Although many caspase substrates have been identified, for most substrates the physiologic caspase(s) required for cleavage is unknown. The Bcl-2 protein, which inhibits apoptosis, is cleaved at Asp-34 by caspases during apoptosis and by recombinant caspase-3 in vitro. In the present study, we show that endogenous caspase-3 is a physiologic caspase for Bcl-2. Apoptotic extracts from 293 cells cleave Bcl-2 but not Bax, even though Bax is cleaved to an 18-kDa fragment in SK-NSH cells treated with ionizing radiation. In contrast to Bcl-2, cleavage of Bax was only partially blocked by caspase inhibitors. Inhibitor profiles indicate that Bax may be cleaved by more than one type of noncaspase protease. Immunodepletion of caspase-3 from 293 extracts abolished cleavage of Bcl-2 and caspase-7, whereas immunodepletion of caspase-7 had no effect on Bcl-2 cleavage. Furthermore, MCF-7 cells, which lack caspase-3 expression, do not cleave Bcl-2 following staurosporine-induced cell death. However, transient transfection of caspase-3 into MCF-7 cells restores Bcl-2 cleavage after staurosporine treatment. These results demonstrate that in these models of apoptosis, specific cleavage of Bcl-2 requires activation of caspase-3. When the pro-apoptotic caspase cleavage fragment of Bcl-2 is transfected into baby hamster kidney cells, it localizes to mitochondria and causes the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Therefore, caspase-3-dependent cleavage of Bcl-2 appears to promote further caspase activation as part of a positive feedback loop for executing the cell.

Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are activated during programmed cell death (reviewed in Ref. 1Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). These proteases are synthesized as proenzymes, which are proteolytically cleaved into active heterodimers. Caspases can be grouped according to their substrate specificities, which are largely determined by the amino acids preceding the cleavage site aspartic acid residue (2Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of one group of caspases that includes caspases-6, -8 (MACH/FLICE), and -9 is V/LEXD, a site similar to that found in caspase proenzymes (2Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Therefore, these caspases may function as initiators of a proteolytic cascade by activating pro-caspases to amplify a death signal (2Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

During Fas (CD95/Apo-1)-induced apoptosis, pro-caspase-8 is recruited to the Fas receptor, where caspase-8 becomes activated (3Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar). Once activated, caspase-8 cleaves and activates downstream caspases as well as the pro-death protein Bid (5Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 6Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar). The Bid cleavage fragment is targeted to mitochondria, where it promotes release of cytochrome c. In HeLa cell extracts, cytochromec and Apaf-1 can activate pro-caspase-9 (Mch6/ICE-LAP-6), which subsequently activates caspase-3 (8Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 489-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of a second group, consisting of caspases-2, 3, and 7 is DEXD, a cleavage site similar to that found in many target proteins that are cleaved during apoptosis, suggesting that these caspases function during the effector phase of cell death (2Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

However, the caspase cascade is not yet well defined, and some caspases may serve both upstream and downstream functions. For example, caspase-2 has some characteristics of an upstream caspase (10Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), whereas caspase-6 is presumably acting as a downstream caspase when it cleaves lamin (11Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Mice that lack caspase-3 have diminished cell death of the developing brain (12Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 13Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufmann S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Remarkably, cells from mice deficient in caspase-3 show stimulus-specific defects in apoptosis that include delayed kinetics, incomplete chromatin condensation, and the absence of DNA fragmentation (13Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufmann S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Similarly, MCF-7 cells that do not express caspase-3 also do not undergo DNA fragmentation during cell death (14Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). The absence of DNA fragmentation in cells lacking caspase-3 may be because of the failure to cleave the endonuclease inhibitor, ICAD/DFF45 (15Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 16Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Cleavage of ICAD releases the nuclease CAD, which enters the nucleus to produce DNA fragmentation (16Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, 17Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). A number of other proteins have been identified as caspase substrates. Some of these regulate homeostatic functions like DNA repair (for example PARP 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; DEVD-CHO, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-aspartinal; YVAD-CHO, N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-aspartinal; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; BHK, baby hamster kidney; Z-VAD-fmk, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; DEVD-CHO, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-aspartinal; YVAD-CHO, N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-aspartinal; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; BHK, baby hamster kidney; Z-VAD-fmk, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone) and the cell cycle (such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21) (18Zhivotovsky B. Burgess D.H. Vanags D.M. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Caspase cleavage inactivates these proteins and may prevent homeostatic mechanisms from impeding apoptosis. Cleavage of substrates such as PAK2 and gelsolin creates active proteolytic products, which appear to mediate some of the morphological changes of apoptosis (20Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar,21Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K.T. Mcgarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Other caspase substrates such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Akt/protein kinase B normally function to prevent apoptosis, and cleavage of these proteins appears to inactivate their survival function (22Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 23Grandgirard D. Studer E. Monney L. Belser T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In addition the cleavage fragments of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are potently pro-apoptotic (22Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 24Clem R.J. Cheng E.H.-Y. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G.

Cell death induced by fragments of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL is blocked by caspase inhibitors, indicating a potential positive feedback loop that ensures the death of the cell. The lack of protease inhibitors that distinguish between individual caspases has made it difficult to identify the physiologic caspase(s) required to cleave specific substrates inside cells. To examine the caspase(s) required to cleave Bcl-2, we utilized apoptotic extracts from 293 cells that were depleted of specific caspases by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, MCF-7 cells that lack caspase-3 were used to test whether caspase-3 is required for Bcl-2 cleavage in cells during staurosporine-induced cell death. Finally, the pro-death Bcl-2 cleavage product was shown to localize to mitochondria and cause release of cytochrome c, suggesting that Bcl-2 cleavage promotes caspase activation and cell death via a mitochondrial pathway. Construction of pSG5 (Stratagene) expression plasmids for Bcl-2, D34A mutant Bcl-2, ΔN34 Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, P35, and Bcl-xL has been described previously (22Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J.

The pBactM11Z caspase-1 expression plasmid was a gift from J. Yuan (26Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). ABglII fragment containing Bcl-2 or ΔN34Bcl-2 was inserted into a modified pSG5 vector (HYC 66) containing the HA epitope (27Cheng E.H.-Y. Nicholas J. Bellows D.S. Hayward G.S. Guo H.-G. Reitz M.S. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) or a Flag epitope (28Lim D.-S. Kirsch D.G. Canman C.E. Ahn J.-H. Ziv Y. Newman L.S.

[35S]Met-labeled proteins were produced with the TNT T7-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. 3 μl of 35S-labeled lysate was incubated with 10 μl of 293 apoptotic extract, prepared as described previously (29Fearnhead H.O. McCurrach M.E. O'Neill J. Zhang K. Lowe S.W. Lazebnik Y.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and 1 mm ATP at 37 °C overnight. Extracts were immunodepleted with monoclonal antibodies for caspase-3 (4-1-18) or caspase-7 (5-1-18). Control immunodepletions were performed with monoclonal antibodies to either caspase-3 (3-1-11) or caspase-7 (7-1-11) that react in immunoblot analysis but fail to immunoprecipitate. Reactions were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.45 mm nitrocellulose, and autoradiographed. The human neuroblastoma cell line SK-NSH (30Goldman S.C. Chen C.Y. Lansing T.J. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1381-1385PubMed Google Scholar), the human leukemia cell line HL-60, and the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were each cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (with glutamine) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamine containing 10% fetal bovine serum. MCF-7 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of the indicated plasmid in 14 μl of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were harvested 33 h post-transfection. Cell death was induced in SK-NSH cells with 4 gray ionizing radiation (1 gray = 100 rads) from a 137Cs source with or without a 1-h pretreatment with protease inhibitors (DEVD-CHO, YVAD-CHO, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, aprotinin, or leupeptin obtained from Sigma). Cell death was induced in HL-60 cells and MCF-7 cells by treatment with 2 μmstaurosporine (Alexis) for 14 h. Floating and attached cells were harvested and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer as described previously (31Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and wet-electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose, and equivalent loading was confirmed by Fast Green (Sigma) staining as described previously (31Kastan M.B.

Proteins were detected with antibodies to Bcl-2 (sc-509; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caspase-3 (65906E; Pharmingen and 3-1-11), caspase-7 (5-1-18 and 7-1-11), Bax (13666E; Pharmingen), PARP (C-2–10; Calbiochem), Porin/VDAC (529534; Calbiochem), and cytochromec (65981A; Pharmingen) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) and autoradiography with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2–3 × 104 BHK cells were seeded on a slide and transiently transfected with 1 μg of the indicated plasmid DNA with 8 μl of LipofectAMINE. At the indicated times after transfection, localization studies of HA-Bcl-2, HA-ΔN34 Bcl-2, and Flag-ΔN34 Bcl-2 were performed as described previously (28Lim D.-S. Kirsch D.G. Canman C.E. Ahn J.-H.

To assess cytochrome c localization, immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described by Rosseet al. (32Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted in Ca2+-Tris-buffered saline as follows: anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 1:100; anti-cytochrome c (65971A, Pharmingen) 1:25; anti-Flag (sc-807, Santa Cruise) 1:100; anti-Bax (13666E, Pharmingen) 1:150; and anti-Bcl-xL (65186E, Pharmingen) 1:150. Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Chemicon). Cells were analyzed with a Noran OZ CLSM confocal microscope system with interversion software (Noran Inc, Madison, WI). 7.5 × 105 BHK cells were transiently transfected with 20 μg of the indicated DNA with 80 μl of LipofectAMINE. After 3 h, the cells were placed in fresh medium in the presence or absence of 100 μmz-VAD-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA). 8 h after adding the DNA-liposome complexes, the cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of cold MSHE buffer: 0.21 m mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.75 mmspermidine, with 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm benzamidine-HCl, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin added just before the experiment. Cells were Dounce-homogenized with 25 strokes on ice. Nuclei and unlysed cells were cleared by centrifugation at 500 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant was placed at −80 °C, and the rest of the supernatant was centrifuged at 9500 × g for 9 min at 4 °C to pellet mitochondria. The supernatant containing the cytosol was frozen at −80 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was washed once in MSHE buffer, and intact mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 8500 ×g for 9 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in MSHE buffer and frozen at −80 °C before preparing samples for immunoblot analysis. When35S-labeled, in vitro translated Bcl-2 was incubated with 293 cell extract in the presence of 1 mmATP, cleavage of Bcl-2 occurred (ΔN34 Bcl-2 in Fig.1 a). Specificity of the cleavage reaction was demonstrated by the lack of cleavage of in vitro translated Bax (Fig. 1 a). The Bcl-2 cleavage product comigrated with in vitro translated Bcl-2 lacking amino acids 2–33 (ΔN34 Bcl-2), and Bcl-2 cleavage by the 293 cell extract was inhibited by mutating the cleavage site Asp-34 to Ala (D34A Bcl-2) (Fig. 1 b). Therefore, the 293 extract cleaves Bcl-2 at Asp-34, the same site cleaved in apoptotic cells and by recombinant caspase-3 in vitro (22Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Bcl-2 by the 293 apoptotic extracts was inhibited by the addition of the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO, indicating that Bcl-2 cleavage by the 293 cell extract requires caspases (Fig. 1 c). Thus, in vitro cleavage of Bcl-2 by the 293 apoptotic extract recapitulates the same Bcl-2 cleavage site and protease specificity previously observed in cells undergoing apoptosis (22Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 cleavage site, D31AGD34, corresponds to the substrate specificity of caspases 2, 3, and 7. Because caspases 3 and 7 are activated in the 293 extract (Fig. 2), we focused our biochemical analysis on these caspases. 293 cell extracts were immunodepleted with monoclonal antibodies that immunoprecipitate either caspase-3 or caspase-7 to create 293 extracts that were depleted (Δ) for each caspase. Control extracts (Fig. 2, panels a–c, C) were immunodepleted with monoclonal antibodies that recognize caspase-3 or caspase-7 by immunoblot but fail to immunoprecipitate the respective caspase. Immunodepletion of caspase-3 completely blocked cleavage of Bcl-2 by 293 extracts in vitro (Fig. 2 a). However, immunoprecipitation with control (immunoblotting only) antibodies had no effect on cleavage of Bcl-2 (Fig. 2 a). Therefore, in vitro cleavage of Bcl-2 by 293 extracts requires caspase-3. In contrast, immunodepletion of caspase-7 had no effect on cleavage of Bcl-2 (Fig. 2 a), demonstrating that caspase-7 is dispensable for Bcl-2 cleavage in this model system. Although caspase-7 is neither required for Bcl-2 cleavage nor appears to contribute to Bcl-2 cleavage activity in the 293 extracts, it remains possible that Bcl-2 has some susceptibility to caspase-7 in other contexts. Immunoblot analysis of these cleavage reactions confirmed that caspase-3 was successfully immunodepleted from the extracts (Fig.2 b, lane 2). Similarly, immunoblot analysis of these reactions for caspase-7 showed that caspase-7 was successfully immunodepleted (Fig. 2 c, lane 4). Interestingly, only unprocessed pro-caspase 7 (p35, Fig. 2 c, top arrow) and caspase-7 lacking the short amino-terminal pro-domain (middle arrow) were present in extracts lacking caspase-3 (Fig. 2 c, lane 2). However, fully processed caspase-7 (p19, bottom arrow) was observed in extracts containing caspase-3 (Fig. 2 c, lanes 1 and3). This suggests that caspase-3 is required to fully process and activate caspase-7 in this cell-free model of apoptosis. Thus, caspase-3 may not only cleave substrates during the effector phase of apoptosis, but it may also play a role in the initiation or amplification of a caspase cascade during the initiator phase of apoptosis before the activation of downstream caspases. Indeed, the decreased developmental apoptosis that occurs in brains from mice lacking caspase-3 (12Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 13Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufmann S.A. Senaldi G.

Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the absence of caspase-7 activation after caspase-3 immunodepletion is that another factor required for caspase-7 processing was immunoprecipitated with the caspase-3 antibody. Consistent with this possibility is the observation that in other cell types, caspase-7 has been reported to be proteolytically processed in the presence of a caspase-3 inhibitor (33Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) or in the absence of caspase-3 (13Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufmann S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The absence of Bax cleavage by 293 apoptotic extracts was somewhat surprising given that during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, a smaller protein of approximately 18 kDa is produced, which is detected with an antibody to Bax (36Thomas A. El Rouby S. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Silber R. Potmesil M. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1055-1062PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, an 18-kDa protein, which was reported to be a Bax cleavage product, is produced following Alphavirus-induced apoptosis (23Grandgirard D. Studer E. Monney L. Belser T. Fellay I. Borner C. Michel M.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have observed similar cleavage of endogenous Bax following ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis of SK-NSH neuroblastoma cells, which produces an 18-kDa doublet (Fig.3). It is possible that the protease that cleaves Bax in cells is not present or activated in the 293 extract. Alternatively, in vitro translated Bax may lack specific post-translational modifications that occur in apoptotic cells, rendering Bax a poor cleavage substrate in vitro. Finally, it is possible that one or more of the protease inhibitors used in the preparation of the 293 extracts, including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain inhibits Bax cleavage. To investigate the protease specificity of Bax cleavage during apoptosis, SK-NSH cells were treated with a variety of protease inhibitors before ionizing radiation. Twenty-four h after ionizing radiation, Bax was cleaved into a doublet, which migrated at approximately 18 kDa (Fig. 3). Pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO (Fig. 3, D) diminished Bax cleavage following ionizing radiation, suggesting that Bax cleavage may be downstream of caspase activation (Fig. 3). In contrast, YVAD-CHO (Fig. 3,Y) had no effect. However, when cells were pretreated with leupeptin, an inhibitor of serine and (noncaspase) cysteine proteases, Bax cleavage was abolished (Fig. 3 and Ref. 35Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), whereas PARP cleavage was not affected (data not shown). Furthermore, when cells were preincubated with the serine protease inhibitor, aprotinin, the upper band of the doublet was not detected, whereas preincubation with the (noncaspase) cysteine protease inhibitorN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal prevented the appearance of the bottom half of the doublet (Fig. 3). Thus, the presence of protease inhibitors, such as 2 μg/ml leupeptin present in the 293 extract, may prevent Bax cleavage in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that serine and/or cysteine proteases other than caspases are involved in Bax cleavage. The results described above indicate that caspase-3 is required for cleavage of Bcl-2 in 293 apoptotic extracts. Although the 293 apoptotic extract cleaves Bcl-2 at the same site and with the same protease specificity as observed in intact cells, some cell-free systems do not always mimic all of the apoptotic events in cells (37Maravei D.V.

Therefore, to examine if caspase-3 is also required for Bcl-2 cleavage in intact cells, we used the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, which lacks endogenous caspase-3 (14Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L.

In this study, we show that both splice isoforms of VEGF-B bind specifically to Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a receptor for collapsins/semaphorins and for the VEGF165isoform. The NRP1 binding of VEGF-B could be competed by an excess of VEGF165.

Five different VEGF transcripts encoding polypeptides of 121, 145, 165, 189, and 206 amino acid residues are generated by alternative splicing from a single human VEGF gene (3Houck K.A. Ferrara N.

VEGF121 is secreted as a soluble protein, whereas VEGF165 has affinity for heparan sulfates and is partially sequestered into the pericellular matrix. Recently, a third receptor for the VEGF165 isoform was identified from nonendothelial tumor cells, which bound a sequence encoded by exon 7 of the VEGF gene (6Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). This receptor was identical to Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a type I transmembrane receptor for semaphorins/collapsins (7He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Coexpression of NRP1 with VEGFR-2 in transfected cells resulted in increased VEGF165 binding and enhanced chemotaxis and mitogenicity in response to VEGF165 (6Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). The NRP1 binding may explain why VEGF165 is more potent than VEGF121 as a mitogen for endothelial cells (9Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar).NRP1 is expressed in the tips of actively growing axons of particular classes of neurons, and studies of it have concentrated on its important role in axon growth and guidance in the developing embryo (10Takagi S.

Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NRP1 is, however, expressed in the developing embryo ubiquitously in endothelial cells of capillaries and blood vessels and in mesenchymal cells surrounding the blood vessels as well as in certain other nonneuronal tissues including the endocardial cells of the embryonic heart (6Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 13Kitsukawa T. Shimono A. Kawakami A. Kondoh H. Fujisawa H. Development. 1995; 121: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, homozygous NRP1 knock-out embryos die of cardiovascular failure at embryonic day 10.5–12.5, and overexpression of NRP1 under the β-actin promoter is lethal because of severe anomalies of the nervous and cardiovascular systems (13Kitsukawa T. Shimono A. Kawakami A. Kondoh H. Fujisawa H. Development. 1995; 121: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cardiovascular defects may result from modulation of VEGF bioactivity and VEGF-induced angiogenesis by abnormal NRP1 levels.At present, the VEGF-family of growth factors contains four other known members, namely placenta growth factor (PlGF), VEGF-B/VRF, VEGF-C/VRP, and VEGF-D/FIGF (14Korpelainen E.I. Alitalo K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PlGF and VEGF-B bind selectively to VEGFR-1 and resemble most closely VEGF in sequence and in genomic structure (15Persico M.G. Vincenti V. DiPalma T. Claesson-Welsh L. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. 237. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1999: 31-40Google Scholar,16Olofsson B. Pajusola K. von Euler G. Chilov D. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19310-19317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced PlGF and VEGF-B mRNAs each give rise to two protein isoforms, PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 and VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186, respectively (16Olofsson B. Pajusola K. von Euler G. Chilov D. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19310-19317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Hauser S. Weich H.A.

Persico M.G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). The PlGF-2 and VEGF-B167 isoforms have basic COOH-terminal domains responsible for binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans and a sequence homologous to the NRP1 binding exon 7-encoded peptide of VEGF.PlGF-2 was recently shown to bind NRP1 (19Migdal M. Huppertz B. Tessler S. Comforti A. Shibuya M. Reich R. Baumann H. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22272-22278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether NRP1 also binds other angiogenic growth factors of the VEGF family and whether it thus might have a more general role in the regulation of angiogenesis. The sequence homology between the COOH-terminal parts of VEGF165 and VEGF-B167and the observation that VEGF-B167 is sequestered into the pericellular matrix upon its secretion from cells suggested that, like VEGF165 and PlGF-2, also VEGF-B might interact with NRP1. In this study we have carried out binding experiments using both soluble extracellular and transmembrane NRP1 proteins and show that NRP1 provides a receptor for VEGF167 and for the proteolytically processed, but not for the full-length, form of VEGF186.DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrate that VEGF-B binds to NRP1, a receptor for collapsins/semaphorins, which has been shown to function in guiding neuronal growth cones and as an isoform-specific receptor for two angiogenic factors of the VEGF-family, VEGF165 and PlGF-2. Both VEGF-B splice variants, the heparin-binding VEGF-B167and soluble VEGF-B186 forms, were able to bind to NRP1, but the binding of VEGF-B186 was regulated by proteolytic processing. Only the processed form lacking theO-glycosylated COOH terminus was able to bind NRP1, whereas in VEGF-B167 the heparin binding domain encoded by exon 6B was responsible for binding. The exon 6B-encoded domain of VEGF-B167 is highly homologous to the NRP1 binding epitopes of the VEGF165 and PlGF-2 isoforms, which also bind heparin. In contrast, in VEGF-B186 an alternative splice acceptor site in exon 6 generates an insertion and a frameshift in the coding sequence; therefore the COOH terminus of VEGF-B186differs from the heparin binding domain of VEGF-B167 (16Olofsson B. Pajusola K. von Euler G. Chilov D. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19310-19317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the processed form of VEGF-B186, the peptide encoded by the NH2 terminus of exon 6A thus constitutes a novel NRP1 binding epitope. VEGF-B186 does not seem to have affinity for heparin and the binding to NRP1 was not heparin-dependent, yet in the presence of heparin the binding appeared stronger. 2T. Makinen, B. Olofsson, U. Eriksson, and K. Alitalo, unpublished data. Because the processing site was mapped to Arg-127, the specific NRP1 binding epitope constitutes minimally only 12 amino acid residues, with the COOH-terminal Arg residue probably being important for efficient binding.Proteolytic processing is commonly used to regulate the bioavailability and activity of members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/VEGF family. Both PDGF isoforms, PDGF-A and -B, are proteolytically processed after biosynthesis (24Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Westermark B. Growth Factors. 1995; 8: 245-252Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also VEGF-C and VEGF-D are sequentially processed at sites flanking the cystine knot growth factor domain. Furthermore, proteolytic processing of VEGF-C regulates its affinity to the VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 receptors (25Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jetsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Also, proteolytic cleavage of VEGF-B186 appeared to result in an increased VEGFR-1 affinity (20Olofsson B. Korpelainen E. Pepper M. Mandriota S. Aase K. Kumar V. Gunji Y. Jeltsch M.M. Shibuya M. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11709-11714Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Activation of NRP1 binding by proteolytic cleavage could further increase the VEGFR-1 binding affinity and thus modulate VEGF-B186-induced biological effects, including regulation of protease activities in endothelial cells (20Olofsson B. Korpelainen E. Pepper M. Mandriota S. Aase K. Kumar V. Gunji Y. Jeltsch M.M. Shibuya M. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11709-11714Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The glycans of the COOH terminus were not responsible for the masking of the NRP1 binding epitopes in the full-length VEGF-B186, as deglycosylation of the COOH terminus did not lead to acquisition of NRP1 binding ability. It should be noted that the NRP1 binding domains of VEGF165, PlGF-2, and Sema III are highly basic (7He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The exposure of a basic peptide sequence (RVAIPHHRPQPR) in VEGF-B186 upon proteolytic cleavage might be enough to give the protein an ability to bind NRP1. The binding of the processed form of VEGF-B186 by NRP1 was, however, weaker than that of VEGF-B167 or VEGF165. Approximately 20% of the immunoprecipitated proteolytically processed VEGF-B186 protein was precipitated with NRP1 in the absence of heparin. In contrast, both specific antibodies and soluble NRP1-Ig fusion protein precipitated approximately equal amounts of VEGF-B167 or VEGF165.NRP1 and VEGF-B were prominently co-expressed for instance in the myocardial cells of the developing heart and in the smooth muscle cell layers surrounding larger blood vessels (13, 23, and the this paper). In addition, NRP1 detected in endothelial cells of large vessels is located in juxtacrine relationship with the smooth muscle cell layer producing VEGF-B (23Aase K. Lymboussaki A. Kaipainen A. Olofsson B. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Dev. Dynamics. 1999; 215: 12-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been reported that NRP1 and the related NP-2 can form homo- and hetero-oligomers through the interaction between MAM domains, they bind different but overlapping subset of semaphorins, and they mediate chemorepulsion of axons of different classes of neurons (26Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 27Chen H. He Z. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, although NP-2 also binds VEGF165, the expression pattern of NP-2 is different from that of NRP1 or VEGFR-1, e.g. being absent from endothelial cells of capillaries (26Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 28Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R. Gillespie S.K.H. Levengood D.V. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).The exact role of NRP1 binding in the biology of VEGFs is unknown, but NRP1 has been reported to enhance the mitogenic effects of VEGFR-2 upon VEGF165 stimulation when the two receptors are coexpressed in transfected endothelial cells (6Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). In addition to VEGFR-2, NRP1 has been suggested to function as a ligand binding subunit of a transmembrane receptor(s) that mediate specific signals for different semaphorins (29Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 30Feiner L. Koppel A.M. Kobayashi H. Raper J.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, NRP1 appears to regulate other signal-transducing receptors, and no intrinsic signaling may occur via NRP1 itself. Although the high conservation of the short cytoplasmic domain of NRP1 suggests importance of this part to NRP1 function, no binding partners or obvious protein homology domains have been reported within this portion. In fact, the cytoplasmic tail was shown to be unnecessary for the Sema III-induced biological responses via NRP1. The presence of Sema III binding a1/a2 (CUB) domain and the MAM domain responsible for NRP1 oligomerization and possible interaction with other transmembrane signal-transducing proteins were sufficient for Sema III-induced growth cone collapse (27Chen H. He Z. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1283-1290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 29Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It is not known whether VEGF binding is sufficient for signal transduction via a NRP1-associated hypothetical signal-transducing polypeptide chain although the enhanced mitogenic signaling of VEGFR-2 in NRP1-overexpressing cells suggests such a possibility.According to the present results, VEGF-B, in analogy to the Sema III, could therefore induce biological responses in cells which express NRP1, but no VEGFRs. In addition, NRP1 might potentiate the effects of VEGF-B in cells where VEGFR-1 is expressed. Furthermore, as VEGF and Sema III have been shown to compete for NRP1 binding (28Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and as we here show competition between VEGF and VEGF-B, there could be a more extensive cross-regulation of cellular signals between the two families of growth factors.

VEGF121 is secreted as a soluble protein, whereas VEGF165 has affinity for heparan sulfates and is partially sequestered into the pericellular matrix. Recently, a third receptor for the VEGF165 isoform was identified from nonendothelial tumor cells, which bound a sequence encoded by exon 7 of the VEGF gene (6Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). This receptor was identical to Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a type I transmembrane receptor for semaphorins/collapsins (7He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Coexpression of NRP1 with VEGFR-2 in transfected cells resulted in increased VEGF165 binding and enhanced chemotaxis and mitogenicity in response to VEGF165 (6Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). The NRP1 binding may explain why VEGF165 is more potent than VEGF121 as a mitogen for endothelial cells (9Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). NRP1 is expressed in the tips of actively growing axons of particular classes of neurons, and studies of it have concentrated on its important role in axon growth and guidance in the developing embryo (10Takagi S.

Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NRP1 is, however, expressed in the developing embryo ubiquitously in endothelial cells of capillaries and blood vessels and in mesenchymal cells surrounding the blood vessels as well as in certain other nonneuronal tissues including the endocardial cells of the embryonic heart (6Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 13Kitsukawa T. Shimono A. Kawakami A. Kondoh H. Fujisawa H. Development. 1995; 121: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, homozygous NRP1 knock-out embryos die of cardiovascular failure at embryonic day 10.5–12.5, and overexpression of NRP1 under the β-actin promoter is lethal because of severe anomalies of the nervous and cardiovascular systems (13Kitsukawa T. Shimono A. Kawakami A. Kondoh H. Fujisawa H. Development. 1995; 121: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cardiovascular defects may result from modulation of VEGF bioactivity and VEGF-induced angiogenesis by abnormal NRP1 levels. At present, the VEGF-family of growth factors contains four other known members, namely placenta growth factor (PlGF), VEGF-B/VRF, VEGF-C/VRP, and VEGF-D/FIGF (14Korpelainen E.I. Alitalo K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PlGF and VEGF-B bind selectively to VEGFR-1 and resemble most closely VEGF in sequence and in genomic structure (15Persico M.G. Vincenti V. DiPalma T. Claesson-Welsh L. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. 237. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1999: 31-40Google Scholar,16Olofsson B. Pajusola K. von Euler G. Chilov D. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19310-19317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced PlGF and VEGF-B mRNAs each give rise to two protein isoforms, PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 and VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186, respectively (16Olofsson B. Pajusola K. von Euler G. Chilov D. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19310-19317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Hauser S. Weich H.A. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Ferraro M.G. Aprelikova O. Alitalo K. Del Vecchio S. Lei K.-J. Chou J.Y. Persico M.G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). The PlGF-2 and VEGF-B167 isoforms have basic COOH-terminal domains responsible for binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans and a sequence homologous to the NRP1 binding exon 7-encoded peptide of VEGF. PlGF-2 was recently shown to bind NRP1 (19Migdal M. Huppertz B. Tessler S. Comforti A. Shibuya M. Reich R. Baumann H. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22272-22278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether NRP1 also binds other angiogenic growth factors of the VEGF family and whether it thus might have a more general role in the regulation of angiogenesis. The sequence homology between the COOH-terminal parts of VEGF165 and VEGF-B167and the observation that VEGF-B167 is sequestered into the pericellular matrix upon its secretion from cells suggested that, like VEGF165 and PlGF-2, also VEGF-B might interact with NRP1. In this study we have carried out binding experiments using both soluble extracellular and transmembrane NRP1 proteins and show that NRP1 provides a receptor for VEGF167 and for the proteolytically processed, but not for the full-length, form of VEGF186. DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrate that VEGF-B binds to NRP1, a receptor for collapsins/semaphorins, which has been shown to function in guiding neuronal growth cones and as an isoform-specific receptor for two angiogenic factors of the VEGF-family, VEGF165 and PlGF-2. Both VEGF-B splice variants, the heparin-binding VEGF-B167and soluble VEGF-B186 forms, were able to bind to NRP1, but the binding of VEGF-B186 was regulated by proteolytic processing. Only the processed form lacking theO-glycosylated COOH terminus was able to bind NRP1, whereas in VEGF-B167 the heparin binding domain encoded by exon 6B was responsible for binding. The exon 6B-encoded domain of VEGF-B167 is highly homologous to the NRP1 binding epitopes of the VEGF165 and PlGF-2 isoforms, which also bind heparin. In contrast, in VEGF-B186 an alternative splice acceptor site in exon 6 generates an insertion and a frameshift in the coding sequence; therefore the COOH terminus of VEGF-B186differs from the heparin binding domain of VEGF-B167 (16Olofsson B. Pajusola K. von Euler G. Chilov D. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19310-19317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the processed form of VEGF-B186, the peptide encoded by the NH2 terminus of exon 6A thus constitutes a novel NRP1 binding epitope. VEGF-B186 does not seem to have affinity for heparin and the binding to NRP1 was not heparin-dependent, yet in the presence of heparin the binding appeared stronger. 2T. Makinen, B. Olofsson, U. Eriksson, and K. Alitalo, unpublished data. Because the processing site was mapped to Arg-127, the specific NRP1 binding epitope constitutes minimally only 12 amino acid residues, with the COOH-terminal Arg residue probably being important for efficient binding.Proteolytic processing is commonly used to regulate the bioavailability and activity of members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/VEGF family. Both PDGF isoforms, PDGF-A and -B, are proteolytically processed after biosynthesis (24Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Westermark B. Growth Factors. 1995; 8: 245-252Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also VEGF-C and VEGF-D are sequentially processed at sites flanking the cystine knot growth factor domain. Furthermore, proteolytic processing of VEGF-C regulates its affinity to the VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 receptors (25Joukov V. Sorsa T. Kumar V. Jetsch M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao Y. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Also, proteolytic cleavage of VEGF-B186 appeared to result in an increased VEGFR-1 affinity (20Olofsson B. Korpelainen E. Pepper M. Mandriota S. Aase K. Kumar V. Gunji Y. Jeltsch M.M. Shibuya M. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11709-11714Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Activation of NRP1 binding by proteolytic cleavage could further increase the VEGFR-1 binding affinity and thus modulate VEGF-B186-induced biological effects, including regulation of protease activities in endothelial cells (20Olofsson B. Korpelainen E. Pepper M. Mandriota S. Aase K. Kumar V. Gunji Y. Jeltsch M.M. Shibuya M. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11709-11714Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The glycans of the COOH terminus were not responsible for the masking of the NRP1 binding epitopes in the full-length VEGF-B186, as deglycosylation of the COOH terminus did not lead to acquisition of NRP1 binding ability. It should be noted that the NRP1 binding domains of VEGF165, PlGF-2, and Sema III are highly basic (7He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The exposure of a basic peptide sequence (RVAIPHHRPQPR) in VEGF-B186 upon proteolytic cleavage might be enough to give the protein an ability to bind NRP1. The binding of the processed form of VEGF-B186 by NRP1 was, however, weaker than that of VEGF-B167 or VEGF165. Approximately 20% of the immunoprecipitated proteolytically processed VEGF-B186 protein was precipitated with NRP1 in the absence of heparin. In contrast, both specific antibodies and soluble NRP1-Ig fusion protein precipitated approximately equal amounts of VEGF-B167 or VEGF165.NRP1 and VEGF-B were prominently co-expressed for instance in the myocardial cells of the developing heart and in the smooth muscle cell layers surrounding larger blood vessels (13, 23, and the this paper). In addition, NRP1 detected in endothelial cells of large vessels is located in juxtacrine relationship with the smooth muscle cell layer producing VEGF-B (23Aase K. Lymboussaki A. Kaipainen A. Olofsson B. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Dev. Dynamics. 1999; 215: 12-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been reported that NRP1 and the related NP-2 can form homo- and hetero-oligomers through the interaction between MAM domains, they bind different but overlapping subset of semaphorins, and they mediate chemorepulsion of axons of different classes of neurons (26Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 27Chen H. He Z. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, although NP-2 also binds VEGF165, the expression pattern of NP-2 is different from that of NRP1 or VEGFR-1, e.g. being absent from endothelial cells of capillaries (26Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 28Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R. Gillespie S.K.H. Levengood D.V. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).The exact role of NRP1 binding in the biology of VEGFs is unknown, but NRP1 has been reported to enhance the mitogenic effects of VEGFR-2 upon VEGF165 stimulation when the two receptors are coexpressed in transfected endothelial cells (6Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). In addition to VEGFR-2, NRP1 has been suggested to function as a ligand binding subunit of a transmembrane receptor(s) that mediate specific signals for different semaphorins (29Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 30Feiner L. Koppel A.M. Kobayashi H. Raper J.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, NRP1 appears to regulate other signal-transducing receptors, and no intrinsic signaling may occur via NRP1 itself. Although the high conservation of the short cytoplasmic domain of NRP1 suggests importance of this part to NRP1 function, no binding partners or obvious protein homology domains have been reported within this portion. In fact, the cytoplasmic tail was shown to be unnecessary for the Sema III-induced biological responses via NRP1. The presence of Sema III binding a1/a2 (CUB) domain and the MAM domain responsible for NRP1 oligomerization and possible interaction with other transmembrane signal-transducing proteins were sufficient for Sema III-induced growth cone collapse (27Chen H. He Z. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1283-1290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 29Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It is not known whether VEGF binding is sufficient for signal transduction via a NRP1-associated hypothetical signal-transducing polypeptide chain although the enhanced mitogenic signaling of VEGFR-2 in NRP1-overexpressing cells suggests such a possibility.According to the present results, VEGF-B, in analogy to the Sema III, could therefore induce biological responses in cells which express NRP1, but no VEGFRs. In addition, NRP1 might potentiate the effects of VEGF-B in cells where VEGFR-1 is expressed. Furthermore, as VEGF and Sema III have been shown to compete for NRP1 binding (28Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and as we here show competition between VEGF and VEGF-B, there could be a more extensive cross-regulation of cellular signals between the two families of growth factors. In this study we demonstrate that VEGF-B binds to NRP1, a receptor for collapsins/semaphorins, which has been shown to function in guiding neuronal growth cones and as an isoform-specific receptor for two angiogenic factors of the VEGF-family, VEGF165 and PlGF-2.

https://openalex.org/W2016241657,"This study investigated phospholipid hydroperoxides as substrates for non-selenium GSH peroxidase (NSGPx), an enzyme also called 1-Cys peroxiredoxin. Recombinant human NSGPx expressed in Escherichia coli from a human cDNA clone (HA0683) showed GSH peroxidase activity withsn-2-linolenoyl- orsn-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides as substrate; NADPH or thioredoxin could not substitute for GSH. Activity did not saturate with GSH, and kinetics were compatible with a ping-pong mechanism; kinetic constants (mM−1min−1) were k 1 = 1–3 × 105 and k 2 = 4–11 × 104. In the presence of 0.36 mm GSH, apparentK m was 120–130 μm and apparentV max was 1.5–1.6 μmol/min/mg of protein. Assays with H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides as substrate indicated activity similar to that with phospholipid hydroperoxides. Maximal enzymatic activity was at pH 7–8. Activity with phospholipid hydroperoxide substrate was inhibited noncompetitively by mercaptosuccinate with K i 4 μm. The enzyme had no GSH S-transferase activity. Bovine cDNA encoding NSGPx, isolated from a lung expression library using a polymerase chain reaction probe, showed >95% similarity to previously published human, rat, and mouse sequences and does not contain the TGA stop codon, which is translated as selenocysteine in selenium-containing peroxidases. The molecular mass of bovine NSGPx deduced from the cDNA is 25,047 Da. These results identify a new GSH peroxidase that is not a selenoenzyme and can reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides. Thus, this enzyme may be an important component of cellular antioxidant defense systems. This study investigated phospholipid hydroperoxides as substrates for non-selenium GSH peroxidase (NSGPx), an enzyme also called 1-Cys peroxiredoxin. Recombinant human NSGPx expressed in Escherichia coli from a human cDNA clone (HA0683) showed GSH peroxidase activity withsn-2-linolenoyl- orsn-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides as substrate; NADPH or thioredoxin could not substitute for GSH. Activity did not saturate with GSH, and kinetics were compatible with a ping-pong mechanism; kinetic constants (mM−1min−1) were k 1 = 1–3 × 105 and k 2 = 4–11 × 104. In the presence of 0.36 mm GSH, apparentK m was 120–130 μm and apparentV max was 1.5–1.6 μmol/min/mg of protein. Assays with H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides as substrate indicated activity similar to that with phospholipid hydroperoxides. Maximal enzymatic activity was at pH 7–8. Activity with phospholipid hydroperoxide substrate was inhibited noncompetitively by mercaptosuccinate with K i 4 μm. The enzyme had no GSH S-transferase activity. Bovine cDNA encoding NSGPx, isolated from a lung expression library using a polymerase chain reaction probe, showed >95% similarity to previously published human, rat, and mouse sequences and does not contain the TGA stop codon, which is translated as selenocysteine in selenium-containing peroxidases. The molecular mass of bovine NSGPx deduced from the cDNA is 25,047 Da. These results identify a new GSH peroxidase that is not a selenoenzyme and can reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides. Thus, this enzyme may be an important component of cellular antioxidant defense systems. The integrity of biomembranes and other phospholipid-enriched cellular components requires a mechanism to repair oxidized phospholipids generated by spontaneous or pathologic oxidation. Intracellular glutathione peroxidase (GSH Px) 1The abbreviations used are: GSH Px, glutathione peroxidase; NSGPx, non-selenium glutathione peroxidase; hNSGPx, human NSGPx; PHGPx, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; PLA2, phospholipase A2; DTT, dithiothreitol; PLPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-linolenoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine; PAPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-snglycerol-3-phosphocholine; DENP, diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate; MJ33, 1-hexadecyl-3-trifluoroethylglycero-sn-2-phosphomethanol; pBPB, p-bromophenacyl bromide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid plays an important role in reducing fatty acid hydroperoxides and H2O2, although this enzyme has no activity toward phospholipid hydroperoxides (1Michiels C. Raes M. Toussaint O. Remacle J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Detoxification of phospholipid hydroperoxides can be accomplished through the combined enzymatic activity of phospholipase A2(PLA2) and reduction of the resultant fatty acid hydroperoxides with GSH Px (2van Kuijk F.J.G.M. Sevanian A. Handelman G.J. Dratz E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Recently, a phospholipid hydroperoxide GSH Px (PHGPx) has been described as a 19-kDa selenoenzyme that uses GSH to reduce peroxidized phospholipids to the nontoxic hydroxy derivative (3Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 4Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F.

Ursini F. Wingender E. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7342-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of phospholipid hydroperoxides also has been described as a minor activity for the selenoenzyme plasma GSH Px and for some GSH S-transferase enzymes (6Yamamoto Y. Takahashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Hurst R. Bao Y. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated phospholipid hydroperoxides as substrates for a novel 25-kDa GSH Px. The protein was first isolated from the bovine ciliary body and was shown to catalyze the reduction of H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides using GSH as electron donor (8Shichi H. Demar J.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Activity toward phospholipid hydroperoxides was not tested. The absence of selenium in the protein was demonstrated by assay with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (8Shichi H. Demar J.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The enzyme, which was called a non-selenium GSH Px (NSGPx), had no GSH S-transferase activity when assayed with a spectrum of potential SH acceptors (8Shichi H. Demar J.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA sequence (HA0683) 2GenBankTM accession numberD14662. ultimately shown to encode NSGPx was first isolated from a human myeloblast cell line (KG-1) (9Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and described as a Ca2+-independent PLA2 (12Kim T-S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2542-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an identical cDNA from a human lymphoma cell line (U937) was described; protein encoded by this cDNA was expressed in E. coli and NIH 3T3 cells and shown to be a peroxidase with minimal PLA2 activity (13Kang S-W. Baines I.C. Rhee S-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In contrast to the prior publication using the native protein (8Shichi H. Demar J.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), anin vitro assay with the protein product of this clone indicated that GSH was not an effective reductant, and the report concluded that the physiologic reductant for the peroxidase was unknown (13Kang S-W. Baines I.C. Rhee S-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Based on homology to the peroxiredoxin family, the enzyme was called 1-Cys peroxiredoxin, since only one Cys residue was conserved (13Kang S-W. Baines I.C. Rhee S-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). More recently, protein expressed in vitro with a bovine cDNA clone was found to utilize GSH as a reductant for peroxidase activity, although the discrepancy with the previous study was not explained (14Singh A.K. Shichi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One possibility, although unlikely, is that the human and bovine enzymes have different cofactor requirements. The present study investigated substrate utilization of recombinant NSGPx using the human clone (HA0683) that has been previously described (12Kim T-S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2542-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) as well as a newly isolated cDNA clone from a bovine lung cDNA library. Our results with both human and bovine NSGPx show that GSH is effective for reduction of H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides including phospholipid hydroperoxides. GSH, glutathione reductase, β-NADPH, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, diethylp-nitrophenyl phosphate (DENP), p-bromophenacyl bromide (pBPB), dithiothreitol (DTT), H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, GSH peroxidase (from bovine erythrocytes), GSH S-transferase (from rat liver), and soybean lipoxidase (EC 1.1311.12 type V) were purchased from Sigma. Phospholipids, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl PC (PAPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-linolenoyl PC (PLPC), were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 13-Hydroperoxyoctadecanoic acid and 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetranoic acid were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). The C18 Sep-Pack was from Millipore Corp. (Milford, MA). Radiochemicals were purchased from DuPont NEN. Molecular mass standards for SDS-PAGE, transblot membrane, protein dye-binding assay kit, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Triton X-100 (electrophoretically purified) were purchased from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence kit and x-ray film were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. pET28C vector and the His bind kit containing imidazole buffer were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). A bovine lung cDNA library was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Lennox LB broth was obtained from Fisher. 1-Hexadacyl-3-trifluoroethylglycero-sn-2-phosphomethanol (MJ33), a PLA2 inhibitor, was a gift from Dr. Mahendra Jain (University of Delaware). The human cDNA clone (HA0683) (12Kim T-S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2542-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was digested with the restriction enzyme HindIII, and the insert was recloned into theHindIII site of pET28C (Novagen, Madison, WI) in both the forward (sense) and reverse (antisense) directions. The inserted fragment contained about 1040 nucleotide pairs and included the entire coding sequence of the human enzyme along with 43 nucleotides from the 5′-untranslated region and 320 nucleotides from the 3′-untranslated region. Plasmid DNAs were prepared using a QIAGEN column (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA); were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, which produce T7 RNA polymerase and express pET28C inserts efficiently; and were incubated at 37 °C overnight to get colonies. A single colony was inoculated in 50 ml of LB broth containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and incubated with shaking at 37 °C until optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Recombinant protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm final concentration and incubating at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 12.5 ml of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and recentrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl and sonicated three times. For purification, the cell pellet was resuspended and sonicated in 5 mm imidazole buffer. The HA0683 product was expressed as a fusion protein with a series of six histidine residues in pET28C. This “His tag” allowed affinity purification of the fusion protein on a Ni2+ column using the His bind kit under native conditions by following the protocols recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, after allowing the 5 mm imidazole buffer to drain to the top of the column bed (2.5 ml), the column was loaded with the prepared extract in the same buffer. The flow rate was 10 ml/h, the column was washed with 25 ml of 5 mm imidazole buffer and then washed with 15 ml 60 mm imidazole buffer, and the bound protein was eluted with 15 ml of 1 m imidazole buffer. Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the column and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15Kim T-S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar). NSGPx as indicated by Western blot was concentrated in fractions 2–5, which were pooled. Western blot of the purified protein utilized a previously described polyclonal antibody prepared in rabbits to a 15-amino acid synthetic peptide representing a conserved internal sequence of NSGPx or a mouse monoclonal antibody (8H11) raised against the E. coli-expressed HA0683 product (human NSGPx) (15Kim T-S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar). HA0683 also was expressed with a wheat germ expression system in the presence of 0.5 mm [35S]methionine (63 Ci/mmol) as described previously; this procedure generated a single band of 35S-labeled protein by autoradiography of SDS-PAGE gels (12Kim T-S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2542-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Each translation included a negative control in which no RNA was added. An aliquot of the translated proteins was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the radiolabeled protein band was cut from the gel and analyzed by scintillation counting. The amount of radiolabeled NSGPx representing the translated cDNA product was calculated from total incorporated 35S, [35S]methionine specific activity of the starting material, and the fractional methionine content of NSGPx as deduced from the cDNA. After translation, NSGPx represented 0.05% of the total wheat germ extract protein. A similar protocol, but with nonlabeled methionine, was used to express bovine NSGPx using the bovine lung cDNA. The hydroperoxides of linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, PLPC, and PAPC were prepared by treatment of the corresponding fatty acid or phospholipid with soybean 15-lipoxidase according to previously described methods (4Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The reactions were monitored by continuous recording of oxygen consumption using a standard oxygen electrode. The hydroperoxides of linolenic and arachidonic acids, 13-hydroperoxyoctadecanoic acid and 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetranoic acid, respectively, were identified by authentic standards and separated by reverse phase HPLC in a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (60:40:0.1) or methanol/water/acetic acid (85:15:0.1) with UV detection at 235 nm (16Funk C.D. Gunne H. Steiner H. Izumi T. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PLPC and PAPC hydroperoxides were separated by reverse phase HPLC in a mobile phase consisting of 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) and methanol (1:20, v/v) (17Therod P. Couturier M. Demelier T.F. Lemonnier F. Lipids. 1993; 28: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min on a Hewlett-Packard Series 1050 system equipped with a Columbus 5-μm C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Absorbance was measured at 205 nm to detect the phospholipid and at 235 nm to detect conjugated dienes. Peak retention time was 28.6 min for the starting phospholipid, 23.4 min for the hydroxyphospholipid, and 20.9 min for the hydroperoxide, with an additional peak coming earlier (17.3 min) with oxidized PAPC, suggesting the presence of a double hydroperoxidation product. The products were recovered between 20 and 23 min, and the hydroperoxide concentrations were estimated from the integrated peaks based on an extinction coefficient of 2.3 × 104 cm−1m−1 (18Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The HPLC-purified lipid was used as substrate for enzymatic assays. NSGPx activity was assayed by measuring consumption of NADPH in the presence of GSH and GSH reductase. Unless otherwise noted, all assays used the HA0683 product expressed inE. coli and affinity-purified. The standard reaction buffer (3 ml) was 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mmNaN3, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.3 mmNADPH, 0.36 mm GSH, and 0.23 units/ml GSH reductase. To assay PC hydroperoxides, 0.1% Triton X-100 was routinely added, since activity was approximately 40% less in its absence. For the standard assay, the mixture plus enzyme (2 μg of protein/ml) was preincubated for 5 min with continuous stirring. Fluorescence was continuously recorded at 460 nm (340-nm excitation) using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology Instruments, Bricktown, NJ). After a steady base line was achieved, the reaction was started by the addition of substrate generally at 250 μm, and the linear change in fluorescence was recorded for 5–10 min. The change in fluorescence was corrected for the relatively small base-line nonenzymatic oxidation of NADPH and used to calculate enzyme activity based on authentic NADPH standards. Protein was measured with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad protein dye binding kit) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Enzymatic activity was expressed as nmol of NADPH oxidized/min/mg of protein. Data for multiple replications are presented as mean ± S.E. To confirm results with the fluorescence assay, the production of hydroxy-PLPC from PLPC hydroperoxide was determined by HPLC analysis, assuming that the extinction coefficient at 235 nm is the same for both molecular species (18Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In some assays, NSGPx activity was determined by the disappearance of H2O2 by modification of the method of Kanget al. (13Kang S-W. Baines I.C. Rhee S-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The enzyme (6 μg/ml) was incubated for 2 or 10 min in 50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA buffer with 0.2 or 5 mm GSH and 250 μmH2O2. At the end of incubation, 2 mmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 0.25 mm KSCN were added. The absorbance of the red ferrithiocyanate complex formed in the presence of peroxides was measured at 480 nm. This assay was used to test pH dependence; buffers were 50 mm glycine (pH 3), 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4–5), 50 mm MES (pH 6), or 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7–10). This assay also was used to measure peroxidase activity in the presence of 2 mm DTT, substituting for GSH, as described previously (13Kang S-W. Baines I.C. Rhee S-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). GSH S-transferase activity was measured by continuous spectrophotometric assay with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene substrate (8Shichi H. Demar J.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since the initial isolation of this enzyme was from bovine sources (8Shichi H. Demar J.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we isolated a bovine cDNA to complement previous descriptions of human, rat, and mouse clones (12Kim T-S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J. Biol.

Werner S. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The cDNA was isolated and sequenced prior to the recent report of a bovine clone for this enzyme isolated by polymerase chain reaction (14Singh A.K. Shichi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We screened a commercially available bovine lung cDNA library cloned in bacteriophage λ Uni-ZAP XR. Approximately 50,000 plaques were screened using a 589-nucleotide polymerase chain reaction product derived from HA0683 as a probe. Forty positive clones were obtained, representing 0.08% of those screened. Selected positive bovine clones were “zapped” into Bluescript plasmid according to the supplier's instructions and sequenced in cooperation with the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of Pennsylvania. The E. coli expression system using the sense orientation for the human cDNA (HA0683) generated a protein (called hNSGPx) with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa on SDS-PAGE and Western blot probed with the polyclonal NSGPx anti-peptide antibody (Fig. 1). This protein band was not visible when the antisense orientation was used (not shown). A similar result for Western blot was obtained when probed with a monoclonal antibody to the human fusion protein (hNSGPx) (not shown). The larger apparent mass for the fusion protein on PAGE compared with the mass of 25,032 Da deduced from HA0683 (12Kim T-S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2542-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) is due in part to the presence of the “His tag” plus additional amino acids from the vector and from the 5′ normally untranslated region; we estimate the mass of these additional amino acids as 5996 Da. Based on densitometric scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained gels, the expressed hNSGPx protein in the crude cell homogenate was 13% of total protein (not shown), and this increased to 85% after the Ni2+ column (Fig. 1). This figure for purity represents a lower limit, since immunoreactivity at higher molecular mass on the Western blot suggests the presence of dimers or multimeric forms. The expressed hNSGPx demonstrated GSH peroxidase activity as indicated by the linear decrease in NADPH fluorescence following the addition of organic hydroperoxide substrate to the assay buffer (Fig.2). Fig. 2 A showst-butyl hydroperoxide as substrate; H2O2 and hydroperoxides of cumene, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid were equally effective (TableI). There was zero activity (not shown) with the antisense preparation, indicating specificity of the translated gene fragment. Hydroperoxides of phosphatidylcholine likewise were reduced by hNSGPx (Fig. 2 B). PLPC and PAPC hydroperoxides were equally effective substrates (Table I). Enzymatic activity required GSH, which in combination with glutathione reductase resulted in oxidation of NADPH (Fig. 2 C). NADPH itself was not a cofactor for the enzyme, and substitution of thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase for GSH/glutathione reductase also was ineffective (Fig. 2 D). In contrast to hNSGPx, authentic GSH Px (selenoenzyme from erythrocytes) reduced H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of GSH but had no reactivity toward PLPC hydroperoxide (Fig. 3).Table INSGPx activity with various hydroperoxide (HP) substratesSubstrateNSGPx activityV max(app)K m(app)k 1k 2nmol/min/mg proteinnmol/min/mg proteinμmmm−1min−1mm−1 min−1H2O21850 ± 3218101801.8 × 1059.0 × 104Cumene HP1140 ± 3011201201.2 × 1054.0 × 104t-Butyl HP1320 ± 3912701421.6 × 1056.1 × 104Linolenoyl HP1400 ± 2113901411.7 × 1056.8 × 104Arachidonoyl HP1360 ± 3013801351.8 × 1057.2 × 104PLPC HP1470 ± 3715001203.2 × 10511 × 104PAPC HP1670 ± 2916401292.3 × 1057.9 × 104Activity for hNSGPx was measured with the standard assay (see Fig. 2) at 250 μm substrate concentration and 0.36 mmGSH.

Peroxidase activity of the crude cell lysate fromE. coli prior to hNSGPx affinity purification was 61 ± 2 nmol/min/mg of protein (n = 4) for the end point assay, and no activity was seen in the absence of DTT. The corresponding activity in nmol/min/mg of protein with this preparation using 5 mm GSH in place of DTT was 60 ± 1 (n = 4). Activity for affinity-purified hNSGPx assayed with 0.2 mm GSH was 1275 ± 16 nmol/min/mg of protein (n = 4). The effect of pH on the peroxidase reaction was evaluated with affinity-purified hNSGPx by the disappearance of H2O2 using the end point assay with 0.2 mm GSH. The pH optimum was in the range of 7–8; activity was reduced by 65% at pH 6, and virtually no activity was seen at pH 5 and below (Fig. 4). The pH dependence for PLPC hydroperoxide reduction was evaluated at pH 5 and 8 using HPLC to determine formation of the hydroxyphospholipid. HPLC of the purified original substrate showed a phospholipid hydroperoxide peak at 20.9 min but no hydroxyphospholipid peak. After a 1-h incubation of hNSGPx with substrate at pH 8, the peak height of the hydroperoxide signal was significantly decreased, and a hydroxyphospholipid peak appeared at 23.4 min (Fig. 5 C); hNSGPx activity calculated from the integrated hydroxyphospholipid peak was 1400 nmol/min/mg of protein, similar to the value obtained with the fluorescence assay. No hydroxyphospholipid peak was detected at pH 5, indicating the absence of NSGPx activity (Fig. 5 D).Figure 5pH dependence of NSGPx activity with PLPC hydroperoxide substrate analyzed by HPLC. hNSGPx (2 μg/ml) was incubated for 1 h with 250 μm PLPC hydroperoxide and 0.36 mm GSH in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) or 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5) buffer. The reaction was stopped by passage through a C18 Sep-Pack and elution of the final product with methanol. Samples were concentrated 5-fold with a Speed Vac and then analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. The elution time is indicated in minutes. The peak at 20.9 min indicates the PLPC hydroperoxide, while the hydroxyphospholipid peak was at 23.4 min. Absorbance of PLPC hydroperoxide substrate before incubation was measured at 205 nm (A) to demonstrate phospholipid and at 235 nm (B) to show conjugated dienes. C, incubation at pH 8 resulted in a decrease in the PLPC hydroperoxide peak and increase in hydroxy-PLPC peak indicating reduction of the oxidized PLPC substrate. D, with incubation at pH 5, there was no change in the PLPC hydroperoxide and hydroxy-PLPC peaks, indicating no NSGPx activity at this pH.View Large"

Previously, we showed that the conserved membrane-proximal region of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain negatively regulates adhesion activity. In this report, we provide several lines of evidence that p120ctn is involved in this negative regulation. p120ctn binds to the membrane-proximal region of the nonfunctional carboxyl-terminally deleted E-cadherin protein. An additional internal deletion in this region prevented the association with p120ctn and activated the protein, as seen in an aggregation assay. Furthermore, the nonfunctional E-cadherin can be activated through coexpression of p120ctn proteins with amino-terminal deletions, which eliminate several potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites but do not affect the ability to bind to cadherins. Finally, we show that staurosporine, a kinase inhibitor, induces an increased electrophoretic mobility of p120ctn bound to E-cadherin polypeptides, activates the nonfunctional E-cadherin protein, and converts the wild-type E-cadherin and an E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric protein from a cytochalasin D-sensitive to a cytochalasin D-insensitive state. Together, these results indicate that p120ctn is a modulator of E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Cadherins are transmembrane glycoproteins involved in Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion.

Together, these results indicate that p120ctn is a modulator of E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. The cadherins are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that play essential roles in the initiation and stabilization of cell-cell contacts (1Takeichi M.

The extracellular domain of cadherins is responsible for specific homophilic binding (5Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), whereas the carboxyl-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain interacts with intracellular proteins termed catenins (6Ozawa M.

A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Each cadherin molecule can bind to either β-catenin or γ-catenin (plakoglobin), which in turn binds to α-catenin (8Butz S.

Binding of the cadherin-catenin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton has been proposed to be essential for the binding activity. Deletion or truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin results in a loss of function, despite its continued expression on the cell surface (7Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 17Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Additionally, cells expressing normal E-cadherin but lacking α-catenin do not aggregate (18Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi A. Fujita S. Gotoh M. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5770-5774PubMed Google Scholar), and cell-cell adhesion can be restored by transfection of these cells with the α-catenin cDNA (19Hirano S. Kimoto N. Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Although these studies have defined protein-protein interactions that are important for cell adhesion, the mechanisms involved in regulation of cell adhesion remain poorly understood. p120ctn is a recently described component of the cadherin adhesion complex (21Reynolds A.B.J. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) that seems to be able to associate directly with cadherins (24Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its function in the complex remains unknown. p120ctn, like β-catenin, is a member of the armadillo family of proteins, having 10 copies of the 42-amino acid armadillo repeat (25Reynolds A.B. Herbert L. Cleveland J.L. Berg S.T. Gaut J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2439-2445PubMed Google Scholar), and a number of different but closely related isoforms have been identified (26Mo Y.-Y. Reynolds A.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2633-2640PubMed Google Scholar). p120ctn was first discovered as a protein the phosphorylation of which on tyrosine residues was correlated with transformation in cells transfected with pp60v-Src (27Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). p120ctn is also tyrosine-phosphorylated following the stimulation of cells by growth factors, epidermal growth factor, colony-stimulating factor, and platelet-derived growth factors (28Downing J.R. Reynolds A.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 607-613PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in transformed cells and in response to growth factors, constitutive phosphorylation of p120ctn on serine and to a lesser extent on threonine residues in both normal and src-transformed cells was noticed (29Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was also shown that in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, p120ctn is phosphorylated primarily on serine residues, with some phosphothreonine but no detectable phosphotyrosine (30Ratcliffe M.J. Rubin L.L. Staddon J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31894-31901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of these residues, caused by either activation of protein kinase C or the addition of kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine, has been correlated with faster migration of p120ctn during SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CD, cytochalasin D; EC0L, L cell expressing mutant E-cadherin lacking the cytoplasmic tail; EΔC71L, L cell expressing mutant E-cadherin with the carboxyl-terminal deletion of 71 amino acids; EL, L cells expressing E-cadherin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline and precedes the permeability increase across epithelial cell monolayers (30Ratcliffe M.J. Rubin L.L. Staddon J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31894-31901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of p120ctn on serine/threonine residues modulates intercellular junctions. Recent experiments revealed that the membrane-proximal region of the cadherin cytoplasmic domain plays a role(s) in the regulation of its activity. In the case of C-cadherin, it supports lateral clustering and adhesive strengthening (31Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), whereas in the case of E-cadherin, it prevents dimerization of the extracellular domain of the protein and thereby negatively regulates adhesion activity (32Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, carboxyl-terminally truncated mutant E-cadherin proteins retaining the membrane-proximal region are inactive in cell adhesion, but deletion of the region results in activation of the nonfunctional E-cadherin polypeptides. Although its precise role in the regulation remains to be determined, the membrane-proximal region seems to interact with p120ctn (31Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 32Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 33Lampugnani M.G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the potential role of p120ctn in this negative regulation and obtained several lines of evidence that p120ctn is involved in modulation of E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Mammalian expression vectors containing mouse E-cadherin cDNAs encoding the wild-type, mutant proteins EΔC71 or EC0 (Fig. 1 a) and an E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric protein (EαC) were described previously (32Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 35Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29524-29529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding another E-cadherin mutant protein, EΔC71Δ604–615 (Fig. 1 a), was constructed as described below and cloned into the same expression vector, pCAGGSneo (36Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. K. Yamamura, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan). To construct EΔC71Δ604–615, two additionalEcoRI sites were generated in the EΔC71 cDNA at the positions encoding amino acid residues 604–605 and 614–615, by means of the polymerase chain reaction described previously (32Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For this, the following two combinations of sense and antisense primers were used: X1 (TATACCGCTCGAGAGCCG) and EN (CGGAATTCATCATAGTAATACACATTGTCCC), and EC (CGGAATTCAGCCAGCTGCACAGGGGC) and ΔC71 (ATCTTAATTACCGATGAAGTTTCCAATTTC). Sense primer X1 contains aXhoI restriction sequence, whereas sense primer EC and antisense primer EN each contain a EcoRI restriction sequence near the 5′-end. The cDNA fragments were assembled into the pBluescript II KS(+) vector using theXhoI-EcoRV site. After confirming the sequence, the cDNA was cloned into the expression vector for E-cadherin, from which the XhoI-EcoRV fragment of the E-cadherin cDNA that encodes the carboxyl-terminal 373 amino acids of E-cadherin had been removed. cDNA for mouse p120ctn (the 1A isoform) was kindly provided by Drs. J. Stappert and R. Kemler (Max-Planck Institut für Immunbiologie, Freiburg, Germany). Carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged p120 (p120HA) was generated by the addition of the sequence that encodes the nine amino acid hemagglutinin (HA) epitope for the anti-peptide mAb 12CA5. cDNAs encoding two amino-terminal deletion mutant p120 proteins, p120ΔN1HA and p120ΔN2HA (see Fig.5 a), were constructed by deleting in-frame segments between two restriction sites, NcoI and EcoRI orSmaI and SmaI, respectively. These cDNAs were cloned into the pCAGGSneo vector For the blot overlay assay, the entire E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain or parts of it were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) (see Fig. 4 a). For this, cDNA fragments were generated by either digestion at appropriate restriction enzyme sites in the cDNA or polymerase chain reaction with the following oligonucleotides as primers: N5 (CGGGATCCGGAGGAGAACGGTG) and N3 (AACTGCAGTCAAGTCACTTCCGGTCGGG), and C5 (TGACCCGGGAGGTGGAGAAGAAGAC) and C3 (GCGTCGACTTAAGGGGGTGCCGTGGG). The cDNA fragments were cloned into pGEX4T vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the fusion proteins were purified as described previously (11Obama H. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11017-11020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mouse fibroblasticl-tk− cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. L cells (5 × 105) were transfected with the expression vectors (10 μg) by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (6Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were isolated and examined for E-cadherin expression by immunofluorescence staining as described previously (6Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Positive cells were subcloned and used for further studies. To obtain transfectants expressing both the mutant E-cadherin (EΔC71) and mutant p120ctn proteins, either pC-p120HA, pC-p120ΔN1HA, or pC-p120ΔN2HA (15 μg) was introduced into an L cell clone expressing the mutant E-cadherin (EΔC71L cells) by the calcium phosphate method. Because EΔC71L cells already contained the neomycin gene, another plasmid (pStk) containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (37Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) (1.5 μg) was cotransfected. After selection in HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterine, and thymidine; Life Technologies, Inc.) medium, single colonies were isolated and analyzed for the expression of the p120ctnprotein by immunoblotting with anti-HA mAb. The cell aggregation assay was performed as described previously (7Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.01% trypsin (type XI, Sigma) and 2 mm CaCl2. After the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), the cells were washed and resuspended. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with constant rotation at 70 rpm, the cells were fixed by adding an equal volume of 6% formaldehyde in PBS. A mouse mAb against p120ctn (pp120) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). DECMA-1, a rat mAb to E-cadherin (38Vestweber D. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3393-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), was used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining, and rabbit anti-E-cadherin antibodies (6Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar) were used for immunoprecipitation. A mAb against GST was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A mAb (12CA5) directed against HA and a mAb against phosphotyrosine (4G10) were kindly provided by Dr. A. Yoshimura (Kurume University, Fukuoka, Japan). Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described previously (32Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (32Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cells (5 × 106) were lysed with either R lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin), or PI lysis buffer to preserve phosphorylated amino acid residues in p120ctn (25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin). The E-cadherin-catenin complex was collected with rabbit anti-E-cadherin antibodies, which had been preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immune complex was washed with the same buffer four times and then boiled for 5 min in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For treatment with alkaline phosphatase, the immunoprecipitate was washed three times with AP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then incubated with 20 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Ohtsu, Japan) in 200 μl of AP buffer. To check the specificity of the phosphatase, a phosphatase inhibitor (100 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 4 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Na3VO4) was used (39Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). After 1 h incubation at 30 °C with occasional mixing, the immunocomplex was washed with PI buffer and boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The blot overlay assay was carried out as described previously (11Obama H. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11017-11020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) except that anti-p120 antibodies were used to detect the GST-p120 fusion proteins bound to the GST-E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins that had been separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and that the proteins were visualized with an ECL detection kit. Cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl, the cells were soaked in a blocking solution (PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum) for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were incubated with antibodies as described previously (32Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated overnight in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl and 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5) and 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products). The cells were then treated with or without 100 nmstaurosporine for 60 min, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. Following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford MA) and immunoblotting to assess the recoveries of proteins, the area of the filter containing p120ctn was excised. The proteins were hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 1 h in 5.7 m HCl to release phosphoamino acids. Following lyophilization, phosphoamino acids were separated and detected as described (40Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). To examine the potential role of p120ctn in the modulation of E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, we expressed the wild-type E-cadherin as well as mutant E-cadherin polypeptides EΔC71 and EC0 on L cells. We chose L cells in the present study because L cells seem to exhibit less proteolytic activity toward p120ctn compared with K562 cells, in which degradation of p120ctn during immunoprecipitation experiments was observed (32Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The wild-type E-cadherin has a cytoplasmic domain of 151 amino acids at its carboxyl terminus. EΔC71 is a mutant E-cadherin polypeptide with a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 71 amino acid residues, whereas EC0 is a mutant polypeptide completely lacking the cytoplasmic domain (Fig.1 a). When expressed on L cells, these proteins migrated as polypeptides of the expected molecular weights upon immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 b). Consistent with our previous experiments on these proteins expressed on K562 cells (32Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), EC0 expressed on L cells exhibits activity in a cell aggregation assay but EΔC71 was inactive (Fig.2). Therefore, as in the case of K562 cells, the presence of the membrane-proximal region of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain maintains the partially truncated E-cadherin polypeptide (EΔC71) expressed on L cells in an inactive state. Immunoblot analysis of the E-cadherin immunoprecipitate with anti-p120 revealed that p120ctn is associated with E-cadherin expressed on L cells (Fig. 1 c). In the case of the EΔC71 polypeptide, a reduced amount of p120ctn (∼10% of the wild-type E-cadherin polypeptide) was coprecipitated, but no p120ctn was detected in the EC0 precipitate. The largest isoform of p120ctn isolated from L cells migrated as a protein of 110 kDa, which was slightly smaller than the reported size of p120ctn in other cells (25Reynolds A.B. Herbert L. Cleveland J.L. Berg S.T. Gaut J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2439-2445PubMed Google Scholar). Different posttranslational modification may be responsible for the difference. To demonstrate the direct binding of p120ctn to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin and to localize p120ctn-binding site(s) in the latter, we expressed different regions of the domain as fusion proteins with GST (Fig. 3 a). Their interaction with p120ctn, which was also expressed as a GST fusion protein, was analyzed using the blot overlay assay. As shown in Fig.3 b, p120ctn bound to the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins containing residues 578–728 (the entire cytoplasmic domain) and residues 578–657 (the membrane-proximal region of the domain), but not to a fusion protein including residues 658–728 (the membrane-distal region of the domain). Furthermore, p120ctn bound to a cytoplasmic domain fusion protein containing residues 596–628, but not to a fusion protein containing residues 605–671, eliminating the possibility that the region that was split to produce the membrane-proximal and membrane-distal regions contains an additional binding site for p120ctn. The deletion of residues 604–615 from the membrane-proximal region abolished its ability to bind to p120ctn. These results suggest that the p120ctn-binding site in the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is localized in the membrane-proximal region,i.e. not in the membrane-distal region, and that residues 604–615 play a critical role in the binding. p120ctn has been shown to be colocalized with E-cadherin and catenins at cell-cell contacts (21Reynolds A.B.J. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining with anti-p120 mAb revealed that p120ctn is localized at cell-cell contacts in L cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin (EL) or a mutant E-cadherin polypeptide with the membrane-proximal region (EΔC71L) (Fig.4). In contrast, p120ctn was undetectable at cell-cell junctions in L cells expressing the tail-less E-cadherin polypeptide (EC0L); instead, it was found throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). Thus, the tail-less E-cadherin cannot recruit p120ctn to the contacts. These results show that the membrane-proximal region of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is enough to localize p120ctn at cell-cell contacts. If the binding of p120ctn to the membrane-proximal region of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is involved in the failure of the mutant E-cadherin polypeptide (EΔC71) to be functional in the cell aggregation assay, the deletion of the p120ctn-binding site from the EΔC71 polypeptide should activate the protein. Therefore we constructed a cDNA that encodes a mutant E-cadherin, designated EΔC71Δ604–615 (Fig. 1 a). The EΔC71Δ604–615 polypeptide has an additional deletion of residues 604–615, the residues shown to be required for p120ctn-binding in the above experiments, within the EΔC71 protein. This construct was introduced into L cells, and G418-resistant clones were isolated. Although the EΔC71Δ604–615 protein has the molecular weight expected from its construct and migrated faster than the EΔC71 protein on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 c), immunofluorescence staining with DECMA-1, an anti-E-cadherin mAb, revealed that each clone positive for DECMA-1 staining contained a mixture of two types of cells, one (10∼%) stained normally, like EL cells, and the other (∼90%) stained weakly. This unstable nature of expression of the EΔC71Δ604–615 protein persisted even after recloning. Therefore, we analyzed aggregation activity using L cell clones consisting of the two types of cells. Despite the presence of the weakly stained cells, L cells expressing the EΔC71Δ604–615 protein showed a certain degree of cell aggregation (Fig. 2). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that cells in the aggregates were stained strongly with DECMA-1, whereas the majority of the cells remaining as single ones were stained only weakly (data not shown). Therefore, the EΔC71Δ604–615 protein expressed on L cells seemed to be active in the aggregation assay. The lack of association of p120ctn with the EΔC71Δ604–615 protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the E-cadherin immunoprecipitate with anti-p120ctn antibodies (Fig.3 c). Whereas the above results demonstrating p120ctn binds to a site (including residues 604–615) of the membrane-proximal region of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and the deletion of this site from the nonfunctional E-cadherin (EΔC71) activates the protein strongly suggested that p120ctn was a crucial modulator of the protein, the possibility existed that another protein that can bind to the protein at this site could be modulating the aggregation activity. To confirm the role of p120ctn in the modulation of the adhesion activity of the EΔC71 protein, we constructed two amino-terminally truncated p120ctn proteins (p120ΔN1 and p120ΔN2) (Fig.5 a) and expressed them in EΔC71L cells. p120ctn can be divided into three parts; an amino-terminal part, a central portion composed of the so-called armadillo repeats, and a small carboxyl-terminal tail. The armadillo repeats are responsible for its binding to cadherins (24Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M.

EΔC71L cells were transfected with these constructs together with the pStk vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene or the pStk vector alone. After selection in HAT medium, single colonies were isolated and analyzed for expression of the p120ctn protein by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-p120 antibodies (Fig. 5 b). Immunoblot analysis of the E-cadherin immunoprecipitates with anti-p120 antibodies revealed that these truncated p120ctn polypeptides are associated with the EΔC71 polypeptides to similar degrees to the endogenous p120ctn polypeptides (Fig. 5 c). Aggregation assay of EΔC71 cells expressing these truncated p120ctnpolypeptides (clone 3 of EΔC71/p120ΔN1L cells and clones 8 and 3 of EΔC71/p120ΔN2L cells) revealed that these cells form aggregates, whereas EΔC71L cells transfected with the pStk vector alone (EΔC71/tkL cells) and EΔC71L cells expressing the full-length p120ctn polypeptides (EΔC71/p120L cells"

Although the pathogenesis of AD is unknown, it is widely accepted that AD is caused by extracellular accumulation of a neurotoxic peptide, known as Aβ. Mutations in the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), from which Aβ arises by proteolysis, are associated with some forms of familial AD (FAD) and result in increased Aβ production. Two other FAD genes, presenilin-1 and -2, have also been shown to regulate Aβ production; however, studies examining the biological role of these FAD genes suggest an alternative theory for the pathogenesis of AD. In fact, all three genes have been shown to regulate programmed cell death, hinting at the possibility that dysregulation of apoptosis plays a primary role in causing neuronal loss in AD. In an attempt to reconcile these two hypotheses, we investigated APP processing during apoptosis and found that APP is processed by the cell death proteases caspase-6 and -8. APP is cleaved by caspases in the intracellular portion of the protein, in a site distinct from those processed by secretases. Moreover, it represents a general effect of apoptosis, because it occurs during cell death induced by several stimuli both in T cells and in neuronal cells.

It is widely believed that this disease is caused by the extracellular accumulation of the aggregated amyloidogenic form of Aβ peptide (Aβ1–42). This peptide arises from the processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by still unknown proteases (secretases) (2Haass C. Selkoe D.J.

The recent discovery of three genes linked to familial, early-onset forms of AD (FAD) has brought further support to this theory. The first to be discovered was, in fact, APP, the protein from which Aβ derives (3Goate A. Chartier-Harlin M.C. Mullan M. Brown J. Crawford F. Fidani L. Giuffra L. Haynes A. Irving N. James L.

Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest an alternative model for the pathogenesis of AD according to which AD is caused by dysregulation of programmed cell death (PCD) and enhanced susceptibility of neurons to apoptotic stimuli. These two apparently contrasting theories need not be mutually exclusive. An attractive possibility is that APP processing might regulate or be regulated during PCD. In support for this, it has been shown that APP processing and Aβ formation were enhanced during neuronal apoptosis (23Galli C. Piccini A. Ciotti M.T. Castellani L. Calissano P. Zaccheod D. Tabaton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24LeBlanc A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine how general this finding is, we studied the processing of APP during other forms of apoptosis. In this study, we show that APP is cleaved during apoptosis by the cell death proteases caspase-6 and -8. Further, apoptotic cleavage of APP is common to cell death initiated by different stimuli and occurs in both T and neuronal cells. This processing is distinct from that mediated by secretases because it occurs in the intracellular portion of the protein between Asp664 and Ala665, COOH-terminal to the processing sites of the secretases. The finding that three FAD proteins are substrates of caspase strengthens the possibility that dysregulation of PCD could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The cDNA expressing the 695-amino acid-long form of human APP was cloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and mutant constructs were obtained using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis system (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA encoding for the COOH-terminal fragment of APP after caspase cleavage (APPCcas, Ala665-Asn695) and APPβstub were obtained by PCR (primer sense Ccas: acgtggatccgccgccatggccgctgtcaccccag; primer antisense Ccas and βstub: acgtccgtctagattacttcttcagcatcaccaaggtg; primer sense βstub: cgcggatccgccgccatgctgcccggtttggcactgctcctgctggccgcctggacggctcgggcgctggaatgcagaattccgacatgac) and cloned as a BamHI/XbaI fragment into pcDNA3. The identity of each construct was confirmed by sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 automatic sequencer (Perkin Elmer). Human T-cell Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids), 2 mm glutamine, 25 nm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Murine neuronal N2A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml penicillin. Jurkat cells (4 × 106) (107/ml) were transfected by electroporation with 20 μg of the pcDNA3-APP construct. One h after transfection, dead cells were removed by Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) purification. Regions of APP recognized by the antibodies used in this study are depicted in Fig. 1. R1155 and C7 are rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised to a synthetic polypeptide of amino acids 649–664 and 676–695 of APP (numbering according to Kanget al. (Ref. 25Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A.

The monoclonal 22C11 antibody recognizes an N-terminal epitope of APP and is commercially available (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twenty-four h after transfection, Jurkat cells were washed once with methionine-free RPMI medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated in the same medium for 40 min at 37 °C.35S-Labeled methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (200 μCi) was then added in each transfection, and labeling continued for 2 h before the addition, where necessary, of anti-Fas. Apoptosis was triggered in Jurkat cells 24 h after transfection by direct stimulation of the Fas molecule. Cells were supplied with fresh medium containing a monoclonal human anti-Fas antibody CH-11 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) at 0.1 μg/ml, incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C, and harvested. Alternatively, in Jurkat and N2A cells, apoptosis was stimulated with 250 ng/ml staurosporine (Sigma) for 6 to 10 h. The block of caspase-3 activity in Jurkat cells was obtained by incubating cells for 30 min with 50 μm ZDEVD-fmk, an irreversible caspase inhibitor (Enzyme System, Livermore, CA) prior to anti-Fas addition. Fifty μm mock inhibitor ZFA-fmk (Enzyme System) was used as a control. Of note, caspase-3 activity is required for caspase-6 activation (28Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.6) containing the protease inhibitors 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin (Sigma). Lysate was spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant recovered. Antibody was added and the immunoprecipitation reaction incubated at 4 °C for 12 h with gentle rocking. Immunocomplexes were captured by addition of protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce) and incubation for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were washed three times in wash buffer I (50 mm Tris, 500 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.6), washed three times in wash buffer II (50 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.6), and resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli loading buffer. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 2 min and separated on a polyacrylamide-SDS gel (Novex Experimental Technology). For detection of in vitrolabeled proteins, gels were fixed, enhanced, vacuum-dried, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C using intensifying screens. Unlabeled proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the specified antibodies. Immunoblots were developed using the SuperSignal system (Pierce). [3H]Leucine- or [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were made using a TNT-coupled transcription and translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Caspase cleavage reactions were performed at 37 °C in 25 μl of caspase buffer (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.2) containing 0.5 μg of recombinant caspase (PharMingen). To determine whether increased APP processing and Aβ production was a general phenomenon associated with apoptosis, we studied APP processing during Fas-induced cell death in Jurkat T cells. To this end, Jurkat cells were transfected with a vector expressing APP and subjected to metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine. Two h later, cells were treated with a cytotoxic anti-Fas antibody (CH-11) for 3 h. Cell lysates and cell culture supernatants were immunoprecipitated with either the 22C11 monoclonal antibody or C7 antiserum, specific for NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of APP, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Surprisingly, the C7 antiserum precipitated negligible levels of full-length APP from anti-Fas-treated cells (Fig. 1 B,left panel). On the other hand, the anti-NH2-terminal monoclonal antibody 22C11 revealed the presence of an APP polypeptide of lower molecular weight, termed APPNcas (Ncas), in lysates from cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig.1 B, right panel). In addition, the 22C11 monoclonal antibody did not precipitate any soluble APP proteins in the Fas-stimulated sample (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that the COOH-terminal region of APP containing the C7 epitope is cleaved off during apoptosis and that the NH2-terminal APP fragment, APPNcas, remains associated with the cells. The apoptotic processing of APP appears therefore to be distinct from that mediated by secretases, because the NH2-terminal fragments resulting from these activities are usually released extracellularly. Alternatively, PCD could selectively enhance secretase processing of APP localized in intracellular compartments such as Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. NH2-terminal APP fragments generated by secretases in these compartments remain associated with the cells. To distinguish between these two possibilities, Jurkat cells were transfected with APP and treated with CH-11 the following day. After 6 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either C7 or R1155 antiserum. The latter is specific for an intracytoplasmic region of APP nested between the C7 epitope and the cleavage sites for β-, α-, and γ-secretases (Fig.1 A). Immunocomplexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis and probed with 22C11. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the APPNcas molecule generated during PCD was immunoprecipitated by the R1155 but not by the C7 antiserum. Thus, APP is processed during PCD between the C7 epitope and the γ-secretase cleavage site. Implementation of programmed cell death requires activation of caspases. These cysteine proteases are present in the cell as proenzymes and are activated by proteolysis. Active caspases execute cell death by cleaving intracellular substrates (29Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar,30Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Thus, progression of apoptosis can be monitored by assessing the processing of caspases and their substrates. The 113-kDa protein PARP is one such substrate and is cleaved into two polypeptides of 89 and 24 kDa (31Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). Fas stimulation of APP-transfected cells induced apoptosis as shown by proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP (Fig.2 A, two bottom panels, second lane). Concomitantly, cleavage of APP and appearance of APPNcas was also detected (Fig. 2 A, top panel). Thus, cleavage of APP correlates with activation of caspases. To determine whether APP processing during apoptosis was dependent on caspase activity, transfected cells were treated with either an irreversible caspase inhibitor (ZDEVD-fmk) or with a control molecule (ZFA-fmk) prior to apoptosis induction. While ZFA-fmk had no effect, ZDEVD-fmk completely inhibited caspase-3 activation and, consequently, PARP cleavage (Fig. 2 A, two bottom panels; compare third and fourth lanes). Consistently, inhibition of caspase activity resulted in suppression of the apoptotic processing of APP (Fig.2 A, top panel, fourth lane). Thus, cleavage of APP during PCD requires caspase activity. To demonstrate that the apoptotic processing of APP is not specific to Fas-induced cell death but, rather, is common to apoptotic pathways initiated by several different stimuli, we treated Jurkat cells with staurosporine or ceramide, two other inducers of PCD. Both staurosporine (Fig. 2 B) and ceramide (data not shown) resulted in the apoptotic processing of APP. In looking at the amino acid sequence of APP, we noticed a putative caspase consensus cleavage sequence (Val661-Glu-Val-Asp664) (32Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A.

This sequence is present in the cytoplasmic tail of APP, and cleavage at the predicted Asp664-Ala665 site would give rise to an NH2-terminal segment compatible in size with the APPNcas. Caspases have an absolute requirement for aspartic acid at position P1 of their substrate (32Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J.

To address whether APP was cleaved at this site by caspases during apoptosis, an APP mutant was made in which position P1 (Asp664) was substituted with an asparagine (mutant D664N). As a control, another aspartate present in the extracellular portion of APP was mutated (mutant D620H). Jurkat cells were transfected with these two mutants, and apoptosis was induced with the anti-Fas antibody CH-11. While mutation of Asp620 did not affect the processing of APP, mutant D664N was completely resistant to cleavage (Fig. 3 A,top panel). Of note, caspases were normally activated in these samples, as demonstrated by caspase-3 and PARP processing (Fig.3 A, two bottom panels). Identical results were also observed using an alternative approach. Transfected Jurkat cells were metabolically labeled, and APP was immunoprecipitated with the C7 antiserum or the 22C11 monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, APPNcas was specifically immunoprecipitated with the 22C11 antibody but not with the C7. Instead, mutation at the Asp664 completely abolished cleavage of APP by caspases. Together, these data indicate that APP is a direct substrate for caspases during PCD and that processing occurs at the Asp664-Ala665 site of its cytoplasmic domain. Of interest, the APPCcas fragment generated in apoptotic cells is probably short-lived, because it could not be detected even when lysates from 4 × 107 cells taken at different time points after apoptosis triggering were analyzed by immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Apoptosis progresses through a sequential activation of caspases. Triggering of Fas, for example, induces recruitment of caspase-8 to its intracytoplasmic tail followed by activation of this protease (35Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M.

Active caspase-8 activates, either directly or indirectly, effector caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-6. To test whether APP is directly cleaved by any of these caspases, we tested recombinant caspase-3, -8, and -6 in an in vitro cleavage assay usingin vitro-translated recombinant APP protein as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 A and recently by others (37Barnes N.Y. Li L. Yoshikawa K. Schwartz L.M. Oppenheim R.W. Milligan C.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5869-5880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Weidemann A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5823-5829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), APP was cleaved by caspase-3 and -8. However, both caspase-6 and -8 appeared to be more efficient in processing APP, as observed by the amount of the ∼5 kDa fragment immunoprecipitated with the C7 antiserum (APPCcas; Fig. 4 A). Thus, unlike PS-1 and PS-2, which are specific substrates of caspase-3 (18Giambarella U. Yamatsuji T. Okamoto T. Matsui T. Ikezu T. Murayama Y. Levine M.A. Katz A. Gautam N. Nishimoto I.

Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), APP in vivo might be preferentially cleaved by caspase-6 and -8. This conclusion is further substantiated by dose titration assays. In these experiments, caspase-3 cleaved more efficiently its established target PARP than APP, while caspase-6 showed the inverse specificity (Fig. 4 C). The size of the APPCcas fragment is compatible with processing occurring at the Asp664-Ala665 site. This supposition was indirectly confirmed by the fact that in vitro transcription/translation of a construct encoding a polypeptide spanning from Ala665 to the COOH terminus of APP (APPCcas) generated an APP polypeptide that co-migrated with APPCcas (Fig. 4 A, last lane). However, to directly confirm this possibility, we produced recombinant-labeled APP D664N and D620H proteins and analyzed their susceptibility to caspase cleavage. As shown in Fig. 4 B, while mutant D620H maintained APP sensitivity to caspase-8 processing, mutant D664N was resistant to it. APP plays a central role in the etiological pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial forms of AD. Because this disease is characterized by extensive neuronal loss, it was important to determine whether apoptotic processing of APP also occurred during neuronal cell death. To address this question, we used the mouse neuronal cell line N2A and induced PCD by treating these cells with staurosporine. Triggering of apoptosis resulted in a molecular shift of endogenous APP (Fig.5, compare first andsecond lanes), similar to that observed for transfected APP in apoptotic Jurkat cells. Moreover, APPNcas, which could not be immunoprecipitated with the C7 antiserum (Fig. 5,fourth lane), was pulled down by the R1155 antiserum (Fig. 5, sixth lane). Thus, endogenous APP is readily and completely processed by caspases during neuronal apoptosis. In the present study, we have demonstrated that APP is processed during apoptosis. Apoptotic cleavage of APP is common to death pathways initiated in diverse cell types and by various stimuli. The apoptotic proteolysis of APP is distinct from that mediated by secretases. In fact, while secretases cleave APP either in the extracellular (β- and α-secretases) or in the transmembranous (γ-secretase) regions of the protein (2Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), APP processing in apoptotic cells occurs in the intracytoplasmic tail. The intracellular portion of APP contains a canonical cleavage site for caspases. Using specific caspase inhibitors together with mutagenesis studies and an in vitro cleavage assay, we have shown that APP is a direct and specific substrate of caspase-6 and, to a lesser extent, caspase-3. Caspases are the mammalian homologues of the cell deathCaenorhabditis elegans gene CED3. CED3is essential for the execution of PCD in this nematode. Likewise, the proteolytic activities of caspases are required to complete the apoptotic program in mammalian cells. The proapoptotic function of these enzymes is mediated by processing of a number of intracellular substrates. Upon caspase-mediated cleavage, some endogenous proteins acquire proapoptotic activity, such as DFF/ICAD (39Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 40Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar), Bid (41Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar), and procaspases themselves. Antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, can also be processed by caspases, and this cleavage inactivates their protective function and results in the generation of proapoptotic polypeptides (42Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Caspase cleavage has also been shown to generate a negative feedback signal. Processing of PS-2 by caspase-3 inactivates the proapoptotic function of PS-2 and generates a dominant negative inhibitor of apoptosis, PS2Ccas (21Vito P. Ghayur T. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28315-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Whether caspase-mediated cleavage of APP inactivates its proapoptotic role or, on the contrary, mediates the function of APP in cell death is currently under investigation in the laboratory. Two neuronal proteins, FE65 and X11, have been shown to bind to the cytoplasmic region of APP (43Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Jondro P.D. Tanzi R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 44Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; Nov: 6229-6241Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the YENPTY motif of APP responsible for modulating this interaction is located COOH-terminal to the VEVD caspase cleavage site (43Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Jondro P.D. Tanzi R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It should then be concluded that the APPNcas fragment that originates from caspase cleavage does not bind to these two proteins. Therefore, upon caspase cleavage of APP the functional role of the APP/X11 and APP/FE65 interaction is likely to be lost. Thus, one possible immediate effect of caspase cleavage of APP is to abrogate its binding to X11 and FE65 and the functional consequences of these interactions. Whether APPCcas retains the ability to bind to X11 and/or FE65 and whether this putative interactions affect the progression of the apoptotic process remains to be determined. Because AD is characterized by neuronal cell loss, one possibility is that the disease might be caused by dysregulation of PCD in neuronal cells. Studies regarding the biological functions of the three FAD genes have generated data supporting this hypothesis and lead to a model where even a slight imbalance in favor of apoptosis could eventually progress to neuronal cell loss seen in FAD. In fact, all three genes have been shown to positively regulate cell death, and FAD mutations generate molecules that enhance the sensitivity of cells to apoptotic stimuli (12Vito P. Lacanà E.

The data we present here, together with the findings that apoptosis can enhance amyloidogenic processing of APP (22Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), raise the important possibility that cleavage of APP by caspases could regulate Aβ production. This link between apoptosis and production of amyloidogenic forms of Aβ could be relevant to the pathogenesis of AD. A correct understanding of the causative processes of AD represents an extremely important step in the identification of effective and much-needed therapeutic agents. We are indebted to Drs. Selkoe and Xia (Harvard University) for generously making available to us polyclonal antibodies C7 and R1155 (as well as others not included in this study) and to Dr. Schwartz for critically reading the manuscript."

In this study we present evidence that MT1-MMP plays a key role for the in vitro invasiveness of malignant melanoma. Melanoma cell lines secreted latent MMP-2 when cultured on plastic. However, when cells were grown in floating type I collagen lattices, only high invasive melanoma cells activated proMMP-2. Activation could be inhibited by antibodies against MT1-MMP, by addition of recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 and by inhibition of MT1-MMP cleavage. MT1-MMP protein was detected as an inactive protein in all cell lines cultured as monolayers, whereas in collagen gels, active MT1-MMP protein was detected in the membranes of both high and low invasive melanoma cells. Production of TIMP-2 was about 10-fold higher in low invasive cells as compared with high invasive melanoma cells and was further increased in the low invasive cells upon contact to collagen. Thus, in melanoma cells TIMP-2 expression levels might regulate MT1-MMP-mediated activation of proMMP-2. High invasive melanoma cells displayed increased in vitro invasiveness, which was inhibited by TIMP-2.

Local degradation of connective tissue in the vicinity of the cell surface is thought to be essential for tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Neoplastic cells that invade surrounding tissues and metastasize through the blood stream or lymphatic system must penetrate several barriers, including basement membranes and the interstitial connective tissue (1Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Degradation of extracellular matrix components is accomplished through the combined action of different proteases, primarily of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; CMK, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone; MT-MMP, membrane type matrix metalloproteinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (3Birkedal-Hansen H.

Because of the importance of MMP activity for initiating efficient matrix degradation, MMP expression and activity is tightly regulated and is subject to several levels of control, including gene transcription, post-translational extracellular activation, and inhibition by soluble inhibitors (3Birkedal-Hansen H.

Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Basal production of metalloproteinases is typically low or absent and requires an inducing factor, such as a cytokine, phorbol ester, or contact with components of the extracellular matrix to increase their expression (3Birkedal-Hansen H.

Enzyme activation is achieved by removal of the N-terminal propeptide domain through exogenous or autocatalytic cleavage. In vitro, serine proteases, such as plasmin or trypsin, have been shown to activate most MMPs (3Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. Decarlo A. Engler J.A.

A novel membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) was originally cloned from a breast cancer cDNA library and was characterized as an integral membrane MMP that can activate proMMP-2. Thus far, four different membrane-bound MMPs have been described (12Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M.

Invest. 1997; 76: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). Like other members of the metalloproteinase family, MT1-MMP is synthesized as a proform. The mechanism of MT1-MMP activation and whether cleavage of the N-terminal peptide of proMT1-MMP is a prerequisite for its activity are still a matter of discussion, but both the intracellular protease furin (22Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and extracellular plasmin (23Okumura Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Kido H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have been reported to be capable to cleave the propeptide. Several studies have demonstrated that activation of proMMP-2 by MT1-MMP depends upon the presence of low amounts of TIMP-2, which is believed to be required for the formation of a membrane-bound ternary complex consisting of MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and latent MMP-2 (24Strongin A.Y.

A second “free” MT1-MMP located in proximity to the ternary complex may, in a second step, cleave proMMP-2 bound to the MT1-MMP/TIMP-2 receptor.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1336-1341PubMed Google Scholar), where it is thought to have a major impact on tumor progression. Further, MacDougall and co-workers (34MacDougall J.R. Bani M.R. Lin Y. Rak J. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4174-4181PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that MMP-2 is constitutively expressed in malignant melanoma cell lines and Vaisanenet al. (35Vaisanen A. Tuominen H. Kallioinen M. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. J. Pathol. 1996; 180: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that expression of MMP-2 increases with enhanced atypia and dedifferentiation in melanocytic lesions. However, little is known about the role of MMP-2 in neoplastic progression of human melanomas and about the mechanisms underlying the activation of proMMP-2 in vivo. To examine the hypothesis that variable expression and/or activity of MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and TIMP-2 might be different in melanoma cells of high and low metastatic potential, we analyzed the expression and activation pattern of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP in different melanoma cell lines. Here we report that active MT1-MMP protein is detected in the cell membranes of melanoma cells lines of both high and low invasive potential when cultured in collagen lattices. Activation of proMMP-2, however, is only observed in high invasive melanoma cell lines, which produced significantly lower amounts of TIMP-2 when compared with low invasive cells. Activation of proMMP-2 by high invasive melanoma cells was completely inhibited by antibodies against MT1-MMP, by a synthetic furin inhibitor, as well as by the addition of recombinant TIMP-2. These data indicate that MT1-MMP is responsible for MMP-2 activation in highly invasive melanoma cell lines and that this process is highly dependent on the expression level of TIMP-2. The following melanoma cell lines were used: MV3 and BLM, known to be highly metastatic with early and frequent formation of metastasis after subcutaneous inoculation in nude mice. The nonmetastatic melanoma cell lines IF6 and 530 showed low invasive abilities and no organ metastasis unless injected intravenously (36Van Muijen G.N.P. Cornelissen I.M.H.A. Jansen K.F.J.

The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin and then passaged by trypsinization. Three-dimensional collagen type I gel cultures were prepared as described previously (38Mauch C. Hatamochi A. Scharffetter K. Krieg T. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded into collagen gels (3.5 × 106 cells/ml) containing 1 mg/ml porcine skin type I collagen (DGF Stoess AG, Eberbach, Germany). Cells were cultured as monolayer for 48 h, washed three times with PBS, followed by trypsinization and counting. 3.5 × 106 cells/ml were seeded into collagen gels, and the medium was changed daily. After 48 h, the gels were washed three times with PBS and the medium replaced by serum-free RPMI; 24 h later, the medium was collected. Alternatively, conditioned media and cells grown as monolayers or in collagen gels were combined and homogenized by sonication. In the inhibition experiments, cell suspensions were preincubated for 20 min with the synthetic furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (CMK; Bachem Biochemicals, Heidelberg, Germany) or aprotinin (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), and then seeded in collagen gels either with furin inhibitor concentrations varying from 0 to 75 μm or aprotinin in concentrations from 1 to 10 μm or methanol, the CMK solvent. After 24 h, cultures were washed three times with PBS and media replaced by serum-free media containing fresh inhibitors. After another 24 h, culture samples were processed as described above. Fibroblast-conditioned medium was prepared by incubating confluent fibroblast cultures with serum-free medium for 48 h. Conditioned media were stored at 4 °C until use. For gelatin zymography, 20 μl of the homogenates were separated on nonreducing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml bovine gelatin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) (39Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min to remove SDS and then incubated in enzyme substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm CaCl2) overnight at 37 °C. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R250 and destained in water. Melanoma cell invasion was assayed as described previously (40Danen E.H.J. van Kraats A.A. Cornelissen I.M.H.A. Ruiter D. van Muijen G.N.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using a modified Boyden chamber equipped with polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size, Corning Costar, Bodenheim, Germany). The filters were coated with 25 μl of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and placed above the lower compartment, which contained either 200 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium (random migration) or fibroblast conditioned media. Melanoma cells were suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 (5 × 105/ml) and seeded into the upper compartment of the chamber (total volume 0.7 ml). The chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 36 h. Cells attached to the upper side of the filter were mechanically removed. The filters were then stained with eosin and thiazine dyes (Dade Diff-Quick, Düdingen, Switzerland). Invasion was determined by counting the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter (100-fold magnification). For each filter, the number of cells in 5 randomly chosen microscope fields was determined and averaged. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Invasion assays were also performed in the presence of human recombinant TIMP-2 (5.4 nm) or of 100 μl of medium conditioned by the non-invasive melanoma cell line IF6, which contains 80 ng of TIMP-2, corresponding to a final concentration of 5.4 nm. For preparation of crude plasma membranes, the collagen gels were disrupted by mechanical shearing through a 10-ml syringe and subsequent incubation with bacterial collagenase D (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for approximately 10 min until no collagen fibers were visible in the solution. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 0.5 volume of fetal calf serum, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation (2,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). All subsequent steps for preparation of crude plasma membranes were carried out at 4 °C. After centrifugation the cells were resuspended in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 8.7% (w/v) sucrose and homogenized by Dounce homogenization. The solution was layered on top of a 38.5% (w/v) sucrose cushion and centrifuged in a swing-out rotor (100,000 × g, 1 h). The plasma membranes were collected from the interface and pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h). Plasma membranes were then resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mmCaCl2. The protein concentration was determined by a commercial protein assay (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) and adjusted to 2 mg/ml. For proMMP-2 activation experiments, 10 μg of crude plasma membranes were incubated with 20 μl of fibroblast conditioned medium containing proMMP-2 for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of either 0.3 μg of anti-MT1-MMP monospecific peptide antibodies (raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 160–173 of human MT1-MMP, clone 114-1F2; Fuji Chem., Toyama, Japan) or of 3.8 nmhuman recombinant TIMP-2 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Bad Soden, Germany). 15 μl of the samples was analyzed by gelatin zymography. Total RNA was isolated from melanoma cells grown for 48 h as monolayers or within collagen gels by direct lysis into guanidine thiocyanate followed by phenol-chloroform extraction (41Sudbeck B.D. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Pentland A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30022-30029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA were resolved by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany), and hybridized with the random-primed 32P-labeled cDNA probe for MT1-MMP (kindly provided by H. Sato, Kanazawa University, School of Medicine, Kanazawa, Japan). For Western blot analysis, crude plasma membrane preparations (30 to 60 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) in a semidry blotting chamber. After blockage of nonspecific binding sites with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0,5% Tween (v/v) blots were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-MT1-MMP monospecific peptide antibody (114-1F2; Fuji Chemical, Toyama, Japan) for 3 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Hamburg, Germany; final concentration 1:2,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantification of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 protein levels, conditioned media were combined with sonicated cells or collagen gels, subjected to enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay multiwell plates (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and measured following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, samples (100 μl) were incubated in multiwell plates precoated with specific antibodies against TIMP-1 or TIMP-2. Antigen-antibody complexes were measured after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-TIMP-1 and anti-TIMP-2 Fab fragment. Tetramethylbenzidine was used as a substrate to evaluate peroxidase activity. Serial dilutions of human recombinant TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were used as an internal standard. Conditioned media prepared from the melanoma cell lines MV3, BLM, IF6, and 530, grown as monolayers and within three-dimensional collagen lattices, were analyzed by gelatin zymography with respect to their production/activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In monolayer culture, all cell lines expressed variable amounts of latent MMP-2, whereas activated forms of this enzyme and MMP-9 were not detectable. When cultured in three-dimensional native type I collagen lattices, all melanoma cell lines showed an increase of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 secretion (Fig. 1). In addition, upon contact with collagen, the high metastatic melanoma cells MV3 and BLM gained the ability to activate proMMP-2 into its 62/59-kDa active forms, whereas the cells of low invasive potential, 530 and IF6, continued to show MMP-2 only as latent proenzyme. Since activation of proMMP-2 has been reported to occur by a plasma membrane dependent mechanism, we prepared membrane fractions from melanoma cells grown under both culture conditions. As shown in Fig.2, plasma membranes purified from the two high invasive melanoma cell lines grown in contact to collagen showed activation of exogenous proMMP-2 when plasma membranes were incubated with fibroblast-conditioned medium containing latent MMP-2. In contrast, no activation was obtained by membranes isolated either from the low invasive melanoma cells grown in collagen gels or by membranes purified from any of the melanoma cells cultured on plastic dishes (Fig. 2). MMP-2 is unique among the MMPs in that it is not activated by serine proteases such as plasmin (43Corcoran M.L. Hewitt R.E. Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The putative physiological activators of proMMP-2 are the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases, e.g. MT1-MMP (12Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar, 24Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the role of MT1-MMP for the activation of proMMP-2 in the high invasive melanoma cell lines, we analyzed MT1-MMP transcript levels in the melanoma cell lines under both culture conditions. All melanoma cells constitutively produced MT1-MMP mRNA in different amounts in monolayer cultures. Upon contact with collagen, a slight increase of the specific mRNA levels was observed with the high invasive melanoma cells (Fig. 3). In addition to MT1-MMP, MT2- and MT3-MMP have also been reportedin vitro to activate proMMP-2 (16Tanaka M. Sato H. Takino T. Iwata K. Inoue M. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Butler G.S. Will H. Atkinson S.J. Murphy G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas the substrate specificity of MT4-MMP is still unclear. We therefore analyzed mRNA levels for the different MT-MMPs in high and low invasive melanoma cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. All four MT-MMP mRNAs were detectable by RT-PCR in monolayer as well as collagen cultures. Semiquantitative analysis revealed a slight up-regulation of the transcripts for MT1-MMP in the high invasive melanoma cells cultured in collagen gels as already shown by Northern blot analysis. However, as compared with MT1-MMP, transcript levels for MT2-, MT3-, and MT4-MMP were low (data not shown). Western blot analysis of MT1-MMP in crude membrane preparations displayed a 63-kDa band corresponding to the unprocessed zymogen (44Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) in all melanoma cell lines grown as monolayers (Fig.4 A). When cells were grown within three-dimensional type I collagen lattices, high as well as low invasive cell lines showed an additional immunoreactive protein band of 60 kDa, corresponding to furin-activated MT1-MMP (42Vincent S. Marty L. Fort F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This indicates that both high and low invasive cells display activated MT1-MMP protein on their cell surface upon growth in contact with a collagen matrix, although the high invasive melanoma cells only showed activation of proMMP-2. Preincubation of the invasive melanoma cell line MV3 with increasing concentrations of the synthetic furin inhibitor CMK resulted in complete suppression of collagen-induced proMMP-2 activation (Fig.4 B), whereas the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin did not affect proMMP-2 activation. In addition, detection of MT1-MMP protein in membranes isolated from MV3 cells that were treated with 50 μm CMK for 24 h displayed a significant increase of the latent 63-kDa protein, whereas the amounts of 60-kDa protein were reduced. These data suggest that treatment with the furin inhibitor CMK results in an accumulation of the unprocessed membrane-bound MT1-MMP protein form, providing strong evidence that Golgi-associated furin is mainly responsible for proMT1-MMP processing in melanoma cells. Furthermore, preincubation of membranes with a monospecific MT1-MMP antibody resulted in a strong reduction of proMMP-2 activation (Fig.5). These observations support the theory that MT1-MMP plays a substantial role in proMMP-2 activation in melanoma cells. As shown above, membranes from high as well as low invasive melanoma cell lines contain activated MT1-MMP as components of their plasma membranes, but only the high invasive cells showed activation of proMMP-2 upon contact with fibrillar collagen. Since no difference in the activation of MT1-MMP was found between melanoma cells of high and low invasiveness, we asked whether variable secretion of TIMP-2 by the melanoma cells could account for the differences in proMMP-2 activation between the two cell types. Quantification of TIMP levels revealed that the non-invasive cell lines IF6 and 530 produced about 10-fold higher amounts of TIMP-2 under both culture conditions as compared with the high invasive BLM and MV3 cells (Fig. 6). Furthermore, upon contact with fibrillar type I collagen, both low invasive melanoma cell lines further increased their TIMP-2 production, whereas the high invasive BLM and MV3 cells showed a significant decrease of TIMP-2 secretion. In contrast, TIMP-1, which has been reported not to inhibit proMMP-2 activation (26Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), was detected in variable amounts in the different melanoma cell lines under both culture conditions, showing no correlation with the reported in vivo invasiveness of the cells (Fig. 6). Additional evidence for the role of TIMP-2 in regulating MT1-MMP-mediated activation of proMMP-2 in melanoma cells came from the finding that the activation process was also inhibited in the presence of 3.8 nm human recombinant TIMP-2 (Fig. 5) or medium conditioned by the low invasive IF6 cells (data not shown). This observation is in accordance with reports showing that an excess of TIMP-2 inhibits proMMP-2 activation by blocking the activity of MT1-MMP (6Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M.

https://openalex.org/W2038506328,"We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding a human α1,2-mannosidase that catalyzes the first mannose trimming step in the processing of mammalian Asn-linked oligosaccharides. This enzyme has been proposed to regulate the timing of quality control glycoprotein degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. Human expressed sequence tag clones were identified by sequence similarity to mammalian and yeast oligosaccharide-processing mannosidases, and the full-length coding region of the putative mannosidase homolog was isolated by a combination of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and direct polymerase chain reaction from human placental cDNA. The open reading frame predicted a 663-amino acid type II transmembrane polypeptide with a short cytoplasmic tail (47 amino acids), a single transmembrane domain (22 amino acids), and a large COOH-terminal catalytic domain (594 amino acids). Northern blots detected a transcript of ∼2.8 kilobase pairs that was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Expression of an epitope-tagged full-length form of the human mannosidase homolog in normal rat kidney cells resulted in an ER pattern of localization. When a recombinant protein, consisting of protein A fused to the COOH-terminal luminal domain of the human mannosidase homolog, was expressed in COS cells, the fusion protein was found to cleave only a single α1,2-mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc2 to produce a unique Man8GlcNAc2 isomer (Man8B). The mannose cleavage reaction required divalent cations as indicated by inhibition with EDTA or EGTA and reversal of the inhibition by the addition of Ca2+. The enzyme was also sensitive to inhibition by deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine, but not swainsonine. The results on the localization, substrate specificity, and inhibitor profiles indicate that the cDNA reported here encodes an enzyme previously designated ER mannosidase I. Enzyme reactions using a combination of human ER mannosidase I and recombinant Golgi mannosidase IA indicated that that these two enzymes are complementary in their cleavage of Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides to Man5GlcNAc2.

The maturation of Asn-linked oligosaccharides in mammalian cells is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; dMNJ, 1-deoxymannojirimycin; pNP-α-Man, p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannoside; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; EST, expressed sequence tag; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s); NRK, normal rat kidney; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ORF, open reading frame; PA, pyridylamine through the cleavage of three glucose residues and as many as two mannose residues soon after the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide is transferred to the nascent polypeptide chain (1Kornfeld R.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). For glycoproteins that are destined for secretion or transport to other intracellular compartments, additional mannose trimming occurs in the Golgi complex through the action of members of a multigene family of mannosidases that remove the remaining α1,2-mannose residues to yield a Man5GlcNAc2 structure (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Further maturation by the action of GlcNAc transferase I, Golgi mannosidase II, the collection of branching GlcNAc transferases, and additional glycosyltransferases results in the array of complex oligosaccharides that are found on cellular and secreted glycoproteins (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). The initial stages of mannose trimming in the ER were originally examined by the metabolic radiolabeling of oligosaccharides on newly synthesized glycoproteins in the presence of mannosidase processing inhibitors or ionophores, such as carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, that blocked the transport of proteins from the ER (3Bischoff J.

The oligosaccharide structures were then examined on glycoproteins that were either secreted from the cell or retained within the ER either as ER-resident proteins or as a result of the carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone blockade. These studies revealed the presence of two processing mannosidase activities in the ER. The first activity, termed ER mannosidase I (12Weng S. Spiro R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was originally identified by the partial accumulation of oligosaccharides containing a unique Man8GlcNAc2 isomer structure (Man8B; Fig. 1) in mammalian cells in the presence of low concentrations of dMNJ (5Bischoff J. Liscum L. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent in vitro assays using ER membrane preparations identified a catalytic activity that could generate the Man8B structure from Man9GlcNAc2, and this activity was shown to be sensitive to inhibition by dMNJ, kifunensine, and EDTA but not swainsonine or 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-mannitol (12Weng S.

In contrast to ER α-mannosidase I, a second ER-resident α-mannosidase activity, termed ER mannosidase II, has been identified in mammalian cells and has been shown to cleave Man9GlcNAc2 to a distinct Man8GlcNAc2 isomer (Man8C; Fig.1) and potentially smaller structures (12Weng S. Spiro R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Weng S. Spiro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25656-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was sensitive to inhibition by dMNJ and 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-mannitol and to partial inhibition by swainsonine but not kifunensine or EDTA. An α-mannosidase activity that is immunologically and biochemically related to ER mannosidase II has also been found in the cytosol (12Weng S. Spiro R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Bischoff J. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4758-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the cytosolic form of the enzyme was considerably larger (27Bischoff J. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4758-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bischoff J. Moremen K. Lodish H. J. Biol.

The similarity in characteristics between the ER and cytosolic forms of the enzyme has led to the hypothesis that ER α-mannosidase II was derived from a post-translational translocation of the cytosolic form by a process that involves a proteolytic cleavage event (12Weng S. Spiro R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A potential role for ER mannosidase I in the quality control degradation of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER has been recently reported in both S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells. InS. cerevisiae, the formation of the Man8B product of the ER processing mannosidase was shown to be essential for the rapid degradation of a misfolded form of carboxypeptidase Y in the ER (30Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar,31Knop M. Hauser N. Wolf D.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Expression of mutant carboxypeptidase Y under conditions that blocked the formation of the isomer B structure, either through gene disruptions in the processing α-glucosidases or the ER processing mannosidase or through defects in the synthesis of the lipid linked precursor structure, led to an accumulation of the misfolded protein in the ER. A role for an ER processing mannosidase has also been described in mammalian cells by an examination of the degradation of a misfolded variant form of α1-antitrypsin (32Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and the T cell receptor subunit CD3-δ (33Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The turnover of these glycoproteins in the ER is accomplished by translocation into the cytoplasm and proteolysis by the cytosolic proteosome. Treatment of the cells with dMNJ blocked the quality control degradation of these proteins, indicating a requirement for a dMNJ-sensitive ER mannosidase prior to proteolysis. Treatment of cells with kifunensine, a selective inhibitor of ER mannosidase I but not ER mannosidase II, also blocked degradation of α1-antitrypsin, implicating ER mannosidase I in targeting proteins for degradation (32Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In an effort to further characterize the mammalian form of ER mannosidase I and examine its role in oligosaccharide maturation and glycoprotein quality control degradation, we have isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding a homolog of the processing mannosidases from a human cDNA library. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide with striking similarity to the S. cerevisiae ER processing mannosidase and members of the multigene family of mammalian Golgi processing mannosidases (Class I mannosidases (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), also known as the Swiss-Prot glycosylhydrolase family 47 (34Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 35Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, 36Henrissat B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)). A recombinant form of the enzyme was shown to cleave only a single mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc2 to form Man8B, and it displayed the anticipated response to inhibitors that would be predicted for ER mannosidase I, based on in vitroassays of the enzyme from membrane extracts from mammalian tissues (12Weng S. Spiro R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of an epitope-tagged form of the enzyme into normal rat kidney (NRK) cells resulted in a co-localization with ER-resident proteins. Northern blots indicated that transcripts encoding the enzyme were ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. These data indicate that the cDNA encodes human ER mannosidase I and will provide the basis for further studies on the localization of the enzyme and the role of the enzyme in glycoprotein maturation and catabolism.

COS-7 and NRK cells were from ATCC (Rockville, MD). All other reagents were at least reagent grade and obtained from standard suppliers. DNA sequences were determined using Taq polymerase in the dideoxy dye terminator reaction (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar) and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA Sequencer (Molecular Genetic Facility, University of Georgia) following the standard protocol as described by the manufacturer. Primers for PCR and DNA sequencing were synthesized by the Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility, University of Georgia. The human EST data bank was searched using World Wide Web-based BLAST search engines (National Center for Biotechnology Information), while the S. cerevisiae andCaenorhabditis elegans data banks were searched using their respective search engines. 2The search engines for the S. cerevisiae and C. elegans data banks can be found on the World Wide Web. ESTs were purchased from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using Pileup and Boxshade subroutines from the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the ClustalW 1.6 program (38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Research. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of the cDNA encoding the human mannosidase homolog was isolated by two consecutive rounds of 5′-RACE (39Frohman M. Dush M. Martin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). The template for the 5′-RACE reaction was a cDNA preparation from human placenta containing ligation-anchored oligonucleotide termini (39Frohman M. Dush M. Martin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar, 40Edwards J. Delort J. Mallet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5227-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) (Marathon Ready cDNA, CLONTECH), and the primers for the first round of 5′-RACE were a pair of EST-specific nested primers designed based on the 5′-end sequence of the human EST R55729. Two rounds of PCR were performed for each round of 5′-RACE. The first amplification employed 5 μg of ligation-anchored cDNA and a gene-specific primer corresponding to the complement of the sequence at base pair positions 1066–1102 (Fig. 3). This gene-specific primer was matched with the adaptor primer complementary to the ligation-anchored adaptor (primer AP-1; CLONTECH). The primary amplification conditions employed primers at a concentration of 2.5 mm in a reaction containing components of the Expand Long PCR Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) essentially as described by the manufacturer, in a thermal cycler programmed for a preincubation at 94 °C, (1 min) followed by a temperature step cycle of 94 °C (30 s) and 68 °C (4 min) for 30 cycles. The product of the first round of PCR was diluted 1:50 in water, and 1 μl was used in a secondary round of PCR using a nested adaptor primer (AP-2,CLONTECH) and a nested EST-specific primer corresponding to the complement of the sequence at base pair positions 1007–1043 (Fig. 3). The conditions for the secondary round of PCR were identical to the first round. The resulting 613-bp 5′-RACE product was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified from the gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA), subcloned into the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Comparison with the S. cerevisiae ER processing mannosidase and C. elegans putative open reading frames CELT03G11.4 and ZC410.3 indicated that the full 5′-end of the cDNA had not yet been obtained. Therefore, a second round of 5′-RACE was performed using an antisense cDNA-specific primer pair corresponding to positions 502–532 and 483–512 (Fig. 3), matched with the AP-1 and AP-2 adaptor primers in amplifications as described above. A 610-bp amplimer was obtained containing a 5′ sequence that indicated that the complete coding region had been obtained. To confirm that the 5′-end of the cDNA was complete, a third round of 5′-RACE was performed using an antisense cDNA-specific primer pair corresponding to positions 10–40 and 1–30 (Fig. 3) matched with the AP-1 and AP-2 primers as described above. The 5′-end of the amplimer that was obtained was identical to the product of the second round 5′-RACE reaction, indicating that the full-length cDNA had been obtained. To generate a construct that encompassed the catalytic domain of the human mannosidase homolog, the human placenta cDNA source described above was used as a template in a nested pair of PCRs. The first PCR contained cDNA-specific primers corresponding to base pair positions 532–565 matched with a primer complementary to the sequence at base pair position 2000–2033 (Fig. 3) using conditions for PCR as described above. The product of the first round of PCR was diluted 1:50 in water, and 1 μl was used in a secondary round of PCR using cDNA-specific primers corresponding to positions 541–572 matched with the complement of the sequence at base pair positions 1984–2017 (Fig. 3). The resulting 1476-bp amplimer was subcloned into the pCR II cloning vector and sequenced to confirm that no errors were introduced into the sequence as a result of the PCR. The insert was then subcloned in frame into the EcoRI site in the pPROTA fusion vector (41Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate a fusion protein construct with the NH2-terminal end corresponding to protein A and the COOH-terminal end corresponding to the human mannosidase homolog (pPROTA-ERManI). To generate a construct encoding the full-length human mannosidase homolog, a nested pair of PCRs was used to generate a 907-bp PCR amplimer containing the front end of the coding region from the human placenta cDNA source as described above. The cDNA-specific primer pairs for the first round of PCR corresponded to positions −93 to −63 paired with the complement of the sequence at base pair positions 927–957 (Fig. 3). The second round of PCR employed a cDNA-specific primer pair corresponding to base pair positions −71 to −41 paired with the complement of the sequence at base pair positions 805–836 (Fig. 3). The amplimer fragment was isolated, subcloned, and sequenced to confirm that no errors were introduced into the cDNA sequence as a result of the PCR. To generate the full-length construct in the pCR II vector, the 907-bp amplimer corresponding to the front end of the coding region was excised from pCR II by digestion with NsiI, which cleaves in the vector polylinker and in the insert at a unique site corresponding to base pair position 668 (Fig. 3). The pCR II vector containing the 1476-bp amplimer corresponding to the back end of the coding region was digested with NsiI, and the small NsiI fragment that was excised was replaced with the NsiI fragment from the front end of the coding region to result in a construct containing the full-length coding region corresponding to base pair positions −71 to 2017. The insert from this construct was excised by digestion withEcoRI and subcloned into the vector, pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen), that had been isolated following digestion with the same enzyme. To generate an in-frame fusion with the vector-encoded COOH-terminal Myc epitope tag, the human mannosidase homolog in the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector was altered by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers to positions 1971–2009 to change the stop codon, UAG, to a Lys codon, AAG. The resulting construct (ERManI/pcDNA3.1 Myc-His) encodes a polypeptide containing an extra 50 amino acids added to the COOH-terminal end of the coding region including the vector-encoded Myc epitope sequence and a His6 peptide. The fusion protein of the human mannosidase homolog linked to protein A was expressed by transient transfection of the pPROTA-ERManI plasmid in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal medium supplemented with 0.1 μg/ml penicillin, 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM/10% FCS) to 60% confluence in T-175 flasks and transfected with a mixture of 50 μg of pPROTA-ERManI and 150 μl of Dosper liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 6 h at 37 °C. Following this incubation, the transfection medium was removed, and the cultures were maintained in fresh DMEM/10% FCS and grown at 37 °C for 36 h. The growth medium was collected, 160 μl of a 50% suspension of IgG-Sepharose beads were added per 10 ml of culture medium, and the suspension was incubated at 4 °C overnight with constant shaking. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 1700 × g for 15 min, washed three times by resuspension and centrifugation in 15 ml of PBS, and used directly in enzyme assays. Oligosaccharide substrates were obtained, and enzyme assays were performed essentially as described previously (42Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10–20 μl of the washed IgG-Sepharose bead suspension with bound fusion protein was used in a total assay volume of 50 μl containing 100 mm MES (pH 7.0) and pyridylamine-tagged Man9GlcNAc2 as the oligosaccharide substrate. Incubations with added cations contained the indicated concentrations of chloride (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ba2+, Ho3+, Yb3+) or sulfate (Cu2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Zn2+) salts. The assays were incubated for 20–30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Beads were removed by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter (Millex GV4, Millipore) and adjusted to 70% acetonitrile prior to chromatography on a Hypersil APS-2 NH2 HPLC column (43Liao Y.-F. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28348-28358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Man8GlcNAc2-PA oligosaccharides isolated on the NH2 HPLC column were resolved into isomers by chromatography on a Cosmosil C18 column (42Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant murine Golgi mannosidase IA expressed in Pichia pastoris and the Man8GlcNAc2-PA isomer standards for the C18 column were described previously (42Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays using the disaccharide substrate, Manα1,2Manα-O-CH3, were performed in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), using 2 mm substrate (42Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Assays using thep-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (pNP-α-Man) substrate were performed as described previously (43Liao Y.-F. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28348-28358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with the exception that the buffer was 100 mm MES (pH 7.0). Northern blots containing poly(A+) RNA from various human tissues were purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories. The blots were prehybridized, hybridized, and washed as described (44Moremen K.W. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using a 900-bpHindIII–PstI restriction fragment from the mannosidase homolog coding region as a radiolabeled probe. The blots were subsequently hybridized with a radiolabeled human β-actin control probe (CLONTECH) to act as an RNA load control for the blots. 32P-Labeled DNA probes were generated using [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the Ready-To-Go labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) after a 1-day exposure. NRK cells were grown on eight-well chamber slides or 100-mm dishes containing 10 mm Hepes-buffered DMEM/5% FCS. For stable expression, NRK cells were grown to 60% confluency on a 100-mm culture dish and transfected with a mixture of ERManI/pcDNA3.1 Myc-His (20 μg) and DOSPER liposomal transfection reagent (100 μg; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in fresh DMEM/5% FCS for 18 h at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced, and cultures were grown for an additional 24 h followed by selection with 800 μg/ml G418 sulfate.

https://openalex.org/W2085663173,"Calcium is a universal intracellular signaling molecule. Through variations in both the amplitude and frequency of intracellular calcium increases, the same calcium ion can elicit different responses. In this report, we investigated the effect of a calcium transient, lasting 2–5 min, on alterations in the phosphorylation state of the cytoskeletal protein, tau. Transient increases in calcium result in a prolonged (1–4 h) ∼60% increase in tau phosphorylation at the Tau-1 epitope. These increases in tau phosphorylation appear to be more dependent upon the duration of the increase in intracellular calcium and less on the amplitude. The calcium-induced increases in tau phosphorylation are not dependent upon protein synthesis, nor are protein kinase C or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II involved in the response. However, the calcium-induced increase in tau phosphorylation was inhibited by lithium, a noncompetitive inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Furthermore, transient increases in calcium resulted in a prolonged increase in GSK-3β tyrosine phosphorylation concomitant with the increase in tau phosphorylation. Therefore, this study is the first to indicate that transient increases in intracellular calcium result in increased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of GSK-3β which subsequently results in a sustained increase in the phosphorylation state of tau.

Therefore, this study is the first to indicate that transient increases in intracellular calcium result in increased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of GSK-3β which subsequently results in a sustained increase in the phosphorylation state of tau. Calcium is an important intracellular messenger for neuronal signaling pathways. Cytoplasmic calcium concentrations fluctuate when extracellular calcium enters the cell and/or when calcium is released from intracellular stores, and both temporal and spatial aspects of the calcium signal are important in regulating cellular responses (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). The regulation of specific protein kinases and phosphatases by different calcium signals is likely to play a role in numerous physiological and pathological processes. For example, recent studies have demonstrated that increases in intracellular calcium differentially altered phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein, MAP-2, in neonatal and adult rat hippocampal slices (3Quinlan E.M. Halpain S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7627-7637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that mature and immature neurons respond differently to calcium signals and this in turn results in specific phospho-dependent changes in the cytoskeleton. Considering these previous findings, it is likely that the phosphorylation and function of other cytoskeletal proteins are modulated by specific calcium signals. Tau, a family of microtubule-associated proteins produced by alternative splicing of a single gene, is a prominent phosphoprotein of the neuronal cytoskeleton. The classical function of tau is to promote microtubule nucleation and assembly, as well as to stabilize microtubules (for review, see Ref. 4Johnson G.V.W. Jenkins S.M. Alzheimer's Disease Rev. 1996; 1: 38-54Google Scholar). However, tau also appears to be involved in other cellular functions, including signal transduction (5Hwang S.C. Jhon D.Y. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 777-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that increasing the phosphorylation state of tau greatly reduces its ability to bind to and stabilize microtubules (10Jameson L. Frey T. Zeeberg B. Dalldorf F. Caplow M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 11Lindwall G. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5301-5305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bramblett G.T.

Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that the phosphorylation state of tau will modulate tau's ability to perform its more novel roles as well. Furthermore, it is the phosphorylation of specific sites, rather than overall extent of phosphorylation, that is apparently most important in regulating the microtubule binding and stabilizing functions of tau. For example, phosphorylation of tau at just one or two sites within the microtubule-binding region significantly inhibits microtubule binding (14Drewes G. Trinczek B. Illenberger S. Biernat J.

Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1887-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Numerous protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate tauin vitro (for reviews, see Refs. 4Johnson G.V.W. Jenkins S.M. Alzheimer's Disease Rev. 1996; 1: 38-54Google Scholar and 16Johnson G.V.W. Hartigan J.A. Alzheimer's Disease Rev. 1998; 3: 125-141Google Scholar), however, only a few of these kinases have been shown to phosphorylate tau in situ, and little is known about the signaling processes that activate these protein kinases and subsequently the phosphorylation of tau. Since changes in the phosphorylation state of tau directly affect the function of the protein, it is important to understand the regulation of tau phosphorylation by calcium-dependent processes. Alterations in intracellular calcium concentrations are clearly involved in modulating the phosphorylation state of tau in situ. However, results have been decidedly mixed, and there is little consensus as to the specific effects of elevating intracellular calcium levels on tau phosphorylation. For example, acute treatment of primary neuronal cultures with calcium ionophores has been reported to both increase (17Mattson M.P. Engle M.G. Rychlik B. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1991; 15: 117-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J.

Brain Res. 1997; 757: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) tau phosphorylation. The same mixed results have been found using human neuroblastoma cell lines, as ionophore treatment resulted in both increases (20Shea T.B. Prabhakar S. Ekinci F.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and decreases (21Xie H.Q. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurosci.

Increasing intracellular calcium by activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors has been shown to result in the dephosphorylation of tau in rat brain slices (22Fleming L.M. Johnson G.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and cortical neuronal cultures (19Adamec E. Mercken M. Beermann M.L. Didier M. Nixon R.A. Brain Res. 1997; 757: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is clear that further studies are required to elucidate the role of calcium in modulating tau phosphorylation, as well as the specific protein kinases and phosphatases involved in this process. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between specific temporal changes in intracellular calcium concentrations and alterations in the phosphorylation state of tau. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that transient increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ranging in duration from 2 to 5 min result in prolonged increases in tau phosphorylation (2–4 h), which are not dependent on protein synthesis. Additionally, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) 1The abbreviations used are: GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium, PYK2, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 21The abbreviations used are: GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium, PYK2, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 or tyrosine kinases blocks the calcium-induced increase in tau phosphorylation. Finally, our data indicates that in response to transient increases in intracellular calcium, the tyrosine phosphorylation state of GSK-3β is increased, which has been shown to result in increased activity (23Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). This finding is especially interesting as GSK-3β has not been previously reported to be activated in response to elevations in intracellular calcium levels. This study clearly demonstrates that a brief, modest increase in intracellular calcium levels results in a prolonged increase in the phosphorylation of a prominent neuronal cytoskeletal protein and hence is likely to have long term effects on cellular structure and function. Several phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent tau antibodies were used to probe tau and examine its phosphorylation state. Tau-5 (from Dr. L. Binder) recognizes tau epitopes independent of their phosphorylation state (24Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol.

The monoclonal GSK-3β antibody, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20H were purchased from Transduction Labs. The polyclonal tau antibody was from DAKO. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Protein A- and protein G-Sepharose beads, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, A23187, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. 4-Bromo-A23187, KN-62, and KN-93 were purchased from BioMol. Cell culture media and other reagents were obtained either from Life Technologies, Inc. or Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)(Sigma), and the final concentration of Me2SO during drug treatments was maintained at 0.2% or less. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were maintained on Corning dishes in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal clone II (HyClone), 1% penicillin G, 1% streptomycin, and 20 mml-glutamine. Cells were used in an experiment when 70–80% confluent. Prior to treatment, cells were transferred to serum-free media supplemented with antibiotics and 20 mml-glutamine. Cells were then treated with A23187, a selective calcium ionophore, or other drugs as indicated, and returned to the incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for the indicated amount of time. Control cells received the Me2SO alone. To down-regulate protein kinase C, cells were treated with 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h in serum-containing media prior to transfer to serum-free media and treatment with A23187. For the transient experiment, 1.8 μm A23187 was added to the cells for 2 min, after which the media containing the drug was removed, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fresh serum-free media was added and the cells placed back in the incubator for the indicated amount of time. Controls were treated similarly with vehicle alone. Cells were collected in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, and a 10 μg/ml concentration each of aprotonin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Lysates were sonicated on ice, centrifuged, and protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). The homogenates were diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 2× reducing stop buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mmdithiothreitol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol, with bromphenol blue as the tracking dye). Equal amounts of protein from each sample were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the indicated antibodies. After incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the blots were developed using ECL (Amersham). Densitometric analysis was used to quantitate the blots. Intracellular calcium levels were measured using the Fura-2 technique with ratiometric measurements as described previously (32Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were reseeded onto coverslips coated with 5 μg/ml poly-d-lysine 2 days prior to experimentation. On the day of the experiment, cells were incubated with calcium-sensitive Fura-2 AM (10 μm) (Teflabs) for 30 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were then placed in a heated microchamber, and maintained at 35 °C in RPMI 1640 media without phenol red (ICN), supplemented with antibiotics and 20 mml-glutamine. Ratiometric measurements were performed with a Xenon light source and an intensifying CCD camera with IonWizard software (Ionoptix, Inc., Milton, MA). 4-Bromo-A23187, a non-fluorescent analog of the ionophore, was used for all studies. Cells were placed in RPMI 1640 phosphate-free (P-free) media (ICN), supplemented with antibiotics and 20 mml-glutamine, for 30 min, prior to the addition of 0.5 mCi/ml 32Pi(carrier-free, ICN) and prelabeled for 2 h before treatment with 0.15 μm A23187. For the transient experiment, the cells were placed in P-free media for 30 min, 1.8 μm A23187 was added for 2 min, after which the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and changed to fresh P-free media, to which32Pi was then added. After the indicated amount of time, the cells were collected in lysis buffer containing appropriate protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were boiled for 10 min, centrifuged, and the supernatant collected. A polyclonal tau antibody (34 μg) was added to each sample, and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Fifty microliters of washed protein A-Sepharose beads were added to each sample and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and resuspended in 2× reducing stop buffer. The samples were boiled for 15 min and the supernatants electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the monoclonal tau antibody, Tau-5. The blots were developed using diaminobenzidine, to assess total tau in each sample. The blots were then exposed to x-ray film, to assess the amount of radioactivity in each sample. GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated from 300 μg of protein using a monoclonal GSK-3β antibody (1.5 μg), and the immune complex was captured with protein G-Sepharose beads. The precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the complex was removed from the beads by adding 35 μl of 2× reducing stop buffer and boiling for 15 min. The supernatant was electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, RC20H (used at 1:2500 in 1% bovine serum albumin in borate saline). After being developed by ECL, the blot was stripped by incubating in a stripping buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min. The blot was then washed, blocked in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 for 1 h, and re-probed with the monoclonal GSK-3β antibody to determine the protein levels that were immunoprecipitated. To determine the effects of modest increases in intracellular calcium on tau phosphorylation, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 0.15 μm A23187 and collected at various times after the addition of ionophore. The samples were subsequently immunoblotted with Tau-5 antibody, which recognizes total tau, and Tau-1 antibody which recognizes tau only when it isdephosphorylated at residues 189–207. The representative immunoblots in Fig. 1 Ademonstrate that Tau-1 immunoreactivity was decreased by 0.5 h after addition of 0.15 μm A23187 and remained decreased for up to 4 h, indicating an increase in phosphorylation at this epitope. Therefore, tau phosphorylation is increased in response to 0.15 μm A23187 by 0.5 h and remains elevated for up to 4 h. The A23187-induced increase in phosphorylation at the Tau-1 epitope remained elevated for up to 8 h, but by 24 h had returned to normal (data not shown). The data from three independent experiments were quantitated and the Tau-1 immunoreactivity in each sample normalized to the amount of total tau as measured by Tau-5 immunoreactivity. The data were then presented as the relative increase in phosphorylation at the Tau-1 epitope in response to treatment with 0.15 μm A23187 (Fig. 1 B). These data demonstrate that there is a significant, consistent ∼60% increase in tau phosphorylation at the Tau-1 epitope after treating with the low concentration of A23187 for 1 and 2 h. To analyze the selectivity of the calcium-induced increase in tau phosphorylation by a low concentration of A23187, samples were probed with a number of phosphorylation dependent tau antibodies. Treatment with the ionophore resulted in an increase in AT8 immunoreactivity. AT8 recognizes phosphorylated Ser202/Thr205. This piece of data is consistent with the Tau-1 data, since the AT8 epitope is found within the Tau-1 epitope. However, no differences were found between cells treated with 0.15 μm A23187 and those treated with Me2SO at the PHF-1 (phosphorylated Ser396/Ser404), 12E8 (phosphorylated Ser262 and/or Ser356) (Fig.2), AT270 (phosphorylated Thr181), or AT180 (phosphorylated Thr231/Ser235) (data not shown) sites. These data indicate that the increase in tau phosphorylation in response to treatment with a low concentration of ionophore is site selective. To further elucidate the effect of A23187 on tau phosphorylation, the effects of increasing concentrations of A23187 on tau phosphorylation was examined. Cells were treated for 1 h with Me2SO alone, or increasing concentrations of A23187 up to 1.8 μm and then immunoblotted with Tau-5 and Tau-1. These results indicate that tau phosphorylation is increased in response to low concentrations of ionophore, but decreased at high concentrations (Fig. 3). The finding that tau is dephosphorylated in response to higher concentrations of ionophore is consistent with previous reports (19Adamec E. Mercken M. Beermann M.L. Didier M. Nixon R.A. Brain Res. 1997; 757: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Xie H.Q. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because tau is phosphorylated in response to chronic treatment with a low concentration of A23187, but dephosphorylated when the cells were treated chronically with higher concentrations of A23187, cells were treated acutely with a high concentration of the ionophore. In this paradigm, cells were treated with 1.8 μm A23187 or Me2SO for 2 min, and then returned to drug-free media. It was found that tau phosphorylation increased 0.5 h after a transient treatment with 1.8 μm A23187 for 2 min at the Tau-1 and AT8 epitopes. No change was observed at the PHF-1 epitope (Fig. 4). This increase in tau phosphorylation was also observed 4 h after the transient ionophore treatment (data not shown). These results indicate that a transient treatment with the high concentration of ionophore mimics the effect of chronic treatment with the low concentration of calcium ionophore. That is, tau phosphorylation is increased in a site selective manner in both paradigms. 4-Bromo-A23187, a non-fluorescent analog of A23187, was used for the calcium imaging experiments, and on the basis of immunoblot analyses elicited the same effects on tau phosphorylation as unmodified A23187 (data not shown). Fig.5 shows typical intracellular calcium profiles of cells treated chronically with 0.15 μm (Fig.5 A), 1.8 μm (Fig. 5 B), or transiently with 1.8 μm 4-bromo-A23187 (Fig.5 C). For each condition, a 100-s baseline was recorded, followed by the addition of the drug (denoted by the arrow). Although Fig. 5 only shows recordings out to 600 s, initial experiments were carried out to 20 min (data not shown). Because no differences were detected after 600 s with the low concentration or transient treatment with A23187, and the cells treated chronically with 1.8 μm started to become non-adherent at longer time points, further imaging paradigms were not extended beyond this time point. Treatment with 0.15 μm 4-bromo-A23187 resulted in a rapid, but modest, increase in intracellular calcium from a baseline of ∼50 to ∼75 nm. However, after approximately 300 s intracellular calcium levels returned to baseline, even though the drug remained on the cells (Fig. 5 A). (Note: the different line characteristics seen in Fig. 5 is a result of a change in recording speed from 1 record every 0.5 s for the first 400 s, to a speed of 1 record every 10 s thereafter.) Treatment with 1.8 μm 4-bromo-A23187 also produced a rapid increase in intracellular calcium. However, calcium concentrations never returned to baseline, and after ∼200 s continued to rise steadily during the remainder of the experiment (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, transient treatment with 1.8 μm 4-bromo-A23187 for 2 min results in an intracellular calcium profile that was similar to chronic treatment with the low concentration in terms of temporal aspects. In Fig. 5 C, the simple line arrow indicates where the drug was removed. The treatment results in a rapid increase in intracellular calcium. However, approximately 2 min after the drug is removed, the calcium levels return to baseline. This finding is particularly interesting because it demonstrates that transient increases in intracellular calcium, lasting 2–5 min, result in prolonged tau phosphorylation, that is not evident until 0.5 h after treatment, and remains elevated for at least 4 h. 32Pi labeling of the cells was carried out to further evaluate the increase in tau phosphorylation seen in response to transient increases in intracellular calcium concentrations. Typical results from the32Pi experiments are shown in Fig.6. These data indicate that chronic treatment with the low concentration of ionophore (Fig. 6 A) or transient treatment with the high concentration (Fig. 6 B) both result in an overall increase in tau [32P]phosphorylation. Autoradiographs were quantitated and the 32P incorporated into tau was normalized to the total amount of tau in the samples as determined from the Tau-5 blots. These results revealed a significant 43.7 ± 3% (n = 3) increase in tau phosphorylation in response to transient increases in calcium. Because a transient increase in intracellular calcium lasting only a few minutes elicited an increase in tau phosphorylation that was evident hours later, the possible involvement of protein synthesis was evaluated. Cells were pretreated for 15 min with 60 μmcycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, then 0.15 μm A23187 was added for an additional 2 h. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not prevent the increase in tau phosphorylation elicited by treatment with the ionophore (Fig.7). Because the increase in tau phosphorylation occurred in response to a transient increase in intracellular calcium, the possible involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and/or protein kinase C was evaluated. Treatment of cells with 30 μm KN-62 or KN-93, selective Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitors (33Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol.

These data indicate that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or protein kinase C are not involved in the calcium-induced increase in tau phosphorylation. The Tau-1 and AT8 epitopes are phosphorylated by GSK-3β in vitro and in situ (35Hong M. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19547-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 36Lesort M. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of inhibition of GSK-3β on the calcium-induced increase in tau phosphorylation was examined. Lithium has been shown to be an uncompetitive, selective inhibitor of GSK-3β (37Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar, 38Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells overnight with 10 mm lithium chloride resulted in the elimination of the increase in tau phosphorylation in response to the low dose of A23187 (Fig.8). These data strongly support a role for GSK-3β in the calcium-mediated increase in tau phosphorylation. To further analyze the role of GSK-3β in the calcium-mediated increase in tau phosphorylation, the effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein were examined because GSK-3β is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (23Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with 100 μm genistein for 10 min, then treated with 0.15 μm A23187 for 1 h. Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor completely blocked the increase in tau phosphorylation in response to A23187 (data not shown). These data indicate that the calcium-mediated increase in tau phosphorylation is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation and further point to GSK-3β as a possible candidate. Previous studies have shown that there are tyrosine kinases that are selectively activated by increases in intracellular calcium (39Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R."

Both in mammalian cells and in budding yeast, Ku plays a role in nonhomologous end joining in the double strand break repair pathway. However, Ku has a more significant role in DNA repair in mammalian cells compared with yeast, in which a homology-dependent pathway is the predominant one. Recently Ku has been shown to be a likely component of the telomeric complex in yeast, suggesting the possibility of a similar role for Ku at mammalian telomeres. However, long single-stranded G-rich overhangs are continuously present at mammalian but not at yeast telomeres. These overhangs have the potential to fold in vitro into G-G base-paired conformations, such as G-quartets, that might prevent Ku from recognizing telomeric ends and thus offer a mechanism to sequester the telomere from the prevalent double strand break repair pathway in mammals. We show here that Ku binds to mammalian telomeric DNA ends in vitro and that G-quartet conformations are unable to prevent Ku from binding with high affinity to the DNA.

Recently, homologs to both Ku70 and Ku80 have been identified in budding yeast (HDF1/YKU70 and HDF2/YKU80, respectively) (18Feldmann H. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12895-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Feldmann H. Driller L. Meier B. Mages G. Kellermann J. Winnacker E.L. J. Biol.

In this organism, contrary to mammalian cells, a RAD52-dependent homologous recombination pathway is responsible for the majority of the DSB repair events (21Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). However, as revealed by experiments performed in a rad52 background, yeast also possesses a DNA repair pathway that is HDF1/HDF2-dependent and involves joining of nonhomologous ends (22Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 23Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K.B. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell.

Ikeda H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in repair, HDF1 and HDF2 play a role at telomeres. Telomeres are the terminal chromosomal elements (27$$Google Scholar) and are composed of simple tandem repeats, generally bearing short runs of guanines in the strand that runs with 5′-3′ polarity toward the tip of the chromosome (e.g. 5′-TTAGGG-3′ in vertebrates). Telomeres carry out at least two primary functions. First, through the action of the telomerase enzyme, they circumvent the replicative problem of linear DNA ends (28Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Second, they protect the ends of the chromosome from being treated as broken ends by the DSB repair pathway (29Muller H.J. Collecting Net—Woods Hole. 1938; 13: 181-195Google Scholar, 30McClintock B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1942; 28: 458-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sandell L. Zakian V.

Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Both hdf1−and hdf2−cells are partially defective in telomere maintenance, with telomeres in mutant cells shrinking to about 70% of their normal length (20Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 33Porter S.E. Greenwell P.W. Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D.

Biol. 1998; 8: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hdf1p/Hdf2p may be an integral component of the yeast telomeric complex. First, HDF1 and HDF2 affect telomere position effect, a phenomenon in which genes located near telomeres are transcriptionally repressed. Telomere position effect in yeast telomeres is dependent on a multiprotein complex that includes Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p (for review, see Ref. 35Grunstein M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Loss of HDF1 or HDF2 has a dramatic effect on telomere position effect, equivalent to impairment of SIR2, SIR3, or SIR4 (34Nugent C.I. Bosco G. Ross L.O. Evans S.K. Salinger A.P. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Lundblad V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Second, although the nuclear localization of yeast Ku has not been determined directly, in HDF1− cells, the subnuclear localization of telomeres appears to be altered (37Laroche T. Martin S.G. Gotta M. Gorham H.C. Pryde F.E. Louis E.J. Gasser S.M. Curr Biol. 1998; 8: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, cross-linking studies indicate that Hdf2p is bound to telomeric DNA in vivo, and hdf2− cells experience strand-specific loss of telomeric DNA (38Gravel S. Larrivee M. Labrecque P. Wellinger R.J. Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). How Ku in yeast reconciles its dual role as a telomere end factor and as a DSB repair protein remains to be determined. The DNA binding activity of Ku suggests that the protein may bind directly to telomeric DNA. However, because of the interaction of Hdf1p with Sir4p in yeast two-hybrid assays (39Tsukamoto Y. Kato J. Ikeda H. Nature. 1997; 388: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), it is also possible that in yeast, the interaction of Ku with the telomere is mediated by protein-protein interactions. In addition, the effect of single-stranded telomeric tails on Ku binding to double-stranded DNA remains unknown, especially in the light of the recognized ability of telomeric G-rich strands to adopt G-G base-paired conformationsin vitro (for review, see Ref. 40Henderson E. Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 11-35Google Scholar). Indeed, telomeric G-strand DNA in vitro readily forms, under physiological conditions, a structure in which four guanine residues from four different telomeric repeats are arranged in a planar conformation (G-quartet, or G-DNA) that is stabilized by Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds. For any particular telomeric sequence, typically three or four of these planar arrangements are stacked onto each other and are stabilized by Na+ or K+ ions loosely coordinated at the center. Several types of related structures, all belonging to the G-quartet family, have been described, with variability residing on the relative orientation of the four strands (parallel or antiparallel) and the loops connecting them (diagonal or lateral) (41Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 42Sundquist W.I. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 43Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar, 44Kang C. Zhang X. Ratliff R. Moyzis R. Rich A. Nature. 1992; 356: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Mammalian telomeres terminate in long (130–270 base pairs) single-stranded G-rich overhangs (45Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 46McElligott R. Wellinger R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 47Makarov V. Hirose Y. Langmore J.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), whereas long (>20 base pairs) overhangs occur at yeast telomeres only briefly in late S-phase (48Dionne I. Wellinger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 49Wellinger R.J. Ethier K. Labrecque P. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in the requirements for telomere end binding activities might exist in the two organisms. In particular, the possibility exists that Ku in mammalian cells is limited to a role in DSB repair and that the G-rich overhangs at mammalian telomeres might be sufficient to sequester telomeric ends from this repair pathway. Our results indicate that the ability of Ku to bind to telomeric DNA ends in different conformations is consistent with a direct interaction of Ku with mammalian telomeric DNA and its proposed role as a telomeric protein. Ku heterodimer was purified to apparent homogeneity (as judged from silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels) from nuclear extracts from HeLa cells (50Dignam J.P. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Four chromatographic steps were used for the purification (11de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar): DEAE-Fractogel 650 (EM Separations), phosphocellulose (Whatman), double-stranded DNA cellulose (Sigma), and single-stranded DNA cellulose (Sigma). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystem DNA synthesizer and gel-purified before use. Labeling of 5′-ends was carried out by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Annealing of double-stranded substrates was achieved by incubation for 2 h at room temperature and was carried out after labeling and folding of overhangs when appropriate. Folding of overhangs was induced by incubating at 90 °C for 3 min and at room temperature for 20 min (41Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). DMS protection assays were as described in Ref. 41Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar. Binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 15 min. Reactions described in Fig. 2 were carried out in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.75, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm KCl, and 7% glycerol. All other reactions were performed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, with or without added salts, as indicated below in the individual experiments, and glycerol (3% final concentration) was added prior to loading on gel. Electrophoresis was performed in 5% acrylamide (29:1), on 20 cm gels in 1× TBE at 130 V for 2 h at room temperature. Quantitation of experiments was performed by phosphorimaging using ImageQuant software. Given the DNA-end binding activity of Ku and its suggested role at yeast telomeres, it was of interest to investigate the ability of Ku to bind to telomeric DNA in vitro. Oligonucleotides were synthesized terminating in the human telomeric TTAGGG repeats in different configurations, both 3′ protruding and blunt-ended (Fig. 1,T1, T2, and T3). The affinity of Ku for the various substrates in band-shift assays was then compared with the affinity for an oligonucleotide of similar size but of random sequence (Fig. 1, R1). Two representative binding experiments performed with the control DNA and the three telomeric DNAs as competitors are shown in Fig. 2. In these and in other experiments (data not shown), the telomeric oligonucleotides competed efficiently for Ku binding to either the telomeric DNA T1 (Fig. 2 a) or the control DNA R1 (Fig.2 b). The telomeric substrates, in fact, proved to be slightly better competitors than the random sequence DNA. T3 in particular performed as a good competitor. This result is in agreement with the known preference of Ku for the longer double-stranded regions (10Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these results show that DNAs terminating with telomeric sequence are able to bind Ku with an affinity comparable to that displayed by molecules bearing nontelomeric DNA ends. Because single-stranded telomeric sequences are known to adopt G-G base-paired structures in vitro (for review, see Ref. 40Henderson E. Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 11-35Google Scholar) (41Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 42Sundquist W.I. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 43Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar, 44Kang C. Zhang X. Ratliff R. Moyzis R. Rich A. Nature. 1992; 356: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), we next determined whether Ku can bind to DNA molecules terminating with telomeric sequences folded in a G-quartet conformation. To this end, we constructed duplex DNA molecules bearing 3.5 copies of the telomeric repeat fromOxytricha nova (TTTTGGGG) in single-stranded form at each DNA end (Fig. 1). Although human telomeric sequences have been shown to fold into G-quartets (51Wang Y. Patel D.J. Structure. 1993; 1: 263-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 52Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO. 1994; 13: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 53Balagurumoorthy P. Brahmachari S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21858-21869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Oxytricha telomeric repeat was chosen because it is the one that more readily adopts an intramolecular G-quartet conformation in vitro (41Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 44Kang C. Zhang X. Ratliff R. Moyzis R. Rich A. Nature. 1992; 356: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar,54Wang Y. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 76-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 55Smith F.W. Feigon J. Biochem. 1993; 32: 8682-8692Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 56Smith F.W. Feigon J. Nature. 1992; 356: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Because intramolecular G-quartets are dependent on the presence of K+ or Na+, but are not formed in the presence of Li+ (41Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), the annealed oligonucleotides were incubated either in the absence of any cation or in the presence of either K+ or Li+. When K+ was present, the duplexed oligonucleotides displayed an increased migration rate, consistent with the folding of the two single-stranded tails into a G-quartet conformation (Fig.3 a, compare lanes 17 and 18, single asterisk versus double asterisk) (41Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar,57Zahler A.M. Williamson J.R. Cech T.R. Prescott D.M. Nature. 1991; 350: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Although incubation in Li+ sometimes gave rise to a double band (Fig. 3 a, lane 19), the mobility of the oligonucleotide was slower compared with the mobility observed after incubation in K+ and was comparable to the mobility of the DNA incubated in TE without ions (Fig. 3 a, lanes 17–19). In addition, when we employed a chemical protection assay to further verify the structure of the terminal tails, both strands showed K+-dependent protection of the terminal G4 arrays (Fig. 3 b, lanes 5–12), consistent with the fact that the N-7 position in G-G base-paired structures is protected from modification by DMS. Also in agreement with the methylation protection pattern of intramolecular G-quartets was the observation that the protection was slightly greater at the 2 central Gs of each arrays (41Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Having verified the folding of the terminal tails into a G-quartet conformation in the presence of K+, we then performed binding assays with the oligonucleotide in different ionic environments to determine whether a change in affinity for Ku existed upon conditions that promote G-quartet formation. Interestingly, Ku showed essentially identical affinity for the DNA, whether it was folded in G-quartet conformation or not (Fig. 3 a, lanes 1–15). Appropriate control experiments were performed with oligonucleotide R2 to verify that the affinity of Ku for DNA under the different ionic conditions employed did not vary significantly (data not shown). The K+-dependent change in electrophoretic mobility of oligonucleotide Q1 (Fig. 3 a, lanes 17–19) was still apparent with samples to which Ku had been added (Fig.3 a, compare lanes 5 and 6, andlanes 10 and 11), suggesting that the presence of Ku protein preparation had no effect (folding or unfolding) on the structure of the G-tails. Nevertheless, we considered the possibility that the 5 mm KCl introduced into the reactions upon addition of Ku protein could have induced G-quartet formation in Q1 DNA, thus hindering our comparison of folded versus unfolded DNA. We therefore performed reciprocal competition experiments with the folded oligounucletide Q1 and the control oligonucleotide R2 (note that the two molecules have duplex regions of nearly equal length: 33 and 30 nucleotides, respectively). Both probes were incubated with Ku in the presence of K+ and a molar excess of either cold competitor DNA (Fig. 4). Both DNAs competed to the same extent for Ku binding, indicating that Ku binds to either substrate with very similar affinities, thus supporting our conclusion that terminally located G-quartets do not affect the binding of Ku to the duplex. To see whether Ku has the ability to bind to G-quartet structures per se, we performed competition experiments with an oligonucleotide entirely composed of four copies of theOxytricha telomeric repeat (Fig. 1, Q2). This molecule displays the expected K+-dependent ability to adopt an intramolecular G-quartet conformation as judged by gel electrophoresis (data not shown) and DMS protection (Fig. 3 b, lanes 1–4). Interestingly, Q2 behaves practically identically to a 33 nucleotides-long single-stranded oligonucleotide of random sequence in its ability to compete for Ku binding (Fig.5, lanes 10–17, 19–26). Both of these DNAs are about 20 times less effective as competitors compared with the 31-base pair-long double-stranded R2. Thus these results show that Ku binds to G-quartet structures inefficiently, with affinity similar to that of single-stranded DNA. The finding that Ku in yeast plays an important role at telomeres raises the obvious possibility that it might exert a similar function in mammalian cells. However, significant differences exist between yeast and mammalian telomeres. Whereas in yeast, no tails are detectable by an in-gel hybridization assay, setting the upper limit for telomeric overhangs at about 20 nucleotides (48Dionne I. Wellinger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 49Wellinger R.J. Ethier K. Labrecque P. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), long G-rich overhangs (130–270 nucleotides) are observed at mammalian telomeres (45Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 46McElligott R. Wellinger R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 47Makarov V. Hirose Y. Langmore J.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Thus the biochemical requirements for binding to chromosome ends may be different in the two systems. In particular, the G-rich tails found at mammalian telomeres might adopt G-G base-paired conformations. Although it is not clear whether such DNA structures are formed in vivo, G-G base-paired structures are readily adopted in vitro by most telomeric repeats under physiological conditions (for review, see Ref. 40Henderson E. Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 11-35Google Scholar). Interestingly, plasmids bearing G-rich overhangs are found to self-associate in vivo in yeast, presumably due to the formation of G-G base pairs at the overhangs (49Wellinger R.J. Ethier K. Labrecque P. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition, the O. nova telomeric protein β and Rap1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae promote the formation of G-DNA at telomeric sequences in vitro (58Fang G. Cech T.R. Cell. 1993; 74: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,59Giraldo R. Rhodes D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2411-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, G-quartet structures may exist at eukaryotic telomeres, possibly in a transient manner in some cell types. Our findings suggest that the long overhangs found at mammalian telomeres, even if folded into G-quartet structures, will not prevent Ku from binding to the DNA. Therefore, the biochemical properties of mammalian Ku are consistent with it being a telomeric protein, like its yeast counterpart. One of the main unanswered questions in telomere biology is how telomere termini escape becoming a substrate of DNA repair activities. Our data argue against a potential simple solution to this problem: that the binding of Ku to natural chromosome ends is blocked by the unusual structure and sequence of telomere termini. The in vitro binding of Ku to a variety of alternate telomeric substrates renders this explanation unlikely and further substantiates the opposite view that Ku may actually be (possibly transiently) bound to telomeres in vivo. Clearly, a definitive answer to the role of Ku at mammalian telomeres, if any, requires functional or cytological evidence. Our attempts at identifying Ku at telomeres in human and rodent cell lines have not resulted in proof for co-localization of Ku with the telomeric protein TRF1 (data not shown). However, these experiments are not conclusive, because a signal at the telomere might be masked by the abundance of Ku throughout the nucleus and because of the expected scarcity of an end factor at the telomere, possibly below the detection limits of immunofluorescence techniques. The prospect of Ku being positioned at mammalian chromosome ends raises the question of how this telomere bound Ku is prevented from performing its function in the DSB repair. This dilemma also applies to Ku bound at yeast telomeres and to other components of the DNA repair pathway (RAD50, MRE11, and XRS2), for which a role in telomere maintenance and therefore possible binding to telomere termini has recently been demonstrated (34Nugent C.I. Bosco G. Ross L.O. Evans S.K. Salinger A.P. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Lundblad V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of Ku binding to DNA is not known. The search for a common requirement in the various DNA substrates that are bound with high affinity by Ku has led to the suggestion that Ku might recognize the transition from single- to double-stranded DNA (10Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4741-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on the fact that free 3′- or 5′-ends are not needed for binding and is supported to some extent by the observation that Ku appears to bind more tightly to oligonucleotides terminating with an AT-rich sequence as opposed to ones terminating in a G-rich sequence, suggesting that possibly the melting of the terminal base pairs provides the substrate for Ku recognition (10Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a Ku DNA-helicase activity that could help in generating such substrate has been reported (60Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zhang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, this model for DNA binding is not consistent with our finding that Ku is able to bind with high affinity to interstrand terminally cross-linked (with psoralen) DNA molecules (data not shown). In the case of the G-DNA substrates used in this work (which all have free 3′- and 5′-ends) it appears likely that the recognition occurs at either the free 3′- or the free 5′-end, or possibly in the T4-loop region. With recognition occurring at the 3′-end or in the T4-loop only, stabilization of Ku binding on the DNA duplex would appear likely to require unfolding of the G-quartet with lower on-rate and affinity as a likely consequence. Because this was not observed, we favor the hypothesis that it is the free 5′-end that is recognized. Thus, even though our experiments do not address the state of the folded overhang after Ku binding, we suggest that Ku is able to recognize the junction between double-stranded DNA and G-quartet without the necessity to unfold the structure.

https://openalex.org/W2021528141,"Integrin-induced adhesion leads to cytoskeletal reorganizations, cell migration, spreading, proliferation, and differentiation. The details of the signaling events that induce these changes in cell behavior are not well understood but they appear to involve activation of Rho family members which activate signaling molecules such as tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, and lipid kinases. The result is the formation of focal complexes, focal adhesions, and bundles and networks of actin filaments that allow the cell to spread. The present study shows that μ-calpain is active in adherent cells, that it cleaves proteins known to be present in focal complexes and focal adhesions, and that overexpression of μ-calpain increased the cleavage of these proteins, induced an overspread morphology and induced an increased number of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Inhibition of calpain with membrane permeable inhibitors or by expression of a dominant negative form of μ-calpain resulted in an inability of cells to spread or to form focal adhesions, actin filament networks, or stress fibers. Cells expressing constitutively active Rac1 could still form focal complexes and actin filament networks (but not focal adhesions or stress fibers) in the presence of calpain inhibitors; cells expressing constitutively active RhoA could form focal adhesions and stress fibers. Taken together, these data indicate that calpain plays an important role in regulating the formation of focal adhesions and Rac- and Rho-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations and that it does so by acting at sites upstream of both Rac1 and RhoA. Integrin-induced adhesion leads to cytoskeletal reorganizations, cell migration, spreading, proliferation, and differentiation.

The present study shows that μ-calpain is active in adherent cells, that it cleaves proteins known to be present in focal complexes and focal adhesions, and that overexpression of μ-calpain increased the cleavage of these proteins, induced an overspread morphology and induced an increased number of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Inhibition of calpain with membrane permeable inhibitors or by expression of a dominant negative form of μ-calpain resulted in an inability of cells to spread or to form focal adhesions, actin filament networks, or stress fibers. Cells expressing constitutively active Rac1 could still form focal complexes and actin filament networks (but not focal adhesions or stress fibers) in the presence of calpain inhibitors; cells expressing constitutively active RhoA could form focal adhesions and stress fibers. Taken together, these data indicate that calpain plays an important role in regulating the formation of focal adhesions and Rac- and Rho-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations and that it does so by acting at sites upstream of both Rac1 and RhoA. Adhesion of cells on integrin substrates results in cell spreading, migration, differentiation, and proliferation and is essential for events such as inflammation, platelet clot formation, development, and wound healing (1Meredith Jr., J.E.

Recent evidence has shown that one of the early events following integrin-ligand interactions is the clustering of integrins into small complexes with signaling molecules (4Clark E.A. King W.G.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The subsequent activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 induces the polymerization of new actin filaments that organize into bundles and submembranous networks, thus, causing the extension of filopodia and lamellipodia (4Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 5Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The dynamic breakdown and formation of new focal complexes in the extending lamellipodia allows the cells to spread. RhoA then becomes activated and induces the formation of larger complexes of integrins, cytoskeletal proteins, and signaling molecules known as focal adhesions. RhoA also induces myosin to interact with actin filaments, causing the filaments to assemble into bundles known as stress fibers that terminate at the focal adhesions and allow tension to be generated on ligand-occupied integrin in the spreading cells (9Amano M.

By analogy to activation of Ras proteins by growth factor receptors, it is likely that Rho family members are activated by exchange factors that are recruited to sites of ligand-occupied integrin (13Boguski M.S.

However, little is known about the mechanisms inducing recruitment or activation of such factors. The ability of activated Rho family members to induce the formation of focal complexes and adhesions (collectively referred to as focal adhesion complexes) and to reorganize the cytoskeleton presumably results from activation of effector molecules by the Rho proteins. Signaling molecules that have been identified at sites of ligand-occupied integrin or shown to be activated as a consequence of integrin-ligand interactions include tyrosine kinases, serine-threonine kinases, and lipid kinases (1Meredith Jr., J.E. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S. Ren X.-D. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Lafrenie R.M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Several of these have been implicated as playing a role in mediating integrin-induced signaling but the molecular details of the way in which these regulate the formation of focal adhesions or the integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations are, in general, not well understood. Another signaling molecule that could conceivably be involved in mediating integrin-induced signaling is calpain (20Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Calpains are intracellular, non-lysosomal, Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases that are active at physiological pH (21Murachi T. Biochem. Int. 1989; 18: 263-294PubMed Google Scholar). They are heterodimers containing a common regulatory subunit of 30 kDa and either of two genetically distinct, catalytic subunits of 80 kDa (22Sakihama T. Kakidani H. Zenita K. Yumoto N. Kikuchi T.

Chem. 1986; 261: 9465-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One form of calpain requires micromolar Ca2+(m-calpain or calpain I) for half-maximal activation while the other requires millimolar concentrations (μ-calpain or calpain II) (25Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Although both forms require higher calcium concentrations for activation than those thought to exist within cells under normal physiological conditions, it is becoming apparent that calpain activation may be regulated during normal signal transduction mechanisms (20Fox J.E.B.

One cell in which calpain has been shown to be activated during normal signaling is the platelet (20Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. Cell Motility. 1983; 3: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Fox J.E.B.

In this cell, its activation occurs as a consequence of engagement of αIIbβ3, the major platelet integrin, by its ligand (20Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Direct evidence that calpain is activated in adherent cells is lacking. However, the millimolar form of calpain has been detected in focal adhesions of cultured cells (29Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and recent reports in which calpain was inhibited by membrane-permeable calpain inhibitors in CHO 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BAEC, bovine endothelial cells; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; TRITC, tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BAEC, bovine endothelial cells; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; TRITC, tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate cells or by overexpression of the endogenous inhibitor calpastatin in NIH 3T3 cells have suggested that calpain may be involved in the detachment of integrins from focal adhesions during migration or in the extension of lamellipodia in spreading cells (30Potter D.A.

In the present study, we have investigated the possibility that calpain is activated in adherent cells spreading on fibronectin and whether it is involved in integrin-induced remodeling of the cytoskeleton. We provide evidence that: 1) calpain is active and cleaves known components of focal complexes and adhesions in bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells; 2) inhibition of calpain results in an inability of cells to spread and to form focal adhesions, actin filament networks, and stress fibers; 3) overexpression of μ-calpain induces an unusually large spread morphology, an increased number of focal adhesions and stress fibers, and decreased cell growth; 4) cells expressing constitutively active RhoA can still spread and form focal adhesions and stress fibers when calpain is inhibited; cells expressing active Rac1 can extend lamellipodia, form focal complexes, and form networks of submembranous actin filaments. Taken together, these data suggest that calpain plays an essential role in regulating integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations and formation of focal complexes and focal adhesions and that it acts upstream of both Rac1 and RhoA. The membrane-permeable inhibitors of calpain used in this study were MDL (33Mehdi S. Angelastro M.R. Wiseman J.S. Bey P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Cbz-Val-Phe-H, a gift from Dr. S. Mehdi, Merrell Dow, Cincinnati, OH), calpeptin (34Tsujinaka T. Kajiwara Y. Kambayashi J.

All inhibitors were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Monoclonal antibodies against actin and vinculin were obtained from Sigma; monoclonal antibodies against talin were from Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX); monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine and protein kinase C type-III were from UBI (Lake Placid, NY); those against α5β1 were from East Acres Biologicals (Southbridge, MA). Polyclonal antibodies against HA epitope were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal antibodies were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Monoclonal antibodies against integrin β1-subunit were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibodies specific for the 80-kDa subunit of μ-calpain were raised and characterized as described previously (37Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Murofushi H.

BAE cells (provided by Dr. Paul Dicorleto, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) and human embryonal kidney 293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12, 1:1, Biowhittaker) medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) containing penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). For all experiments described here, BAE cells were used between passage 6 and 15. CHO cells (ATCC) were maintained in Ham's F-12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and glutamine. Plasmid DNAs encoding HA-tagged constitutively active Q63L RhoA and inactive T19N RhoA were provided by M. A. Schwartz (The Scripps Research Institute). Plasmid DNA encoding HA-tagged constitutively active Q61L Rac1 was provided by C. S. Abrams (University of Pennsylvania Medical School). The plasmid pUC19 containing the full-length wild-type cDNA sequence of μ-calpain has been described previously (23Aoki K. Imajoh S. Ohno S. Emori Y. Koike M. Kosaki G. Suzuki K. FEBS. 1986; 205: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the forward primer 5′-CAGGAAGCTTATGTCGGAGGAGATCATCAC-3′ and the reverse primer encoding the HA-epitope (YDVPDYASL) from hemagglutinin virus, 5′-TGCCGGATCCTCATAAGCTTGCATAATCAGGAACATCATATGCAAACATGGTCAGCTGC-3′. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested withBamHI and HindIII and subcloned into expression vector pcDNA3. The HA-epitope was inserted at the carboxyl terminus of the coding region after the last amino acid of μ-calpain. The entire coding region of the HA-tagged wild-type μcalpain cDNA was sequenced and shown to contain no mutations. The plasmid encoding HA-tagged catalytically inactive μ-calpain (23Aoki K. Imajoh S. Ohno S. Emori Y. Koike M. Kosaki G. Suzuki K. FEBS. 1986; 205: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was generated as follows. The XbaI/SacII region of the plasmid encoding HA-tagged wild-type μ-calpain was polymerase chain reaction amplified using the forward primer containing theXbaI site and the active site mutation His272→ Ala (underlined), 5′-GACATCTCCAGCGTTCTAGACATGGAGGCCATCACTTTCAAGAAGTTGGTGAAGGGCGCTGC-3′, and reverse primer containing the SacII site, 5′-TAGTTTCGGCAGCCCCCCGCGGTGCT-3′. The resultant polymerase chain reaction product was gel purified and ligated with theXbaI/ApaI and SacII/ApaI fragments of the wild type HA-tagged μ-calpain plasmid DNA. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Stable transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) essentially as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 × 105 BAE cells were plated in 100-mm dishes overnight and washed with serum-free medium once before transfection. Transfection was carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 6.8 ml of serum-free medium containing 20 μl of LipofectAMINE and 10 μg of either vector DNA (pcDNA3) or HA-tagged wild-type μ-calpain cDNA per 100-mm dish. After 5 h, transfection media were replaced with growth media containing 10% serum. Cells were allowed to recover for 72 h and split as 1:3 into selection medium containing 200 μg/ml active G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 15 days, clones were removed using cloning cylinders, cultured, and frozen. Transient transfections with constitutively active and inactive mutants of Rho family members or catalytically inactive μ-calpain were carried out in BAE cells cultured on fibronectin-coated coverslips in 6-well plates. Cells were cultured overnight and transfected with 4 μg of each DNA mixed with LipofectAMINE plus reagent (6 μl of plus reagent and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of serum-free medium for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated coverslips (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), fixed with 1.4% formaldehyde in TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 50 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 mm NaCl, and 0.1% NaN3) for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, then blocked with TBS containing 4% horse serum. Coverslips were incubated with appropriate dilutions of primary antibodies in TBS containing 4% horse serum. Unbound antibodies were removed by extensive washing and samples incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, 1:400 in TBS containing 4% horse serum), followed by streptavidin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:500 in TBS). Actin was detected by staining with TRITC (tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate) coupled to phalloidin (Sigma, 0.5 μg/ml). Control samples were prepared using secondary antibodies alone or irrelevant primary antibodies. Images were collected using either a Zeiss immunofluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser-scanning microscope. Laser intensities were adjusted so that the excitation of the fluorchromes did not allow any cross-talk between the channels. Cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes (35–100 mm, Beckton Dickinson). Media were removed and cells solubilized in cold RIPA buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20 mm), NaCl (150 mm), sdoium deoxycholate (0.1%), Triton X-100 (1%), SDS (0.1%), and inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin, (10 μg/ml), EDTA (2 mm), sodium fluoride (50 mm), and Na3VO4 (1 mm). In experiments analyzing extracts of cells overexpressing μ-calpain, calpeptin (75 μg/ml) was included in the preparation of extracts in addition to the above inhibitors. Total protein was estimated using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein in a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad microassay kit, Hercules, CA). Proteins were denatured by addition of SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed through SDS gels containing 3.5% polyacrylamide in a stacking gel and 7.5% polyacrylamide in a resolving gel (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed by the method of Towbin et al.(39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). To determine whether calpain is required for the formation of integrin adhesion complexes or the cytoskeletal reorganizations that take place following integrin-induced signaling, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips in the absence of serum and in the presence or absence of the membrane-permeable inhibitors of calpain, MDL, and calpeptin. In the absence of inhibitors, the number of spread cells gradually increased with time reaching 60% or more by 6 h. In contrast, cell spreading was markedly inhibited in the presence of inhibitors (Fig.1). The optimum concentration of calpeptin required to inhibit spreading was 50–100 μg/ml, that of MDL was 150–250 μm. Cells spread normally following removal of the inhibitors (Fig. 1) indicating that the concentrations of calpain inhibitors that inhibited spreading were not toxic to the cells. Furthermore, following removal of inhibitor, the viability of the cells (as determined by trypan blue exclusion) was approximately 85% for control cells and 70% for cells treated with 150 μm MDL for 16 h (data not shown). Similar inhibitory effects of calpain inhibitors were observed on the spreading of CHO cells and 293 cells (data not shown). To gain insight into the possibility that calpain is involved in integrin-induced signaling pathways leading to the formation of submembranous actin filament networks and focal complexes at early stages of spreading, serum-starved BAE cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips in the presence or absence of calpeptin for 45 min to 6 h. During this time period, cells spread by extending lamellipodia. The organization of actin filaments in the spreading cells was examined by staining with fluorescently labeled phalloidin, and the distribution of phosphotyrosine, vinculin, talin, or α5β1 detected by staining with antibodies (Fig. 2). In the absence of inhibitors, submembranous networks of actin formed around the spreading cells; as lamellipodia formed, the filaments were concentrated in these structures and were often present in small clusters (e.g. bottom left panel of Fig. 2). Phosphotyrosine, vinculin, talin, and the integrin α5β1 had a similar distribution, both in submembranous sheets and in clusters in lamellipodia. In the presence of calpeptin, the formation of actin filament networks was almost completely inhibited; a few small focal complexes were detected in some cells, but the number was markedly reduced compared with those in control cells. To determine whether calpain is involved in the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers in more fully spread cells, cells were allowed to spread for 6–24 h (Fig. 3). Control cells contained many stress fibers with focal adhesions at their ends. Like focal complexes, focal adhesions contain phosphotyrosine, vinculin, talin, and α5β1, however, they have a characteristic arrowhead shape that is absent in focal complexes (6Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3728) Google Scholar). When inhibitor was present, the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers were markedly inhibited (Fig. 3). We also investigated the effect of calpain inhibitors on cells that had already spread on fibronectin and contained stress fibers and focal adhesions. Addition of MDL to these cells resulted in rounding of cells (Fig. 4). Staining with phalloidin revealed that the cells gradually disassembled actin stress fibers; by 16 h, stress fibers were almost completely absent but filamentous actin was present beneath the membrane, with increasing time as the cells became more rounded the submembranous actin was also lost. Staining with vinculin antibodies showed that focal adhesions disassembled; after 16 h most of the focal adhesions were lost but small focal complexes could be detected; by 24 h focal complexes were also considerably reduced in number. The effects of MDL were reversible, the cells respread, reassembled stress fibers, and reformed focal adhesions (bottom 2 panels of Fig. 4). The experiments described above suggested a requirement of calpain function during the formation of focal complexes, focal adhesions, stress fibers, and actin filament networks. As a more direct approach of determining whether calpain is involved in these integrin-induced events, we performed experiments in which calpain was overexpressed or in which cells were transfected with a dominant negative form of calpain. Because both μ- and m-calpain are present in most cell types, we performed initial experiments to identify the form of calpain that was responsible for inhibition of integrin-induced signaling in endothelial cells. BAE cells were cultured in the presence or absence of inhibitors that were selective for the two forms of the protease. As shown in Table I, the spreading of cells was inhibited by the inhibitor selective for μ-calpain but was barely affected by two m-calpain selective inhibitors, even though the concentrations used were as much as 10,000 times in excess of the K i of the inhibitors.Table IBovine aortic endothelial cells (1 × 105) were cultured on fibronectin-coated coverslips overnight.AdditionK I(μm)Membrane permeabilitySpread cellsCalpain ICalpain IIμm% of totalNo addition98Calpeptin0.0521-aObtained from Li et al.

As one approach to directly test this, cells were transfected with the cDNA for HA-tagged catalytic subunit of μ-calpain or with vector DNA alone and selected for stable transfectants by G418 resistance. The amount of calpain expression was assessed on Western blots with an antibody specific for the catalytic subunit of μ-calpain (Fig. 5). This antibody detected equivalent amounts of μ-calpain in extracts of nontransfected cells and in extracts of cells transfected with vector alone (VT1). Increased expression of μ-calpain was detected in two clones transfected with the cDNA (ST1 and ST4) (Fig. 5). The expression levels were about 2-fold over the control for clone ST1 and 5-fold for clone ST4 as determined by quantitation of three independent gels by NIH image analysis using levels of actin in the same gel as an internal control. Examination of the shape of transfected cells revealed that cells transfected with vector alone had a regular, cobbl"

To test this directly, transgenic mice were created in which three potentially phosphorylatable serines in the ventricular isoform of the regulatory myosin light chain were mutated to alanines. Lines were obtained in which replacement of the endogenous species in the ventricle with the nonphosphorylatable, transgenically encoded protein was essentially complete. The mice show a spectrum of cardiovascular changes. As previously observed in skeletal muscle, Ca2+sensitivity of force development was dependent upon the phosphorylation status of the regulatory light chain. Structural abnormalities were detected by both gross histology and transmission electron microscopic analyses. Mature animals showed both atrial hypertrophy and dilatation. Echocardiographic analysis revealed that as a result of chamber enlargement, severe tricuspid valve insufficiency resulted in a detectable regurgitation jet. We conclude that regulated phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chains appears to play an important role in maintaining normal cardiac function over the lifetime of the animal.

We conclude that regulated phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chains appears to play an important role in maintaining normal cardiac function over the lifetime of the animal. The roles of the regulatory myosin light chains (RLCs) 1The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory myosin light chain; RLC2v, ventricular regulatory myosin light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; TG, transgenic; NTG, nontransgenic; MyHC, myosin heavy chain; RV, right ventricle; LV, left ventricle; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BW, body weight and the reversible post-translational modifications they undergo in striated muscle are beginning to be defined. In skeletal muscle, a serine at the amino end of the protein can be phosphorylated by a sarcoplasmic kinase (1Perrie W.T. Smillie L.B. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and it is now clear that RLCs in the different striated muscles are phosphorylated to differing degrees, leading presumably to different physiological effects. In smooth muscle, RLC phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which is activated by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pathway, is responsible for initiating muscle contraction (2Stull J.T. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 13: 40-93Google Scholar, 3Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in skeletal and cardiac muscle, in which the thin, rather than thick, filament mediates control of contraction, RLC phosphorylation does not activate contraction but appears to play a modulatory role. In skinned skeletal muscle fibers, RLC phosphorylation increases sensitivity to activating Ca2+ such that there is a significant leftward shift in the force-Ca2+ relationship (4Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1085-C1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tuazon P.T. Stull J.T. Traugh J.A. Eur. J.

Increased RLC phosphorylation in skeletal muscle is also associated with potentiation of isometric twitch tension with repeated activation and inactivation of contraction (7Sweeney H.L. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C657-C660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Moore R.L. Persechini A. J. Cell.

Commun. 1993; 193: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis for the effects of RLC phosphorylation in striated muscle is hypothesized to be a lessening of the weak interaction of the myosin head with the myosin backbone and is probably due to a net charge change in a critical region of the protein (13Sweeney H.L. Yang Z. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trybus K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1490-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, the myosin heads move away from the backbone to a position closer to actin, which presumably increases the rate at which myosin-actin interactions occur. Recently, the physiological importance of RLC phosphorylation in striated muscle was addressed by examining the in vivo effects of RLC mutant proteins in the indirect flight muscle of Drosophila (14Tohtong R. Yamashita H. Grahm M. Haeberle J. Simcox A. Maughan D. Nature. 1995; 374: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Phosphorylatable serine residues were replaced with alanines, and the mutated proteins were introduced into a null RLC background. The resultant flies showed normal myofibrillogenesis but had reduced power output and flight ability resulting from a marked reduction in the stretch activation of the indirect flight muscle. Little is known about the role RLC2 phosphorylation plays in maintaining normal mammalian cardiac function. In rats, increased RLC phosphorylation occurs in response to increases in beat frequency and/or LV pressure due to exercise or inotropic agents (15Fitzsimons D.P. Bodell P.W. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 67: 2447-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fitzsimons D.P. Bodell P.W. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 68: 2426-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This response may help maintain force production and stroke volume in the face of an increased rate of relaxation. However, the response is attenuated or absent in the mouse heart after similar exercise regimens (17Fewell J.G. Osinska H. Klevitsky R. Ng W. Sfyris G. Bahrehmand F. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1595-H1605PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in RLC phosphorylation in ischemic rabbit hearts have been noted (18Akiyama K. Akopian G. Jinadasa P. Gluckman T.L. Terhakopian A. Massey B. Bing R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2641-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and in some patients with heart failure, decreases in light chain phosphorylation occurred (19Morano I. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1992; 87: 129-141PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the physiological role of RLC phosphorylation in the heart by transgenically overexpressing a mutated form of RLC2v (ventricular regulatory myosin light chain) that could not be phosphorylated. Multiple lines of transgenic (TG) mice were created in which the endogenous atrial and ventricular isoforms of RLC2 were replaced with a ventricular form in which alanines were substituted for the phosphorylatable serines at residues 14, 15, and 19. Analyses of these animals at the molecular, cellular, whole organ, and animal levels confirm the importance of regulated phosphorylation of the myosin light chains in maintaining normal cardiac function. A previously isolated full-length murine RLC2v cDNA was used as a starting template (20Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Primers with SalI sites engineered at the termini were made to the 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions of the cDNA. The 5′ primer also contained the mutated bases necessary to change the serines at residues 14, 15, and 19 to alanines (Fig. 1 A). The polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced, and the fragment was linked to the mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter. The final construct, RLC2v(P−), was digested free of vector sequence with NotI, purified from agarose, and used to generate transgenic mice as described (20Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Total ventricular RNA was prepared from freshly isolated hearts obtained from 8–16-week-old mice euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. Samples were homogenized in Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each analysis, 1.5 μg of total RNA was loaded onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a dot blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Hybridizations using32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides were performed as described previously (21Robbins J. Palermo J.J. Rindt H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 752: 492-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide sequences that were used as probes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-skeletal actin, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), β-myosin heavy chain (MyHC), and phospholamban have been published (22Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Hewett T. Boivin G. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 8: 1906-1917Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A 51-base oligonucleotide, specific for RLC2v consisted of the sequence 5′-CTGAGGCTGTGGTTCAGGGCTCAGTCCTTCTCTTCTCCGTGGGTAATGATT-3′, and the oligonucleotide 5′-AGGTGTGTTGCTAACAACGCAGATGCACGCACCCGAACACCCTTATATTTCTGCAAATGG-3′, specific for the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase was also used. Hybridization signals were identified and quantitated using a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For SDS-PAGE, the left ventricular apex and atrial flaps were obtained from euthanized RLC2v(P−) TG and nontransgenic (NTG) mice. Myofibrillar sample preparation, gel preparation, electrophoretic conditions, and gel staining have been described (17Fewell J.G. Osinska H. Klevitsky R. Ng W. Sfyris G. Bahrehmand F. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1595-H1605PubMed Google Scholar). Samples used for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were prepared as described by Kirschbaum et al. (23Kirschbaum B.J. Simoneau J. Bar A. Barton P.J.R. Buckingham M.E. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cylindrical polyacrylamide gels (2 mm) for isoelectric focusing were prepared as described by O'Farrell (24O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad ampholytes (2% (v/v) final concentration) with a restricted gradient of pH 4–6. Electrophoresis was performed at 500 V for 10 min and then at 750 V for 3.5 h. Gels were removed from the tubes and equilibrated in a solution containing Tris buffer (62.5 mm, pH 6.8), 1% (w/v) SDS, and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol for approximately 5 min. Electrophoresis in the second dimension slab gel (16% polyacrylamide; 29:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide with a 5% stacking gel; 29:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide) was carried out in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Gels were stained with colloidal blue (Sigma). The phosphorylation state of fibers used in the mechanical studies was tested by Western blot analysis as described (17Fewell J.G. Osinska H. Klevitsky R. Ng W. Sfyris G. Bahrehmand F. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1595-H1605PubMed Google Scholar). Each sample consisted of two ventricular fiber bundles homogenized in sample buffer (8 m urea, 18 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 20.7 mm glycine, 9.3 mm dithiothreitol, 4.6% (v/v) saturated sucrose, and 0.004% (w/v) bromphenol blue). 2A.

The methods used for ultrastructural analysis have been described (17Fewell J.G. Osinska H. Klevitsky R. Ng W. Sfyris G. Bahrehmand F. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1595-H1605PubMed Google Scholar). For histological examination, hearts were briefly perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and then removed and further fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The methods for paraffin embedding, sectioning, and staining have been described (17Fewell J.G. Osinska H. Klevitsky R. Ng W. Sfyris G. Bahrehmand F. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1595-H1605PubMed Google Scholar). Standard methods for measuring force development from skinned muscle fibers were adapted for mouse cardiac fibers (25Fewell J.G. Hewett T.E. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Maughan D. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of myosin light chain phosphorylation on the pCa-force relationship in vitro, skinned fibers were treated with myosin light chain kinase and calmodulin. After measurements of the pCa-force relationship (first contraction), the fiber was incubated in relaxing solution (pCa 8.0) plus 2 μm calmodulin and 0.15 μm of truncated MLCK (kindly provided by Dr. J. T. Stull, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) for 10 min and then in a solution with a pCa of 5 plus 2 μm calmodulin and 0.15 μm truncated MLCK for 10 min. The fibers were relaxed for 2 min, and thepCa-force relationship was measured (second contraction). As a control protocol, fibers were exposed to a double sequence of contraction without calmodulin and MLCK. To examine the effects of myosin light chain phosphorylation on myofibrillar MgATPase activityin vitro, the myofibril was incubated in the following medium: 60 mm KCl, 60 mm imidazole, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5.33 mm ATP at pH 7.0 (pCa = 5) containing 2 μm calmodulin and 0.15 μm truncated myosin light chain at 23 °C for 30 min. The myofibril was washed with incubation medium but with a pCa = 8.0, and Ca2+-stimulated MgATPase activity was measured. The 5-min reaction was initiated with the addition of the sample at 23 °C and stopped with 15% trichloroacetic acid. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, and inorganic phosphate was measured in the supernatant fraction. The Ca2+-stimulated MgATPase activity was estimated by subtracting the activity at pCa = 8.0. Assessment of left ventricular function was performed as follows. Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of 50 μg/g, body weight (BW), ketamine and 100 μg/g, BW, thiobutabarbital (Inactin, Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA) and placed on a thermally controlled surgical table. Following tracheostomy, the right femoral artery and vein were cannulated with polyethylene tubing for measuring systemic arterial pressure and for the infusion of experimental drugs. A 1.4F Millar Mikro-Tip transducer (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) was inserted in the right carotid artery and advanced into the left ventricle for measurement of LV pressure and dP/dt. Cardiovascular responses to increasing doses of dobutamine were determined during 3-min constant infusions (0.1 μl/min/g, BW), and average values were determined during the final 30 s of each infusion. At the end of each dose-response protocol, a bolus dose of propranolol (100 ng/g, BW) was administered to evaluate baseline cardiac function in the absence of endogenous β-adrenergic activity. Pressure signals were recorded and analyzed using a MacLab 4/s data acquisition system at a sampling rate of 1000 samples/s/channel. Echocardiography was performed using a Hewlett Packard Sonos 5500 Ultrasound System equipped with a 12-MHz transducer (Andover, MA). In order to place the heart in the mid-field of the ultrasound sector where axial resolution is optimal, the transducer was fashioned with a latex balloon filled with warm acoustic gel producing a 1-cm standoff between the chest wall and the transducer face. Two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiography of the left ventricle from its short axis was recorded on an optical disc and a strip chart at a speed of 100 mm/s. The object of this study was to ablate RLC2 phosphorylation in the heart. In striated muscle, MLCK can phosphorylate serine 15 (1Perrie W.T. Smillie L.B. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Herring B.P. Gallagher P.J. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25945-25950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). InDrosophila, serines 66 and 67 can be phosphorylated by the enzyme (27Dickinson M.H. Hyatt C.J. Lehmann F.O. Moore J.R. Reedy M.C. Simcox A. Tohtong R. Vigoreaux J.O. Yamashita H. Maughan D.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3122-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These two residues are analogous to serines 14 and 15 in the mouse (Drosophila RLC has an N-terminal extension that is absent in mammalian RLC), suggesting that both residues are potential enzyme substrates. In smooth muscle, both threonine 18 and serine 19 can be phosphorylated by MLCK (28Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 36-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sequence similarities between the smooth and striated muscle RLCs suggest that serine 14 in skeletal muscle is also a target for MLCK phosphorylation. An additional consideration in the construct's design was that other kinases such as Rho kinase and protein kinase C have the ability to phosphorylate RLC2 at serine 15 as well as at other amino acid residues (5Tuazon P.T. Stull J.T. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Amano M. Ito M. Kazushi K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 294: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, to ensure that phosphorylation would not occur on the transgenically encoded protein, serines 14, 15, and 19 were each mutated and replaced by alanine (Fig.1 A). Multiple clones were sequenced to exclude polymerase chain reaction-induced errors. Except for the mutated residues, the consensus sequence was identical to that previously used to make TG mice (20Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Three TG founders were identified and used to establish stable lines by outbreeding to NTG animals. In all cases, the analyses below were carried out on transgenic heterozygotes in order to minimize the possibility of confounding the phenotype through insertional mutagenesis. RLC2v expression at the transcript level was quantitated by dot blot analyses with transcript-specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 B). TG transcript levels were quite modest, ranging from 1.33- to 2.5-fold above that of the endogenous message and were constant across all four cardiac compartments.2 We were interested in determining if there were changes in heart morphology in the RLC2v(P−) TG mice. When the RLC ofDrosophila indirect flight muscles was replaced by a nonphosphorylatable variant, no overt changes in overall muscle organization or architecture could be detected (14Tohtong R. Yamashita H. Grahm M. Haeberle J. Simcox A. Maughan D. Nature. 1995; 374: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast to the insect data, hearts from adult mice derived from the higher expressing lines 21 and 35 both showed hypertrophied and dilated atria when compared with line 42, which expressed only low levels of the transgene or NTG hearts (Fig. 2 A). Multiple hearts (4–8 hearts) from both lines 21 and 35 showed similar gross morphology, ruling out the possibility that the observed phenotype was due to an insertional mutagenic event. Sections comparing ventricular free walls derived from wild type or NTG versusRLC2v(P−) animals indicated that some mild cardiomyocyte disarray could be detected in the latter (Fig. 2 C). This mild pathology was apparent in both lines 21 and 35 but not in the line that expressed low levels of the transgene (line 42).2 In an attempt to define more precisely any LV hypertrophy that might be occurring, 10-week TG (line 21) and NTG hearts were dissected, and the weights of the septa and LV free walls were determined (TableI). The data show a trend toward septal hypertrophy, while the LV free wall weights are unaffected. To confirm the lack of overt hypertrophy in the ventricles, a detailed morphometric analysis was carried out on hearts from NTG and TG lines expressing either wild type RLC2v or RLC2v(P−) (lines 21 and 35). Multiple sections were cut from five blocks derived from two hearts from each line and myocyte density, diameter, and myocyte volume density determined for the LV and RV free wall, as well as the septum. No statistically significant differences between either of the TG lines, as compared with the NTG hearts, were observed.2Table INormalized heart weights for line 21 miceBody weightLV free wallLV free wall/BWSeptumSeptum/BWLA + RA1-aLA and RA, left and right atria, respectively./BWgmgmg/gmgmg/gmg/gRLC2v(P−)32 ± 1.063.9 ± 2.02.09 ± 0.0626.8 ± 0.50.87 ± 0.011.28 ± 0.171-bp ≤ 0.001.NTG31 ± 1.067.6 ± 0.72.1 ± 0.06125.8 ± 0.50.80 ± 0.020.31 ± 0.04n = 3.

All values are means ± S.E., Student'st test was used to determine significant differences. Expression of the mutated protein was first analyzed by examining myofilament proteins derived from the atria of TG animals. Previously, we overexpressed wild type RLC2v in the mouse heart, resulting in complete replacement of atrial RLC2a, while ventricular levels of RLC2v remained constant (17Fewell J.G. Osinska H. Klevitsky R. Ng W. Sfyris G. Bahrehmand F. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1595-H1605PubMed Google Scholar, 20Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Palermo J. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Robbins J. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 501-509PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies showed that overexpression of the ventricular isoform in the atrial compartment resulted in small changes in whole heart function, with modest decreases in the rate of force development and relaxation. However, the mice exhibited no cardiac hypertrophy or chamber dilation. Protein from these mice (line 97) was included as controls in the following analyses. The ventricular and atrial isoforms of RLC2 can be resolved by SDS-PAGE, and examination of the atrial myofibrillar protein composition of juvenile and adult mice shows a progressive replacement of RLC2a with the mutated RLC2v (Fig.3 A). In young mice (3 weeks old), the highest expressing lines (21 and 35) show 50% replacement, while line 42 shows little or no replacement. However, by 3–4 months the two high expressing lines show complete replacement, while line 42 shows approximately 50% replacement. Note that for both the RLC2v and RLC2v(P−) overexpressors, no overt changes in contractile protein stoichiometry occurred (Fig. 3 A). To determine ventricular replacement, a gel system capable of resolving RLC2v from RLC2v(P−) was developed. A 21% SDS-PAGE resolved the 48-dalton differences in size between the mutated and endogenous proteins (Fig. 3 B). The data show that both line 35 and 21 have a nearly complete RLC2v → RLC2v(P−) shift, whereas there is little or no replacement in line 42. In all cases, the myofibril protein stoichiometries were maintained as evidenced by no net increase in total RLC2v protein, a result consistent with previous data obtained for the RLC2v(wt) overexpressors (20Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of a discernable gross cardiac phenotype in the low overexpressors (line 42) and essential identity observed between lines 21 and 35, both of which expressed identical levels of the transgene and showed biatrial hypertrophy, the analyses carried out below focused only on line 21. To determine if detectable phosphorylatable RLC2v was left in TG ventricles, we attempted to resolve the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms by PAGE but were unsuccessful. Therefore, the RLC2v phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig.4). The species corresponding to RLC2v and the phosphorylated form were initially identified by Western blot analysis; multiple analyses showed that in NTG ventricles, 10–30% of the RLC2v is phosphorylated (Fig. 4, top panel). In TG animals, phosphorylated RLC2v could not be detected. These data, in conjunction with the SDS-PAGE analyses, indicate that not only is phosphorylation completely ablated in the TG RLC2v(P−), but little endogenous RLC2v remains in the adult ventricles of line 21 (and line 35)2 TG animals. In light of the histological abnormalities observed in lines 21 (Fig. 2 C) and 35,2 we were interested in determining if there were ultrastructural changes in the RLC2v(P−) TG mice. If the RLCs ofDrosophila indirect flight muscles are replaced by a nonphosphorylatable variant, no changes at the ultrastructural level take place (14Tohtong R. Yamashita H. Grahm M. Haeberle J. Simcox A. Maughan D. Nature. 1995; 374: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Hearts from line 21 animals were then chosen for detailed ultrastructural study using transmission electron microscopy. First, cursory screening of 1-μm epon resin sections from LV fragments of TG mice revealed irregularly shaped cardiomyocytes, the presence of vacuoles, and an irregular distribution of mitochondria (data not shown). At the ultrastructural level, cardiomyocytes from TG LVs revealed more striking abnormalities (Fig.5). Normal NTG myocytes show tightly packed sarcomeric arrays and clearly defined intercalated discs (Fig.5 A), while myofibril degeneration presents in the RLV2v(P−) cardiomyocytes. In many cases, sarcomeric organization is lost and the intercalated discs are convoluted. Large interstitial spaces separate the myocytes, and there is increased collagen deposition (Fig. 5,B–D). Some myocytes, apparently in the final stages of degeneration, were filled with vacuoles, although all had intact sarcolemmal membranes. Based upon the histological analyses, it appeared that the LV of the TG hearts might be mildly aberrant, although no increases in the LV free wall weights could be detected (Table I). Based upon our experience with a number of models, molecular markers of hypertrophy are often elevated in the absence of any detectable histological changes. Indices of the hypertrophic response at the molecular level were determined by transcript analyses of LVs derived from high and low expressing lines (lines 21 and 42, respectively) and compared with transcript levels in the RLC2v(wt) overexpressor as well as with NTG hearts. Transcript levels of ANF, α-skeletal actin and β-MyHC in line 21 animals were significantly elevated when compared with line 42 animals as well as the NTG and RLC2v(wt) controls (Fig. 6). Thus, both TG lines show activation of the hypertrophic markers, and a dose-dependent response is observed, in that the magnitude of the response is consistent with the degree of RLC2v replacement with the nonphosphorylatable species. Analyses of the transcripts for phospholamban and sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase, which can be down-regulated during heart failure, reveal only very modest decreases, indicating that these hearts remained quite healthy and show no signs of decompensating into failure. No sign of a hypertrophic response at the molecular level could be discerned in the RLC2v(wt)-overexpressing line, indicating that isoform replacement in the atria and/or increased levels of total RLC2v transcript in all four cardiac compartments were not responsible for the observed phenotype. In skeletal muscle, RLC2v phosphorylation results in increased sensitivity to activating Ca2+ levels, leading to a leftward shift in the force-Ca2+ curve. In line 21 mice, RLC2v cannot be phosphorylated. To test the effect of this change on fiber Ca2+ sensitivity, skinned fiber bundles from LV papillary muscles were isolated from 8-week-old TG (line 21) and NTG hearts. At this stage of development, the pathological and histological changes have not yet occurred. Under normal isolation conditions, the fibers as isolated are completely dephosphorylated. However, treatment with MLCK results in approximatel"
https://openalex.org/W2057518135,"SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin are SNARE proteins that mediate fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. Membrane attachment of syntaxin and synaptobrevin is achieved through a C-terminal hydrophobic tail, whereas SNAP-25 association with membranes appears to depend upon palmitoylation of cysteine residues located in the center of the molecule. This process requires an intact secretory pathway and is inhibited by brefeldin A. Here we show that the minimal plasma membrane-targeting domain of SNAP-25 maps to residues 85–120. This sequence is both necessary and sufficient to target a heterologous protein to the plasma membrane. Palmitoylation of this domain is sensitive to brefeldin A, suggesting that it uses the same membrane-targeting mechanism as the full-length protein. As expected, the palmitoylated cysteine cluster is present within this domain, but surprisingly, membrane anchoring requires an additional five-amino acid sequence that is highly conserved among SNAP-25 family members. Significantly, the membrane-targeting module coincides with the protease-sensitive stretch (residues 83–120) that connects the two α-helices that SNAP-25 contributes to the four-helix bundle of the synaptic SNARE complex. Our results demonstrate that residues 85–120 of SNAP-25 represent a protein module that is physically and functionally separable from the SNARE complex-forming domains.

Our results demonstrate that residues 85–120 of SNAP-25 represent a protein module that is physically and functionally separable from the SNARE complex-forming domains. Intracellular membrane trafficking depends on specific interactions between vesicles and target membranes. Biochemical and genetic studies demonstrate that integral membrane proteins referred to as SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factorattachment protein receptors) are important elements in this process (1Rothman J. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 2Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The best characterized SNARE proteins are those that mediate synaptic vesicle exocytosis in nerve terminals (reviewed in Ref. 3Sudhof T. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associatedprotein of 25 kDa) and syntaxin are plasma membrane proteins that bind to the synaptic vesicle protein, synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein. The critical role that these proteins play in neurotransmission is underscored by the fact that all three are targets of tetanus or botulinum neurotoxins that block neurotransmitter release. SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin bind to each other to form a stable heterotrimeric complex that consists of a four-helix bundle (4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar,5Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.-K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). SNAP-25 contributes two helices from its N- and C-terminal domains; syntaxin and synaptobrevin each provide one. Syntaxin and synaptobrevin are anchored in opposing membranes through transmembrane domains at their C termini. The parallel orientation of these membrane-anchored helices within the complex has led to a model in which the zippering action of complex formation brings the membranes together, with the energy of complex formation driving membrane fusion (6Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Lin R.C. Scheller R.H.

Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). However, whether SNARE proteins directly mediate fusion remains uncertain (9Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Unlike synaptobrevin and syntaxin, SNAP-25 is associated with membranes through palmitoylated cysteines found near the center of the molecule (10Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich sequence is contained within the linker between the N- and C-terminal helices that SNAP-25 contributes to the core synaptic fusion complex (4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). The structure of the linker domain is unknown, but is presumed to be exposed and disordered in the complexin vitro because of its susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage (11Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennet M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11370-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In any case, this region of SNAP-25 has to be sufficiently extended to accommodate the parallel orientation of both SNAP-25 helices in the synaptic fusion complex (4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is one of several lipid modifications that otherwise soluble polypeptides use to associate with the cytoplasmic face of intracellular membranes (reviewed in Ref. 13Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). SNAP-25, GAP-43 (growth-associated protein of43 kDa), and cysteine string protein are examples of proteins modified by thioester-linked palmitate at multiple cysteine residues. Other proteins located at the plasma membrane are modified sequentially with two different lipid moieties. These include many non-receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein α-subunits that are fatty acylated with both amide-linked myristate and thioester-linked palmitate and certain isoforms of Ras that are prenylated and palmitoylated. The role that different lipid moieties play in the trafficking of newly synthesized proteins to their resident membranes is beginning to be defined. Dual lipidation by myristoylation and palmitoylation appears to confer rapid targeting of p59fyn, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, to the plasma membrane, whereas modification with palmitate alone is associated with slower kinetics of membrane association of GAP-43 and SNAP-25 (14van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously in neuronal cell lines that palmitoylation of SNAP-25 and GAP-43, but not Goα, is sensitive to agents such as BFA 1The abbreviations used are: BFA, brefeldin A; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction that disrupt the secretory pathway (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with at least two pathways for targeting lipid-modified proteins to the plasma membrane. Lipidated proteins are typically modified near their N or C termini. SNAP-25 is unusual in this regard with its centrally located cysteine cluster. This motif is distinct from the N-terminal palmitoylation motifs found on other neuronal proteins such as GAP-43 and SCG-10. The first 35 amino acids of SCG-10, which include the palmitoylated cysteines at positions 22 and 24, contain the membrane-targeting information (16Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.-H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Membrane association of GAP-43 is dependent upon palmitoylated cysteines at positions 3 and 4 (17Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10714-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the palmitoylated cysteines are necessary for membrane association of SNAP-25 (18Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Veit M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined whether the cysteine-rich domain is sufficient to confer plasma membrane localization. Indeed, we have suggested previously that SNAP-25 may bind to syntaxin (or another protein) to facilitate the subsequent interaction of SNAP-25 with a palmitoyltransferase (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to define and characterize the plasma membrane-targeting domain of SNAP-25. Using a deletion and mutagenesis strategy, we mapped the minimal region of SNAP-25 required for membrane localization to a centrally located 35-amino acid sequence. In addition to the palmitoylated cysteines, plasma membrane localization of SNAP-25 also requires a novel five-amino acid motif at the C terminus of this membrane-targeting domain. The SNAP-25/GFP constructs discussed in this paper are summarized in Fig. 1. Standard molecular cloning techniques were used to manipulate DNA (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The integrity of all constructs derived from PCR products was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmids pEGFP-N and pEGFP-C, which fuse the GFP coding region to the 3′- or 5′-end of the inserted sequence, respectively, were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Dr. Michael C. Wilson (University of New Mexico) kindly provided the SNAP-25b cDNA. Full-length SNAP-25 was inserted into pEGFP-C as a KpnI/BamHI fragment (GFP/1–206). 1–142/GFP was first introduced into pEGFP-N as aKpnI/SmaI fragment. To eliminate the 5′-untranslated region in 1–142/GFP, we generated a 5′-oligonucleotide that introduces a XhoI site and anneals to the first 18 bases of the SNAP-25 open reading frame. The PCR product encoding residues 1–142 of SNAP-25 was introduced into pEGFP-N as aXhoI/SmaI fragment. PCR products encoding residues 1–115 and 1–120 of SNAP-25 were cloned into pEGFP-N asXhoI/BamHI fragments. SNAP-25 residues 45–142 and 56–142 were inserted into pEGFP-N asXhoI/SmaI fragments. The constructs 56–95/GFP and 1–95/GFP were generated using a 3′-reverse oligonucleotide annealing across the unique HindIII site of the SNAP-25 coding region and 5′-oligonucleotides annealing at appropriate start sites. The PCR products were then introduced into pEGFP-N asBglII/HindIII (56–95/GFP) andXhoI/HindIII (1–95/GFP) fragments. The PCR product encoding residues 85–120 was cloned into pEGFP-N as aXhoI/BamHI fragment. An in-frame ATG codon was included in the 5′-oligonucleotide primers for SNAP-25 constructs with N-terminal deletions. To replace all four cysteine residues with alanines in 1–142/GFP, a two-step construction was used. First, residues 85 and 88 were mutated using a PCR-based strategy. A PCR product was generated using a 5′-oligonucleotide corresponding to the first 18 bases of the SNAP-25 open reading frame and a mutant 3′-reverse oligonucleotide that annealed across the unique HindIII site of the SNAP-25 coding sequence. The plasmid 1–142/GFP was digested withHindIII and XhoI to generate a vector containing 95–142/GFP. The C85–88A PCR fragment (XhoI/HindIII) was ligated with the vector. The resulting plasmid was used as template to mutate cysteine residues 90 and 92, using a similar strategy. Gln116, Pro117, and Arg118 of SNAP-25 were mutated to alanine in the context of the 85–120/GFP fusion using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). NG108 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 150 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown in six-well or 35-mm tissue culture plates coated with poly-l-lysine until 50–80% confluent. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed 24 h later. Twenty hours after transfection, NG108 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with freshly prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and coverslips were mounted on slides with a drop of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope coupled to an MRC-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) with a 63× oil immersion objective. Confocal images were assembled as montages using Adobe Photoshop Version 3.0 and Canvas 3.5 Cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [3H]palmitate for 90 min as described (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the cells along with the radiolabel (final concentration of 10 μg/ml). Control cells were incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide alone. Cells were solubilized with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and processed for immunoprecipitation as described (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH). Radiolabeled polypeptides were detected by fluorography. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were detectable after 2 or 3 h, and [3H]palmitate-labeled proteins after overnight exposure. Cells growing in 100-mm dishes were transfected with the appropriate constructs and, 16–20 h after transfection, were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in a hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). After a 15-min incubation, cells were homogenized with 20 passes through a ball-bearing homogenizer and pelleted at 800 × g for 5 min. The pellet consisting of unbroken cells and nuclei was designated P1. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant (S100 fraction) was mixed with an equivalent volume of 2× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The 100,000 × g pellet (P100 fraction) was solubilized by suspension in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Equal fractions of P1, P100, and S100 were analyzed by immunoblotting. GFP fusion proteins were detected with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) and 125I-labeled secondary antibody (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Quantitation of the immunoblots was performed using a PhosphorImager screen and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). SNAP-25 is localized predominately at the plasma membrane in neurons and neuronal cell lines (21Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 89: 3039-3052Crossref Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 22Oyler G. Polli J. Higgins G. Wilson M. Billingsley M. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 65: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine if GFP could be used as a reporter to characterize the membrane-targeting domain of SNAP-25, we constructed a fusion protein with full-length SNAP-25 fused to GFP (Fig. 1). This construct was transiently transfected into NG108 cells, and its localization was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2 A, GFP alone localized to the cytosol of NG108 cells. In contrast, the SNAP-25/GFP fusion was localized at the plasma membrane and enriched in cellular processes. This pattern is very similar to that of endogenous protein and indicates that full-length SNAP-25 can direct GFP to the plasma membrane. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the fusion protein was the appropriate molecular mass (Fig. 2 B). To identify the minimal plasma membrane-targeting elements within SNAP-25, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of SNAP-25 fused to GFP (Fig. 1). SNAP-25 contains two sets of heptad repeats at the N terminus interrupted by a break in frame (residues 1–42 and 45–90) (23Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A third set of heptad repeats is found in the C-terminal region of the protein between residues 157 and 205. These heptad repeats form α-helices that are involved in intermolecular coiled-coils (4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). We began the analysis by deleting the C-terminal set of heptad repeats (H3 in Fig. 1) and expressed a protein with the N-terminal 142 amino acids of SNAP-25 fused to GFP. As shown in Fig. 3 a, amino acids 1–142 of SNAP-25 were able to target GFP to the plasma membrane, indicating that the C-terminal portion of the protein is not required for proper targeting. As for the full-length protein (18Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Veit M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), plasma membrane localization of the 1–142/GFP chimera depended on the four palmitoylated cysteine residues since a mutant chimeric protein in which the four cysteines were mutated to alanines had a cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 3 b). To further characterize the membrane-targeting domain of SNAP-25, we constructed a truncated chimeric protein lacking the most N-terminal set of heptad repeats (45–142/GFP) (H1 in Fig. 1). Based on studies of in vitro binding reactions of SNAP-25 deletion mutants with syntaxin, the loss of residues 1–44 should eliminate SNAP-25 interactions with syntaxin (23Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane of NG108 cells (Fig. 3 c), indicating that SNAP-25 can associate with membranes independently of interactions with syntaxin. Residues 45–142 of SNAP-25 include the amino acids encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 5 of the gene (amino acids 56–95). The two isoforms of SNAP-25 (a and b) differ at nine residues within this region (24Bark I.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that these differences might confer differential localization of the two isoforms (25Bark I. Wilson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4621-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We tested whether exon 5 encodes all of the membrane-targeting information by fusing residues 56–95 to GFP. As shown in Fig. 3 d, sequences encoded by exon 5 were not sufficient to target GFP to membranes. Extension of this region at the N terminus (1–95/GFP) did not restore membrane localization (Fig. 3 e). However, extension of this region at the C terminus (56–142/GFP) resulted in an appropriate plasma membrane distribution (Fig. 3 f). Thus, residues 1–55 were dispensable for targeting, but some residues between positions 95 and 142 were required for plasma membrane localization. To define the C-terminal boundary of the membrane-targeting domain of SNAP-25, we made serial deletions inward from residue 142. The constructs 1–115/GFP and 1–120/GFP revealed that the N-terminal 115 amino acids were not sufficient to target GFP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 g), but residues 1–120 were (Fig. 3 h). Using residue 120 as the C-terminal boundary, we established the N-terminal boundary of the membrane-targeting domain by making sequential deletions from residues 56 to 85, the position of the first palmitoylated cysteine. As shown in Fig. 3 i, amino acids 85–120 of SNAP-25 were sufficient to target a heterologous protein to the plasma membrane of NG108 cells. Interestingly, this sequence coincides almost exactly with the protease-sensitive interhelical domain (residues 83–120) of SNAP-25 in the SNARE complex (11Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennet M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11370-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All of the deletion constructs were expressed at similar levels and migrated at the predicted molecular mass as assessed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The N-terminal boundary of the membrane-targeting domain was defined as residue 85 because mutation of this site in the context of the full-length protein (or in 1–142/GFP) results in a significant decrease in membrane association and loss of radioactive palmitate incorporation (18Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 2S. Gonzalo and M. E. Linder, unpublished results. To investigate if the chimera 85–120/GFP retains the ability to be palmitoylated, we incubated NG108 cells expressing 85–120/GFP with [3H]palmitate and assayed for incorporation of radiolabel into the immunoprecipitated protein. As shown in Fig. 4, the 85–120/GFP protein (lane 7) incorporated [3H]palmitate, as did the GFP fusion with the full-length sequence of SNAP-25 (lane 3). Palmitoylation and membrane association of newly synthesized endogenous SNAP-25 require an intact secretory pathway in neuronal cell lines (PC12, N2A, and NG108 cells) (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine if palmitoylation of the membrane-targeting domain of SNAP-25 resembles that of endogenous protein, we evaluated the sensitivity of this process to BFA. As shown in Fig. 4, palmitoylation of both full-length SNAP-25 (lane 4) and the membrane-targeting domain (lane 8) was inhibited by BFA. The inhibitory effect of BFA on palmitoylation was not due to decreased protein expression, as equal amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled protein are found in the immunoprecipitates in the presence or absence of drug (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). Our results indicate that the post-translational processing of the membrane-targeting domain of SNAP-25 (residues 85–120) is similar to that of endogenous SNAP-25. Analysis of the deletion mutants revealed that residues 116–120 are required for localization of SNAP-25 at the plasma membrane. Alignment of the sequences of SNAP-25 family members with residues 85–120 of SNAP-25b (Fig. 5) revealed that three of the five residues are absolutely conserved in all of the sequences. To determine if the conserved residues are important for membrane targeting, we made alanine substitutions at Gln116, Pro117, and Arg119 in 85–120/GFP (85–120 QPR/GFP). As shown in Fig.6, 85–120 QPR/GFP was poorly localized at the plasma membrane (center panel). Although some plasma membrane fluorescence was evident, there was prominent cytoplasmic staining when compared with the intact membrane-targeting domain (left panel). However, mutation of the three residues did not inhibit localization as severely as did deletion of all five residues (right panel).Figure 6Plasma membrane localization of the interhelical domain of SNAP-25 requires amino acids 116–120.NG108 cells were transfected with 85–120/GFP (left panel), 85–120 QPR/GFP (center panel), or 1–115/GFP (right panel) and visualized by confocal microscopy.

We analyzed the distribution of 85–120/GFP, 1–115/GFP, and 85–120 QPR/GFP in particulate and soluble fractions of transfected NG108 cells. 85–120/GFP was found predominately in the P100 (membrane) fraction, whereas both 85–120 QPR/GFP and 1–115/GFP were predominately cytosolic (Fig. 7). The results of the subcellular fractionation confirm the localization depicted by fluorescence microscopy. Palmitoylation of the mutated proteins correlated with membrane association. The amount of [3H]palmitate incorporated into 85–120 QPR/GFP and 1–115/GFP was substantially reduced compared with intact 85–120/GFP (Fig. 8). Although the cysteine residues are maintained in both 85–120 QPR/GFP and 1–115/GFP, these data suggest that the five-amino acid motif QPARV facilitates palmitoylation of the protein, thereby promoting membrane association of SNAP-25. In this study, we mapped the minimal region of SNAP-25 that confers targeting specifically to the plasma membrane to residues 85–120. The membrane-targeting domain represents two-thirds of the interhelical loop that connects the N- and C-terminal α-helices of SNAP-25 in the SNARE complex (Fig. 9). We have established that an important function of the interhelical loop is to localize SNAP-25 at the plasma membrane. This function appears to be independent of SNARE interactions since removal of the regions of SNAP-25 that form coiled-coils with syntaxin and synaptobrevin did not interfere with proper targeting of SNAP-25 fusion proteins. It is noteworthy that the membrane-targeting domain coincides almost exactly with the protease-sensitive region of SNAP-25 (residues 83–120) in the SNARE complex. The sensitivity of SNAP-25 residues 83–120 in the complex to proteases (11Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennet M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11370-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the fact that this domain had to be deleted to obtain crystals of the core SNARE complex suggest that it may be disordered in vitro. However, it seems probable that interactions with the bilayer or with other proteins will result in a more ordered structure of the membrane-binding domain. Residues 85–120 of SNAP-25 constitute a membrane-targeting domain with unique characteristics. Plasma membrane association not only is dependent on the stretch of palmitoylated cysteines contained within the first eight amino acids of the targeting sequence (Ref. 18Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and this study), but also requires an additional 27 amino acids. This distinguishes SNAP-25 from other lipid-modified proteins in which the boundary of the membrane-targeting sequence is in close proximity to lipid-modified amino acids. Targeting information for non-receptor tyrosine kinases p59fyn and p56lck is contained in their 10 N-terminal residues (26Zlatkine P. Mehul B. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 673-679PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This region includes the myristoylated glycine at position 2 and two nearby cysteines modified by palmitate. Membrane association of p59fyn is maintained when this sequence is replaced with the first 10 amino acids of GAP-43, which includes two palmitoylated cysteines (14van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). There are two distinct regions of highly conserved sequence across species that can be observed when the predicted membrane-targeting domains of SNAP-25 family members are aligned (Fig. 5). These regions coincide with the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the membrane-targeting domain. The first is the cysteine-rich region (residues 85–92). The second is a five-amino acid motif (QPXR(V/I)) at the C terminus of the domain. Mutation of three of the five amino acids (Gln, Pro, and Arg) to alanine severely compromised localization of the membrane-targeting domain and significantly decreased palmitate incorporation. SNAP-25 is synthesized as a soluble protein, but must associate with a membrane-bound palmitoyltransferase to become fatty acylated (15Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, there must be a mechanism to provide at least transient interaction of SNAP-25 with membranes to permit palmitoylation. We speculate that the C-terminal QPARV motif permits binding of SNAP-25 to a membrane protein, thereby facilitating recognition of SNAP-25 by a membrane-bound palmitoyltransferase (Fig. 9). It is possible that the same molecule displays both functions, i.e. binding to the membrane-targeting domain and palmitoylation. A requirement for membrane association prior to palmitoylation has been observed for a number of palmitoylated proteins. Modification of proteins at tandem lipidation motifs occurs sequentially (reviewed in Ref. 13Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases is dependent upon prior myristoylation. Similarly, prenylation is a prerequisite for palmitoylation of Ha-Ras and N-Ras. These proteins are modified with an N-myristoyl or farnesyl group in the cytoplasm. The addition of the first lipid provides a low affinity interaction with membranes that appears to permit contact with the palmitoyltransferase. The addition of the second lipid significantly increases membrane affinity, resulting in essentially permanent association of the protein on the membrane where it was modified with palmitate (28Shahinian S. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). G-protein α-subunits that are dually modified with myristate and palmitate exhibit a similar interdependence of lipid modifications. However, the failure to palmitoylate myristoylation-defective Gα subunits can be overcome by coexpressing G-protein βγ-subunits (29Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is precedent for interaction of a palmitoyltransferase substrate with a membrane protein other than a palmitoyltransferase prior to its modification. Our finding that the interhelical domain of SNAP-25 confers membrane localization raises the possibility that this region functions similarly in other SNAP-25 family members. Morphological analysis of the yeast exocytic complex confirms that Sec9p, a yeast SNAP-25 homolog, forms a four-helix bundle with the yeast syntaxin homolog Sso1 or Sso2 and synaptobrevin homolog Snc1 or Snc2 (31Katz L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Brennwald P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6200-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane localization of Sec9p in vivo does not require Sso1/2 (32Rossi G. Salminen A. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Brennwald P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16610-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that its membrane localization may be independent of SNARE interactions. Sec9p lacks palmitoylation sites; thus it must associate with membranes through mechanisms other than fatty acylation. SNAP-23 and syndet are ubiquitously expressed isoforms of SNAP-25 that are localized at the plasma membrane (33Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 34Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a newly identified family member, SNAP-29, is localized predominantly on intracellular membranes when transfected into normal rat kidney cells (35Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.-S. Huang B. Shen M. Yu S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Its distribution overlaps with that of markers for the Golgi, thetrans-Golgi network, and endosomal compartments. Sequences directing membrane attachment of SNAP-23 and SNAP-29 have not been well characterized. The cysteine-rich sequence within the membrane-targeting domain of SNAP-25 is conserved in SNAP-23 and syndet as well as the QPXR(V/I) motif (Fig. 5). The sequence similarity strongly suggests conservation of the membrane-targeting function of the interhelical domain. Baldini and co-workers (36Koticha D.K. Huddleston S.J. Witkin J.W. Baldini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9053-9060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have recently reported that plasma membrane localization of syndet requires the cysteine-rich domain (36Koticha D.K. Huddleston S.J. Witkin J.W. Baldini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9053-9060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, residues 89–101 (RTKNFESGKNYKA) of syndet are dispensable for plasma membrane localization (36Koticha D.K. Huddleston S.J. Witkin J.W. Baldini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9053-9060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These residues immediately follow the cysteine stretch in syndet and correspond to a part of the membrane-targeting domain of SNAP-25 that is poorly conserved among family members (Fig. 5). The putative interhelical domain of SNAP-29 lacks palmitoylation sites and has no other sequence similarity to SNAP-25, SNAP-23, and syndet. However, a significant fraction of SNAP-29 behaves as an integral membrane protein when expressed in COS cells. It has been suggested that SNAP-29 is recruited to membranes through interactions with different syntaxins and vesicle-associated membrane proteins, bypassing the need for a strict membrane-anchoring motif and allowing it to function in a variety of compartments (35Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.-S. Huang B. Shen M. Yu S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that SNAP-25 can be targeted to the plasma membrane independently of its interactions with SNARE proteins. However, this does not exclude the possibility that a SNARE-dependent mechanism also exists. It will be important to define the mechanisms of membrane association of SNAP-25 family members to test whether the interhelical domain has a general role in membrane localization or serves a specialized function for neuronal SNAP-25. We thank Dr. Michael Wilson for providing the SNAP-25b cDNA, Drs. Phyllis Hanson and Susan Wente for helpful suggestions, and members of our laboratory for comments on the manuscript."

Iminoribitol analogues of the transition state are nanomolar inhibitors. The results provide new information for purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways in Leishmania. Leishmania species are protozoan parasites transmitted by blood-sucking female phlebotomine sandflies. They infect humans primarily in the Middle East, central Asia, and Africa, but are found on all continents except Australia (1David J.R. Warren K.S. Mahmoud A.A.F. Tropical and Geographical Medicine. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1984: 125-137Google Scholar). Current chemotherapeuric treatments are also toxic to the host. Most of the protozoan parasites lack the pathway for de novo purine synthesis and depend on purine salvage from the host for DNA and RNA synthesis (2Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Several enzymes have been implicated in the purine salvage pathway, including a cell-surface associated enzyme, 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease, that is proposed to generate nucleosides. The nucleosides are further metabolized by nucleoside hydrolases, a family of enzymes which hydrolyze the N-glycosidic bond of purine and pyrimidine ribosides to yield ribose and the bases (3Neubert T.A. Gottlieb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7236-7242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Miller R.L. Sabourin C.L.K. Krenitsky T.A. Berens R.L. Marr J.J. J. Biol.

Structures for the nucleoside hydrolase from Crithidia fasciculata were reported recently, however, there is no structural information on nonspecific nucleoside hydrolases from protozoan parasites with human hosts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the properties of nucleoside hydrolase fromLeishmania relative to those from Crithidia andTrypanosoma (11Parkin D.W. Horenstein B.A. Abdulah D.R.

Cell-free extracts from a variety of protozoan parasites indicate the existence of several nucleoside hydrolase isozymes with differing substrate specificities. The most abundant nucleoside hydrolase inC. fasciculata is IU 1The abbreviations used are: IU, inosine-uridine; GI, guanosine-inosine; IAG, inosine, adenosine, guanosine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid-nucleoside hydrolase, a nonspecific enzyme that catalyzes efficient hydrolysis of both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (11Parkin D.W. Horenstein B.A. Abdulah D.R. Estupinan B. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20658-20665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second nucleoside hydrolase fromC. fasciculata, GI-nucleoside hydrolase, prefers purine nucleosides as substrates (12Estupinan B. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23068-23073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the two nucleoside hydrolases from C. fasciculata, a purine-preferring nucleoside hydrolase from the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei brucei has been characterized and named IAG-nucleoside hydrolase since the enzyme prefers inosine, adenosine, and guanosine as substrates (13Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The IU-nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculata is the most extensively studied enzyme in protozoan purine salvage pathways. It has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and mutagenesis studies have identified His-241 as a catalytic site residue that acts as a general acid for leaving-group activation (14Gopaul D.N. Meyer S.L. Degano M. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5963-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The transition state structure of IU-nucleoside hydrolase, determined by kinetic isotope effect measurements, has been shown to have characteristics of an oxocarbenium ion (15Horenstein B.A. Parkin D.W. Estupinan B. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10788-10795Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of unliganded IU-nucleoside hydrolase and the enzyme complexed with p-aminophenyl-(1S)-iminoribitol, a transition state inhibitor, have been solved by x-ray crystallography to 2.5- and 2.3-Å resolution, respectively (7Degano M.

The sequence alignment search using the amino acid sequence of the IU-nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculata found an est-cDNA clone of unknown function from Leishmania major. High sequence identity was established in the N-terminal 48 residues of deduced amino acid sequence (14Gopaul D.N. Meyer S.L. Degano M. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L.

We report here the cloning of the full-length nucleoside hydrolase from L. major, determination of its primary amino acid sequence, its expression in E. coli, a purification scheme, analysis of substrate specificity, several nanomolar transition state inhibitors, and the 2.5-Å x-ray structure of the enzyme. cDNA clone LM247 phage stock was generously provided by Dr. J. W. Ajioka from the Laboratory for Parasite Genome Analysis at Cambridge University. Lambda phage lysates were prepared from LB plates with dense plaques using bacterial host strain XL1-blue (Novagen Inc.). Phage DNA was isolated using a phage purification kit (Novagen Inc.) and was used as a template for PCR reactions. A 5′-oligonucleotide primer 5′-GCATTTGCGAGCCATGCCG-3′ was designed based on the partial sequence on the 5′-end of the LM247 clone that shows significant sequence identity to the gene sequence of IU-nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculata (14Gopaul D.N. Meyer S.L. Degano M. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5963-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The 5′ primer was used with a 3′-oligonucleotide primer 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGCG-3′ corresponding to the T7 promoter, which is located on the vector λ ZAPII of the LM247 clone. A PCR product of approximately 1.0 kilobases was ligated into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen Inc.). The full sequence of the PCR product showed an 78% amino acid sequence identity to the protein sequence of the IU-nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculata. Primers 5′-CATATGCCGCGCAAGATTATTCTC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCACTGAGGATCGCCGAT-3′ were based on the nucleotide sequence of the 5′- and 3′-regions of the sequenced PCR product and were designed to include restriction sites NdeI and BamHI, respectively. A stop codon, TGA, was also incorporated into the 3′-primer. These were used to amplify the full-length gene by PCR using LM247 Lambda phage DNA as template. The PCR product was purified from a 1% agarose gel using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The cDNA was ligated into the expression vector PMW172 and the construct was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated overexpression of a protein with molecular mass of approximately 34,000 daltons without isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The crude cell extracts gave nucleoside hydrolase activity with both inosine and p-nitrophenyl β-d-ribofuranoside as substrates. The 0.95-kilobase open reading frame for nucleoside hydrolase in the PMW172 expression vector was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells (Novagen Inc.). Cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cell cultures were grown continuously in shaken flasks for 7 h at 37 °C and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were washed with and resuspended in an equal volume 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 15 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm NaCl. The cells were frozen and stored at −70 °C. Frozen cells were thawed in warm water and disrupted with 4 cycles of French press treatment. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 80 min. Neomycin sulfate (10% w/v in H2O) was added slowly with vigorous stirring to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). After centrifugation, solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 40%. The pellet was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a minimum volume of 20 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.8, containing 15 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A), and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the same buffer. The dialysate was applied to a FastQ anion exchange chromatography column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 1.5 column volumes of buffer A and eluted with 4 column volumes of buffered 0–0.3 m NaCl in a linear gradient. The nucleoside hydrolase was eluted between 2.5 and 3.0 column volumes. The fractions containing the nucleoside hydrolase were pooled, concentrated, and loaded on a Superdex 200 chromatography column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA and eluted with the same buffer. The fractions containing nucleoside hydrolase activity were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.3, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The protein was rapidly frozen and stored at −70 °C. Recombinant nucleoside hydrolase fromL. major was crystallized using hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C. The protein was crystallized in the presence of hypoxanthine, which is a product of the enzyme and also inhibits the enzyme at high concentration. Saturated hypoxanthine (6 μl) was air dried on a glass coverslip. On top of the dried hypoxanthine, 3 μl of 13–15 mg/ml protein was mixed with an equal volume of mother liquid containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 16% polyethylene glycol 4000, and was equilibrated against 1.0 ml of the mother liquid in the well. Crystals appeared in 3–5 days in the presence of some amorphous precipitate. Crystals grew in clusters, but single crystals could be separated from the clusters. Diffraction from these crystals is consistent with the monoclinic space group P21 witha = 81.8 Å, b = 79.2 Å,c = 109.8 Å, and β = 91.6o. The crystals contain a tetramer in the asymmetric unit with aV m = 2.54 Å3/Da and a calculated solvent content of 56%. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature from a single crystal of nucleoside hydrolase using a Siemens X-1000 area detector coupled to a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 KV and 80 mA. Radiation from the copper anode was focused through Cross-coupled Gobel mirrors (Bruker AXS) and a 0.3-mm collimator. Indexing and integration of the data frames were carried out using program XDS (19Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryst. 1988; 21: 67-71Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar) and the data was scaled using SCALEPACK from the DENZO package (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Acta Cryst. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Coordinates of the IU-nucleoside hydrolase dimer fromC. fasciculata were used as the search model with all side chains that are different from L. major nucleoside hydrolase trimmed to alanine (7Degano M. Almo S.C. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6277-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Temperature factors of all atoms were reset to 20.0 Å2. Two solutions, corresponding to the orientations and locations of the two homodimers in the asymmetric unit, were generated using 8.0–4.0 Å data. The tetrameric structure generated by molecular replacement was subjected to rigid-body refinement using XPLOR (22Brunger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). TheR cryst dropped from 41.7 to 32.6% andR free was also reduced from 39.5% to 31.5 after 40 steps of rigid-body refinement using 8.0–4.0 Å data. Program O (23Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; B115: 157-171Crossref Scopus (936) Google Scholar) was used to view the structure and build the missing side chains into the electron densities in the 2 F o −F c map. Strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were applied in the initial cycle of refinement and relaxed in the subsequent cycles. The final structure contains residues 2–313 in all four subunits, one Ca2+ for each subunit and a total of 100 water molecules in the tetramer withR cryst of 20.3% andR free of 25.5%. The model shows good geometry with 85.3% of the residues in the most favored region, 13.6% in the additionally allowed region, and 1.1% in the generously allowed region by PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Statistics for the refinement are summarized in TableI. Nucleoside hydrolase was assayed at room temperature or at 30 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. Hydrolysis of inosine to hypoxanthine and ribose was followed by continuous reading of optical absorbance at 280 nm (11Parkin D.W. Horenstein B.A. Abdulah D.R. Estupinan B. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20658-20665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis ofp-nitrophenyl β-d-ribofuranoside was followed by release of the p-nitrophenylate anion which has strong absorbance at 400 nm with extinction coefficient of 14,600m−1 cm−1 under the assay condition (25Pelle R. Schramm V.L. Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2118-2126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of guanosine, adenosine, cytidine, and uridine was monitored by release of reducing sugar at room temperature (11Parkin D.W. Horenstein B.A. Abdulah D.R. Estupinan B. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20658-20665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition constants for inhibitors were measured at a fixed concentration of p-nitrophenyl β-d-ribofuranoside and variable concentrations of inhibitor. The results were fit to the equation: v =V m A/[K m(1 +I/K i) + A], wherev = the initial rate of product formation,V m = maximum catalytic rate, A = substrate concentration, K m = Michaelis constant, and K i = the dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex. This analysis makes the assumption thatA and I (the inhibitor) compete for the catalytic site. The amino acid sequence of the nucleoside hydrolase from L. major contains a total of 315 residues including the N-terminal Met (Table II). Sequence alignment was performed with the IU-nucleoside hydrolase fromC. fasciculata and the IAG-nucleoside hydrolase fromT. brucei brucei (14Gopaul D.N. Meyer S.L. Degano M. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5963-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Pelle R. Schramm V.L. Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2118-2126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The L. majornucleoside hydrolase shares 78% sequence identity with the IU-nucleoside hydrolase but only 20% sequence identity with the IAG-nucleoside hydrolase. The IU-nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculata requires the presence of all three hydroxyl groups, (2′-, 3′-, and 5′-hydroxyls), in the nucleosides to ensure efficient substrate binding and catalysis (11Parkin D.W. Horenstein B.A. Abdulah D.R. Estupinan B. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20658-20665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues involved in hydrogen bonding of the three hydroxyls in the C. fasciculata enzyme include Asp-10, Asp-14, Asp-15, Asn-39, and Asp-242 (Asp-241 inL. major because of one deletion in the amino acid sequence) for the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls and Asn-160, Glu-166, and Asn-168 for the 5′-hydroxyl (7Degano M. Almo S.C. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6277-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All these residues involved in substrate recognition are conserved in the L. major nucleoside hydrolase (TableII). In the IAG-nucleoside hydrolase, the only residues in contact with ribosyl hydroxyls that are not conserved are Asn-39 and Asn-160. In IAG-NH, Asn-39 is replaced by an aspartate which has a similar hydrogen bonding ability, and Asn-160 is replaced by Thr near a 6-amino acid insertion (Table II). The insertion of amino acids GNVFLP in IAG-NH prior to the position corresponding to Asn-160 in the L. major enzyme is likely to be involved in the ability of the IAG-NH to hydrolyze deoxynucleosides more efficiently than the nonspecific nucleoside hydrolases (11Parkin D.W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2118-2126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). His-241 in the IU-NH from C. fasciculata has been proposed to be involved in leaving group activation. Mutation of H241A in the IU-NH resulted in over 2000-fold loss of activity in inosine hydrolysis with no loss in the rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl β-d-ribofuranoside, a substrate that is not activated by leaving group protonation (14Gopaul D.N. Meyer S.L. Degano M. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5963-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Mazzella L.J. Parkin D.W. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2111-2112Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This His residue (242) is conserved in the L. major nucleoside hydrolase. The IAG-nucleoside hydrolase from T. brucei brucei has a Trp in this position which is likely to be involved in its leaving group specificity for purines, possibly as a result of base stacking with Trp. At present there is no structural information for the IAG-nucleoside hydrolase. The extensive amino acid sequence similarity between nucleoside hydrolases from C. fasciculataand L. major suggested closely related catalytic properties. The p-nitrophenyl β-d-ribofuranoside has been shown to be a good substrate for the nonspecific nucleoside hydrolase but a poor one for purine-specific nucleoside hydrolases including the IAG-NH from T. brucei brucei (13Parkin D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This discrimination arises from differences in the catalytic mechanism for transition state formation. Purine-specific nucleoside hydrolases lower the energy of activation to achieve the transition state by applying similar energies to both leaving group activation (protonation or hydrogen bonding) and ribosyl activation (forming a ribooxocarbenium ion). Nonspecific nucleoside hydrolases typified by the IU-NH from C. fasciculata invest most of their catalytic energy into ribooxocarbenium formation. The substrate p-nitrophenyl β-d-ribofuranoside cannot be protonated on the leaving group, but is susceptible to fascile decomposition when the ribosyl group is converted to the oxocarbenium ion. The nucleoside hydrolase from L. major demonstrates the characteristics expected for nonspecific nucleoside hydrolases, including, 1) efficient utilization of p-nitrophenyl β-d-ribofuranoside as a substrate; 2) recognition of both inosine and uridine nucleosides as favored substrates; and 3) some catalytic activity with all of the naturally occurring purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (TableIII). Despite these similarities between the C. fasciculata and L. major enzymes, differences exist in catalytic specificity and efficiency. Thek cat values for inosine of 28 s−1for the C. fasciculata and 119 s−1 for theL. major establish a 4.25-fold increased catalytic turnover for the best purine substrate. The specificity for purines and pyrimidines also differs significantly. Catalytic turnover ratios for uridine/inosine are 5.1 for the C. fasciculata enzyme but only 0.27 for that from L. major. Both thek cat and relative rates of hydrolysis of adenosine and guanosine are slower for the L. major enzyme (Table IV). These properties indicate that the L. major enzyme has evolved to catalyze an increased turnover of inosine, with a loss of catalytic efficiency for other nucleosides. Hypoxanthine is thought to be the major precursor for purine salvage in L. major, and the substrate specificity of this enzyme is well suited to the role (1David J.R. Warren K.S. Mahmoud A.A.F. Tropical and Geographical Medicine. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1984: 125-137Google Scholar, 2Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Metabolic efficiency in a salvage pathway benefits from enzymes withk cat/K m values near diffusion control, approximately 108m−1s−1 for the nucleoside hydrolases. The nonspecific nucleoside hydrolase described here is approximately 2 orders of magnitude from catalytic perfection because of a highK m value. It is possible that inosine transport by the protozoa provides intracellular concentrations above the low micromolar levels found in blood.Table IIIKinetic parameters for nucleoside hydrolase from L. majorSubstrateK mk catk cat/K mμmsec−1m−1/s−1Inosine445 ± 209119 ± 342.7 × 105Uridine234 ± 11232 ± 61.3 × 105Guanosine140 ± 230.59 ± 0.034.2 × 103Adenosine185 ± 460.57 ± 0.043.1 × 103Cytidine422 ± 1750.36 ± 0.058.5 × 102p-NPR3-ap-Nitrophenyl-β-d-ribofuranoside.185 ± 31220 ± 171.2 × 106Initial reaction rates were measured with a minimum of four substrate concentrations under conditions described under “Materials and Methods.” The kinetic parameters and associated errors were determined with fits of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph 3.0.3-a p-Nitrophenyl-β-d-ribofuranoside.

Iminoribitols with 1-S substitutions are transition state inhibitors for the IU-NH from C. fasciculata (6Parkin D.W. Limberg G. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Chen X.Y. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3528-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Inhibitors containing 9-deazadenosine (immucillin A) or 4-amino-5-carbonylamino-3-pyrrolyl (immucillin ACAP) substituents of iminoribitol have been shown to inhibit both C. fasciculata and T. brucei brucei nucleoside hydrolases with nanomolar inhibition constants. 2R. W. Miles, P. C. Tyler, G. B. Evans, R. H. Furneaux, D. W. Parkin, and V. L. Schramm, submitted for publication. These analogues of the nucleoside hydrolase transition state gave inhibition constants of 6.5 and 15 nm for the nucleoside hydrolase from L. major (Table V). These dissociation constants vary less than 2-fold from those of C. fasciculatanucleoside hydrolase but differ more from the K ivalues obtained with the enzyme from T. brucei brucei. Inosine is the best substrate for nucleoside hydrolase from L. major with a K m of 445 μm. The inhibitors of Table V are powerful inhibitors for this enzyme with immucillin A binding 29,700 times more tightly than theK m for inosine, while immucillin ACAP gives aK m/K i ratio of 68,460. These inhibitors would compete very favorably for the catalytic site of nucleoside hydrolase, even in the presence of nanomolar inhibitor and micromolar substrate.Table VTransition state inhibitors for nucleoside hydrolasesThe values for K i with C. fasciculataandT. brucei bruceinucleoside hydrolases are unpublished observations from R.

Nucleoside hydrolase from L. major is folded into a single domain structure containing 12 α-helices and 10 β-strands (Fig.1). The core of the structure consists of a 7-stranded parallel β-sheet (β3, 63–65; β2, 28–35; β1, 3–9; β4, 121–125; β5, 148–152; β6, 186–189; and β10, 288–290) and two α-helices (α1, 13–24 and α11, 242–249). Five α-helices (α3, 105–115; α4, 130–138; α5, 141–145; α7, 173–180; and α6, 167–170) stack above the central β-sheet and three α-helices (α10, 213–228; α12, 296–310; and α9, 201–210) sit beneath the two helices (α1, α11) in the core. Two α-helices (α2, 42–55 and α8, 191–194) are located at the either side of the core. Two 2-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (β7, 254–257 and β10, 291–294; β8, 261–263 and β9, 274–276) are oriented perpendicular to each other and protecting the core structure from the right side. A bound Ca2+ ion is located in the active site cleft formed by β2, β1, β4, β5, α1, and α11 in the core. The enzyme was co-crystallized with saturating hypoxanthine. Although the addition of hypoxanthine improved the crystal morphology, no hypoxanthine molecules were found either in the active site or other part of the protein structure. The long loop connecting β3 and α3 is projecting outwards and is very flexible. Part of this loop (residues 76–83) was modeled as polyalanine because of the poor side chain densities in the electron density maps. L. major nucleoside hydrolase forms a homotetramer that is related by a 222 point symmetry in the asymmetric unit. The four molecules are nearly identical because of the noncrystallographic symmetry restraints applied in the refinement. The packing of the tetrameric structure is rather loose. The tightest interface (A/B or C/D) in the tetramer buries a total of 1957 Å2 surface area, which represents 7.3% of the total solvent accessible surface area for each molecule. The A/B interface includes the β8/β9 (263–282) region and the connection between β5 and α6 (155–165). The interactions are mostly hydrophobic van der Waals contributed by Leu-269, Val-275 from both subunits and two hydrogen bond pairs between side chain of Glu-264 and backbone N of Leu-269, and between side chains of His-157. The other two interfaces (A/D or B/C, A/C or B/D) bury a total of 1685 and 82 Å2surface area, respectively. The crystal structures of apo and complexed IU-nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculatahave revealed a Ca2+ ion bound at the active site (7Degano M. Almo S.C. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6277-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Degano M. Gopaul D.N. Scapin G. Schramm V.L. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Elemental analysis confirmed that the Ca2+ binds to the IU-nucleoside hydrolase with 1:1 molar ratio (7Degano M. Almo S.C. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6277-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the L. major nucleoside hydrolase crystal structure, a single Ca2+ ion is located in each of the molecules in the tetramer and the electron density in the 2 F o −F c maps indicates that the Ca2+ ion is fully occupied in the active site. Crystal structures of Ca2+ complexes indicate that Ca2+ usually binds to oxygen atoms in chelating complexes and the preferred coordination numbers range from 6 to 8 (28Katz A.K. Glusker J.P. Beebe S.A. Bock C.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5752-5763Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In the L. major nucleoside hydrolase, however, only five oxygen ligands are found chelating the Ca2+. The remaining chelation sites are open to solvent contact and it is likely that one or more of these additional sites are in exchange with water. In the structure of IU-NH from C. fasciculata, the sixth chelate position was occupied by an ordered water, but no ordered water is seen here. The distances for the coordination are 2.6 Å to the OD1 of Asp-10, 2.8 and 2.9 Å, respectively, to the OD2 and OD1 of Asp-15, 2.7 Å to the OD2 of Asp-241, and 2.5 Å to the carbonyl O of Thr-126 (Fig.2). The Ca2+ is located near the bottom of the active site cleft and the side chains of these residues point up to chelate the Ca2+. In the C. fasciculata IU-nucleoside hydrolase apoenzyme structure, the coordination to Ca2+ from protein atoms is very similar, but a water molecule is located above the Ca2+ to provide the sixth ligand. In the C. fasciculata structure with bound inhibitor, the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls from the bound transition state inhibitor provide two more ligands to the Ca2+. The mechanistic role of the Ca2+ is to orient substrate in the active site and to position the water molecule for attack at the C1′-anomeric carbon following the formation of the ribooxocarbenium ion (7Degano M. Almo S.C. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6277-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues that make contact to the Ca2+are completely conserved in all three of the well characterized nucleoside hydrolases (Table II). The L. major nucleoside hydrolase is structurally similar to the C. fasciculata IU-nucleoside hydrolase (Fig.3). This is expected from the 78% amino acid sequence identity and conservation of sequences in the catalytic site. The overlap of Cα traces of the two structures reveals differences in the two flexible loop regions. These are the long loop connecting β3 and α3 (76–83), and the loop immediately after α10 (230–235). The root mean square deviation between all Cα atoms excluding the two flexible loop regions is 0.4 Å between the L. major enzyme and the C. fasciculata apoenzyme, and 0.8 Å between the L. major enzyme and the C. fasciculata complex structure. In the C. fasciculatacomplex structure, the two flexible loops moved closer to the active site of the enzyme upon binding of a transition state inhibitor (7Degano M. Almo S.C. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6277-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). L. major is the causative parasite for one of the significant world health infectious diseases. This report is the first structural description of a nucleoside hydrolase from the organism. Although the enzyme is established as a member of the nonspecific nucleoside hydrolases, it has a unique substrate specificity with strong preference for inosine. Its mechanism includes a tightly bound catalytic site Ca2+. Two inhibitors are described that bind >105-fold tighter than theK m for substrate.

Here we report the maximum size of the non-native protein to stay and fold in thecis-cavity. Using total soluble proteins ofEscherichia coli in denatured state as binding substrates and protease resistance as the measure of polypeptide held in thecis-cavity, it was estimated that thecis-cavity can accommodate up to ∼57-kDa non-native proteins. To know if a protein with nearly the maximum size can complete folding in the cis-cavity, we made a 54-kDa protein in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its blue fluorescent variant were fused tandem. This fusion protein was captured in the cis-cavity, and folding occurred there. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer proved that both GFP and blue fluorescent protein moieties of the same fused protein were able to fold into native structures in the cis-cavity. Consistently, simulated packing of crystal structures shows that two native GFPs just fit in the cis-cavity. A fusion protein of three GFPs (82 kDa) was also attempted, but, as expected, it was not captured in thecis-cavity.

Molecular chaperones are a ubiquitous and abundant group of proteins that play essential roles in folding, assembly, and translocation of other proteins within the cell (reviewed in Ref. 1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). One remarkable class of such components is the chaperonins found in bacteria, chloroplasts, mitochondria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotic cytosol. The best studied of these chaperonins are GroEL and its co-chaperonin GroES from Escherichia coli (reviewed in Refs.2Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 3Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 4Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; : 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). GroEL is a large cylindrical protein complex comprising two heptameric rings of 57-kDa identical subunits, and these rings are stacked back to back (5Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy (6Chen S. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Wood S.P. Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. Saibil H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) has indicated that the crystallographically disordered 23-amino acid C-terminal segments of the seven subunits appear to project into the central channel of the cylinder at the level of the ring-ring interface, and hence the central channel of GroEL would function as two cavities, one in each ring. GroES contains seven identical 10-kDa subunits assembled as one heptameric ring (7Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The GroEL ring to which GroES is bound is referred to as cis-ring and the opposite ring astrans-ring. Current understanding of the productive pathway of a GroEL reaction is as follows. (i) Non-native polypeptide binds to GroEL at near the inner rim of the central cavity. (ii) Bind-ing of ATP to the polypeptide-containing ring of GroEL permits the binding of GroES to that ring accompanying the release of polypeptide into an enclosed cage, defined by the GroEL cavity and the dome of GroES, in which folding to the native state can proceed with aggregation being avoided (6Chen S.

Nature. 1993; 366: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 14Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), and GroES is released upon subsequent ATP binding to the trans-ring of GroEL, permitting native or partially folded proteins to leave GroEL (15Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The mechanism described above imposes a physical limit on the size of a polypeptide whose GroEL-assisted folding is strictly GroES-dependent. Examination of the crystal structure of GroEL/GroES/ADP7 complex suggests that GroES binding fixes a drastic upward and outward shift of the apical GroEL domains, thereby increasing the size of the central cavity and forming a dome-shaped chamber ∼85 Å high and ∼80 Å wide. This folding cage, termed thecis-cavity, has the volume (175,000 Å3) equal to a globular protein of ∼142 kDa, assuming a perfect fit (1.23 Å3/Da) (16Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), and this must be the theoretical size limit of protein to be contained in the cis-cavity. Actual size limit, however, appears to be far below this limit, since 75-kDa methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was not able to be held in thecis-cavity (9Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This may be also the case for 72-kDa phage P22 tailspike protein, since its GroEL-mediated folding did not require GroES (17Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins in non-native state can bind to GroEL (in the absence of GroES) or to trans-ring of GroES/GroEL (in the presence of GroES) but cannot fit in the cis-cavity. The question then arises: what is the real size limit of an unfolded polypeptide that can be accommodated within the cis-cavity? To determine this, we have employed the total soluble protein ofE. coli as binding substrate of GroEL. It was previously demonstrated that GroEL binds half of the denatured (in vitro) and 10–15% of nascent (in vivo) soluble proteins of E. coli with molecular size ranging from about 10 to 150 kDa (18Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Ewalt K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1997; 90: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, cis-trans topology of the bound proteins was not clarified in these studies. Using limited proteolysis, we assessed the topology of polypeptides bound to GroEL. Another question related to (but independent from) the above one is: how large a protein can fold within the cis-cavity? To our knowledge, the protomer of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase fromRhodospirirum rubrum (55 kDa) is probably the largest molecule for which GroEL-mediated folding shows strict GroES dependence, an indication of folding in the cis-cavity (20Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). However, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase is a homodimer enzyme, and its catalytic activity, the measure of proper folding, can only be assayed after the release from GroEL to the bulk medium. As a consequence, it is not certain if the protomer of this enzyme completes the folding in the cis-cavity or after the escape from thecis-cavity. Completion of folding in thecis-cavity has been demonstrated only for three relatively small proteins, namely 33-kDa rhodanese (13Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), 27-kDa green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BFP, a mutant green fluorescent protein which emits blue light; BFP-GFP, a protein in which BFP and GFP are fused; DTT, dithiothreitol; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.

Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Here, we generated fused dimer (54 kDa) and trimer (82 kDa) of GFP, and monitored their binding and folding in the cis-cavity. Our results from experiments using total E. coli soluble protein and a GFP dimer clearly show that up to 54–57-kDa protein can be accommodated and can fold in the cis-cavity. ATP, hexokinase, proteinase K, DNase I, and RNase A were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. AMP-PNP, bovine serum albumin, and trypsin were from Sigma. ADP was from Kohjin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride was from Wako (Tokyo, Japan). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and anti-GFP antibodies were obtained from Vector Laboratories and CLONTECH, respectively. GroEL and GroES were purified as follows. E. coli strain BL21(DE3), bearing GroEL expression plasmid pET-EL, was cultured at 37 °C to A 650 nm = ∼0.8, induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were suspended in 25 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, sonicated, and centrifuged (20,000 × g for 20 min). Supernatant fraction was applied on a Butyl-Toyopearl column (Tosoh) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% methanol, and 10% saturated ammonium sulfate, and the column was washed with the same buffer. GroEL was eluted with a 10–0% saturated ammonium sulfate linear gradient. GroEL fractions were collected, dialyzed against 20 mm Na-Pi(pH 7.5), and stored at −80 °C until use. E. coli cells BL21(DE3), bearing GroES expression plasmid pET-ES, was cultured, collected, sonicated, and centrifuged as above. Supernatant was applied on a Butyl-Toyopearl column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 20% saturated ammonium sulfate, and the column was washed with 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% saturated ammonium sulfate, and 10% methanol. GroES was then eluted with a 20–0% saturated ammonium sulfate linear gradient in the buffer without methanol. GroES fractions were applied on a SP-Toyopearl column (Tosoh) equilibrated with 25 mmsodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, and a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) was applied to the column. Fractions of pure GroES were collected, dialyzed against 20 mm Na-Pi (pH 7.5), and stored at −80 °C until use. All GFP mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Kunkel method (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar), and single-stranded DNA of plasmid was obtained by infecting E. coli CJ236 cells with helper phage M13KO7 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A NheI-EcoRI fragment containing thegfp gene was isolated from wild-type GFP-expressing plasmid TU#58 (a kind gift from Dr. Martin Chalfie; Ref. 23Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar), and inserted into pET21c (Novagen) in NheI-EcoRI sites (pET-wtGFP). Using single-stranded DNA of pET-wtGFP as a template, plasmid pET-GFPer was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The plasmid pET-GFPer encodes a mutant GFP (F99S/M153T/V163A) that shows improved folding efficiency (24Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The peak wavelengths of the excitation and fluorescence spectra of this GFP mutant are identical to those of the wild-type GFP. Next, using single-stranded DNA of pET-GFPer as a template, pET-GFP(FRET) and pET-BFP(FRET) were generated. pET-GFP(FRET) encodes a GFP mutant that has two more amino acid substitutions, F64L/S65C, that allow the protein to have a single, red-shifted excitation peak. pET-BFP(FRET)encodes a mutant form of GFP in which three more amino acid substitutions, F64L/Y66H/Y145F, are introduced into pET-GFPer. This mutant emits blue light (25Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). In addition, both pET-GFP(FRET) and pET-BFP(FRET) contained mutations at the 3′-terminus of gfp gene in order to delete crystallographically disordered C-terminal six amino acids, which may have a negative effect on GFP fluorescence (26Li X. Zhang G. Ngo N. Zhao X. Kain S.R. Huang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28545-28549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and to generate a peptide linker segment connecting BFP to GFP in the fused protein to be made. The pET-GFP(FRET) was digested with XhoI, and both termini of the fragment containing gfp gene were ligated together. This procedure generated the plasmid pET-GFP(FRET)His, which expresses C-terminal histidine-tagged GFP. From the pET-BFP(FRET),NheI-(NheI-compatible)XbaI fragment was isolated and ligated into NheI site of pET-GFP(FRET)His. The resultant plasmid, pET-BFPGFP(His), encoded a fusion protein of BFP and GFP with His tag at the C terminus. Amino acid sequence of the protein expressed from this plasmid was deduced as MA-{BFP(S2 … F64L/Y66H/F99S/Y145F/M153T/V163A … G232)}-SGGRLESGGS-{GFP(S2 … F64L/65C/F99S/M153T/V163A … G232)}-SGGRLEHHHHHH. Trypsin cleaves the peptide bonds after Arg in the linker region and in the C-terminal tail. The plasmid pET-BFP(FRET)His, which encoded C-terminal His-tagged BFP, was produced by insertingNspV-BssHII fragment from pET-BFP(FRET) into the similarly cut plasmid pET-GFP(FRET)His. For simplicity, these His-tagged mutant proteins are denoted by GFP, BFP, and BFP-GFP in this paper. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET-BFPGFP(His), cultured at 37 °C toA 650 = ∼0.5, and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for overnight at 15 °C. Cells were harvested, suspended and sonicated in 25 mm Na-Pi (pH 7.5) which contained a protease inhibitor mixture, Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 500 mm NaCl. The disrupted cells were centrifuged (20,000 × g for 20 min), and the supernatant was applied on a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 25 mmNa-Pi (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl. With a 0–500 mm imidazole linear gradient, BFP-GFP was eluted at around 50 mm imidazole. The BFP-GFP fraction was next applied on a Butyl-Toyopearl column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% saturated ammonium sulfate, and eluted with a 20–0% saturated ammonium sulfate gradient. Fractions containing BFP-GFP were collected, dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), and stored at −80 °C until use. BFP and GFP were individually purified through the similar procedures above described from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET-BFP(FRET)His or pET-GFP(FRET)His, respectively. E. coli JM109 cells were cultured in 2× YT broth and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), and 50 mm NaCl, and sonicated in 20 mmNa-Pi (pH 7.5), 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml DNase I, and 10 μg/ml RNase A. The suspension was centrifuged (20,000 × g for 20 min) and the supernatant was incubated with NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce), a primary amine reactive biotinylation reagent, at a molar ratio to protein 75:1 assuming that the average M r of total E. colisoluble proteins was 35,000 (27Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, the solution was dialyzed against 8 m urea. All reactions were carried out at 25 °C. Biotinylated E. colisoluble proteins in 8 m urea (125 μm) was diluted 100-fold into the dilution buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 5 mm KCH3COO, and 5 mm DTT), which contained 2.5 μm GroEL and 5.0 μm GroES. The solution was incubated for 1 min, and nucleotide, 50 μm ATP (1.43 mol/mol GroEL protomer) or 1 mmAMP-PNP (final concentrations), was added. In the case of ADP, the dilution buffer containing 2.5 μm GroEL, hexokinase (0.45 units), 20 mm glucose, and 1 mm ADP, was preincubated for 5 min to remove contaminating ATP. To this solution, 125 μm biotinylated E. coli soluble proteins in 8 m urea was diluted 100-fold and, after 1 min, 2.5 μm GroES was added. The mixtures containing ATP, AMP-PNP, or ADP thus prepared were incubated for 5 min, and then proteinase K was added to 10 μg/ml. After 30 min, reaction was stopped by addition of 5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. The reaction mixture was centrifuged briefly (17,000 × g for 5 min at 25 °C), and an aliquot (80 μl) was applied to a gel filtration HPLC column (G3000SWXL, Tosoh). The column was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 10 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 5 mmKCH3COO, 100 mm Na2SO4at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The (GroES/)polypeptide/GroEL complex was isolated, and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Biotinylated proteins were visualized by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. In the experiments with BFP-GFP, acid denatured BFP-GFP solution (25 μm) in 12.5 mm HCl, 1 mm DTT, 8 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) (final pH 1.5) was diluted 20-fold into the dilution buffer containing 2.5 μm GroEL and 5.0 μm GroES and, after 1 min, 50 μm ATP was added. The following procedures were the same as the above, except that anti-GFP antibodies were used to detect BFP-GFP. GroEL reacted neither with streptavidin nor with anti-GFP antibodies. BFP-GFP folding reactions were carried out at 25 °C. Acid-denatured BFP-GFP solution (25 μm) was diluted 25-fold into the dilution buffer containing 2.0 μm GroEL, 4.0 μm GroES, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The solution was incubated for 1 min, and 40 μm ATP was added to start GroEL-mediated folding. After a 20-min incubation, the solution was subjected to a brief centrifugation (17,000 × g for 5 min at 25 °C) and an aliquot (50 μl) was injected into a gel filtration HPLC column (G3000SWXL, Tosoh). Elution was monitored with an on-line spectrophotometer and an on-line fluorometer (FS-8010, Tosoh). Cleavage of BFP-GFP, BFP, and GFP by trypsin was carried out at 25 °C under two conditions. For SDS-PAGE, 10 μg of BFP-GFP, BFP, or GFP was incubated in a 50-μl solution containing 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 20 mm CaCl2, and 6 μg of trypsin. At the time indicated, an aliquot (10 μl) was taken out and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (5 mm, final concentration) was added to stop the reaction. Aliquots treated in this manner were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained by Coomassie Blue R-250. For the spectroscopic analysis, 20 μg of BFP-GFP was incubated in a 1.2-ml solution containing 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 20 mmCaCl2, and 30 μg of trypsin, and fluorescence spectra by excitation light at 380 nm were measured with a fluorometer (FP-777, Jasco) at indicated time intervals. The sites of XhoI andXbaI were introduced into pET-GFPer at the 3′-terminus of the gfp gene and a resultant plasmid, pET-GFPer+c, was digested with XhoI. The fragment that contained thegfp gene was ligated both ends together to attach 6×His tag at the C terminus of GFP and was named pET-GFP(His). Two gfpgenes containing NheI-XbaI fragment obtained from pET-GFPer+c were ligated into the NheI site of pET-GFP(His), and a plasmid, pET-3GFP(His), encoding a GFP trimer with a C-terminal 6×His tag was produced. The linker sequence connecting each GFP moiety was Arg-Gly-Leu. GFP trimers were expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) transformed with pET-3GFP(His) as inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were washed with 1% Triton X-100, solubilized in 100 mm Na-Pi (pH 7.5), 6 mguanidine-HCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and applied on a Ni-NTA-agarose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 100 mm Na-Pi (pH 7.5), 8m urea, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and was eluted with a linear gradient from 100 mm Na-Pi (pH 7.5) to 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.0) in 8 murea, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Fraction of GFP trimer was dialyzed to 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 murea, and stored at −80 °C until use. This GFP trimer preparation was not completely homogeneous but pure enough for the following experiment. The protease sensitivity experiment was carried out in the same manner as described in the experiment with BFP-GFP, except that 20 μm denatured GFP trimer in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 m urea, 12.5 mm HCl, 1 mmDTT (final pH 3.0) was diluted 50-fold into the dilution buffer containing 1.0 μm GroEL and 2.0 μm GroES. Next, 20 μm ATP and then 4 μg/ml proteinase K were added as indicated. Concentrations of GroES and GFP were determined spectrophotometorically. Extinction coefficients at 280 nm used for GroES, BFP-GFP, BFP, and GFP were 1500 (28Bochkareva E.S. Lissin N.M. Flynn G.C. Rothman J.E. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6796-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 35,020, 16,170 and 18,850 m−1 cm−1, respectively. The values for the GFPs were calculated based on the amino acid composition using DNASTAR software. Concentration of other proteins were determined with a method by Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). In this paper, the molar concentrations of GroEL, GroES are expressed as those of oligomers. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 13% of gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Polypeptides bound to GroEL are highly susceptible to proteolysis (8Martin J. Mayhew M. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1993; 366: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 31Martin J.

This is because polypeptide attached at the cis-ring of GroEL becomes sequestered in thecis-cavity upon binding of GroES and is protected from protease. Taking advantage of this protection, we analyzed the size of the proteins that were able to be accommodated in thecis-cavity (Fig. 1). Total soluble protein of E. coli was urea-denatured, biotinylated, and used as binding substrate that was the mixture of proteins of various size (Fig. 1, Total labeled protein). The mixture was diluted into the buffer containing GroEL and GroES, and allowed to form polypeptide/GroEL complex. Then, for indicated cases, ATP, ADP, or AMP-PNP was added to form GroES/polypeptide/GroEL complex. Note that the amount of ATP was slightly over the stoichiometric amount to the GroEL protomers (1.43 mol of ATP/mol of protomer) so that most ATP would be exhausted before the release of polypeptides from GroEL, which was also an ATP-requiring process. The complex was isolated with gel filtration HPLC, electrophoresed, blotted onto a membrane, and visualized by using biotin tag. Polypeptides of various size ranging from about 8 to 110 kDa were found to be associated with the GroEL complex for all samples (Fig. 1, lanes 1, 3,5, and 7). By treatment with proteinase K prior to HPLC, polypeptides associated with the complex that had been formed in the absence of nucleotide disappeared completely (Fig. 1, lane 2). However, in the cases of the complexes that had been formed in the presence of nucleotides, significant amount of polypeptides were protected from digestion even though majority of bound polypeptides disappeared (Fig. 1, lanes 4, 6, and8). Polypeptides lost by the protease treatment may represent those bound to trans-ring of GroEL and possibly those improperly bound to cis-ring. The protease-resistant polypeptides represent a fraction of polypeptides held in thecis-cavity; noticeably, they are all smaller than the 57-kDa GroEL subunit. Therefore, we have concluded that the maximum molecular size to be contained in the cis-cavity is ∼57 kDa. The above experiments did not reveal whether folding in the cis-cavity would be possible for the proteins with nearly maximum size. To determine this, we made a 54 kDa BFP-GFP in which blue fluorescent variant of GFP (BFP) and green fluorescent GFP 2In this paper, we use the term GFP often as a folding-efficient GFP mutant (see “Materials and Methods”) in the sentences where there is no possible confusion. were fused in a single polypeptide. Both BFP moiety and GFP moiety in the BFP-GFP purified from expressingE. coli cells were proved to have native structures from two criteria. As in the case of wild-type GFP, individual monomers of BFP and GFP were resistant to trypsin digestion (Fig.2 A, left andcenter lanes). Shift of the original protein band to a slightly lower band with increasing incubation time reflected the cleavage of the C-terminal tail connecting His tag. When the BFP-GFP was treated with trypsin, the linker regions were cleaved by trypsin and the BFP-GFP band disappeared in parallel with appearance of stable bands of GFP and BFP that were no longer digested except for cleavage of the GFP C-terminal tail (Fig. 2 A, right lanes). Another support for native structures of BFP and GFP moieties in the BFP-GFP was the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). When the BFP moiety of the BFP-GFP was excited by 380 nm light, excitation of the GFP moiety was induced and eventually the BFP-GFP emitted green fluorescence at 520 nm (Fig. 2 B, trace 1). This efficient FRET can occur only when BFP and GFP moieties are located very closely, in the same protein in this case. In fact, as BFP and GFP moieties in the same BFP-GFP were allowed to diffuse apart each other by trypsin cleavage of the linker region, FRET disappeared; the green fluorescence decreased, and the blue fluorescence from BFP increased (Fig. 2 B, traces 2–6). Experiments similar to those for E. coli soluble proteins were carried out for the BFP-GFP. The native BFP-GFP was denatured by acid and used for the experiments. Acid-denatured BFP-GFP was able to restore the native structure spontaneously upon dilution into the neutral pH buffer. Both BFP and GFP moieties in BFP-GFP folded in similar kinetics, and half-maximal fluorescence was recovered at 133 and 150 s after dilution, respectively (data not shown). These rates were several times slower than those of monomer BFP and GFP (21Makino Y. Amada K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Experimental procedures were dilution of acid denatured BFP-GFP into the neutral buffer containing GroEL and GroES, with or without addition of ATP, with or without proteinase K treatment, isolation of the GroEL complex with HPLC, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting. The denatured BFP-GFP was able to bind to GroEL in the absence of ATP (Fig.3 A, lane 1), but it was digested completely by proteinase K (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). In contrast, when ATP was added, some amount of GroEL-bound BFP-GFP was resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). This indicates that full length of the BFP-GFP polypeptide can be accommodated within thecis-cavity. Next, we monitored HPLC elution of the complex formed in the presence of ATP and found that the complex emitted green fluorescence of GFP by 380 nm excitation light, a suitable excitation light for BFP (Fig. 3 B). This fluorescence was really emitted from the BFP-GFP held in the cis-cavity of the GroES/GroEL complex, since addition of EDTA, which induced the release of GroES from GroEL, resulted in disappearance of fluorescence from the GroEL peak fraction (data not shown). Folded, free BFP-GFP was also eluted at 19 min, which were probably BFP-GFP molecules released from the cis-cavity and/or trans-ring of GroEL. Because native BFP-GFP by itself does not bind to GroEL (data not shown), native BFP-GFP associated with the GroES/GroEL complex should be a product of folding in the cis-cavity. To analyze contribution of FRET to the fluorescence at the GroEL peak fraction of HPLC, the GroES/BFP-GFP/GroEL complex was isolated, and its fluorescence spectrum was measured (Fig. 3 C). In principle, the spectrum would have been the sum of contributions of fully folded BFP-GFP, in which both BFP and GFP moieties completed folding, and of half-folded BFP-GFP, in which only one of moieties completed folding. We estimated the relative contribution of the fully folded BFP-GFP in the observed spectrum on the assumption that the populations of two kinds of half-folded BFP-GFP (“BFP-only” molecule and “GFP-only” molecule) were the same. Based on this assumption and using the spectra in Fig. 2 B as references, one can calculate that the spectrum in Fig. 3 C is generated by a mixture of ∼60% fully folded BFP-GFP and ∼40% half-folded BFP-GFP. The spectrum of 100% fully folded BFP-GFP, as well as the spectrum of 100% half-folded BFP-GFP (=0% fully folded BFP-GFP), at the same concentration of BFP-GFP are also calculated and shown in Fig.3 B (100% and 0%). The assumption of equal population of BFP-only molecules and GFP-only molecules may not be far from the case, since inherent folding ability of BFP and GFP moieties in BFP-GFP are similar as described in the above paragraph. Furthermore, even without this assumption, occurring of FRET in the GroES/BFP-GFP/GroEL complex is evident. If whole fluorescence at 510 nm by 380 nm excitation light of the observed spectrum in Fig.3 C has been emitted solely by GFP-only molecules but not derived from FRET, we can predict the amount of GFP-only molecules and hence the intensity of the 510 nm fluorescence excited by 480 nm light, an optimum excitation light for GFP. However, the observed intensity at 510 nm excited by 480 nm was much smaller than the predicted one (data not shown) and could not be explained without FRET. Altogether, we conclude that significant fraction of BFP-GFP molecules within thecis-cavity achieve complete folding; both BFP and GFP moieties reach the native structures. We also made an 82-kDa protein consisting of three GFPs. The denatured GFP trimer could bind to GroEL in the absence and presence of ATP (Fig.4, lanes 1 and 3), but, as expected, bound GFP trimer was completely digested by proteinase K (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 4). ATP did not protect bound GFP trimer from digestion. The GFP trimer is too large to be accommodated in the cis-cavity. Although the crystal structure of GroES/GroEL complex imposes ∼142 kDa as a physical size limit of protein to be accommodated in the cis-cavity (16Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), the actual size limit has not been determined by experiments. Here, we have shown that up to ∼57-kDa protein, but no larger proteins, can be accommodated in thecis-cavity and that at least a 54-kDa protein can finish folding there. Thus, actual size limit is less than half of the maximum physical size limit. Folding intermediates have more expanded volume, and random thermal motion of polypeptide chain of the intermediate should be allowed to find the proper interactions between segments distant in the primary sequence. Also, because interactions with surrounding water molecules are essential to stabilize native structure of the soluble proteins, the cis-cavity must contain many water molecules for the folding intermediate to reach the native structure. Entropic burden to pack a large extended polypeptide chain into a restricted space may be another factor limiting the size. The shapes of folded, native proteins are not always exactly globular, and the fit of the shape of native protein with that of thecis-cavity may also be important. The 54-kDa protein we tested for folding is a fused dimer of GFP, and a monomer GFP is a 27-kDa protein with the shape of a cylinder, which has a diameter of ∼30 Å and length of ∼40 Å (33Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar, 34Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Using the crystal structures of GFP and GroES/GroEL complex, we tried to pack the GFP dimer into thecis-cavity and found that the dimer can just fit in thecis-cavity without steric collision (Fig.5). Three GFP molecules cannot fit in by any means. Interestingly, a 56-kDa T4 phage head protein (gp23) may not be contained in the cis-cavity underneath GroES and the phage encodes its own derivative of GroES, gp31, which can form a larger cis-cavity to accommodate gp23 (35Hunt J.F. van der Vies S.M. Henry L. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 1997; 90: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Now that ∼57 kDa is the cut-off size of the cis-cavity, how do the larger proteins fold in vivo? Pulse-labeling experiment of E. coli cells showed that proteins larger than 57 kDa actually bound to GroEL, even if the population was small and commitment of GroES was not clear (19Ewalt K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1997; 90: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the bound large proteins were retained to GroEL in a more stable manner during the chase period than the proteins of molecular size 25–55 kDa. Implication of this observation remains open. It was recently reported that hsp60 (GroEL homologue)-mediated in vivo folding of a 87-kDa mitochondrial aconitase in yeast was dependent on hsp10 (GroES homologue) (36Dubaquie Y. Looser R. Funfschilling U. Jeno P. Rospert S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5868-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The question of whether GroEL (and GroES) indeed assists the folding of large proteins in vivo has not been answered and should gain more attention."

These studies show that LKLF plays an important role in normal lung development. During mouse embryogenesis, normal lung development is initiated at 9.5 days post coitus (pc) 1The abbreviations used are: pc, post coitus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; LKLF, Lung Kruppel-like factor; ES, embryonic stem; GPI, glucose phosphate isomerase; TTF, thyroid transcription factor; TGF, transforming growth factorin the form of two endodermally derived epithelial buds that arise from the primitive foregut (1Ten Have-Opbroek A.A.W.

As the epithelial buds invade the surrounding mesenchyme, they undergo a defined pattern of branching morphogenesis and differentiate into conducting and respiratory airways of the adult lung, whereas the surrounding mesenchyme forms the lung stroma. Although cells in these compartments appear to be undifferentiated, they express lung-specific genes at this early time. Initial patterning of the lung occurs during the pseudoglandular stage of lung development (9.5–16 days pc) due to the rapid growth and branching of the primitive lung epithelium to form the tracheobronchial tree and terminal acinar buds. These primitive acini dilate during the canalicular (16–17 days pc) and saccular stages (17 days pc to birth) of lung development to form the respiratory epithelium. Subsequent maturation of the lung parenchyma continues after birth during the process of alveolization (birth to 14 days postnatal) (2Ten Have-Opbroek A.A.W. Exp. Lung Res. 1991; 17: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Transcription factors, in conjunction with growth factors, play important roles in development by regulating cell growth and differentiation. Establishment of cell type-specific patterns of gene expression resulting from the combinatorial action of transcription factors (3Ness S.A. Engel J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Genes that are normally expressed during lung development are ideal candidates for regulation of its development. LKLF is one transcription factor that is highly expressed in lung with limited distribution in other organs (16Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Expression of LKLF during lung development suggests that it has a role in the development of this vital organ. We earlier developed mice with targeted disruption of theLKLF gene with the goal of discerning its role in lung development and function (17Wani M.A. Means R.T. Lingrel J.B Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mice homozygous forLKLF deletion die in utero around 12.5 days of gestation due to severe hemorrhage (17Wani M.A. Means R.T. Lingrel J.B Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This makes it difficult to study the effects of a null mutation on normal lung development beyond the stage of embryonic lethality. One of the strategies to overcome embryonic lethality due to null mutations includes tracking the contribution of embryonic stem (ES) cells in chimeric animals (19Williams B.O. Schmitt E.M.

In chimeric mice that survived birth, mutant ES cell contribution was found in all the major organs examined, except for the lung. Histological examination of the chimeric mice that died at birth revealed abnormalities in their lung development. These result suggest that LKLF expression is important for normal lung development. Embryonic stem cells with one LKLF gene knocked out (17Wani M.A. Means R.T. Lingrel J.B Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were electroporated with anLKLF targeting vector containing a neomycin resistance gene in place of the HPRT minigene used during initial targeting as described earlier (17Wani M.A. Means R.T. Lingrel J.B Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The neomycin gene was under the control ofPGK promoter and contained polyadenylation sequences. The ES cells with one LKLF gene knocked out were electroporated in the second round of targeting under similar conditions as described (17Wani M.A. Means R.T. Lingrel J.B Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Following electroporation, the cells were plated on neomycin-resistant feeder cells and were selected in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium containing 300 μg/ml G418 and 2 μm gancyclovir. The resistant colonies were screened for homologous recombination by PCR. The double targeted cells were expanded for DNA extraction for Southern analysis and subsequent blastocyst injection. DNA extraction and Southern analysis were performed as described (17Wani M.A. Means R.T. Lingrel J.B Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using 32P-labeledLKLF probes as shown in Fig. 3. The double targeted ES cells were grown to confluency, trypsinized, and replated for 2 h, during which time, only feeders attached to the plates. The medium containing the ES cells was collected and pelleted. Total RNA was extracted from ES cells by RNAzol (24Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar) using the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty μg of total RNA were used for Northern analysis, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with 32P-labeled LKLFcDNA. The glucose phosphate isoenzymes were separated and detected as described (25Bradley A. Roberton E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1987: 112-152Google Scholar). Briefly, Titan III Zip Zone cellulose acetate plates (Helena Laboratories) were soaked in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mmTris, 200 mm glycine, pH 8.5) for 20 min before application of the samples. The samples were prepared by homogenizing tissues in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The homogenized tissues were lysed by three rounds of freezing and thawing and centrifuged. The supernatants were electrophoresed in a Zip Zone chamber (Helena Laboratories) for 1.5 h at 150 V and 4 °C. Following electrophoresis, the membranes were stained with 10 ml of 1% agarose solution that contained 80 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 15 mg of fructose 6-phosphate, 2 mg of methylthiazolium tetrazolium, 0.36 mg of phenazine methosulfate, 2 mg of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and 10 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Tissues from neonates were surgically removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in graded alcohol solutions, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis. Immunohistochemistry for PECAM (CD31), surfactant proprotein C, surfactant protein B, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a marker for the developing pulmonary epithelium, was performed as described previously using a biotinylated secondary antibody and an avidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system (26Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 27Zheng X. Wert S.E. Federici R. Peters K.G. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to rat TTF-1 was provided by Dr. Roberto Di Laura (Stazionl Zoological “Anton Dohrn,” Naples, Italy). LKLF +/− mice were mated, and the morning of the appearance of the vaginal plug was counted as 0.5 days pc. Lung buds were isolated from 11.5 days pc embryos under a dissecting microscope and cultured on 8-μm pore size nucleopore membranes (Thomas Scientific) in a chemically defined medium. After the lung bud was isolated from an embryo, its remaining tissue was used for DNA extraction to genotype the embryo forLKLF. The membranes with lung buds were placed in tissue culture dishes containing 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Lung buds were grown at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator. Lung buds grown on membranes were photographed every 24 h for documentation using a dissecting microscope under bright field illumination. The embryos were dissected from the pregnant mother after timed matings and used for whole mount in situ hybridization as described (28Wilkinson D.G. Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1992: 75-83Google Scholar). The RNA probe was synthesized from LKLF cDNA labeled by in vitro transcription using fluoresceinated UTP. The detection of hybridization was done using antifluorescein antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and subsequent staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. RNA was isolated from embryonic lungs using RNAzol (24Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar) and used as a template for reverse transcription primed by oligo(dT). The synthesized cDNA was used for PCR amplification using LKLF primers 5′-CAAGGGGCTGGGTGTGGAAT-3′ and 5′-GGGAGGGAGGGAGGGAAAGA-3′. These primers amplify a 539-base pair LKLF-cDNA fragment. In previous studies, we showed thatLKLF is expressed at high levels in the adult lung and during embryogenesis (16Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To show that LKLF is expressed during lung development, we used whole mount in situhybridization of mouse embryos at different stages of gestation. Expression of LKLF in the lung bud was observed as early as day 11.5 of mouse development (Fig.1 a). Reverse transcription-PCR using RNA from lungs at various stages of development showed thatLKLF is expressed throughout lung development and in the adult lung (Fig. 1 d). The expression pattern in developing, as well as adult, lungs suggests a critical role for LKLF in lung development and function. Interestingly, mice homozygous for LKLF deletion die around midgestation, when lung development has just started (17Wani M.A. Means R.T. Lingrel J.B Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). However, in LKLF mutant animals, the lung bud forms normally until the animals die. These lungs show primitive respiratory tubules with dichotomous branching (Fig. 2). Lung development beyond this point, however, cannot be studied, as the embryos do not survive. In order to follow lung development beyond the time of embryonic lethality, lung buds from mutant embryos were removed at 11.5 days of gestation and were grown in organ culture. Lung cultures were performed in defined medium, and their growth was followed for 4–5 days. Lung buds from wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant embryos showed comparable branching morphogenesis (Fig. 2), suggesting that LKLF expression is not required for development of tracheobronchial tree. Histological analysis of the lung buds grown in culture also showed that the bronchial epithelial growth progressed normally in the mutant lungs buds (not shown), suggesting that LKLF expression may not be required during the pseudoglandular period of lung development. To overcome embryonic lethality and, therefore, study the role of LKLF in lung development, chimeric animals were generated from LKLF −/− ES cells. ES cells bearing disruptions in both LKLF alleles were examined for their contribution to the lung in chimeric animals. LKLFhomozygous mutant ES cells were generated using a two-step targeting procedure (29te Riele J. Maandag E.R. Clark A. Hooper M. Burns A. Nature. 1990; 348: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The heterozygous E14TG2a, an Hprt-deficient ES cell line derived from 129/sv mouse strain, was constructed usingLKLF targeting vector with Hprt minigene as a selectable marker (17Wani M.A. Means R.T. Lingrel J.B Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A single heterozygous ES cell clone was then used for a second round of targeting with another targeting vector to delete the remaining wild type allele. The procedure was identical to the first targeting step except that the Hprt selectable marker was replaced with a neomycin resistance gene (Fig.3 A). Following selection in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium containing G418 and gancyclovir, LKLF −/− ES cell clones were identified by PCR (not shown) for correct targeting of the second allele, which were subsequently confirmed by Southern blotting usingLKLF-specific probes (Fig. 3 B). The correctly targeted cells lack a band that corresponds to the wild type allele, and these cells instead contain an additional band showing homologous recombination between the wild type allele and the LKLF-neomycin targeting vector (Fig. 3 B). Using this strategy, we were able to obtain several LKLF −/− ES cell clones. The two clones that were used for blastocyst injection were analyzed by Northern blot analysis to confirm the lack of LKLF expression. Whereas LKLF expression was seen both in wild type and heterozygous cells, it was not detected in either of the LKLF −/− ES cell clones (Fig. 3 C). The embryonic stem cells derived from mouse strain 129/sv were injected into blastocysts collected from C57Bl/6 mice. The contribution of LKLF-deficient ES cells in the chimeric animals can be estimated by the extent of agouti coat color. Several highly chimeric animals were obtained from the LKLF-deficient cells, and in these, the extent of contribution by LKLF-deficient ES cells was determined in various internal organs. The LKLF-deficient cells are homozygous for the a allele of glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI-1s a), which encodes GPI-1A, whereas the cells from C57Bl/6 host embryo are homozygous forGPI-1s b, encoding GPI-1B (30Lyon M.F. Searle A.G. Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory Mouse. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar). Using cellulose acetate electrophoresis, the two isoforms were separated, and the specific enzyme activity was estimated after staining (25Bradley A. Roberton E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1987: 112-152Google Scholar) (Fig.4). The amount of these activities was used to determine the extent of the contribution by the two different cell types to the development of various tissues. Whereas LKLF-deficient ES cells were able to contribute significantly to various internal organs examined, including skeletal muscle, spleen, heart, liver, kidney, stomach, brain, uterus, testis, skin, and brain, they were not able to contribute to the formation of adult lung in the chimeric mice that survived (Fig. 5). Histopathological examination of mice with high chimerism, as determined by Southern analysis (not shown), that died at birth revealed abnormalities in lung development and/or function. The lungs in these animals were not expanded and appeared to be arrested in the late canalicular stage of lung development with undilated acinar tubules and buds in peripheral regions of the lung (Fig.6 a). In contrast, wild type controls were in the saccular stage of lung development at birth, with well expanded saccular alveoli (Fig. 6 b). This is consistent with the observation that in LKLF −/− embryos, lung development up to pseudoglandular stage is comparable with their wild type littermates when their lung buds are grown in culture. The effect observed on later stages of lung development in vivo, however, could not be detected in organ culture. Immunohistochemistry for surfactant proprotein C, surfactant protein B, and TTF-1, as epithelial cell markers, demonstrated normal type II epithelial cell differentiation (Fig. 6, c and d, and Fig.7, a–d). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry for PECAM, an endothelial cell marker, demonstrated normal vascularization of the tissue (Fig. 7, eand f). The lack of contribution of LKLF-deficient cells to the adult lung of live chimeras in conjunction with delayed lung development in the highly chimeric mice that died at birth suggests that LKLF is an important transcription factor required for later stages of lung development.Figure 5Contribution of LKLF −/− and LKLF +/+ ES cells to various internal organs.

Science. 1997; 227: 1986-1990Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar) of their target genes, in the tissues in which they are expressed. LKLF is highly expressed in lung, with low level expression observed in other tissues (16Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ES cells also express LKLF at very high levels, but these cells apparently maintain their growth and differentiation properties in the absence of LKLF expression. Furthermore, mice lacking LKLF develop normally up to 11.5 days of gestation, implying that LKLF expression is dispensable for ES cell growth, as well as during early stages of organogenesis. In order to determine the biological functions of LKLF, the gene was altered in mouse embryonic stem cells to generate mice with homozygous deletion of the LKLF gene. These mice die during development at midgestation due to severe hemorrhage (17Wani M.A. Means R.T. Lingrel J.B Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,18Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) associated with defects in blood vessel formation (18Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). InLKLF −/− embryos, lung buds are formed, and furthermore, when the lung buds from wild type and mutant embryos are grown in culture, they show comparable branching morphogenesis (Fig.2). In vitro organ culture of lung buds has been useful in understanding the role of certain growth factors (9Serra R. Pelton R.W. Moses H.L. Development. 1994; 120: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and oncoproteins (40Sawai S. Shimono A. Wakamatsu Y. Palmes C. Hanaoka K. Kondoh H. Development. 1993; 117: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in lung development. However, lung explants grown in culture do not undergo sacculation or vascular maturation and generally do not undergo differentiation beyond the pseudoglandular stage of lung development, limiting their use in studying LKLF effects on later stages of lung development. Because of the attendant embryonic lethality in LKLF −/− animals, it is extremely difficult to study in vivo effects of LKLFmutation on lung development beyond midgestation in these animals. The present work describes the creation of chimeric animals with LKLF-deficient ES cells made by two steps of gene targeting. Due to the contribution of the wild type cells from host embryo, some of the animals escaped midgestational lethality caused by germ lineLKLF homozygosity and developed to birth. The strategy of tracking LKLF-deficient ES cells, with both alleles of LKLFinactivated, in live chimeric animals revealed that these cells did not contribute to lung formation in these animals. The chimeric animals that died at birth exhibited abnormal lung development. The lungs in these animals were unexpanded and appeared to be arrested at the canalicular stage of lung development, indicating that LKLF expression is important during later stages of lung development and maturation. This is expected because LKLF −/− embryos, generated from heterozygous crosses, survived up to 11.5–12.5 days of gestation and showed normal onset of lung development that progresses through the pseudoglandular stage in culture. Lung development begins at 9.5 days of gestation as an endodermally derived epithelial bud originating from the pharyngeal region of the gut, which extends into the mesenchyme (1Ten Have-Opbroek A.A.W. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 162: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Ten Have-Opbroek A.A.W. Exp. Lung Res. 1991; 17: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The epithelial buds undergo extensive proliferation and branching in a controlled pattern to form the bronchial tree and the respiratory surface of the lung, whereas the mesenchyme makes up the lung stroma composed of connective tissue, smooth muscle, and vasculature of the lung. The signaling molecules involved in the control of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in lung vascular development are not fully known. Growth factors, as well as growth factor receptors, which are known to have a role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, are normally expressed inLKLF −/− animals (18Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Normal vasculogenesis inLKLF −/− chimeric animals, as determined by the expression of PECAM-1, an endothelial cell marker, excludes the basis for abnormal lung phenotype due to lack of LKLF expression. Grafting experiments have demonstrated that inductive signals relayed through cell-cell interactions between the epithelial and mesenchymal compartment are essential in the proper patterning, differentiation, and development of the lung (6Cardoso W.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 13: L429-L442Google Scholar). The regulatory molecules that control branching, growth, differentiation, and maturation of the lung include transcription factors and growth factors, as well as circulating hormones. Experiments using transgenic and gene targeting strategies have suggested important biological roles for various transcription and growth factors during lung development. For example, targeted disruption of the TTF-1 gene results in a complete absence of branching morphogenesis (4Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salquero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), whereas the lack of both N-Myc and the EGF receptor results in defects during early lung development (7Moens C.B. Auerbach A.B. Conlon R.A. Joyner A.L. Rossant J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Sibilia M. Wagner E.R.

Development. 1993; 119: 485-499PubMed Google Scholar) due to abnormalities in cell proliferation. Similarly, treatment of lung buds with TGF-β in organ culture has been shown to result in a failure of branching morphogenesis due to down-regulation of N-Myc expression (9Serra R. Pelton R.W. Moses H.L. Development. 1994; 120: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-Myc acts as a transcription factor and probably is involved in activation of genes necessary for proliferation of lung epithelium. Because expression of TGF-β down-regulates N-Myc and causes arrested lung development, it becomes necessary to repress the expression of TGF-β and other genes that might have a growth inhibitory effect during normal embryogenesis. Therefore, LKLF could act as a negative regulator of gene expression to shut down the expression of genes, the products of which could otherwise result in effects like that of TGF-β. In this respect, it is interesting to note that LKLF acts as a negative regulator of gene expression during development of T-cells in the thymus (39Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 227: 1986-1990Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Normal expression of TGF-β in LKLF −/− animals (18Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), however, suggests that LKLF does not act through TGF-β signal pathway. The identification of target genes for LKLF in the lung will help in understanding the signaling pathway through which LKLF works in addition to its role in development and differentiation of specific cell types during normal lung development and function.

https://openalex.org/W2117116950,"Long QT syndrome is an inherited disorder of cardiac repolarization caused by mutations in cardiac ion channel genes, including KVLQT1. In this study, the functional consequences of three long QT-associated missense mutations in KvLQT1 (R243C, W248R, E261K) were characterized using the Xenopusoocyte heterologous expression system and two-microelectrode voltage clamp techniques. These mutations are located in or near the intracellular linker between the S4 and S5 transmembrane domains, a region implicated in activation gating of potassium channels. The E261K mutation caused loss of function and did not interact with wild-type KvLQT1 subunits. R243C or W248R KvLQT1 subunits formed functional channels, but compared with wild-type KvLQT1 current, the rate of activation was slower, and the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation was shifted to more positive potentials. Co expression of minK and KvLQT1 channel subunits induces a slow delayed rectifier K+ current, IKs, characterized by slow activation and a markedly increased magnitude compared with current induced by KvLQT1 subunits alone. Coexpression of minK with R243C or W248R KvLQT1 subunits suppressed current, suggesting that coassembly of mutant subunits with minK prevented normal channel gating.

The physiologic consequences of some mutations have been studied by heterologous expression of KvLQT1 in Xenopusoocytes or mammalian cells (7Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Lazdunski M. Romey G.

Most missense mutations inKVLQT1 cause loss of channel function when mutant subunits are expressed alone and a dominant-negative effect when coexpressed with wild-type (WT) KvLQT1 subunits. However, some mutations alter the function of KvLQT1 channels, and a study of their biophysical properties has led to novel insights into the structural basis of channel function. For example, the LQT-associated mutation V254M caused loss of function but accelerated activation of KvLQT1 channel current when mutant subunits were coexpressed with WT KvLQT1 subunits (8Wang Z. Tristani-Firouzi M. Xu Q. Lin M. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1999; 10: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). V254M is located in the cytosolic loop connecting the S4 and S5 transmembrane domains of KvLQT1. Missense mutations in the S4-S5 linker have also been reported to accelerate activation and deactivation ofhuman ether-a-go-go- related gene (HERG) channels (11Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the S4-S5 linker determines the rate of deactivation of chimeric channels constructed from Kv2.1 and Kv3.1 (12Shieh C.-C. Klemic K.G. Kirsch G.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Together, these studies indicate that the S4-S5 linker of K+ channels affect activation gating in addition to serving as the docking site for the N-terminal inactivation ball in Shaker K+ channels (13Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the physiological consequences of three LQT-associated mutations located in the S4-S5 linker (W248R, E261K) or near the C-terminal end of the S4 transmembrane domain (R243C) of KvLQT1. All three residues are highly conserved within the KCNQ K+ channel family (Fig. 1). Based on the postulated role of S4 and the S4-S5 linker in other K+ channels, we hypothesized that these LQT-associated mutations in KvLQT1 would affect properties of channel activation. We found that E261K caused loss of function and did not functionally interact with WT KvLQT1 or minK subunits. Current induced by R243C or W248R KvLQT1 subunits slowed the activation and shifted the voltage dependence for activation and inactivation compared with WT KvLQT1 channel current. As previously reported (3Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 4Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), coassembly of WT KvLQT1 with minK subunits induced a current, IKs, that was several times larger and activated slower than WT KvLQT1 channel current. In contrast, IKs channels formed by coassembly of R243C or W248R KvLQT1 with minK subunits were nonfunctional. These results confirm an important role for the S4-S5 linker in K+channel gating and define a new mechanism for IKsdysfunction by LQT-associated mutations in KVLQT1. Genomic samples from individuals with LQT were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and used in SSCP analyses. A primer pair for exon 5 (5′-TCAGCCCCACACCATCTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CTGGGCCCCTACCCTAACCC-3′) identified abnormal bands in the coding sequence for the S4-S5 linker of KVLQT1. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out with 50 ng of DNA in a final volume of 10 μl using a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler (Norwalk, CT). Conditions used were as described (14Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Lehmann M.H. Keating M.T. Genomics. 1998; 51: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Reactions were diluted with 40 μl of 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA and with 30 μl of 95% formamide loading dye. The mixture was denatured at 94 °C for 5–10 min and immediately placed on ice. Three μl of each sample was electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 49:1) at 4 °C and on 0.5× mutation detection enhancement gel (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) at room temperature. Electrophoreses on the 5% gels were carried out at 40 W for 2–3 h, and electrophoreses on 0.5× gels were run overnight at 350 V. Gels were dried on filter paper and exposed to film for 18 h at −70 °C. Aberrant and normal SSCP bands were excised from the gel and eluted in 100 μl of double distilled H2O at 65 °C for 30 min. Ten μl of the eluted DNA was used as a template in a second 100-μl polymerase chain reaction reaction using the original primer pair. Products were washed 3× with 400 μl of double distilled H2O in Microcon 100 microconcentrators (Amicon, Bedford, MA). DNA was directly sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method using the original primers on an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Sequencing identified two mutations (R243C, W248R) in unrelated families. These mutations were not observed in more than 200 control individuals. We also studied a previously reported LQT-associated mutation, E261K, located in the S4-S5 linker (15Donger C. Denjoy I. Berthet M. Neyroud N. Cruaud C. Bennaceur M. Chivoret G. Schwartz K. Coumel P. Guicheney P. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2778-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Mutation of wild-type (WT)KVLQT1 cDNA was performed using the megaprimer method (16Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme and DNA sequence analyses. WT and mutant KVLQT1 cDNAs were subcloned into pSP64 plasmid expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Before use in expression experiments, the constructs were characterized by restriction mapping and DNA sequence analyses. Complementary RNAs (cRNA) for injection into oocytes were prepared with SP6 Cap-Scribe (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following linearization of the expression construct with EcoRI. WT and mutant RNAs were quantified by UV spectroscopy and compared by agarose gel electrophoresis. Isolation, maintenance, and injection of Stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes withWT-KVLQT1, mutant KVLQT1, or human minKcRNA was performed using standard methods (11Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Goldin A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 7.5–40 ng of KVLQT1cRNA as described for each experiment. Paired comparisons (WT versus mutant channels) were always made from oocytes isolated from the same frog. Oocytes were used for voltage clamp studies 3–4 days after injection of cRNA. Oocytes were bathed at room temperature (22–25 °C) in a modified ND96 solution containing 96 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6). Whole cell currents were recorded using standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp techniques and a TEV-200 amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) as described (18Stuhmer W. Rudy B. Iverson L.E. Methods in Enzymology, Ion Channels. 207. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992: 319-339Google Scholar). KvLQT1 currents were elicited by 2-s pulses (or 8-s pulses for W248R KvLQT1 current) applied in 10-mV increments to potentials ranging from −70 to +60 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. KvLQT1 tail currents were measured at −70 mV (or −35 mV for W248R KvLQT1 current). IKs (KvLQT1 + minK) was elicited by 8-s pulses applied in 10-mV increments to potentials ranging from −50 to +40 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. IKs tail currents were measured at −50 mV. The voltage dependence of KvLQT1 and IKs activation was determined by fitting the amplitude of peak tail currents versus test potential with a Boltzmann function. pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used to generate voltage-clamp commands and acquire membrane currents. Specific voltage pulse protocols are described under “Results.” Three separate experiments were performed. In the first series of experiments, the physiological function of homomultimeric channels was assessed by comparing currents induced by injection of WT or a mutantKVLQT1 cRNA (15 ng/oocyte). In the second series of experiments, the ability of mutant KvLQT1 subunits to coassemble with WT KvLQT1 subunits was determined. Current induced by injection of WTKVLQT1 cRNA (7.5 or 15 ng/oocyte) was compared with current induced by injection of an equal mixture of WT and mutantKVLQT1 cRNA (7.5 ng/oocyte each cRNA). The third series of experiments compared currents induced by injection of oocytes withminK cRNA (1 ng/oocyte) plus either WT or mutantKVLQT1 cRNA (8 ng/oocyte). pClamp and Origin (Northampton, MA) software were used to analyze data. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = number of oocytes). Channels formed by homomultimeric assembly of subunits were characterized in oocytes injected with 15 ng of either WTKVLQT1cRNA or one of the mutant KVLQT1cRNAs. WT KvLQT1 current activated with a multiexponential time course in response to membrane depolarization and did not fully activate during a 2-s pulse (Fig. 2 A). After membrane repolarization, current deactivation was preceded by an increase in current caused by rapid recovery of channels from inactivation (19Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). R243C and W248R KvLQT1 currents were smaller than WT KvLQT1 current at all potentials examined. Compared with WT KvLQT1 current, R243C KvLQT1 current also activated slower and at more positive potentials, and the tail currents were not obviously hooked (Fig. 2 A). The effects of W248R on the magnitude and kinetics of KvLQT1 current were similar to R243C but more pronounced. The average I-V relationships determined with 2-s pulses for WT and R243C KvLQT1 and 8-s pulses for W248R KvLQT1 are plotted in Fig.2 B. At +60 mV, R243C KvLQT1 current was reduced by about 60% compared with WT KvLQT1 current. W248R KvLQT1 current was reduced even further. At +60 mV, W248R KvLQT1 current measured with 8-s pulses was about 80% smaller than WT KvLQT1 current measured with 2-s pulses. Thus, neutralization of a single charge in the S4 transmembrane domain (R243C) or replacement of a hydrophobic residue with a charged residue in the S4-S5 linker (W248R) altered the gating of KvLQT1 channels. Another LQT-associated mutation in KvLQT1 resulted in reversal of a charged residue in the S4-S5 linker (E261K). Injection of oocytes with 15 ng of cRNA for this mutant subunit did not induce measurable current (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained using higher amounts (40 ng) of E261K KVLQT1 cRNA. To quantify the voltage dependence of KvLQT1 activation, the amplitude of tail currentsversus test potential was determined for WT and mutant channels. For WT KvLQT1 and R243C KvLQT1, tail currents were measured after 2-s pulses. For W248R KvLQT1, tail currents were measured after 8-s pulses to achieve a similar but still incomplete level of channel activation. The data for each cell was normalized to the maximum value determined from a fit of tail current amplitudes to a Boltzmann function. The normalized data for each oocyte was then averaged and plotted as a function of test potential. For oocytes expressing WT KvLQT1 channels, the V 0.5 and slope factor for this relationship was −13.6 ± 0.1 mV and 12.5 ± 0.1 mV, respectively (n = 38). The V 0.5for activation was shifted by +16 mV for R243C KvLQT1 channels and by +50 mV for W248R KvLQT1 channels compared with WT KvLQT1 (Fig.3). The onset of current activation was estimated by fitting current traces to a two-exponential function. WT and R243C KvLQT1 currents were recorded with 2-s pulses. Longer pulses (8 s) were used to activate the much slower W248R KvLQT1 current. The time constants describing the rate of WT KvLQT1 current activation were voltage-dependent, decreasing at more positive potentials (Fig.4, filled squares). The relative amplitude of the fast component of WT KvLQT1 current activation also increased at more positive potentials (Fig.4 B, inset). By contrast, the rate of R243C KvLQT1 current was slower, and the amplitude of the fast component was smaller than WT KvLQT1 current (Fig. 4, A and B). The rate of W248R KvLQT1 current onset was biexponential and extremely slow (Fig. 4, C and D). The rate of channel deactivation was determined by exponential fit of tail currents recorded at potentials ranging from −20 to −80 mV after a pulse to +40 mV. WT KvLQT1 tail current initially increased in amplitude before decaying with a mono-exponential time course. The initial increase results from recovery of channels from an inactivated state (19Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and was not included in the exponential fitting procedure. The time constants for deactivation of WT KvLQT1 tail current varied from 205 ms at −80 mV to 720 ms at −20 mV (Fig.5, A and B). By contrast, the deactivation of R243C KvLQT1 (Fig. 5 B) and W248R KvLQT1 (Fig. 5 C) currents was biexponential and was not preceded by an initial increase in magnitude (Fig. 5 A). The lack of a hook in the tail currents suggested either these channels did not inactivate at +40 mV or that recovery from inactivation was very fast. Overall, the rate of deactivation was faster for mutant KvLQT1 channels compared with WT KvLQT1 channels. The hook in WT KvLQT1 tail currents indirectly reveals the presence of an inactivated channel state. A direct measure of channel inactivation was achieved by applying a three-pulse protocol (21Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 22Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 23Schonherr R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The first depolarizing pulse opened and inactivated channels. The second step was applied to a negative potential (−130 mV) for a duration sufficient to allow inactivated channels to recover to an open state but not long enough for significant deactivation. If channels recovered from inactivation during the second pulse, then current inactivation was observable during a subsequent depolarization applied to the same potential as the first pulse (+40, +60, or +80 mV). This pulse protocol was applied before and after exposure of an oocyte to 30 μm L735,821, a concentration of drug that completely blocks KvLQT1 current (24Salata J.J. Jurkiewicz N.K. Sanguinetti M.C. Siegl P.K. Claremon D.C. Remy D.C. Elliott J.M. Libby B.E. Circulation. 1996; 94 (abstr.): I529Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Digital subtraction of current traces obtained before and after the drug was used to remove endogenous and leak currents. The leak subtraction revealed that WT KvLQT1 current during pulse 1 was the same at +40 and +60 mV but decreased by about 20% at +80 mV (Fig. 6, A andB). This decrease was caused by channel inactivation as evidenced by the observation that the initial current during the third pulse was larger, then rapidly inactivated to a level similar to that recorded at the end of the first pulse (indicated by arrowin A). The increase was greater after a 20-ms, than a 4-ms interpulse (Fig. 6, A and B), indicating that a 4-ms pulse to −130 mV was insufficient to allow adequate recovery of WT channels from inactivation that developed during the first pulse. By contrast to WT KvLQT1, R243C KvLQT1 current increased with depolarization from +40 to +80 mV. However, the increase in current was larger between +40 mV and +60 mV than between +60 mV and +80 mV, indicating slight channel rectification. Because of a faster rate of deactivation, a 20-ms interpulse (pulse 2) was too long to assess inactivation for this mutant channel (Fig. 6 C). However, a 4-ms interpulse revealed that channels were partially inactivated during a pulse to +80 mV but not during pulses to +40 or +60 mV (Fig.6 D). Inactivation of W248R KvLQT1 current was also assessed using the three-pulse protocol, but the duration of the first pulse was lengthened to 8 s to account for the markedly slower activation of this mutant channel. Similar to R243C KvLQT1, inactivation of W248R KvLQT1 current was detectable at +80 mV following a 4-ms interpulse (Fig. 7 D) but not at +40 mV or +60 mV. Like R243C KvLQT1, a 20-ms interpulse was too long for W248R KvLQT1 because of relatively fast deactivation (Fig. 7 C). These data indicate that R243C and W248R KvLQT1 channels can only inactivate at potentials far more positive than that observed for WT KvLQT1 channels. Oocytes were coinjected with WT and mutant KVLQT1 cRNA to determine whether the encoded subunits formed heteromultimeric channels. For these experiments, currents induced by injection of oocytes with 7.5 ng or 15 ng of WT KVLQT1 cRNA were compared with currents induced in oocytes coinjected with 7.5 ng each of WT and mutantKVLQT1 cRNA. Examples of currents induced by coinjection of cRNAs are illustrated in the top panel of Fig.8. The currents recorded in oocytes coexpressing WT and E261K were indistinguishable from those injected with 7.5 ng of WT KVLQT1 cRNA alone. In contrast, the current induced by coexpression of WT and R243C KvLQT1 subunits activated more slowly than WT KvLQT1, and the tail currents had only small or indiscernible hooks. The slowing of activation was even more pronounced in oocytes coinjected with WT and W248R subunits. Regardless of the effects on kinetics, the magnitude of current induced by coexpression of WT and mutant KvLQT1 subunits measured at test potentials between −70 mV and +40 mV was about the same as that observed for oocytes injected with 7.5 ng of WT KVLQT1 cRNA (Fig. 8, middle panels). Further evidence for coassembly of WT and R243C KvLQT1 subunits was the shift in the voltage dependence of activation for KvLQT1 current in coinjected oocytes compared with those injected with only WT KVLQT1 cRNA (Fig. 8 A,bottom panel). This shift was even greater for oocytes coexpressing WT and W248R subunits (Fig. 8 B, bottom panel). The shifts in the voltage dependence of KvLQT1 current activation (+6 mV for WT + R243C KvLQT1 and +23 mV for WT + W248R KvLQT1) were about half that measured in oocytes expressing homomultimeric channels (+16 mV for R243C KvLQT1, +51 mV for W248R KvLQT1; Fig. 3). The voltage dependence of activation was not shifted in oocytes coexpressing WT and E261K KvLQT1 subunits (Fig.8 C, bottom panel). These data indicate WT KvLQT1 subunits are capable of coassembling with R243C or W248R KvLQT1 subunits but not with E261K KvLQT1 subunits. As reported previously (3Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 4Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), coexpression of WT KvLQT1 and minK subunits induced a large, slowly activating current similar to cardiac IKs(Fig. 9 A). The average current induced by injection of oocytes with 8 ng of KVLQT1 cRNA plus 1 ng of minK cRNA was 5.8 ± 0.4 μA at +60 mV, about 8-times larger than that induced by injection of oocytes with minK cRNA alone (0.7 ± 0.1 μA at +60 mV; Fig. 9, B and D). The average current induced by coexpression of E261K KvLQT1 and minK (0.76 ± 0.09 μA at +60 mV; Fig. 9, C and D) was nearly identical to that induced by minK alone. Thus, E261K KvLQT1 subunits do not functionally interact with minK subunits. In contrast, the average currents induced by coexpression of R243C KvLQT1 or W248R KvLQT1 subunits with minK (both 0.34 ± 0.02 μA at +60 mV) were smaller than currents induced by expression of minK alone (Fig. 9, Cand D). These data indicate that coassembly of minK with R243C or W248R KvLQT1 subunits suppresses channel function. R243C and W248R KvLQT1 channels activated slower and at more positive potentials than WT KvLQT1 channels. These changes were most pronounced for the W248R mutation, resulting in a current that grossly resembled IKs (3Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 4Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 25Sesti F. Goldstein S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We previously reported the functional consequences of another LQT-associated mutation, V254M, located in the S4-S5 linker of KvLQT1 (8Wang Z. Tristani-Firouzi M. Xu Q. Lin M. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1999; 10: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This mutant caused loss of function, but coassembly of mutant subunits with WT KvLQT1 accelerated the rate of channel activation. Thus, like HERG (11Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), missense mutations in the S4-S5 linker of KvLQT1 can either slow or accelerate activation. The assignment of specific amino acids to the S4 transmembrane domain or S4-S5 linker is based on hydropathy plots. However, recent studies indicate that several residues near the C-terminal end of S4 of Shaker K+ channel subunits are accessible by thio-reactive reagents from the cytoplasm (26Baker O.S. Larsson H.P. Mannuzzu L.M. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1283-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, some residues indicated to be within S4 in Fig. 1 (including R243C) might, in fact, be part of the S4-S5 linker. Modulation of gating properties by the S4-S5 linker has been reported for other voltage-gated K+ channels. For example, the deactivation rate of chimeric channels made from Kv2.1 and Kv3.1 K+channels is determined by the S4-S5 linker (12Shieh C.-C. Klemic K.G. Kirsch G.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Missense mutations in the S4-S5 linker of HERG channels either slowed or accelerated activation, and one mutation (D540K) destabilized the closed state, causing the channel to re-open upon hyperpolarization (11Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Together, these studies support a role for the S4-S5 linker in transducing the movement of the voltage-sensing S4 transmembrane domain into opening of the channel. Mutation studies have also provided evidence that the linker also lines the inner vestibule of the pore and provides the docking site for the N-terminal inactivation gate of Shaker K+ channels (27Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 28Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 353: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, the S4-S5 linker of voltage-dependent K+ channels has functional roles in channel gating associated with both activation and inactivation. R243C and W248R altered the kinetics and voltage dependence of deactivation and inactivation of KvLQT1. Tail currents of WT KvLQT1 channels were biphasic. The mono-exponential decay of current (deactivation) was preceded by a relatively rapid increase, due to recovery of channels from an inactivated state. Analysis of tail current was previously used to determine that WT KvLQT1 channels reach half-maximal inactivation at −18 mV (19Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, deactivation of R243C and W248R channel current was biexponential and not preceded by an increase. The lack of an initial hook in the tail current suggested that mutant channels did not inactivate during pulses to membrane potentials as positive as +60 mV. This was confirmed using a three-pulse voltage clamp protocol designed to allow recovery of channels from inactivation before applying a final pulse to permit direct recording of current inactivation. These experiments confirmed that R243C and W248R KvLQT1 channels did not inactivate at +40 or +60 mV but also revealed that channel inactivation did occur at +80 mV. The structural basis of KvLQT1 channel inactivation is unknown, but our findings indicate that mutations in the S4-S5 linker have a profound affect on the voltage dependence of this process. IKs channels are formed by coassembly of KvLQT1 subunits with minK subunits (3Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 4Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Compared with homomultimeric KvLQT1 channels, IKs channels have a much slower rate of activation, slightly slower rate of deactivation, an increased single channel conductance, and no detectable inactivation (4Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 25Sesti F. Goldstein S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 29Yang Y. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The most prominent effect of coexpression of KvLQT1 and minK is an increase in the magnitude of current. Like WT KvLQT1 subunits, R243C and W248R KvLQT1 subunits were capable of forming homomultimeric channels. However, coexpression of minK subunits with R243C or W248R KvLQT1 subunits caused a marked suppression of current, indicating a functional interaction between the two subunits. It is likely that channels formed by coassembly of minK and R243C or W248R KvLQT1 subunits were nonfunctional because the heteromultimeric channels could not gate properly in response to membrane depolarization. Although less likely, it is also possible that heteromultimeric channels had a very reduced single channel conductance compared with KvLQT1 alone or were subject to an accelerated rate of degradation. The small IKs recorded in oocytes co-injected with minK plus R243C or W248R KVLQT1 cRNA was likely caused by coassembly of minK with constitutively expressed KvLQT1 subunits (4Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Elucidating the mechanisms of minK interaction with KvLQT1 requires further study, but these data indicate an important role for the S4-S5 linker of KvLQT1 in determining the functional interaction with minK subunits. Mutations in KVLQT1 that cause one type of autosomal dominant LQT usually result in loss of channel function and a dominant-negative effect (7Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5472-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Wang Z. Tristani-Firouzi M. Xu Q. Lin M. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Cardiovasc.

Genet. 1997; 6: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the functional consequences of three LQT-associated missense mutations located in or adjacent to the S4-S5 linker of KvLQT1. One of these mutations (E261K) resulted in substitution of a positively charged residue for a negatively charged amino acid. This mutation caused loss of function but did not cause a dominant-negative effect. This finding indicates that E261K KvLQT1 subunits are incapable of interacting with either WT KvLQT1 or WT minK subunits. The mechanism of loss of function for this mutation was not investigated but is most likely because of improper folding and rapid degradation of the mutant subunit. It is also possible, but unlikely, that E261K KvLQT1 subunits fold correctly and are stable but incapable of coassembling with WT KvLQT1 or minK subunits. The amplitude of currents induced by expression of R243C KvLQT1 or W248R KvLQT1 subunits was smaller than currents induced by WT KvLQT1 subunits (Fig. 2). The decreased amplitude is partly explained by the positive shift in the voltage dependence of activation for the two mutant channels. However, this shift accounts for only about half of the decrease. The remainder could be caused by a reduced efficiency of protein expression or a reduction in open probability or single channel conductance. Whatever the exact mechanism(s) of current reduction, this effect would diminish the amplitude of channels formed by heteromultimeric assembly of WT and mutant KvLQT1 subunits. More importantly, in cardiac myocytes, the markedly reduced function of heteromultimeric channels formed by coassembly of mutant KvLQT1 and WT minK subunits would reduce IKs. Thus, these two mutations would reduce the slow delayed rectifier K+ current in myocytes by altering the gating, kinetics, and coassembly properties of IKs and KvLQT1 channels. The resulting decrease in repolarizing current would prolong action potential duration and QT interval and increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. We thank Dr. M.

The recent studies on the homologues of the Drosophila Toll and Rel-related proteins have reinforced the idea that some aspects of immune response have common evolutionary origins (4Yang R.B.

The Toll-mediated signaling pathway was identified to be essential in determining the dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophilaembryo. This pathway has recently been shown to be essential also for the Drosophila immune defense (1Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The cytoplasmic domain of the Drosophila Toll receptor is homologous to those of the mammalian type I interleukin-1 (IL-1) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1, interleukin-1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay receptor and the newly identified human Toll-like receptors (9Hashimoto C.

This homology can also be found within the vertebrate MyD88 protein (12Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1095-1097PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hultmark D. Biochem.

An intracellular serine-threonine kinase Pelle functions downstream of Toll. Although the immediate substrate of Pelle is still not clear, Pelle interacts with the Toll receptor complex and probably phosphorylates a downstream component to relay the signal (15Shen B. Manley J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mammalian homologue of Pelle, the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (16Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), probably functions through a similar mechanism. In plant, a Pto family of kinases has been identified as homologues of Pelle (17Martin G.B. Brommonschenkel S.H. Chunwongse J. Frary A. Ganal M.W. Spivey R. Wu T. Earle E.D. Tanksley S.D. Science. 1993; 262: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pelle, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase, and Pto all contain the homologous death domain, which was first identified in proteins involved in controlling apoptosis. More intriguingly, Drosophila Toll, mammalian Toll-like receptor, and IL-1 receptor signaling all lead to the activation of NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors (1Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 6Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4625) Google Scholar,11Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.A.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4452) Google Scholar). NF-κB/Rel proteins are held from activation in the cytoplasm of cells by a family of inhibitors, the IκB proteins. The activation of NF-κB/Rel is initiated by the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκB proteins to unmask a nuclear localization signal within NF-κB/Rel proteins, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/Rel proteins and the transcription activation of target genes (6Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4625) Google Scholar, 18Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). Cactus, a Drosophila IκB homologue, is regulated through a similar mechanism as in vertebrates to regulateDrosophila Rel proteins (1Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The extensive conservation of the regulatory pathways makes Drosophila an excellent model system to study mammalian immune response regulation. NF-κB/Rel family proteins are widely distributed dimeric transcription factors that inducibly and coordinately regulate genes that control apoptosis, inflammation, immune response, and development (6Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4625) Google Scholar, 19Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). After over a decade of studies in defining the function of Rel protein family, however, the molecular control mechanisms by which these proteins interact with each other to act in various cell types and during different cellular processes remains to be determined. Although it has been shown that different combinations of Rel protein dimers preferentially bind to distinct DNA sequences (κB sites) (20Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not entirely clear how different Rel proteins are individually regulated and how different Rel proteins interact with each other to control specific endogenous gene expression. In Drosophila, Rel proteins such as Dif, Dorsal, and Relish have been shown to participate in the response to bacterial challenge (21Ip Y.T. Reach M. Engstrom Y. Kadalayil L. Cai H. Gonzalez-Crespo S. Tatei K. Levine M. Cell. 1993; 75: 753-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 22Lemaitre B. Meister M. Govind S. Georgel P. Steward R. Reichhart J.M.

A. 1996; 93: 10343-10347Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). One of theDrosophila immune responses against microorganisms is the induction of a group of potent antimicrobial peptides including Attacin, Cecropin, Defensin, Diptericin, and Drosomycin (2Dushay M.S. Eldon E.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 10-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Hultmark D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 25Ip Y.T. Levine M. Curr. Opin. Genet. and Dev. 1994; 4: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it is not understood how the activation of the Rel proteins leads to increased expression of these immunity genes. Since Rel proteins activate transcription as dimers, we overexpressed Rel proteins in different combinations in cultured Drosophilacells to study their interactions and how these interactions lead to the activation of immunity genes in their native chromosomal environment. Our results demonstrate that Rel proteins directly regulate Drosophila immune response by binding to the promoters of antimicrobial peptide genes. Detailed analysis of different Rel protein combinations revealed that although Dif or Dorsal homodimer can be involved in regulating drosomycin gene expression, the activation of drosomycin expression is greatly enhanced by co-expressing Relish. Similarly, Dorsal/Relish heterodimer is the preferred combination, and Dif/Relish heterodimer is also a significant combination, to regulate defensinexpression. Molecular analysis reveals that Relish can enhance the binding activity of Dif and Dorsal to κB site located within thedrosomycin and defensin promoters, providing an explanation for the regulation of these genes by the heterodimer formation. The Relish homodimer and heterodimers can efficiently activate attacin expression, and various dimer combinations can activate cecropin and diptericin. Therefore, the differential regulation of Rel proteins can lead to preferential expression of specific immunity genes. DrosophilaSchneider-2 cells were maintained at 25 °C, in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1× Glutamax-1 and 1× Penstrep (Life Technologies, Inc.). For cells that carried metallothionein promoter plasmid, Rel protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.7 mmCuSO4. After 18 h of CuSO4 incubation, LPS was added to 10 μg/ml. Samples were taken at different time points for protein or RNA analysis. The pBmIEGLacZ-BmIEGhyg, which encodes the hygromycin-resistant gene (26Vulsteke V. Janssen I. Broeck J.B. De Loof A. Huybrechts R. Insect Mol. Biol. 1993; 2: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was used to select stably transfected cells. All Rel protein expression vectors were derived from pRmHa-3 (27Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To create pSHflag or pSHhis, a DNA linker coding the FLAG epitope (gaattcatggactataaggacgatgacgacaaaagtagatctctcgaggtc) or a linker coding the hexahistidine epitope (His) (gaattcatgagaggatcgcatcaccatcaccatcacagtagatctctcgaggtc) was inserted into pRmHa-3 between EcoRI and SmaI sites, which placed the cDNA under the control ofmetallothionein promoter. Polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was employed to create a SalI site inrelish cDNA, a XhoI site in DifcDNA, and a SalI site in dorsal cDNA immediately upstream of the start codons. Dif,relish, and dorsal cDNA were then subcloned into appropriate pSH vector to create pSHflag-Relish, pSHhis-Dif, and pSHhis-Dorsal. RelD was created as described by Dushay et al. (23Dushay M.S. Asling B. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10343-10347Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), except that the restriction site SalI was used. Stable cell lines that express Relish, Dif, Dorsal, or RelD proteins were established as described by Vulsteke et al.(26Vulsteke V. Janssen I. Broeck J.B. De Loof A. Huybrechts R. Insect Mol. Biol. 1993; 2: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), except that Lipofectin (from Invitrogen) was used for transfection according to manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 5 μg of each Rel protein expression plasmid was mixed with 0.25 μg of pBmIEGLacZ-BmIEGhyg to transfect 1 × 106 cells in each experiment. Stable cell lines were selected and maintained in Schneider's medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Mouse anti-FLAG M2 was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Mouse anti-RGSHis was purchased from Qiagen. Protein samples were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, separated by 8% denaturing SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter that was then incubated for 1 h in blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk). The blot was probed with anti-RGSHis antibody or anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and the detection of the target proteins was done using enhanced chemiluminescence performed as recommended by the manufacturer (NEN Life Science Products). Total RNA was prepared using the TRI REAGENT (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), according to the protocol furnished by the manufacturer. Approximately 10 μg of RNA from each sample was separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (NEN Life Science Products). The following random primer-labeled probes were used for Northern hybridization: attacin cDNA (28Asling B. Dushay M.S. Hultmark D. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Hybridization was performed at 45 °C in 50% formamide and 2× SSC for 20 h. The stringent wash was carried out at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. After washing, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film or quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). EMSA was done as described previously with modification (34Engstrom Y. Kadalayil L. Sun S.C. Samakovlis C. Hultmark D. Faye I. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared from S2* cells by sonication in EMSA buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed from complementary strands and labeled using T4 DNA polymerase and [32P]dCTP. Binding reactions were carried out by adding 2 ng of 32P-labeled κB probe and cell extract containing 5 μg of protein in a final volume of 20 μl EMSA buffer. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, samples were separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gel. For antibody supershift, about 0.75 μg of M2 anti-FLAG antibody was added to the reaction buffer. For competition assay, EMSA was carried out in the presence or absence of 20-fold of competing oligonucleotides. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were shown in Fig. 5. The genomic DNA sequence of drosomycin was deposited by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and can be obtained from GenBankTM under accession number AC004358. The genomic DNA sequence of defensin has been described previously (32Dimarcq J.L. Hoffmann D. Meister M. Bulet P. Lanot R. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Insoluble materials were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates were pre-cleared with G protein-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody that was pre-bound to G protein-agarose beads. After washing, antigen-antibody-protein G complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. We first characterized the cell line for the study. The parental S2 cell line used in this series of experiments can be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to express a subset of antimicrobial genes and is therefore designated as S2* cells (35Petersen U.M. Bjorklund G. Ip Y.T. Engstrom Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3146-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In these cells, attacin, cecropin, and diptericin were inducible, butdrosomycin induction was not detectable. Comparing with the induction levels of attacin and cecropin,defensin was less inducible (see Fig. 3 A, theleft four lanes). The differential expression of the antimicrobial genes is consistent with a multiple pathway model (7Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar) in which either LPS activates multiple receptors leading to the induction of individual immunity genes or a single LPS receptor can activate an intracellular pathway that branches at certain point to regulate different immunity genes. The S2* cells may lack some, but not all, of the regulatory molecules that act downstream of the branch point, resulting in a partial inducibility by LPS. Although different pathways have been proposed to regulate various immunity gene expression, the utilization of specific Rel proteins in each pathway is not known even though most of these genes can be regulated by NF-κB-binding elements (34Engstrom Y. Kadalayil L. Sun S.C. Samakovlis C. Hultmark D. Faye I. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 36Sun S.C. Faye I. Eur. J.

To correlate the function of Rel proteins with the regulation of immune response, we examined the mRNA expression of Rel protein genes in S2* cells after LPS challenge. The mRNA for all three Rel protein genes was detectable in S2* cells, albeit at different levels. relishmRNA had high basal expression level, and the expression could be further up-regulated by 4-fold after 1 h of LPS treatment.Dif and dorsal mRNA levels were low and less responsive to LPS treatment (Fig. 1). The different expression levels of Dif, dorsal, andrelish mRNA may account for the inducibility of only a subset of immunity genes and suggest that Relish can function as a primary transcription factor in controlling attacin andcecropin expression (also see Fig. 4).Figure 4The Rel domain of Relish activatesattacin and cecropin gene expression. Stable cell lines were established to inducibly express RelD alone or in combination with Dif. Cells expressing exogenous Rel proteins were challenged with LPS, and samples were taken at the 1-, 3-, and 6-h time point for RNA preparation. The 0-h samples were control cells without LPS treatment. Hybridization was done as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stable cell lines that overexpress different Rel proteins, including Dif, Dorsal, and Relish, were established and used to analyze immunity gene regulation. S2* cells were transfected with different combination of plasmids that contained the Rel protein coding sequences under the control of metallothionein promoter. Stably transfected cells were selected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To examine the expression of the transfected constructs, the established cell lines were first incubated with 0.7 mm CuSO4 for 18 h. Approximately equal numbers of cells were then lysed with Triton X-100 and centrifuged to remove the insoluble materials. Supernatants containing Rel proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Rel protein expression was detected with antibodies raised against either the FLAG or the hexahistidine (His) epitope. Western blot results showed that all three proteins were expressed, individually or in combination, to significant levels. The FLAG-tagged Relish expression was relatively uniform in cells designed to express Relish (Fig. 2,upper panel). Expression of His-tagged Dif and Dorsal showed some variations (Fig. 2, lower panels). Despite the variations, the interaction of different Rel proteins seems to be a more important determinant in gene regulation as demonstrated later in Fig. 3 by examining immunity gene induction. We examined the expression of anti-microbial genes in the presence of exogenous Rel proteins prior to or after LPS treatment. After 18 h of incubation with CuSO4 to induce the Rel proteins, the cells were challenged with LPS, and RNA samples were analyzed by Northern blot (Fig.3 A). The relative average value of the antimicrobial gene expression from three independent experiments is also shown in Fig.3 B. The expression of Dif or Dorsal alone prior to LPS incubation caused a modest up-regulation of drosomycin gene expression (Fig. 3, A and B, compare 0 h induction in −, Dif, and Dorsal). Dif and Dorsal together have a similar modest effect on drosomycin induction. 1–6 h of LPS treatment further up-regulated drosomycin expression. This Dif or Dorsal dependent up-regulation is specific, because Relish itself did not cause S2* cells to express drosomycin. A functional interaction between Relish and Dif or Relish and Dorsal was detected by co-expressing two Rel proteins in the S2* cells. When Relish was co-expressed with Dif, drosomycin induction was enhanced significantly (Fig. 3 A). This increased expression was observed before LPS challenge. Treatment of the cells with LPS further increased drosomycin expression by 2-fold (Fig. 3,A and B). Even though there is a significant amount of Relish RNA in parental S2* cell as shown in Fig. 1, Dif functions better with more exogenous Relish expression. It is possible that Dif and Relish form unstable heterodimer, and the formation of the heterodimer requires higher concentrations of Dif and Relish than that produced by the endogenous genes. The result nonetheless suggests that the formation of Dif/Relish dimer is the rate-limiting step for full activation of drosomycin. Although the Relish and Dorsal combination also increased the expression and the inducibility ofdrosomycin, the effect of Dif/Relish ondrosomycin expression was 4-fold higher than that of Dorsal/Relish (Fig. 3 B). It is possible that the promoter ofdrosomycin has higher affinity toward Dif/Relish heterodimer. Alternatively, additional protein factors are involved in activating drosomycin expression, and these proteins coordinate better with Dif/Relish heterodimer. In summary, these results demonstrated that Relish functionally interacts with Dif and Dorsal to control drosomycin expression and thatdrosomycin expression is most efficiently activated by Dif/Relish heterodimer. The induction of defensin prefers the Relish/Dorsal heterodimer over other combinations, which is different from that ofdrosomycin. Surprisingly, the induction of thedefensin gene was down-regulated by the expression of Dif or Dorsal alone. The Dif/Dorsal combination showed similar repressive effect (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that the Dif or Dorsal homodimers bind to the defensinpromoter in a nonproductive conformation, thereby blocking the activation by an endogenous factor such as Relish. Expression of Relish in combination with Dorsal and Dif, on the other hand, restored the inducibility of defensin upon LPS treatment. Unlike the induction of drosomycin by Dif/Relish and Dorsal/Relish,defensin was not expressed prior to LPS treatment even in the presence of the heterodimers. One interpretation is that an additional protein factor, activated by LPS, coordinates with Rel proteins to activate defensin expression. The results, therefore, showed that although the expression of Dif or Dorsal alone represses defensin expression, the co-expression of Dorsal and Relish best enhances defensin gene induction, and the co-expression of Dif and Relish can also mediate the induction (Fig.3 B). Dif, when expressed alone, is sufficient to activatececropin and diptericin expression before LPS treatment (Fig. 3, A and B, compare the 0-h lanes in −, Dif, Relish). The result is consistent with the previous reports (35Petersen U.M. Bjorklund G. Ip Y.T. Engstrom Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3146-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39Gross I. Georgel P. Kappler C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1238-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that Dif can activate cecropin anddiptericin expression in transfection assays. On the other hand, the co-expression of Dif or Dorsal, in combination with Relish, did not show additional effect on the expression levels ofcecropin and diptericin induced by LPS. Taken together, most combinations of Rel proteins can mediatececropin and diptericin induction, and Dif homodimer is an efficient activator for these two genes. The Relish protein contains both Rel domain and IκB domain (23Dushay M.S. Asling B. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10343-10347Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It is likely that the IκB domain of Relish can complex with the Rel domain (RelD) to prevent the activation of Relish when expressed as a full-length protein. To study the function of Relish without the interference of the inhibitory domain, we expressed RelD (from amino acid 4 to 600) in a stable cell line (Fig.4). When RelD was expressed in S2* cells,attacin and cecropin were already activated prior to LPS treatment. In contrast, full-length Relish protein expression did not significantly activate attacin expression prior to LPS treatment (Fig. 4, compare 0-h lane of each set). Furthermore, RelD did not affect drosomycin expression. In the presence of LPS, the expression of attacin and cecropin in the RelD-expressing cells was further elevated by only 2-fold. This suggests that RelD, in the absence of other Rel factors, can activate transcription of specific target genes. The result is in agreement with the observation that the ability of the parental S2* cells to up-regulate Relish by LPS is coincidental with the expression ofattacin and cecropin (Fig. 1). It may be that the formation of the processed Relish (RelD-like product) is the rate-limiting step, which is regulated by LPS. Therefore, the result supports the notion that Relish can function as the primary transcription factor in controlling attain andcecropin gene induction. Because RelD alone can function to activate attacin and cecropin but notdrosomycin expression, it further supports the idea that different combinations of Rel proteins have preferred target genesin vivo. Based on the functional interaction of Drosophila Rel proteins, we expected that part of the protein function was achieved by the formation of heterodimers. To analyze further the interaction of Relish with Dif or Dorsal, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5). Anti-FLAG antibody was used to pull down FLAG-tagged Relish from extracts of cells that expressed Relish. The reaction was specific because the antibody did not recognize Dif or Dorsal protein, which contains the HIS epitope (Fig.5, lower panel). From the samples that had Relish co-expressed with Dif or Dorsal, the His-tagged Dif and Dorsal can be co-immunoprecipitated as examined by Western blot (Fig. 5, upper panel). Quantitative analysis showed that 1–2% of total Dif or Dorsal can be co-immunoprecipitated along with Relish (data not shown). It is possible that higher percentage of heterodimers are formed in the cells but escaped detection. Furthermore, such amounts of heterodimer formation may be sufficient to account for the biological activities observed when assaying for the immunity gene expression. Nevertheless, the results demonstrated the specific interactions between Relish and Dif or Relish and Dorsal. Since co-expression of Relish with Dif or Dorsal can enhance the expression of drosomycin anddefensin, we speculate that the proteins can interact directly with the target genes to regulate their expression. Among the immunity genes, the cecropin and diptericinpromoters have been the most thoroughly analyzed. Previously, it has been shown that Dif can bind to the κB site in thececropin promoter, whereas Dorsal can bind to a similar site in the diptericin promoter. The binding probably leads to activated transcription of cecropin anddiptericin (35Petersen U.M. Bjorklund G. Ip Y.T. Engstrom Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3146-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39Gross I. Georgel P. Kappler C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1238-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Dif and Dorsal may preferentially activate cecropin and diptericin, respectively, based on DNA binding and transfection studies. Meanwhile, our results suggest the possibility that the heterodimers formed by these Rel proteins bind to κB sites in the promoters ofdrosomycin and defensin. Based on the conserved sequence of insect κB motif (34Engstrom Y. Kadalayil L. Sun S.C. Samakovlis C. Hultmark D. Faye I. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we have identified similar κB sites in the promoters of both drosomycin anddefensin (Fig. 6, Aand C). We then tested whether Rel proteins expressed in the stable cell lines can interact directly with these κB sites using EMSA (Fig. 6). The parental S2* cell extract exhibited very little DNA binding activity (lane −). The cell extract that expressed FLAG-tagged Relish had strong binding activity toward the oligonucleotide containing the drosomycin κB site (Fig.6 A, indicated by ▵). This activity was supershifted by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 6 A, indicated by ▴), showing Relish was the protein factor that bound directly to the κB site. Compared with Relish, Dif and Dorsal had relatively lower binding affinity. When Relish was co-expressed with Dif or Dorsal, new complexes were formed that had faster mobility (Fig. 6 A, indicated by *), probably due to the formation of Dif/Relish or Dorsal/Relish heterodimer which has lower molecular weight. The result indicated that Relish enhanced the binding of Dif and Dorsal to the κB site. Moreover, the corresponding bands were supershifted by anti-FLAG antibody, demonstrating that FLAG-tagged Relish complexed with Dif and Dorsal in binding to DNA. To confirm further that Rel proteins bind to the κB sites within the oligonucleotides, we carried out competition EMSA. Whereas 20-fold excess amount of the same wild type oligonucleotide effectively blocked the binding of the Rel proteins to the 32P-labeled wild type oligonucleotide, the oligonucleotide with mutated κB motif did not affect the binding (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that the Rel proteins bind specifically to the κB motif ofdrosomycin. The binding activity of Rel proteins to the κB site ofdefensin promoter showed similar pattern to that ofdrosomycin promoter, albeit with lower affinity (Fig.6 C). Interestingly, this is coincident with lower level ofdefensin expression in S2* cells and in adult fly. Whether the affinity of the Rel proteins toward the target promoter determines the inducibility requires further investigation. When we examined the cellular extracts that contain combinations of Rel proteins, we found that Relish enhanced the binding activity of both Dif and Dorsal (Fig.6 C, indicated by *). The corresponding bands could also be supershifted using the anti-FLAG antibody, showing that the complex indeed contained Relish. The result therefore demonstrated that Rel proteins can interact directly with the defensinpromoter. Our results demonstrated that all five immunity genes that we have tested can be regulated by Rel-related proteins. Moreover, heterodimer formation can lead to an increased potential of gene regulatory activity by these factors. At least three pathways have been proposed to be involved in the transcriptional activation ofDrosophila anti-microbial gene expression (7Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar, 40Williams M.J. Rodriguez A. Kimbrell D.A. Eldon E.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6120-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).drosomycin is largely regulated by the Toll/Cactus pathway, whereas attacin and cecropin are regulated by a pathway involving imd and 18wheeler. The third pathway involving imd is employed to regulatediptericin and drosocin. Further evidence indicates that Drosophila immune system may involve additional regulatory molecules. One example is that attacinand cecropin respond to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (41Han Z.S. Enslen H. Hu X. Meng X. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3527-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Dif and Dorsal can be activated independently, implying the presence of multiple signaling components that may lead to the activation of individual Rel proteins (42Wu L.P. Anderson K.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our present results reveal another level of complexity in the regulatory mechanism as depicted in Fig.7. Despite some overlapping activations by other combinations, drosomycin expression is primarily activated by Dif/Relish heterodimer, and defensin expression is primarily activated by Dorsal/Relish heterodimer. Theattacin expression is primarily activated by Relish homodimer, and Dif/Relish and Dorsal/Relish heterodimers can perform the function during LPS stimulation of attacin. Therefore, whereas the numbers of Rel proteins are limited, they can mediate a broad range of cellular processes by using different combinations of these transcription factors. In vertebrates, there are five known Rel proteins. Most of them can form homodimers and heterodimers in vitro except RelB, which only forms dimers with NF-κB1 (p50) or NF-κB2 (p52) (18Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations of individual Rel proteins generate distinctive immune defective phenotype in knockout mice (6Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4625) Google Scholar, 19Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether the phenotype is due to the lack of homodimers or heterodimers. Although it was reported (6Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4625) Google Scholar, 20Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that different combinations of Rel protein dimers bind to distinct κB sites with differential affinities, the effect of different dimers on endogenous genes expression has not been tested extensively. We overexpressed Drosophila NF-κB/Rel proteins in S2* cells and examined the expression of the immunity genes in their native chromosomal environment. Our results demonstrate that although both Dif and Dorsal homodimers can be involved in regulatingdrosomycin gene expression, the activity of Dif is greatly enhanced by co-expressing Relish. Meanwhile Dorsal/Relish heterodimer is the preferred combination that regulates defensinexpression. The Relish homodimer can efficiently activateattacin and cecropin expression. It has been shown that Dif and Dorsal can interact in vitro (39Gross I. Georgel P. Kappler C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1238-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although we did not detect any significant functional interaction between Dif and Dorsal (Fig. 3), it is possible that Dif/Dorsal heterodimer may contribute redundant function or may control the expression of genes other than those we have examined. It was previously shown that Dif can activate cecropinexpression in transfection experiments (35Petersen U.M. Bjorklund G. Ip Y.T. Engstrom Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3146-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39Gross I. Georgel P. Kappler C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1238-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our results also support this observation (Fig. 3). It is therefore possible that Dif is involved in regulating cecropin expression. On the other hand, genetic study showed Toll signaling pathway controls the activation of Dif and Dorsal, yet mutations in the Toll pathway only partially affect cecropin expression (7Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar, 8Meng X. Khanuja B.S. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We showed that in S2* cells, even though Dif is not actively expressed or up-regulated by LPS, yet cecropin expression can be induced (Figs. 1 and3). It is therefore likely that Dif and Relish both contribute to the expression of cecropin. Our results from co-immunoprecipitation and EMSA showed the complex formation between Relish and Dif as well as Relish and Dorsal (Figs. 5and 6). The complex formation provides the molecular basis for the regulation of immunity genes by the heterodimers. Although there is a significant level of Relish RNA present in the parental S2* cells, very little functional interaction and DNA binding activity are detected in cells transfected to overexpress Dif or Dorsal. It may reflect the requirement of higher levels of Relish expression in order to form heterodimers for full expression of drosomycin. It is possible that proper processing of Relish, such as proteolytic cleavage, is required for heterodimerization. In the parental S2* cells, there may not be enough mature Relish for heterodimerization. When a high level of Relish is provided by transfection, more Relish protein may be properly processed to enhance heterodimer formation. These heterodimers then become most productive in regulatingdrosomycin and defensin expression. Since our results show that different heterodimers have different preferences on target gene regulation, it raises the possibility that the cell may regulate Relish/Dif and Relish/Dorsal through different pathways in order to achieve specific needs. This may explain reported observations showing that in different mutant flies the activation of Dif and Dorsal can be independently regulated and that different micro-organisms induce different subsets of antimicrobial peptides (42Wu L.P. Anderson K.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,43Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14614-14619Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Based on our results, we also expect that Relish has a broader effect than Dif or Dorsal on Drosophila immunity gene expression since Relish is a common subunit of the heterodimers. In summary, we establish that the differential regulation of Rel proteins can lead to preferential expression of specific target genes. We thank R.

FVIIa induced phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in cells expressing TF, BHK(+TF), but not in wild-type BHK(-TF) cells. BHK(+TF) cells responded to FVIIa in a dose-dependent manner, with detectable phosphorylation above 10–20 nm FVIIa. BHK cells transfected with a cytoplasmic domain-deleted version of TF, (des248–263)TF, or a C245S substitution variant of TF also supported FVIIa-induced MAPK activation. Experiments with active site-inhibited FVIIa, thrombin, factor Xa, and hirudin confirmed that the catalytic activity of FVIIa was mandatory for p44/42 MAPK activation. Furthermore, a high concentration of FVIIa in complex with soluble TF induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation in BHK(-TF) cells. These data suggest that TF was not directly involved in FVIIa-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation but rather served to localize the action of FVIIa to the cell surface, potentially to cleave a cell surface receptor. Desensitization experiments with sequential addition of proteases suggested that the p44/42 MAPK response induced by FVIIa was distinctly different from the thrombin response, possibly involving a novel member of the protease-activated receptor family.

The important role of TF in hemostasis and thrombotic disorders such as atherogenesis is well established (see (1Camerer E. Kolsto A.-B. Prydz H. Thromb.

Williamson R.C.N. Lemoine N.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4461-4467PubMed Google Scholar). Additional information about FVIIa/TF-induced signal transduction comes from our previous report showing that binding of FVIIa to cell surface TF resulted in phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK (15Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sørensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C.H. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C. Thastrup O. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).A potential role for the TF cytoplasmic domain in signal transduction was indicated by studies showing that TF expression markedly increased the metastatic potential of melanoma cells (16Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 98: 11832-11836Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and that the pro-metastatic property was critically dependent on this domain (8Bromberg M.E. Konigsberg W.H. Madison J.F. Pawshe A. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 97: 8205-8209Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 9Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 101: 1372-1378Crossref Google Scholar). This supposition was further substantiated by experiments showing that the cytoplasmic domain of TF can be phosphorylated by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism (17Zinocheck T.F. Roy S. Vehar G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3561-3564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that a synthetic peptide based on the cytoplasmic domain can work as a substrate for cell lysate protein kinase activity (18Mody R.S. Carson S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7869-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cysteine 245 in the TF cytoplasmic domain was shown to be acylated with long chain fatty acids (19Bach R. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4227-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Although a number of studies, as referred above, suggest that TF is involved in induction of an intracellular activity, it is not clear how signal transduction is mediated across the membrane as a result of binding of FVIIa to TF, just as the role of the cytoplasmic domain of TF in this process is still unclear. The present study explores the effect of removing the TF cytoplasmic domain on p44/42 MAPK signaling and further examines the importance of FVIIa catalytic activity in mediating the activation of the p44/42 MAPK pathway. Our data show that the cytoplasmic TF domain with its putative sites for regulatory modifications is not required for FVIIa-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the data provide evidence that specific FVIIa catalytic activity is required and that other serine proteases fail to mimic the response, suggesting that TF/FVIIa may be activating a novel receptor on the cell surface.DISCUSSIONThe proteolytic activity of FVIIa and the interaction with TF on the cell surface is of primary importance for initiation of blood coagulation. A number of recent studies suggest that TF may also be involved in angiogenesis, cell migration, and embryonic development (7Carmeliet P. Mackman N. Moons L. Luther T. Gressens P. Van Vlaenderen I. Demunck H. Kasper M. Breier G. Evrard P. Muller M. Risau W. Edgington T. Collen D. Nature. 1996; 383: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and in tumor metastasis (8Bromberg M.E.

Additional evidence for the importance of TF in biological functions other than coagulation comes from a recent observation suggesting that TF may act as a true receptor (10Rottingen J.-A. Enden T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although it was shown that a TF-dependent intracellular activity was induced by binding of FVIIa to TF on the cell surface, it was not clear how signal transduction across the plasma membrane was accomplished. We have shown recently (15Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sørensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C.H. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C. Thastrup O. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) that FVIIa/TF-induced signal transduction leads to p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. The data of the present study (Fig. 1) show that p44/42 MAPK activation is FVIIa dose-dependent and detectable at physiological levels of FVIIa. The present study confirms that the catalytic activity of FVIIa is required for FVIIa/TF-mediated p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation and also provides further evidence that down-stream coagulation factors FXa and thrombin, which might have been generated as a result of FVIIa activity, are not involved in FVIIa/TF-mediated MAPK activation.Our studies with TF-transfected BHK cells (Fig. 2) clearly demonstrated that TF mutants lacking the cytoplasmic domain or the acylation site at Cys-245 were fully capable of mediating FVIIa-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. These data exclude a mandatory role for the cytoplasmic tail TF or its acylation in FVIIa/TF-induced signaling via the MAPK pathway, although we cannot completely exclude the involvement of the tail in modulation of the response. It has been speculated that TF, because of its sequence homology to the cytokine receptors, might be capable of mediating transmembrane signal transduction by receptor dimerization or oligomerization followed by reciprocal phosphorylation of intracellular domains (35Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). However, our present finding that FVIIa can induce MAP kinase activation in cells expressing truncated TF with no intracellular domain excludes such a mechanism, at least for TF/VIIa-induced MAP kinase activation. Recent preliminary observations showing that human TF protein lacking the cytoplasmic domain rescues TF−/− mouse embryos (36Parry G.C.N. Erlich J. Mackman N. Circulation. 1998; 98 Suppl. I (abstr.): 40Google Scholar) provide an indirect support to our present conclusion that the TF extracellular domain can function independently of the cytoplasmic domain in mediating signal transduction. However, one should note that our data do not necessarily rule out a possible involvement of the cytoplasmic tail in other TF-mediated signal transduction events. A requirement for the cytoplasmic domain of TF is suggested from studies on its prometastatic activity (8Bromberg M.E. Konigsberg W.H. Madison J.F. Pawshe A. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 97: 8205-8209Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 9Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 101: 1372-1378Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domain of TF was shown to interact with actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280), suggesting a role for TF in reactions associated with rearrangement of cellular cytoskeleton elements (37Ott I. Fischer E.G. Miyagi Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The exact nature and the importance of these interactions in relation to the p44/42 MAPK pathway remains to be fully unraveled.The results obtained upon treatment of BHK(-TF) cells with exogenous sTF·FVIIa complex (Fig. 3) are consistent with a pertinent role for membrane-bound TF in FVIIa-induced signal transduction because of its virtue of creating a localized area of high FVIIa activity on the plasma membrane. The importance of membrane localization was further substantiated by experiments with a truncated version of FVIIa, des(1–44)FVIIa, which lacks its membrane binding γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain but retains TF-binding and enhanced proteolytic activity. An exogenous complex between this FVIIa derivative and TF, sTF·des(1–44)FVIIa, induced a decreased response compared with sTF·FVIIa when added to BHK(-TF) cells (results not shown) presumably because of the diminished membrane association of this complex because of the absence of the FVIIa-membrane binding domain.The fact that FVIIa proteolytic activity is required for FVIIa-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation may suggest that signal transduction is mediated by a so-called PAR, which is cleaved when FVIIa binds to TF on the cell surface. The presently known PARs (PAR 1–4) belong to a subgroup of the G protein-coupled receptor family. The thrombin receptor (PAR-1), originally cloned from a human megakaryoblastic cell line (25Vu T.K.H.

The PARs are activated by a mechanism in which a protease recognizes and cleaves an extracellular N-terminal exodomain of the receptor to reveal a new N terminus containing a receptor-activating sequence that serves as a tethered ligand. Intracellular calcium mobilization and inositol phosphate formation are the most commonly reported consequences of PAR activation; however, p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation as a result of protease-catalyzed cleavage has been observed with both PAR-1 (34Pages G.

Scott P.H. Pemberton A.D. Miller H.R.P. Wadsworth R.M. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The intracellular reactions following activation of PAR-3 and -4 are not well characterized. The intracellular effects reported, MAPK phosphorylation (15Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sørensen B.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4650-4660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), as a result of FVIIa/TF activity are therefore fully consistent with the possible activation of a known or a hereto undiscovered member of the PAR family.Although a certain protease preference for specific PARs exists, it is well recognized that a given PAR may be cleaved by several proteases and that a given protease may cleave several PARs. This cross-reactivity complicates a functional classification of specific PARs. However, identification clues may be obtained from experiments in which receptor activation by a protease makes this receptor refractory to a second stimulus. We explored this possibility by exposing the cells to FVIIa, thrombin, or trypsin followed by a subsequent exposure to FVIIa. Pre-exposure to FVIIa and not to thrombin resulted in desensitization of the FVIIa-induced response. Exposing the cells to trypsin resulted in partial desensitization of the FVIIa-induced response. These observations indicate that receptors activated/desensitized by thrombin and probably by trypsin were not involved in FVIIa-induced signal transduction. Thrombin activates and is also likely to desensitize PAR-1, -3, and -4 but not PAR-2 (27Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Thus the inability of thrombin pretreatment to abolish FVIIa-induced MAP kinase activation can be taken as evidence against the involvement of PAR-1, -3, and -4. Localization of thrombin to the cell membrane (e.g. by binding to PAR-1) might be a possible prerequisite for its desensitization of PARs 3 and 4, in which case a positive identification of PAR-1 on BHK(+TF) cells would be needed to draw conclusions about the putative role of PAR-3 or PAR-4 in TF/VIIa-induced signal transduction from our desensitization experiments. However, the observation that BHK cells respond to the PAR-1 agonist, SFLLRN, and thrombin with mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores 2L. C. Petersen, O. Thastrun, G. Hagel, B. B. Sørensen, P.-O. Freskgård, L. V. M. Rao, and M. Ezban, unpublished data. suggests that they do indeed express PAR-1 and may not require an additional binding site on the membrane for thrombin desensitization of PAR-3 and PAR-4. The data in Fig. 5 show that trypsin induced a significant p44/42 MAPK activation. The response had not completely returned to the basal level in 40 min, and this may have complicated the desensitization experiment. Nonetheless, FVIIa treatment did enhance MAP kinase activation in trypsin-pretreated cells. Furthermore, treatment of the cells with 300 μm of the murine PAR-2 agonist, SLIGRL, did not induce p44/42 MAPK activation (results not shown) as was expected from PAR-2 activation experiments with rat aortic smooth muscle cells and bovine fibroblasts (31Belham C.M. Tate R.J. Scott P.H. Pemberton A.D. Miller H.R.P. Wadsworth R.M. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that BHK cells may not express PAR-2 and also makes it unlikely that PAR-2 is involved in FVIIa-induced signal transduction. However, the observation of a partly desensitized FVIIa response could indicate that trypsin may, in addition to PAR-2, also cleave the putative receptor activated by FVIIa. So far then, the combined data on characterization of FVIIa-induced signaling seems to exclude the currently known PARs as targets for FVIIa activation, making it possible that a hereto undiscovered member of the PAR family is responsible for FVIIa-induced signal transduction.The prometastatic function of TF-expressing cells appears to depend on the concerted action of FVIIa/TF activity and certain reactions involving the cytoplasmic domain of TF (8Bromberg M.E. Konigsberg W.H. Madison J.F. Pawshe A. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 97: 8205-8209Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This might suggest the existence of a close connection between dynamic modifications (phosphorylation or acylation) of the TF cytoplasmic domain and the TF/FVIIa-induced signal transduction leading to p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. The activated p44/42 MAPK is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that might possibly phosphorylate one or more serine residues present in the TF cytoplasmic domain. G protein-coupled receptors are known to activate parallel signal transduction pathways e.g. activation of phospholipase C-β, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and formation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to Ca2+mobilization and activation of protein kinase C. These reaction might well be induced by a putative PAR activation by TF-bound FVIIa and result in dynamic covalent modification of the TF tail. We are currently pursuing these possibilities. The extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation is initiated when factor VIIa (FVIIa) 1The abbreviations used are: FVIIa, activated FVII; TF, tissue factor; sTF, TF(1-219); TFΔcyto, TF(1-247); FFR-FVIIa, FVIIa blocked in the active site withd-Phe-l-Phe-l-Arg-chloromethyl ketone; FX, factor X; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAR, protease-activated receptor; FCS, fetal calf serum; BHK, baby hamster kidney1The abbreviations used are: FVIIa, activated FVII; TF, tissue factor; sTF, TF(1-219); TFΔcyto, TF(1-247); FFR-FVIIa, FVIIa blocked in the active site withd-Phe-l-Phe-l-Arg-chloromethyl ketone; FX, factor X; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAR, protease-activated receptor; FCS, fetal calf serum; BHK, baby hamster kidneycirculating in plasma binds to the integral membrane protein, tissue factor (TF), exposed to the blood upon injury of the vessel wall. TF consists of a 219-residue (1–219) extracellular domain, a 23-residue (220–242) transmembrane domain, and a 21-residue (243–263) cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular part of TF is structured in two fibronectin type III-like domains, which shows structural and sequence homology to the cytokine receptor superfamily. The important role of TF in hemostasis and thrombotic disorders such as atherogenesis is well established (see (1Camerer E. Kolsto A.-B. Prydz H. Thromb.

Williamson R.C.N. Lemoine N.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4461-4467PubMed Google Scholar). Additional information about FVIIa/TF-induced signal transduction comes from our previous report showing that binding of FVIIa to cell surface TF resulted in phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK (15Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sørensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C.H. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C. Thastrup O. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A potential role for the TF cytoplasmic domain in signal transduction was indicated by studies showing that TF expression markedly increased the metastatic potential of melanoma cells (16Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 98: 11832-11836Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and that the pro-metastatic property was critically dependent on this domain (8Bromberg M.E. Konigsberg W.H. Madison J.F. Pawshe A. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 97: 8205-8209Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 9Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 101: 1372-1378Crossref Google Scholar). This supposition was further substantiated by experiments showing that the cytoplasmic domain of TF can be phosphorylated by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism (17Zinocheck T.F. Roy S. Vehar G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3561-3564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that a synthetic peptide based on the cytoplasmic domain can work as a substrate for cell lysate protein kinase activity (18Mody R.S. Carson S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7869-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cysteine 245 in the TF cytoplasmic domain was shown to be acylated with long chain fatty acids (19Bach R. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4227-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although a number of studies, as referred above, suggest that TF is involved in induction of an intracellular activity, it is not clear how signal transduction is mediated across the membrane as a result of binding of FVIIa to TF, just as the role of the cytoplasmic domain of TF in this process is still unclear. The present study explores the effect of removing the TF cytoplasmic domain on p44/42 MAPK signaling and further examines the importance of FVIIa catalytic activity in mediating the activation of the p44/42 MAPK pathway. Our data show that the cytoplasmic TF domain with its putative sites for regulatory modifications is not required for FVIIa-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the data provide evidence that specific FVIIa catalytic activity is required and that other serine proteases fail to mimic the response, suggesting that TF/FVIIa may be activating a novel receptor on the cell surface. DISCUSSIONThe proteolytic activity of FVIIa and the interaction with TF on the cell surface is of primary importance for initiation of blood coagulation. A number of recent studies suggest that TF may also be involved in angiogenesis, cell migration, and embryonic development (7Carmeliet P. Mackman N. Moons L. Luther T. Gressens P. Van Vlaenderen I.

Insulin inhibited transcription induced by dexamethasone and cAMP of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene fused with the PEPCK promoter sequence in HL1C cells stably transfected with this construct. A dominant negative mutant of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase blocked insulin inhibition of transcription of the PEPCK-CAT fusion gene, whereas a constitutively active mutant of PI 3-kinase mimicked the effect of insulin. Although a constitutively active mutant of Akt (protein kinase B) inhibited PEPCK-CAT gene transcription induced by dexamethasone and cAMP, a mutant Akt (Akt-AA) in which the phosphorylation sites targeted by insulin are replaced by alanine did not affect the ability of insulin to inhibit transcription of the fusion gene. Akt-AA almost completely inhibited insulin-induced activation of both endogenous and recombinant Akt in HL1C cells. Furthermore, neither a kinase-defective mutant protein kinase Cλ (PKCλ), which blocked insulin-induced activation of endogenous PKCλ, nor a dominant negative mutant of the small GTPase Rac prevented inhibition of PEPCK-CAT gene transcription by insulin. These data suggest that phosphoinositide 3-kinase is important for insulin-induced inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription and that a downstream effector of phosphoinositide 3-kinase distinct from Akt, PKCλ, and Rac may exist for mediating the effect of insulin.

The primary role of insulin is to control the plasma glucose concentration by stimulating glucose transport into muscle and adipose cells as well as by reducing glucose output from the liver (1Kruszynska Y.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Invest. Med. 1996; 44: 413-428PubMed Google Scholar). These actions of insulin are mediated by activation of effectors, such as glucose transporters and glycogen synthase, or by regulation of the amount of specific protein participants in metabolic pathways (1Kruszynska Y.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Invest. Med. 1996; 44: 413-428PubMed Google Scholar, 2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3White M.F.

Granner D.K. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver; thus, in the absence of this effect of insulin, as in diabetes mellitus or long term starvation, gluconeogenesis is increased (1Kruszynska Y.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Invest. Med. 1996; 44: 413-428PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the PEPCK gene is increased by various hormonal agents including glucocorticoids and glucagon (or its second messenger, cAMP), and insulin inhibits PEPCK gene transcription induced by these stimuli (2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Given that PEPCK is not known to be subject to allosteric regulation, the inhibition of gluconeogenesis by insulin in vivo is probably due to the insulin-induced decrease in the amount of PEPCK protein. Moreover, the observations that PEPCK gene expression in the liver is increased in several animal models of diabetes (5Hofmann C. Lorenz K. Williams D. Palazuk B.J. Colca J.R. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 384-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and that transgenic animals overexpressing the PEPCK gene develop a diabetic phenotype (6Valera A. Pujol A.

Proietto J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1396-1404PubMed Google Scholar) also indicate the importance of this enzyme in glucose homeostasis in vivo.Despite the recent progress in our knowledge of insulin signal transduction, the mechanism by which PEPCK gene transcription is regulated remains unclear. The Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade contributes to the regulation of the expression of various genes by insulin (8Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A constitutively active mutant of Ras was shown to inhibit transcription of the PEPCK gene induced by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (9Agati J.M. Yeagley D. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18751-18759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, constitutively active mutants of Ras or of Raf, an immediate downstream effector of Ras, did not inhibit PEPCK gene transcription induced by dexamethasone and a cAMP analog (10Gabbay R.A.

Despite the apparently discrepant results obtained with these constitutively active mutants, the observation that either a dominant negative mutant of Ras or a pharmacological inhibitor that blocks farnesylation of Ras, an important step in the activation of this GTPase, did not prevent insulin inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription (9Agati J.M. Yeagley D. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18751-18759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3198-3204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggests that Ras is not required for this effect of insulin.The role of PI 3-kinase, which is involved in a number of the metabolic actions of insulin (12Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), on PEPCK gene transcription has also been explored. Yang and Dickson (13Yang S.H. Dickson A.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) showed that insulin-induced inhibition of PEPCK gene expression was not affected by a pharmacological blocker of PI 3-kinase, to which various metabolic actions of insulin are sensitive (12Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). However, a previous observation by Sutherland et al. (14Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), subsequently confirmed by others (10Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27320-27324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of insulin on PEPCK gene transcription is dependent on PI 3-kinase. The role of Akt (also known as protein kinase B), an immediate downstream effector of PI 3-kinase, in regulation of PEPCK gene transcription is also controversial. A kinase-deficient mutant of Akt, in which ligand-induced phosphorylation sites were replaced for alanine, prevents the inhibition of PEPCK transcription induced by insulin (15Liao J. Barthel A. Nakatani K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27320-27324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). By contrast, Agati et al. (9Agati J.M. Yeagley D. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18751-18759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) showed that kinase-deficient Akt variants containing an amino acid substitution in the kinase domain or in the PH domain did not inhibit insulin-induced repression of PEPCK transcription.In this study, we have further explored the role of PI 3-kinase in the inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin, by using dominant negative and constitutively active mutants of the enzyme. Moreover, we have investigated the roles of several downstream targets of PI 3-kinase, including Akt, atypical protein kinase C (PKC), and the small GTPase Rac, in this action of insulin.DISCUSSIONPharmacological inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, such as wortmannin and LY294002, are useful tools for exploring insulin signal transduction. Various metabolic actions of insulin, including stimulation of glucose transport, glycogen synthase, amino acid transport, and general protein synthesis, are sensitive to these inhibitors (3White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 4Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 12Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). These compounds also prevent the repression of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin (10Gabbay R.A.

Accordingly, we here show that a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase, Δp85, blocked this effect of insulin. Moreover, a constitutively active form of PI 3-kinase (Myr-p110) mimicked the effect of insulin on PEPCK gene expression. These data indicate that insulin-induced inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription is mediated by PI 3-kinase.Akt variants in which the Akt sequence is ligated to either a myristoylation signal sequence or a viral Gag protein exhibit kinase activity that is greater than that of the wild-type enzyme (26Burgering B.M.T.

Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). We have now shown that stimulation of PEPCK gene transcription by dexamethasone-cAMP was markedly attenuated in HL1C cells that express a constitutively active mutant of Akt (Myr-Akt), an observation consistent with the results of a previous study (15Liao J. Barthel A. Nakatani K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27320-27324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, whereas the expression of Akt-AA inhibited the insulin-induced activation of Akt as well as insulin-induced stimulation of protein synthesis (17Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y.

Y., and Kausga, M., submitted for publication. this mutant did not affect the inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin.It is possible that Akt-AA did not completely prevent signal transmission through endogenous Akt and that the remaining low level of Akt activity was sufficient to inhibit PEPCK gene transcription to a substantial extent. However, this possibility is unlikely because both insulin-induced Akt activation (data not shown) and PEPCK gene transcription were inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase (Δp85) in a similar dose-dependent manner, suggesting that a small increase in the activity of Akt is not sufficient to fully inhibit PEPCK gene expression. Therefore, the simplest explanation of the present results is that a molecule distinct from Akt is capable of transmitting signals to PEPCK gene transcription, whereas activated Akt is sufficient to inhibit the expression of this gene under certain conditions.We have shown that Akt-AA almost completely abolished the stimulation of transfected Akt1 and endogenous Akt2 activity by insulin. Because antibodies against Akt3 did not precipitate insulin-stimulated kinase activity from HL1C cells, this isoform of Akt may not be expressed in these cells. Furthermore, we have shown that Akt-AA inhibited insulin-induced endogenous Akt activity precipitated with antibodies that recognize all three known isoforms of Akt with apparent similar efficiency (17Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, Akt translocates to the plasma membrane fraction or GLUT4-containing vesicles in response to extracellular stimuli (30Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Because we assayed Akt activity in immunoprecipitates prepared from total cell lysates, it is possible that this assay does not completely reflect the activity of Akt in a specific cellular compartment. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that an increase of Akt activity in a certain fraction of the cell may be sufficient to transmit signals to the PEPCK gene promotor. It is also possible that an unidentified isoform of Akt that is resistant to Akt-AA is present in the cells studied and responsible for the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription.Liao et al.

However, these investigators did not observe the inhibition of insulin-induced activation of endogenous Akt by this mutant. The reason for this apparent discrepancy between their results and ours is not clear. The difference could be related to the methods used to monitor PEPCK mRNA expression. Whereas we assayed transcription by assessing the activity of a CAT reporter gene fused to the promoter region of the PEPCK gene, Liao et al. (15Liao J. Barthel A. Nakatani K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27320-27324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) measured PEPCK mRNA by primer extension analysis. The latter technique cannot discriminate between effects on gene transcription and mRNA stability, and insulin is known to affect PEPCK mRNA stability (2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).We and others have shown that a kinase-defective mutant of Akt in which the Lys179 in the kinase domain is replaced by aspartate does not inhibit insulin-induced Akt activation (17Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell.

Nonetheless, this and similar Akt mutants do inhibit certain biological actions of insulin, including the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (32Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), the activation of glycogen synthase (29Takata M. Ogawa W. Kitamura T. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Klip A. Gingras A.C.

Cell. 1998; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4914) Google Scholar), it is possible that kinase-defective mutants of Akt containing substitutions at Lys179 block signaling downstream of Akt by competing with the endogenous enzyme for its substrates. However, in the present study, infection of HL1C cells with AxCAAkt-K179D did not prevent the inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin, which is consistent with the results of a previous study (9Agati J.M. Yeagley D. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18751-18759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These observations also support the hypothesis that inhibition of Akt signaling is not sufficient to prevent insulin suppression of PEPCK gene transcription.Atypical isoforms of PKC are also thought to act downstream of PI 3-kinase (18Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kusuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Akimoto K. Takahashi R.

We have previously shown that expression of λΔNKD markedly inhibits stimulation of both PKCλ activity and glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by insulin (18Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kusuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now shown that PKCλ, but not PKCζ, is expressed in HL1C cells and that λΔNKD does not affect the inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin, although this mutant almost completely inhibited insulin-induced activation of PKCλ. Atypical PKC has been proposed to participate in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling cascade (36Berra E. D'az-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S. Municho M.M. Sánchez P.

Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have recently shown that expression of λΔNKD inhibits the insulin-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in various cells, including HL1C cells. 3Matsumoto, M., Ogawa, W., Kotani, K., and Kasuga, M., manuscript in preparation. These results, together with our observation that λΔPD, a constitutively active mutant of PKCλ, does not mimic the effect of insulin on PEPCK gene transcription, indicate that PKCλ does not participate in this effect of insulin.The small GTPase Rac, another downstream effector of PI 3-kinase, mediates insulin-induced formation of lamellipodia (38Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac (Rac17N) did not prevent the inhibitory effect of insulin on PEPCK gene transcription, suggesting that the Rac pathway does not contribute to this action of insulin. Because insulin does not induce formation of lamellipodia in HL1C cells, we do not know whether the level of expression of Rac17N achieved in the present study is sufficient to prevent signaling through endogenous Rac. However, given that insulin-induced formation of lamellipodia is completely blocked in Chinese hamster ovary cells, KB cells, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes by expression of Rac17N at levels similar to or lower than that achieved in the present study (data not shown), it is likely that the concentration of Rac17N achieved in HL1C cells was sufficient to inhibit the endogenous protein.In summary, we have shown that a constitutively active mutant of PI 3-kinase inhibits the dexamethasone-cAMP-induced stimulation of PEPCK gene transcription and that a dominant negative mutant of this lipid kinase blocks insulin-induced inhibition of PEPCK gene expression. However, dominant negative mutants of Akt, PKCλ, and Rac did not affect the ability of insulin to inhibit transcription of the PEPCK gene. Our data suggest that a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase distinct from Akt, PKCλ, and Rac mediates the effect of insulin on PEPCK gene transcription. Given that various additional enzymes, including PKCε (39Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Takenawa T. Fukui Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The primary role of insulin is to control the plasma glucose concentration by stimulating glucose transport into muscle and adipose cells as well as by reducing glucose output from the liver (1Kruszynska Y.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Invest. Med. 1996; 44: 413-428PubMed Google Scholar). These actions of insulin are mediated by activation of effectors, such as glucose transporters and glycogen synthase, or by regulation of the amount of specific protein participants in metabolic pathways (1Kruszynska Y.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Invest. Med. 1996; 44: 413-428PubMed Google Scholar, 2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3White M.F.

Granner D.K. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver; thus, in the absence of this effect of insulin, as in diabetes mellitus or long term starvation, gluconeogenesis is increased (1Kruszynska Y.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Invest. Med. 1996; 44: 413-428PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the PEPCK gene is increased by various hormonal agents including glucocorticoids and glucagon (or its second messenger, cAMP), and insulin inhibits PEPCK gene transcription induced by these stimuli (2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Given that PEPCK is not known to be subject to allosteric regulation, the inhibition of gluconeogenesis by insulin in vivo is probably due to the insulin-induced decrease in the amount of PEPCK protein. Moreover, the observations that PEPCK gene expression in the liver is increased in several animal models of diabetes (5Hofmann C. Lorenz K. Williams D. Palazuk B.J. Colca J.R. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 384-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and that transgenic animals overexpressing the PEPCK gene develop a diabetic phenotype (6Valera A. Pujol A.

Despite the recent progress in our knowledge of insulin signal transduction, the mechanism by which PEPCK gene transcription is regulated remains unclear. The Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade contributes to the regulation of the expression of various genes by insulin (8Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod.

The catalytic subunit of PP1α was inhibited by PA dose-dependently in a noncompetitive manner with a K i value of 80 nm. The inhibition by PA was specific to PP1 as PA failed to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or PP2B. Furthermore, PA was the most effective and potent inhibitor of PP1 compared with other phospholipids. Because we recently showed that ceramides activated PP1, we next examined the effects of PA on ceramide stimulation of PP1. PA inhibited both basal and ceramide-stimulated PP1 activities, and ceramide showed potent and stereoselective activation of PP1 in the presence of PA. Next, the effects of PA on ceramide-induced responses were examined. Molt-4 cells took up PA dose- and time-dependently such that by 1 and 3 h, uptake of PA was 0.37 and 0.65% of total PA added, respectively. PA at 30 μm and calyculin A at 10 nm (an inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A at low concentrations), but not okadaic acid at 10 nm (a PP2A inhibitor at low concentrations) prevented poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proteolysis induced by C6-ceramide. Moreover, the combination of PA with okadaic acid prevented retinoblastoma gene product dephosphorylation induced by C6-ceramide. These data suggest that PA functions as a specific regulator of PP1 and may reverse or counteract those effects of ceramide that are mediated by PP1, such as apoptosis and retinoblastoma gene product dephosphorylation.

Two endogenous proteins, inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2, as well as Mn2+ have been reported as factors that regulate PP1 specifically, but not other protein phosphatases, such as PP2A, PP2B, PP2C, or protein-tyrosine phosphatases (4Endo S.

Galadari, L. M. Obeid, and Y. A. Hannun, manuscript in preparation. especially in causing dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb). Phosphatidic acid (PA) is another proposed second messenger in cellular responses. In different cell types, PA can mimic physiological agonists leading to various cellular responses, such as neurotransmission, hormone release, cell proliferation, expression of several proto-oncogenes, and calcium influx in cells. PA has also been shown to modulate several enzyme activities, such as phospholipase C, protein kinases, cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase, Ras GTPase-activating protein and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (6English D.

PA is produced by 1) phospholipase D (PLD), which causes the hydrolysis of phospholipids (such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidylethanolamine), 2) diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase, which causes the phosphorylation of DAG, or 3) lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-acyltransferase, which acylates LPA (9Exton J.H.

Of these, the PLD pathway has been the best studied in signal transduction, and the generated PA has been proposed as a key mediator of PLD action. Multiple studies suggest an important role for ceramide in regulating diverse cell responses, such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cell senescence (13Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Our recent finding that ceramide activated PP1 stereoselectively and that PP1 may mediate the effects of ceramide on Rb phosphorylation raised the possibility that PP1 is a lipid-regulated phosphatase.2 During the investigation of lipid regulation of PP1 and the role of PP1 in ceramide-induced signaling, we found that PA functions as a potent inhibitor of PP1. In the present study, we report on this inhibition of PP1 by PA. We also provide evidence that there is a role for PP1 in mediating the effects of ceramide on caspases and that PA is capable of inhibiting PP1-mediated effects of ceramide, i.e. specifically on activation of caspases and Rb dephosphorylation. The implications of these findings on the lipid regulation of PP1 and on the role of PP1 as a target for PA and ceramide are discussed.

For PA uptake, dioleoylglycerol was labeled using diacylglycerol kinase producing [32P]DiC18:1-PA. Bcl-2-transfected Molt-4 cells (2 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 medium with 2% FBS) were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time periods with 30 μm [32P]DiC18:1-PA.

For ceramide uptake experiments, Bcl-2-transfected Molt-4 cells (2 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 medium with 2% FBS) were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time periods with 20 μm[14C]C6-ceramide in the absence or presence of 30 μm PA. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The cells were suspended in 1 ml of deionized water and lysed by ultrasonication with three 30-s pulses. Radioactivity in the suspension was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The recombinant catalytic subunit of PP1α (rabbit muscle) was incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of DiC18:1-PA. The catalytic subunit of PP1α was inhibited by PA dose-dependently when assayed with 10–50 μg/ml [32P]MBP (Fig.1 A). Control PP1 activity for MBP showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, yielding a K mof 100 μg/ml and a V max of 100 pmol/ml of Pi released per min. As seen from Lineweaver-Burk analysis (Fig. 1 B), PA caused a decrease inV max at lipid concentrations up to 300 nm in a noncompetitive manner. From Dixon analysis, DiC18:1-PA showed a K i value of 80 nm (Fig. 1 C). Egg yolk PA produced the same results, and using [32P]histone as a substrate also produced similar results, yielding a K m of 58 μg/ml and a V max of 35 pmol/ml of Pi released per min (Fig. 1 D). Again, PA decreased the V max in a noncompetitive manner, with DiC18:1-PA demonstrating a K i value of 150 nm (Fig. 1, E and F). Previous work indicated that PA modulates protein-tyrosine phosphatase by activating the CD45-tyrosine phosphatase (8Cui Y. English D.K. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of PA on other protein phosphatases were investigated. The inhibitory effect of PA was specific to PP1 compared with PP2A or PP2B. Interestingly, at 10 μm, DiC18:1-PA also activated PP2A by 5-fold (Fig. 2). To evaluate whether other phospholipids are able to inhibit PP1, the effects of acidic phospholipids were examined. At 1 μm, only DiC18:1-PA inhibited PP1 completely, and at 10 μm, DiC18:1-LPA also inhibited PP1, probably due to structural similarity. Phosphatidylinositol, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylglycerol, but not phosphatidylserine, also showed more than 50% inhibition at 10 μm (Fig.3). We also examined the effects of several other lipids, short chain PA, long and short chain diacylglycerol, sphingosine, and d-e-dihydro-C6ceramide in conjunction with d-e-C6 ceramide on PP1 activity. With the exception of d-e-C6ceramide, each compound demonstrated modest inhibitory effects above 1 μm. Sphingosine (IC50 = 10 μm),d-e-dihydro-C6-ceramide (IC50 = 3 μm), DiC8:1-PA (IC50 = 2.5 μm), DiC8:1-DAG (IC50 = 2.2 μm), and DiC18:1-DAG (IC50 = 3 μm) were inhibitory to PP1, but, similar to the phospholipids above, not as potently as DiC18:1-PA (IC50 = 80 nm) (Fig. 3, C andD). These data strongly suggest that long chain PA is a potent and selective inhibitor of PP1. Recently, we found that ceramide activated PP1 in vitro and in cells.2Therefore, we next examined the effects of PA on ceramide activation of PP1. DiC18:1-PA inhibited both basal and ceramide-activated PP1 activities, but ceramide showed potent activation of 12.1- and 6.6-fold in the presence of 300 nmand 3 μm PA, respectively, compared with 2.7-fold in the absence of PA (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, in the presence of PA,d-erythro-C6-ceramide (the natural stereoisomer of ceramide) activated PP1 more potently than other stereoisomers of C6-ceramide (Fig. 4 B). We previously showed that ceramide induces cell cycle arrest (17Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazarie F. Pushkareva M.Yu Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) through activation of Rb in the Molt-4 T leukemia cells (18Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S.

Ceramide also activates caspases in cells resulting in cleavage of many substrates (13Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), including Rb (data not shown). We therefore performed the following studies in cells overexpressing Bcl-2, which inhibits the effects of ceramide on proteases but not on Rb dephosphorylation (15Zhang J. Alter N. Reed J.C. Borner C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5325-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 21Martin S.J. Takayama S. Mcgahon A.J. Miyashita T. Corbeil J. Kolesnick R.N. Reed J.C. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 253-257PubMed Google Scholar). We also recently found that the dephosphorylation of Rb induced by ceramide may involve PP1.2 To evaluate the effects of PA, DiC18:1-PA was added to cells, and its effects on Rb were examined. First, we examined DiC18:1-PA uptake by Molt-4 cells. The uptake of PA was 0.37% after 1 h and 0.65% after 3 h, making the effective dose in vivo approximately 200-fold greater than in vitro (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, using larger doses of PA for treatment of Molt-4 cells, we found that neither DiC18:1-PA (3, 10, and 30 μm) alone (Fig. 5 B) nor okadaic acid (a specific PP2A inhibitor) prevented C6-ceramide-induced Rb dephosphorylation, but the combination of DiC18:1-PA with okadaic acid inhibited C6-ceramide-induced Rb dephosphorylation (Fig. 5 C). Importantly, the effects of PA were not due to effects on ceramide uptake, as 30 μmDiC18:1-PA did not affect uptake of C6-ceramide (Fig. 5 D). Moreover, the direct metabolites of PA, LPA, and DiC8 had no effects on C6-ceramide-induced Rb dephosphorylation (Fig.5 C). Ceramide has been shown to induce caspase activation as measured by proteolysis of PARP (20Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21Martin S.J. Takayama S. Mcgahon A.J. Miyashita T. Corbeil J. Kolesnick R.N. Reed J.C. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 253-257PubMed Google Scholar). First, and in order to determine whether phosphatases are involved in the induction of the proteolysis of PARP by ceramide, we examined the effects of calyculin A or okadaic acid on ceramide-induced PARP proteolysis in Molt-4 cells. Calyculin A, but not okadaic acid, prevented PARP proteolysis induced by C6-ceramide (Fig.6 A). These results strongly suggest that PP1 is the primary phosphatase involved in mediating the effects of exogenous ceramides on caspase activation. Next, we evaluated the effects of DiC18:1-PA on ceramide-induced PARP proteolysis. DiC18:1-PA, but not LPA or DiC8 prevented, at least in part, C6-ceramide-induced PARP proteolysis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). We also examined whether PA treatment had an affect on the time course of PARP cleavage in response to ceramide. Neither LPA nor DiC8affected the induction of PARP cleavage by ceramide treatment which began at approximately 3 h post-ceramide treatment (Fig.6 C). On the other hand, DiC18:1-PA-treated cells did not demonstrate PARP cleavage in response to C6-ceramide until 7 h (Fig. 6 C). These data suggest that ceramide may induce PARP proteolysis through PP1 activation and that PA is able to inhibit activation of PP1 by ceramide in cells. In this study, we demonstrated that PA may function as a potent and selective inhibitor of PP1 and opposes the effects of ceramide on PP1 in vitro and in cells. Notably, the in vitroinhibition of PP1 by PA shows relatively high potency with some specificity to PA and high selectivity for PP1. PA had aK i value of 80 nm in the inhibition of PP1, whereas other reported biochemical effects of PA have required a micromolar range (7Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 9Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 23Ito M. Feng J. Tsujino S. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Takano J. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7607-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Other phospholipids were either without effects or with only weak effects seen with other anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin, which inhibited PP1α by less than 40% at 1 μm. Conversely, PA did not inhibit other serine/threonine phosphatases that were tested, thus demonstrating selectivity of action. The inhibition of PP1 by PA carries important implications for a possible physiologic role of PP1 in PA action, and for possible dual regulation of PP1 by PA and ceramide. The in vitro results suggest a direct interaction between PA and the catalytic subunit of PP1α in the absence of any other regulatory subunits. Recently, however, acidic phospholipids, including PA, were reported to bind the regulatory subunit (130 kDa) of PP1 (muscle myosin phosphatase) and may cause its association with liposomes (23Ito M. Feng J. Tsujino S. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Takano J. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7607-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, PA may have multiple sites of interaction with heteromeric PP1. Indeed, these studies raise the possibility that PP1 may function as a preferred cellular target for the action of PA. PA has received increased attention as a candidate second messenger/lipid mediator, and PA formation in cells has been shown to be regulated by the action of either PLD or DAG kinase. Agonist-induced activation of PLD has been the better studied and documented of these two pathways, and it appears to involve the action of small G proteins and protein kinase C (6English D. Cui Y. Siddiqui R.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22English D. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 24Billah M.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This regulated formation of PA has led to the hypothesis that PA may function as a lipid second messenger; however, further evaluation of this hypothesis has been hampered by the difficulty in delivering PA to cells and by the difficulty in distinguishing effects of PA from those of DAG (with which it is metabolically interconvertible through the action of PA phosphohydrolases and DAG kinases). Despite these difficulties, a number of candidate direct targets for the action of PA have been identified in vitro and proposed as mediators of cellular action of PA. These include protein kinases, Ras GTPase-activating protein, phospholipase C, and cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases (6English D. Cui Y. Siddiqui R.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22English D. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,28Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1989; 247: 1151-1157Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These in vitro effects require μmconcentrations of PA. In contrast, the effects of PA on PP1 are pronounced in the nm range, and as such PP1 is the most sensitive target for PA in vitro identified thus far. Moreover, the specificity of PA effects (even over LPA) provides further support for a potent and specific interaction of PP1 with PA. The ability of PA, delivered exogenously, to inhibit PP1-dependent activities, such as activation of caspases, shows that cellular PP1 is responsive to changes in PA. Moreover, these effects were specific to PA in that neither DAG nor LPA, the two metabolites usually associated with PA formation, was active in these assays. The effects of exogenous PA were not as potent as the in vitro effects due to low cellular uptake of PA (approximately1200 of the [32P]DiC18:1-PA was taken up by the cells). Indeed, it was somewhat surprising that this negatively charged lipid exerted significant cellular effects. These considerations lead us to propose that PP1 may function as a direct intracellular target for PA generated from agonist stimulation of PLD (or possibly from the action of DAG kinase). PP1 is reported to be the major protein phosphatase associated with the microsomes of several tissues (5Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar), and Ito et al. (23Ito M. Feng J. Tsujino S. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Takano J. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7607-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) recently reported that myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (PP1cδ) was observed in the cytosol and the plasma membrane throughout the mitotic cycle. Indeed, the inhibition of PP1 by PA is consistent with the proposed mitogenic effects of PLD. Results from this study and from others are beginning to implicate PP1 in activation of caspases and Rb, thus connecting PP1 to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, respectively. In previous studies, ceramides were shown to inhibit PLD (31Gomez-Munoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

In addition, PA was reported to have opposite actions to ceramide on cellular responses: 1) ceramide causes cell cycle arrest (14Heitman J. Koller A. Cardenas M.E. Hall M.N. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 176-187Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but PA causes cell proliferation and opposes the effects of ceramide on proliferation (6English D. Cui Y. Siddiqui R.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22English D. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 2) Ceramide inactivates PKCα (36Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), but PA may activate PKC (6English D. Cui Y. Siddiqui R.A. Chem. Phys.

Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 3) Ceramide inhibits superoxide formation and calcium influx (37Wong K. Li X.B. Hunchuk N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3056-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but PA activates NADPH oxidase to form superoxide and induces calcium influx (22English D. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here, we find that PA has effects opposing those of ceramide on PP1. In cell studies, we show that the combination of PA and okadaic acid potently prevent Rb dephosphorylation induced by ceramide. Lee et al. 3J. Y. Lee, L. M. Obeid, and Y. A. Hannun, unpublished observation. showed that Rb is a direct substrate for both PP1 and PP2A. This is consistent with the current results and with our previous data showing that okadaic acid alone did not prevent ceramide-induced Rb dephosphorylation in cells.2 We also show that calyculin A, but not okadaic acid, prevented ceramide-induced PARP proteolysis. This finding strongly suggests that PP1 is involved in the ceramide-induced apoptotic machinery. Importantly, PA also prevented ceramide-induced PARP proteolysis. This result further suggests that PA has an inhibitory activity on PP1 in the apoptotic pathway. Obviously, more studies are required to define the cellular mechanisms by which PA inhibits PP1 to prevent C6-ceramide-induced Rb dephosphorylation and PARP proteolysis. In conclusion, these studies show specific and direct interactions between PP1 and PA. They also show opposite functions between PA and ceramide on PP1 in vitro and in cells. Indeed, the activity of PP1 in cells may be subject to a balance of the relative effects of PA and ceramide. The results support an emerging hypothesis that PP1 is a lipid regulated enzyme.

During growth on poly- or disaccharides, the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus uses a novel type of glycolytic pathway that is deviant from the classical Embden-Meyerhof pathway in several respects (1Kengen S.W.M. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 119-137Crossref Google Scholar, 2De Vos W.M. Kengen S.W.M. Voorhorst W.G.B. Van der Oost J. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). First, instead of the classical ATP-dependent hexokinase, the pathway involves a novel ADP-dependent glucokinase (3Kengen S.W.M. De Bok F.A.M. Van Loo N.-D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. J.

Second, a novel ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase replaces the more common ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (3Kengen S.W.M. De Bok F.A.M. Van Loo N.-D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. J. Biol.

Third, the pathway is modified in the degradation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which involves glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase instead of the conventional couple glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase (5Mukund S.

Modifications of the classical Embden-Meyerhof pathway at one or more of these three steps have also been observed in members of the hyperthermophilic archaeal genera Thermococcus, Desulfurococcus, andThermoproteus (2De Vos W.M.

Microbiol. 1997; 167: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The presence of these modifications inP. furiosus and other hyperthermophilic microorganisms suggests that these are adaptations to elevated temperatures as a result of an altered biochemistry or a decreased stability of biomolecules. Although ATP is regarded as the universal energy carrier and the most common phosphoryl group donor for kinases, several gluco- and phosphofructokinases with a different cosubstrate specificity have been described. Beside ADP-dependent gluco- and phosphofructokinases that have been demonstrated inPyrococcus and Thermococcus spp. (3Kengen S.W.M. De Bok F.A.M. Van Loo N.-D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. J.

Microbiol. 1997; 167: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), polyphosphate-dependent glucokinases have been found in several other microorganisms. In addition, the glucokinase ofPropionibacterium can use both ATP and polyphosphate as phosphoryl group donor (8Phillips N.F.B. Horn P.J. Wood H.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPi-dependent phosphofructokinases have been described in several eukarya and bacteria and the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermoproteus tenax (9Siebers B. Klenk H.-P. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses of phosphofructokinases grouped these enzymes into three clusters. In a multiple alignment of representatives of each cluster, functionally important residues were identified that were highly conserved between all phosphofructokinases (9Siebers B. Klenk H.-P. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ADP-dependent phosphofructokinases were not included in this study, because primary sequences of these enzymes were not yet available. In this paper, we describe the cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of the ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase from P. furiosus. It is the first molecular and biochemical characterization of an ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase to date. Acetyl phosphate (potassium-lithium salt, crystallized), ADP (disodium salt), AMP (disodium salt, crystallized), aldolase (d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphated-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase, EC 4.1.2.13; rabbit muscle), ATP (disodium salt), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (trisodium salt, crystallized), GDP (dilithium salt), glucose 6-phosphate (disodium salt), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (d-glucose-6-phosphate:NADP+1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49; yeast), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8; rabbit muscle), NADH (disodium salt), phosphoenolpyruvate (tricyclohexylammonium salt), phosphoglucose isomerase (d-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9; yeast), and triosephosphate isomerase (d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.1; rabbit muscle) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. d-Fructose-1-phosphate (barium salt), d-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (sodium salt),d-fructose 6-phosphate (disodium salt), β-NADP (sodium salt), sea salts, sodium phosphate glass type 35, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate pentasodium, and trisodium trimetaphosphate were from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Life Technologies Inc. Mono Q HR 5/5, Phenyl-Superose HR 5/5, Q-Sepharose fast flow, and Superdex 200 prep grade were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, hydroxyapatite Biogel HT was from Bio-Rad.P. furiosus (DSM 3638) was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms (Braunschweig, Germany). Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue and E. coli BL21(DE3) were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The expression vector pET9d was obtained from Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). P. furiosus was mass-cultured (200 liters) in an artificial seawater medium supplemented with Na2WO4 (10 μm), yeast extract (1 g/liter), and vitamins, as described before (10Kengen S.W.M. Luesink E.J. Stams A.J.M. Zehnder A.J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) but with lower concentrations of Na2S (0.25 g/liter) and NaCl (20 g/liter). The fermentor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) was sparged with N2, and potato starch was used as substrate (8 g/liter). E. coli XL1 Blue was used as a host for the construction of pET9d derivatives. E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as an expression host. Both strains were grown in Luria Bertani medium with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) in a rotary shaker at 37 °C. P. furiosus cells from a 200-liter culture were harvested by continuous centrifugation (Sharples, Rueil, France) and stored at −20 °C until used. Cell-free extract was prepared by suspending cells in 2 volumes (w/v) of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8, and treatment in a French press at 100 megapascals. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × gat 10 °C. The supernatant was used for purification of the phosphofructokinase. The phosphofructokinase was partially purified from cell-free extract of P. furiosus. All purification steps were done without protection against oxygen. To prevent microbial contamination, all buffers contained 0.02% sodium azide. Phosphofructokinase activity was recovered from cell-free extract following precipitation between 40 and 60% ammonium sulfate saturation. The subsequent purification included chromatography on phenyl-Superose HR 5/5, Q-Sepharose fast flow, hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HT, mono Q HR 5/5, and Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration. Alternatively, cell-free extract was applied to a dye affinity chromatography system as described before (11Hondmann D.H.A. Visser J. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 510: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The previously obtained N-terminal amino acid sequence of the ADP-dependent glucokinase from P. furiosus, partially published as MTXEXLYKN(I/A), whereX = ambiguous residue (4Kengen S.W.M. Tuininga J.E. De Bok F.A.M. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30453-30457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), was used for BLAST search of the P. furiosus data base. 1Utah Genome Center,http://www.genome.utah.edu. After exchanging the ambiguous residues with several possible amino acids, a putative glucokinase gene was identified. Using the sequence of this gene, another open reading frame was identified by nucleotide sequence similarity in the P. furiosus data base. The following primer set was designed to amplify this open reading frame by polymerase chain reaction: BG447 (5′-GCGCGTCATGATAGATGAAGTCAGAGAGCTCG, sense) and BG448 (5′-GCGCGGGATCCTTACTGATGCCTTCTTAGGAGGGA, antisense), withBspHI and BamHI restriction sites in bold. The 100-μl polymerase chain reaction mixture contained 100 ng ofP. furiosus DNA, isolated as described before (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 100 ng each of primer BG447 and BG448, 0.2 mm dNTPs,Pfu polymerase buffer, and 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase and was subjected to 35 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94 °C, 45 sec at 60 °C, and 3 min 30 sec at 72 °C) on a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested (BspHI/BamHI) and cloned into an NcoI/BamHI-digested pET9d vector, resulting in pLUW572, which was transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue and BL21(DE3). Sequence analysis on pLUW572 was done by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with a Li-Cor automatic sequencing system (model 4000L). Sequencing data were analyzed using the computer program DNASTAR. An overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing pLUW572 was used as a 1% inoculum in 1 liter of Luria Bertani medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. After growth for 16 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (2200 ×g for 20 min) and resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The suspension was passed twice through a French press (100 megapascals), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min). The resulting supernatant was used for purification of the recombinant phosphofructokinase. TheE. coli cell-free extract was heated for 30 min at 80 °C, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column that was equilibrated with 20 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5. Bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0 to 1 m in Tris/HCl buffer). Active fractions were pooled and desalted with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5, using a Centricon filter with a 30-kDa cutoff. Protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 as described before (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of the enzyme was checked by SDS-PAGE 2The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, morpholinoethanesulfonic acid as described before (10Kengen S.W.M. Luesink E.J. Stams A.J.M. Zehnder A.J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Protein samples for SDS-PAGE were heated for 5 min at 100 °C in an equal volume of sample buffer (0.1 mcitrate-phosphate buffer, 5% SDS, 0.9% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, pH 6.8). ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase activity was measured aerobically in stoppered 1-ml quartz cuvettes at 50 °C as described before (3Kengen S.W.M. De Bok F.A.M. Van Loo N.-D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17537-17541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm fructose 6-phosphate, 0.2 mm NADH, 2.5 mm ADP, 3.9 units of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 11 units of triosephosphate isomerase, 0.23 units of aldolase, and 5–25 μl of enzyme preparation. The absorbance of NADH was followed at 340 nm (ε = 6.18 mm−1 cm−1). Care was taken that the auxiliary enzymes were never limiting. Specific enzyme activities were calculated from initial linear rates and expressed in units/mg of protein. 1 unit was defined as that amount of enzyme required to convert 1 μmol of fructose 6-phosphate/min. The activity of the enzyme in the reverse direction was measured in an assay containing 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 12.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 2.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm NADP, 0.35 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1.4 units of phosphoglucose isomerase, and 5–25 μl of enzyme preparation. The absorbance of NADPH was followed at 340 nm (ε = 6.18 mm−1 cm−1). The molecular mass of the partially purified phosphofructokinase from P. furiosuscell-free extract was determined on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column using 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8, with 150 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated using the following standard proteins: ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa). Molecular mass determination of the purified recombinant phosphofructokinase was done by running PAGE gels at various acrylamide percentages (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12%) as described before (14Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). The following molecular mass standards were used: lactalbumin (14.2 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), chicken egg albumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin monomer and dimer (66 and 132 kDa), and urease trimer and hexamer (272 and 545 kDa). The subunit molecular mass of the purified recombinant protein was determined by SDS-PAGE, using a molecular mass standard mix of carbonic anhydrase (31.0 kDa), ovalbumin (45.0 kDa), serum albumin (66.2 kDa), and phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa). The pH optimum of the phosphofructokinase was determined at 50 °C in 200 mm Tris/maleate buffer over the pH range 5.0–8.0. Buffer pH values were adjusted at this temperature. Care was taken that the auxiliary enzymes were not limiting at the various pH values. As possible phosphoryl group donors, ATP, GDP, GTP, pyrophosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, acetylphosphate, tripolyphosphate, trimetaphosphate (each 2.5 mm), and polyphosphate (sodium phosphate glass type 35, 0.25 mg/ml) were used in the activity assay instead of ADP. The divalent cation requirement was tested by adding 10 mm MnCl2, CaCl2, CoCl2 or ZnCl2 instead of MgCl2. Kinetic parameters were determined at 50 °C by varying the concentration of ADP (0.0125–5 mm) or fructose 6-phosphate (0.1–10 mm) in the assay mixture in the presence of 10 mm fructose 6-phosphate or 2.5 mm ADP, respectively. Data were analyzed by computer-aided direct fit to the Michaelis-Menten curve. Furthermore, the data were used to construct Hill plots (log (V/V max - V)versus log S). Regulation of phosphofructokinase activity by possible allosteric modulators was investigated by adding adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, or AMP; 2, 5, and 10 mm), metabolites (glucose, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, or citrate; 5 mm) or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (0.1 and 1 mm) to the assay mixture. Furthermore, the effect of KCl and NaCl (30, 150 and 500 mm) on the enzyme activity was tested. Cell-free extracts of P. furiosus showed a phosphofructokinase activity of 0.038 units/mg. However, despite the use of various chromatographic techniques, we were unable to obtain a highly purified enzyme, because it tended to stick to other proteins, resulting in similar band patterns upon PAGE after each purification step. When applied to a hydrophobic interaction column, phosphofructokinase activity was completely lost. Moreover, the use of dye affinity chromatography was not successful; although the phosphofructokinase did bind to a number of the tested dye ligands, it could not be eluted specifically with ADP. Aspecific elution with NaCl did not result in loss of contaminating proteins. Consequently, following chromatography on five different columns, the enzyme was purified 80-fold to a specific activity of 3 units/mg but still contained several contaminating proteins (Fig.1). Using the previously obtained N-terminal amino acid sequence of the ADP-dependent glucokinase (4Kengen S.W.M. Tuininga J.E. De Bok F.A.M. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30453-30457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), a putative glucokinase gene was identified in the P. furiosus genome sequence. Expression of the gene in E. coli resulted in an ADP-dependent glucokinase activity of 20 units/mg in cell-free extracts at 50 °C, confirming that the gene indeed encoded the glucokinase 3C. H. Verhees, J. E. Tuininga, S. W. M. Kengen, J. van der Oost, A. J. M. Stams, and W. M. de Vos, manuscript in preparation. . When the glucokinase gene, designated glkA, was used to search theP. furiosus genome, highest homology (25.7% nucleotide identity) was found with a 1365-base pair open reading frame predicted to encode a 455-amino acid protein. It was considered that this open reading frame might encode the ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase, and therefore the open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET9d, resulting in plasmid pLUW572. DNA sequence analysis of pLUW572 confirmed the successful and faultless cloning of the open reading frame into pET9d (not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis of a cell-free extract of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pLUW572 revealed an additional band of approximately 50 kDa, which corresponded with the calculated molecular mass (52.3 kDa) of the gene product. This band was absent in extracts of E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the pET9d plasmid without insert. In a cell-free extract of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pLUW572, an ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase activity of 3.48 units/mg was measured at 50 °C, confirming that indeed the P. furiosus phosphofructokinase gene, designatedpfkA, had been cloned and expressed. The enzyme could be produced for up to 5% of the total E. coli cell protein without inducing gene expression by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Therefore, no attempts were made to optimize the overexpression. On an amino acid level, the identity between the glucokinase and phosphofructokinase from P. furiosus was 21.1%. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the phosphofructokinase with those of proteins present in the GenBank data base showed high similarity with two hypothetical proteins from Pyrococcus horikoshii (PH1645, 75.2% identity; PH0589, 23.1% identity). Cloning and expression of the corresponding genes demonstrated that the proteins are an ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase and an ADP-dependent glucokinase, respectively (data not shown). Furthermore, 48.6% identity was found with a hypothetical protein from Methanococcus jannaschii(MJ1604), which turned out to be an ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase3. Multiple sequence alignment showed several conserved regions throughout the five proteins (Fig.2). Comparison of the conserved regions with sequences present in the GenBank data base did not reveal additional similarities. The recombinant phosphofructokinase was easily purified by a heat incubation and anion exchange chromatography to at least 95% homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The specific activity of the purified protein was 88 units/mg at 50 °C. On SDS-PAGE, the purified recombinant protein did not appear at the same height as the most abundant band in the partially purifiedP. furiosus fraction. However, because the phosphofructokinase activity of the partially purified P. furiosus cell-free extract is 3 units/mg, the enzyme represents only 3% of the total protein in the extract and can therefore not be most dominant band in lane 2 of the SDS-PAGE gel. SDS-PAGE of the purified recombinant phosphofructokinase gave a single band at 52 kDa (Fig. 1). The native molecular mass of the partially purified phosphofructokinase from P. furiosus cell-free extract, as determined by gel filtration chromatography, was approximately 180 kDa. This is in good agreement with the molecular mass determination of the purified recombinant phosphofructokinase. A native molecular mass of the phosphofructokinase of 179 kDa was calculated from the calibration curve (Fig.3), suggesting that the phosphofructokinase is a homotetramer. The phosphofructokinase showed activity between pH 5.5 and 7.0, with an optimum at pH 6.5 (data not shown). The purified phosphofructokinase only showed activity in the forward direction. The enzyme showed highest activity with ADP as a phosphoryl group donor, which could be replaced by GDP, ATP, and GTP to a limited extent (TableI). Divalent cations were required for activity of the enzyme, as shown by complete lack of activity in the presence of EDTA. Phosphofructokinase activity was highest in the presence of MgCl2, followed by CoCl2 (Table I). The partially purified enzyme from P. furiosus cell-free extract showed the same substrate specificity pattern (data not shown).Table ISubstrate specificity and cation dependence of the ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase from P. furiosusPhosphoryl group donorRelative activityDivalent cationRelative activity%%ADP100Mg2+100GDP28Co2+81ATP<10Mn2+43GTP<6Ca2+8PhosphoenolpyruvateND1-aND, not detectable.Zn2+NDPyrophosphateNDTripolyphosphateNDAcetylphosphateNDTrimetaphosphateNDPolyphosphateNDEnzyme assays were done at 50 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 100% activity corresponds to a specific activity of 88 units/mg.1-a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Enzyme assays were done at 50 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 100% activity corresponds to a specific activity of 88 units/mg. The purified phosphofructokinase showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics at 50 °C, with the following constants that were determined according to direct fit: K m values of 2.3 ± 0.3 and 0.11 ± 0.01 mm for fructose 6-phosphate and ADP, respectively, and V max values of 194 ± 13 and 150 ± 5 units/mg for fructose 6-phosphate and ADP, respectively. K m values determined for the partially purified enzyme from P. furiosus cell-free extracts were in the same order of magnitude. Furthermore, Hill coefficients of 1.1 (fructose 6-phosphate) and 0.95 (ADP) were determined, indicative of noncooperative binding of the substrates to each subunit of the tetrameric enzyme. The addition of glucose, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, citrate, or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate did not show any effect on the phosphofructokinase activity. Both NaCl and KCl had a negative effect on the phosphofructokinase activity (42 and 43% activity in 300 mm NaCl and KCl, respectively). Furthermore, the phosphofructokinase activity was negatively affected by the addition of ATP or AMP to the assay mixture. Because subsequent addition of MgCl2 did not restore activity, the negative effect was not because of binding of Mg2+ to the ATP or AMP, resulting in lower availability of the ions for the substrate ADP. The addition of 5 mm ATP or AMP resulted in an increase inK m values for ADP from 0.11 to 0.34 ± 0.02 or 0.41 ± 0.03 mm, respectively, whereas theV max did not change (Fig.4). This indicates competitive inhibition of the phosphofructokinase by ATP and AMP. Apparently, the phosphofructokinase is not allosterically regulated by ATP, AMP, or any of the other tested compounds. P. furiosus uses a modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway involving two novel-type kinases, i.e. an ADP-dependent glucokinase, which has previously been purified and characterized (4Kengen S.W.M. Tuininga J.E. De Bok F.A.M. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30453-30457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and an ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase. In cell-free extracts of mass-cultured P. furiosus cells grown on starch, a phosphofructokinase activity of 0.038 units/mg was measured. Purification of the ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase from cell-free extracts of P. furiosus was hampered, because the enzyme tended to stick to other proteins, and both dye affinity and hydrophobic interaction chromatography could not be used in the purification. However, an alternative approach became available following the identification of the P. furiosus pfkA gene encoding the phosphofructokinase, which was successfully overexpressed in E. coli. The recombinant phosphofructokinase was purified from E. coli to 95% homogeneity in a two-step purification. The specific activity of the purified protein was 88 units/mg at 50 °C, which is approximately 2300-fold higher than the activity in crude cell-free extract of P. furiosus (0.038 units/mg). This suggests that the phosphofructokinase represents a very small fraction (0.043%) of the total P. furiosus cell protein, which is unexpected for a catalytic enzyme present in an important metabolic pathway. However, using the experimentally determined relationship between activity and temperature (Q 10 = 2 (15Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 188-202Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar)), it can be calculated that the specific activity at 100 °C would be 2816 units/mg. Furthermore, it has been calculated before that the specific activity of phosphofructokinase in cell-free extracts of P. furiosusis sufficiently high to sustain the glucose flux (3Kengen S.W.M. De Bok F.A.M. Van Loo N.-D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17537-17541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase had a native molecular mass of 180 kDa and a subunit size of 52 kDa, in agreement with the deduced molecular mass of 52.3 kDa from the amino acid sequence. These data suggest that the phosphofructokinase has a tetrameric structure, which is most common for phosphofructokinases. ATP-dependent phosphofructokinases from bacteria and mammals are usually homotetramers with a subunit size of 33 and 85 kDa, respectively. Yeast phosphofructokinases show α4β4 octameric structures with subunits of 112 and 118 kDa, whereas PPi-dependent phosphofructokinases have been described to be monomers (110 kDa), homodimers (subunits of 48–55 kDa), homotetramers (subunits of 45 kDa), or heterotetramers (subunits of 60 and 65 kDa) (16Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 105-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by the phosphofructokinase was found to be irreversible. Therefore, P. furiosus needs a separate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate phosphatase to catalyze the conversion of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate during gluconeogenesis. Indeed, this enzyme has been detected in cell-free extract with a specific activity of 0.026 units/mg at 75 °C (17Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 354-363Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The irreversibility of the phosphofructokinase reaction has also been described for ATP-dependent phosphofructokinases, although PPi-dependent phosphofructokinases catalyze reversible reactions (16Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 105-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Apparent K m values of 2.3 and 0.11 mmwere found for fructose 6-phosphate and ADP, respectively. These values were determined at 50 °C, which is much lower than the optimal growth temperature of P. furiosus. Because temperature can have a dramatic effect on K mvalues, 4S. W. M. Kengen, unpublished observations. one has to realize that K m values at the optimum growth temperature of 100 °C could differ considerably from the data obtained in this study. Apparent K m values at 55 °C of the ADP-dependent phosphofructokinases from cell-free extracts of Thermococcus celer and T. litoralis were 2.5 and 4 mm, respectively, for fructose 6-phosphate and 0.2 and 0.4 mm, respectively, for ADP (7Selig M. Xavier K.B. Santos H. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the possible temperature effect makes it difficult to compare kinetic values of microorganisms with different optimal growth temperatures (100 °C for P. furiosus and 85 °C for bothThermococcus strains). For the purified PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase from T. tenax (optimal growth temperature 85 °C), much lowerK m values were found: 0.053 mm for fructose-6-phosphate and 0.023 mm for PPi(9Siebers B. Klenk H.-P. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase also showed activity with ATP, GTP, and GDP as phosphoryl group donors. In the case of ATP or GTP, however, the reaction product (ADP or GDP, respectively) is again an efficient phosphoryl group donor. Therefore, the relative activities with these compounds are probably overestimated. Furthermore, because of this fact, we were not able to determine kinetic values for ATP. The phosphofructokinase was found to be inhibited by ATP and AMP through a competitive mechanism. In the case of ATP, this is not surprising, because ATP itself is a substrate and must therefore be able to bind to the catalytic site. In view of the role of phosphofructokinases in regulating the glycolytic pathway, it is surprising to see that ATP and AMP have the same (negative) effect on the activity of the phosphofructokinase. Allosterically regulated phosphofructokinases are usually inhibited by ATP but stimulated by AMP. ATP-dependent phosphofructokinases from E. coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus are allosterically activated by ADP and GDP and inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate. Both yeast and mammalian phosphofructokinases are regulated by a large variety of effectors. Beside allosteric regulation by ATP and AMP, the enzymes are inhibited by citrate and activated by phosphate. Only mammalian enzymes are allosterically activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. A very potent allosteric stimulator of eukaryotic phosphofructokinases is fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which acts synergistically with AMP. This compound has been detected in most eukaryotes but never in prokaryotes (16Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 105-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Apparently, the ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase from P. furiosus is not allosterically regulated at all, and therefore it can not act as the major control point of the glycolytic pathway. Alternatively, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase could be an important enzyme in control of the glycolysis of P. furiosus (6Van der Oost J. Schut G. Kengen S.W.M. Hagen W.R. Thomm M. De Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28149-28154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase from T. tenax is not allosterically controlled either, nor does it function as the major control point of the glycolytic pathway of this organism (9Siebers B. Klenk H.-P. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hill plot analysis indicated that the phosphofructokinase did not cooperatively bind either of the substrates ADP and fructose 6-phosphate, in contrast to the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinases from E. coli and B. stearothermophilus, which were found to show cooperative binding to fructose 6-phosphate but not to ATP (16Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 105-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The assumption that the open reading frame related to theglkA, found in the P. furiosus genome, might encode the ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase was based on the observation that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the glucokinase did not show any homology to known sugar kinases (4Kengen S.W.M. Tuininga J.E. De Bok F.A.M. Stams A.J.M. De Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30453-30457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the P. furiosus genome data base, no sequence could be found that showed significant homology to either gluco-, hexo-, or phosphofructokinases. Because both enzymes are ADP-dependent kinases, they could have identical ADP and sugar binding sites and might therefore be homologous to each other. This hypothesis was confirmed when the expressed open reading frame indeed turned out to encode the ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase. Primary sequence analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the glucokinase and the phosphofructokinase showed that the proteins are significantly homologous and share several conserved regions. The functionally important residues for substrate binding that have been described for ATP- and PPi-dependent phosphofructokinases (9Siebers B. Klenk H.-P. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did, however, not seem to be present in any of the sequences of the ADP-dependent kinases, suggesting they represent a novel group of kinases. Altogether, these findings suggest that the glucokinase and the phosphofructokinase from P. furiosus are phylogenetically related. Further research is focused on scientific evidence for this suggestion.

Another lymphoid-specific adaptor FYB/SLAP has also been identified as a predominant binding partner of SLP-76 and the Src kinase FYN-T, although its role in the activation process has been unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that FYN-T selectively phosphorylates FYB providing a template for the recruitment of FYN-T and SLP-76 SH2 domain binding. This interaction is unusual in its distinct cytoplasmic localization and its long term stable kinetics of phosphorylation. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that the co-expression of all three components of the FYN-T-FYB-SLP-76 matrix can synergistically up-regulate T-cell receptor-driven interleukin 2 transcription activity. These findings document the existence of a T-cell receptor-regulated FYN-T-FYB pathway that interfaces with the adaptor SLP-76 and up-regulates lymphokine production in T-cells.

Ligation of CD4/CD8-p56Lck and the T-cell receptor complex (TcRζ 1The abbreviations used are: TcR, T-cell receptor; ITAMs, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs; IL-2, interleukin 2; SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; FCS, fetal calf serum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HA, hemagglutinin/CD3) activates Src protein-tyrosine kinases p56Lck and p59Fyn-T (1Rudd C.E.

Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Activation of ZAP-70 catalytic activity then requires phosphorylation of the kinase at residue Tyr-493 by p56Lck (7Chan A.C.

The p56LckSH2 domain can also bind to ZAP-70, thereby consolidating CD4-p56Lck within the TcR aggregate (9Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The importance of p56Lck and ZAP-70 has been shown in kinase negative Jurkat cells that show defects in Ca2+ mobilization, tyrosine phosphorylation, and IL-2 transcription (10Straus D. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 11Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R. Samelson L. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified an array of immune cell-specific adaptor proteins in T-cells that act as substrates for upstream kinases and play important roles in T-cell function (12Rudd C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Peterson E.J. Clements J.L. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These include the LAT (linker for activation of T-cells), VAV, SLP-76 (SH2 domain-containing leukocyteprotein of 76 kDa), and FYB/SLAP (Fyn T-bindingprotein/SLP-76-associatedprotein)). LAT (pp36) is a transmembrane type III surface protein with a small extracellular region attached to a long cytoplasmic tail (14Weber J.R. Orstavik S. Torgersen K.M. Danbolt N.C. Berg S.F. Ryan J.C. Tasken K. Imboden J.B. Vaage J.T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Zhang W.J. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). It is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells, primarily in T-cells, natural killer cells, mast cells but not B-cells. Rather than binding extracellular ligands, LAT has the hallmarks of a specialized surface protein that acts as an anchor for multiple intracellular proteins. LAT-binding proteins include the established transducing molecules such as growth factor binding protein-2 (GRB-2), Son of sevenless (SOS), VAV, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, the cellular homologue of Casitas B-lineage lymphoma protein (c-Cbl), and SLP-76. Consensus motifs for direct SH2 domain binding exist for GRB-2 and phospholipase Cγ, whereas other components may be indirectly recruited. Although the exact mechanism by which LAT is coupled to the TcRζ·CD3 complex remains to be defined, it is involved in integrating signals from the receptor as demonstrated by the ability of dominant negative form of LAT to inhibit NF-AT transcriptional activity (15Zhang W.J. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). LAT is also needed for the activation of phospholipase Cγ and the Ras pathway (16Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). One potentially important link to LAT is SLP-76, another immune cell-specific cytoplasmic adaptor (17Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It is a relatively hydrophilic protein with an acidic amino-terminal region, several tyrosine consensus motifs, a central proline-rich region, and a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain. As expected of an adaptor, SLP-76 also binds multiple proteins including Nck, c-Cbl, phospholipase Cγ, and VAV. SLP-76−/− knock-out mice show that SLP-76 is required for pre-TcR signaling with a block at the double negative stage of differentiation (18Clements J.L. Yang B. Ross-Barta S.E. Eliason S.L.

Cell. 1998; 94: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Jurkat T-cells lacking SLP-76 also show defects in Ras activation, CD69 expression, and the activation of NFAT transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter (20Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 218: 413-416Crossref Scopus (355) Google Scholar). SLP-76 serves as a substrate for ZAP-70 (21Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H.

Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), an event that facilitates binding to the SH2 domain of VAV (22Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E.

Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). SYK also promotes the binding of the adaptor NCK to the same region, leading to the formation of a SLP-76·VAV·NCK trimolecular complex that may regulate cytoskeletal organization (26Wardenburg J.B. Pappu R. Bu J.-Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, overexpression of SLP-76, NCK, and VAV enhanced TcR-induced actin polymerization, whereas dominant negative forms of these components inhibited polymerization (26Wardenburg J.B. Pappu R. Bu J.-Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SLP-76 is also connected with two other lymphoid-specific proteins, Vav and FYB/SLAP. VAV has a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain for the Rho and Rac GTPases (27Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), a pleckstrin homology domain, a cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) domain, as well as two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain at its carboxyl terminus (28Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The regulation of Rac is in turn correlated with defects in actin-dependent TcRζ/CD3 cap formation in Vav−/− T-cells (29Holsinger L.J. Graef I.A. Swat W. Chi T. Bautista D.M. Davidson L. Lewis R.S.

VAV becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to antigen-receptor ligation (31Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M. Nature. 1992; 356: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and binds via its SH2 domain to SLP-76 (23Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretsky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 24Onodera H. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol.

Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Overexpression of VAV and SLP-76 increases TcR-mediated IL-2 transcription in a cooperative manner (23Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretsky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 25Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendriks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), although VAV·SLP-76 complex formation itself is not needed for TcR-induced IL-2 production in all T-cells (22Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Another connection to SLP-76 signaling involves its SH2 domain binding to FYB/SLAP. FYB/SLAP was independently cloned on the basis of its ability to bind to the Src-related kinase FYN-T and SLP-76 (32Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 33da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It also has the hallmarks of an adaptor protein with several proline-rich regions, multiple tyrosine-containing motifs, and two putative nuclear localization sequences linked to a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain. As with LAT and SLP-76, FYB is restricted in expression to lymphoid cells, in particular T-cells and macrophages, but not in B-cells. Two FYB isoforms at 120 and 130 kDa are known, which differ due to a 46-amino acid insert in the 130-kDa form between the two nuclear localization sequences. 2M. Veale, M. Raab, Z. Li, A. da Silva, S.-K. Kraeft, S. Weremowicz, C. C. Morton, and C. E. Rudd, submitted for publication. FYB also undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TcR ligation, an event diminished in FYN-T-deficient T-cells (35da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike with SLP-76, transfection studies with FYB have yielded conflicting results on the role of FYB/SLAP in the regulation of IL-2 production. One report found that FYB/SLAP potentiated IL-2 production (33da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and another report has postulated a negative function for the protein (32Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Part of the uncertainty related to the effects of FYB/SLAP on lymphokine production may be related to its binding to the Src kinase FYN-T, an immune cell-specific variant of the Src kinase FYN. FYN-T associates with the antigen-receptor in T-cells (36Samelson L.E. Phillips A.F. Luong E.T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, expression of constitutively active FYN in LCK−/− mice can restore the differentiation of single positive thymocytes (42Groves T. Smiley P. Cooke M.P. Forbush K. Perlmutter R.M.

However, the selective binding of the SH2 domain of FYN-T (and not the other Src kinase LCK) to FYB provides a novel avenue by which the FYN-T kinase could intervene in TcR signaling (33da Silva A.J.

Med. 1993; 178: 2107-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that the Src kinase FYN-T (but not LCK or ZAP-70) regulates the binding of the FYN-T and SLP-76 SH2 domains to distinct sites on FYB. Furthermore, we show that members of the matrix co-localize in the cytoplasm of cells and cooperatively up-regulate TcR-initiated IL-2 promoter activity. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) cell line IPLB-SF21 was obtained from Invitrogen and was propagated as a monolayer culture in Sf900 insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin according to the procedure of Brown and Faulkner (60Brown M. Faulkner P. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 361-364Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Viral infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for protein production and of 0.1 for virus production. COS cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 5% (v/v) FCS, 1% (w/v) penicillin and streptomycin, and 1 (v/v) l-glutamine. COS cells were transfected with cDNAs inserted into the SRα2 expression vector (gift of Dr. M. Streuli, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). COS cell transfections were conducted according to standard protocols. The murine T-cell hybridoma, DC27.10 (gift of Dr. R. Zamoyska, Medical Research Council, London, UK), Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. mAb to SLP-76 was kindly provided by Dr. Paul R. Findell (Syntex, Palo Alto, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was kindly provided by Dr. Tom Roberts (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Anti-FYN mAb was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit antisera against p59Fyn-T and p56Lck were generated against synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 35–51 and 39–64, respectively. Anti-murine CD3 (2C11) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Immunoprecipitations were conducted as described previously (22Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E.

Briefly, either 1.5 × 106 Sf21 cells were infected with the baculovirus encoding the different proteins, 2 × 105COS cells were transfected with the different DNAs using DEAE-dextran, or 25 × 106 DC27.10 were electroporated with the different DNAs. After 2 days cells were harvested and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin). Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubation of the lysate with the antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (10% w/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and then probed with the indicated antibody. Bound antibody was revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peptides were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography purified by the Molecular Biology Core Facility (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). The sequences of the peptides used were as follows (with pY indicating the phosphorylated residue): phosphorylated peptide III, DDIpYDGIEEED; unphosphorylated peptide III, DDIYDGIEEED; phosphorylated peptide II, DEVpYDDVDTSD; unphosphorylated peptide II, DEVYDDVDTSD; phosphorylated peptide I, RGSpYGYIKTTA; unphosphorylated peptide I, RGSYGYIKTTA. For the binding analysis, peptides were coupled to AminoLink Plus gel beads (Pierce). The beads were added to the lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were then washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To activate Jurkat and the DC27.10 murine T-cell hybridoma, 50 × 106 cells were incubated with pre-warmed RPMI media supplemented with 2% FCS, containing either 1 μg/ml OKT3 and 2 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse for Jurkat or 5 μg/ml 145-2C11 (anti-CD3ε) and 10 μg/ml of the rabbit anti-hamster antibody for DC27.10 at 37 °C for varying lengths of time. Following activation, cells were then rapidly pelleted and solubilized in lysis buffer, as described above. Cells were plated on glass coverslips and grown for 1 day prior to staining. Cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized for 10 min in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. To detect FYN-T, FYB, and SLP-76, permeabilized cells were exposed to the antigen-specific antibodies in blocking buffer (2% (v/v) normal goat and 10% (v/v) rabbit serum in PBS) for 1 h, followed by a brief wash and incubation with isotype-specific secondary antibody (Texas Red or FITC-labeled, Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and 0.5 mg/ml Hoechst dye 33238 (Sigma, to visualize DNA (blue)). Slides were mounted in a polyvinyl alcohol medium and viewed on a Nikon FXA microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Photographs were taken using Fujichrome ASA 400 film. Jurkat cells (2 × 107) were co-transfected with 20 μg of FYN-T, FYB, and SLP-76 cDNAs alone or in combinations plus 5 μg of IL-2 full-length LUC reporter plasmid or 3× NFAT/AP-1-LUC reporter plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Burakoff, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) and 0.2 μg of a control reporter plasmid (pRL-TK from Promega). Cells were pulsed using BTX Gene Pulser at 250 V, 800 microfarads in 10% FCS. Cells (1 × 106) were aliquoted into a 12-well plate 16 h after transfection and cultured in a final volume of 1 ml of RPMI growth medium. Cells were unstimulated or stimulated at 37 °C with OKT3 or 10 ng/ml PMA. After 6 h stimulation cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Promega kit). Luciferase activity was determined using the luminometer (MicroLumat, EG7G Berthold) immediately after the addition of 100 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega kit) followed by a Stop and Go reaction to measure the control reporter plasmid (dual luciferase system kit from Promega). Luciferase units of the experimental vector were normalized to the level of the control vector in each sample. Previous studies have shown that FYB preferentially associates with the Src kinase FYN-T and the intracellular signaling protein SLP-76 (32Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of FYN-T phosphorylation of FYB and to assess whether it regulates FYB·SLP-76 complex formation, FYB was co-expressed with either the LCK, FYN-T, or ZAP-70 kinase in COS cells and was assessed for phosphorylation by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting (Fig. 1 A). Only FYN-T was found to consistently phosphorylate FYB (lane 3). ZAP-70 failed to phosphorylate the protein in each of five experiments (lane 4). Similar negative results were obtained using the combination of LCK and ZAP-70 (data not shown). In addition, LCK showed little phosphorylation of FYB (lane 2). Specificity was also seen in a comparison with SLP-76 as substrate (Fig. 1 B). In this case, as previously reported (21Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H.

Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), ZAP-70 preferentially phosphorylated SLP-76 (lane 4). Some FYN-T phosphorylation of SLP-76 was observed but at levels some 2–5-fold less than ZAP-70 (lane 3). No phosphorylation by LCK was evident (lane 2), although using the same system, LCK has previously been found to phosphorylate selectively the TcR ζ chain (6Iwashima M. Irving B.A. Van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 22Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As an internal control for expression, FYB and SLP-76 (Fig. 1, A andB, lower panels), and the kinases (Lck, FYN-T, and ZAP-70) in each co-transfectant was expressed at significant levels (data not shown). These observations demonstrate that among the three TcR associated kinases, FYN-T preferentially phosphorylates FYB. In order for FYN-T phosphorylation of FYB to be of functional importance, one would expect the kinase to phosphorylate sites that are needed for FYN-T and/or SLP-76 SH2 domain binding. To examine this, it was first necessary to identify the site(s) of FYN-T phosphorylation in FYB. To accomplish this, several deletion mutants of FYB were generated from residues 450, 585, 670, and 707 to the carboxyl terminus and were assessed for phosphorylation. The structure of each mutant is illustrated in Fig. 1 C. Deletion mutant 707 selectively deletes the SH3-like domain (Δ707); 670 deletes the putative second nuclear localization motif and the SH3-like domain (Δ670); 585 additionally deletes the above plus two YDDV motifs and a YDGI motif (Δ585); and 450 deletes the above plus a YEDI motif and another putative nuclear localization motif (Δ450). Each mutant was HA epitope-tagged, co-expressed with FYN-T in COS cells, and examined for phosphorylation (Fig.1 C, lower left panels). Although the Δ707 and Δ670 mutants underwent phosphorylation at levels comparable to wild-type (lanes 2–4), deletion from residue 585 resulted in an abrupt loss of FYB phosphorylation by FYN-T (lanes 4–6). FYB expression was found to be equivalent for the different mutants as detected by anti-HA blotting (lower left panel). Importantly, these results could be duplicated in T-cells. Using the T-cell hybridoma DC27.10, wild-type FYB, Δ707, and Δ670 mutants showed similar levels of phosphorylation (right lower panel, lanes 7, 3, and 4, respectively). Again, the majority of phosphorylation was lost with the Δ585 mutant (lane 5). The Δ450 mutant also showed no phosphorylation (lane 6). Each of the proteins was expressed at high levels as observed by anti-HA blotting (lower right panel, lanes 1–7). Background phosphorylation by endogenous FYN-T was also observed but only with overexposure of the film (data not shown). These data confirm that in both COS and T-cells, the primary FYN-T phosphorylation site(s) is located between residues 585 and 670. The above result was initially found to be somewhat surprising given the ideal nature of the YEDI motif (at residues 472–475) for Src-SH2 domain binding. Therefore, to exclude more rigorously whether the YEDI site served as a target, we analyzed another clone of FYB (termed J12) that encodes a limited stretch between residues 395 and 545 (Fig.1 D). In this construct, the YEDI motif is the only possible tyrosine phosphorylation site. However, J12 failed to become phosphorylated when co-expressed with FYN-T (lane 2). As controls, a mutant form of J12 lacking the tyrosine failed to undergo phosphorylation (lane 3), whereas full-length FYB became phosphorylated (lane 4). This observation indicates that the YEDI motif is unlikely to serve as a phosphorylation site for FYN-T. Taken together, these data identified the region between residues 585 and 670 as the region of FYN-T phosphorylation. In order to assess whether phosphorylation by FYN-T leads to SH2 domain binding of FYN-T and/or SLP-76, lysates from cells transfected with FYN-T and the deletion mutants were subjected to precipitation using GST-SH2 fusion proteins. Under these conditions, FYN-T phosphorylation of FYB was found to induce the binding of the SH2 domains of both FYN-T and SLP-76 (Fig. 2 A, lan"
https://openalex.org/W1968873509,"A cDNA clone for a novel carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozyme was isolated from human pancreas and salivary glands. The cDNA sequence of 1182 base pairs encoded a 317-amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 36.4 kDa. The highest similarity of this cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence is to human CA V (mitochondrial CA), hereafter referred to as CA VA. Recombinant protein expressed in COS-7 cells transfected with this cDNA clone was enriched in a mitochondrial fraction. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed cytoplasmic granular signals in COS-7 cells expressing a fusion protein of the novel CA and green fluorescent protein. Several lines of evidence suggest that the cDNA clone presented herein encodes a novel human mitochondrial CA isozyme, designated CA VB. CA VB has a hydrophobic N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence (33 amino acid residues). Western blot analysis showed a 36-kDa protein precursor and a 32-kDa mature protein for CA VB. Similar to CA VA, CA VB is a low activity enzyme with a sensitivity to acetazolamide. The CA VB gene is located on Xp22.1. Northern blot analysis in normal human tissues demonstrated expression of a 1.3-kilobase transcript in heart and skeletal muscle, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed expression of CA VB in pancreas, kidney, salivary glands, and spinal cord but not in liver. CA VA mRNA expression was observed only in liver. These findings indicate these are two genetically distinct isoforms of human CA V, designated CA VA and CA VB, which have different patterns of tissue-specific distribution, suggest different physiological roles for the two mitochondrial isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W2077231895,"Tissue type transglutaminase (TGII, also known as G<sub>h</sub>) has been considered a multifunctional protein, with both transglutaminase and GTPase activity. The role of the latter function, which is proposed as a coupling mechanism between α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and phospholipase C (PLC), is not well defined. TGII was overexpressed in transgenic mice in a cardiac specific manner to delineated relevant signaling pathways and their consequences in the heart. Cardiac transglutaminase activity in the highest expressing line was ∼37-fold greater than in nontransgenic lines. However, <i>in vivo</i> signaling to PLC, as assessed by inositol phosphate turnover in [<sup>3</sup>H]myoinositol organ bath atrial preparations, was not increased in the TGII mice at base line or in response to α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor stimulation; nor was protein kinase Cα (PKCα) or PKCε activity enhanced in the TGII transgenic mice. This is in contrast to mice moderately (∼5-fold) overexpressing G<sub>αq</sub>, where inositol phosphate turnover and PKC activity were found to be clearly enhanced. TGII overexpression resulted in a remodeling of the heart with mild hypertrophy, elevated expression of β-myosin heavy chain and α-skeletal actin genes, and diffuse interstitial fibrosis. Resting ventricular function was depressed, but responsiveness to β-agonist was not impaired. This set of pathophysiologic findings is distinct from that evoked by overexpression of G<sub>αq</sub>. We conclude that TGII acts in the heart primarily as a transglutaminase, and modulation of this function results in unique pathologic sequelae. Evidence for TGII acting as a G-protein-like transducer of receptor signaling to PLC in the heart is not supported by these studies."

We generated transgenic mice containing a human angiotensinogen gene flanked by loxP sites (hAGTflox). To examine the physiologic consequences of tissue-specific loss of angiotensinogen gene function in vivo, we constructed an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Studies were performed in several independent lines of hAGTflox mice before and after intravenous administration of either Adcre or AdβGal as a control. Systemic administration of Adcre caused a significant decrease in circulating human angiotensinogen and markedly blunted the pressor response to administration of purified recombinant human renin. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from various organs revealed that the Cre-mediated deletion was liver-specific. Further analysis revealed the absence of full-length human angiotensinogen mRNA and protein in the liver but not the kidney of Adcre mice, consistent with the liver being the target for adenoviruses administered intravenously. These studies demonstrate that extra-hepatic sources of angiotensinogen do not contribute significantly to the circulating pool of angiotensinogen and provide proof-of-principle that the Cre-loxP system can be used effectively to examine the contribution of the systemic and tissue renin-angiotensin system to normal and pathological regulation of blood pressure.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 1The abbreviations used are: RAS, renin-angiotensin system; AGT, angiotensinogen; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); Ad, adenovirus has long been known to play a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and extracellular fluid volume through the systemic and intrarenal actions of angiotensin II. Classically, angiotensin II is processed in the circulation by the successive proteolytic actions of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme on angiotensinogen (AGT). Circulating AGT is derived mainly from the liver, although it is also synthesized by the kidney, heart, brain, vasculature, and fat (1Lynch K.R. Peach M.J. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although extra-hepatic AGT is not thought to provide a source of circulating AGT, local synthesis of other components of the RAS including angiotensin II receptors in these tissues suggests the potential for both local synthesis and action of angiotensin II. Indeed, angiotensin II has been postulated to regulate blood flow, natriuresis, and tubuloglomerular feedback in the kidney (2Hall J.E. Guyton A.C. Tripodo N.C. Lohmeier T.E. McCaa R.E. Cowley Jr., A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 232: F538-F544PubMed Google Scholar, 3Harris R.C. Cheng H.F. Exp.

Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1996; 3: 99-104Crossref Google Scholar). Angiotensin II may also play an important role in the development of some organs (6Hilgers K.F. Norwood V.F. Gomez R.A. Semin. Nephrol. 1997; 17: 492-501PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidating the function of local RAS synthesis has been of substantial interest to many investigators. Unfortunately, these studies have been complicated by the absence of experimental tools to distinguish these tissue-based systems from the classical systemic (blood-borne) or endocrine system. Recent advances in genetic techniques, which allow gene ablation and tissue-specific gene targeting may provide an important new set of tools to experimentally dissect tissue-based regulatory circuits such as the RAS. Tissue-specific inactivation of a gene would be particularly useful if the gene is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, is part of a complex paracrine system, or whose global loss of function results in death or severe organ dysfunction. Gene-targeted disruption of genes known to be important in blood pressure regulation, such as AGT, angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin II receptors, and endothelin, lead to malformations, organ dysfunction, or death, thus impeding studies on blood pressure regulation (7Davisson R.L.

The use of the Cre-loxP recombinase system may afford a solution to this problem by providing a tool to induce knockouts of a gene in a specific tissue and under temporal control (11Kilby N.J. Snaith M.R. Murray J.A.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 9: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12Tsien J.Z. Chen D.F. Gerber D. Tom C. Mercer E.H. Anderson D.J. Mayford M. Kandel E.R. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1996; 87: 1317-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, a gene is targeted (“floxed”) with loxP sites, which are 34-base pair palindromic sequences, which each bind two molecules of Cre recombinase. Cre recombinase can catalyze a homologous recombination event between two loxP sites found in the same orientation on a contiguous DNA molecule, causing a deletion of the intervening DNA sequence. Genes that are appropriately modified to contain loxP sites in introns flanking an important coding exon will be functional in the absence of Cre recombinase, because the loxP site will be spliced out during mRNA processing but will be rendered nonfunctional in the presence of the Cre recombinase (reviewed in Ref. 13Stec D.E. Sigmund C.D. Exp. Nephrol. 1998; 6: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because the floxed gene will be found in every cell, the specificity of the system arises from tissue-specific delivery of Cre recombinase. This can be achieved either by its expression as a transgene under the control of a highly tissue-specific promoter (14Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossman H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) or delivered specifically to a tissue with the use of a viral vector (15Wang Y. Krushel L.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We demonstrate herein efficient liver-specific deletion of a floxed gene after adenoviral delivery of Cre recombinase and report its effects on plasma AGT and blood pressure. The transgene used herein containing the human AGT (hAGT) gene is identical to one previously described in detail except for the presence of loxP sites flanking exon 2 (Fig. 1) (18Yang G.

The hAGT gene was digested with BamHI to remove the entire portion of exon 2 along with flanking sequences to form the plasmid hAGTΔBam. This plasmid was then ligated to loxP oligonucleotides consisting of two loxP sites separated by an internal BglII site withBamHI ends. The resulting plasmid (hAGTΔBamflox) was digested with BglII and religated to the exon 2 BamHI fragment to yield the final hAGTflox construct. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the orientation of the loxP sites, and their function was first tested by restriction digestion of plasmid DNA grown in a bacterial strain (BS591) constitutively expressing Cre recombinase (21Sauer B. Henderson N. Gene. 1988; 70: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The transgene segment was obtained by digestion with NheI and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA fragment was recovered using the Qia-Quick purification kit (Qiagen) and was microinjected into fertilized C57BL/6J × SJL/J (B6SJL F2) mouse embryos as described previously (18Yang G.

Care of the mice used in the experiments met or exceeded the standards set forth by the National Institutes of Health in their Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. All procedures were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa. All mice were fed standard mouse chow (LM-485; Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets, Madison, WI) and water ad libitum. The Cre recombinase expression cassette containing the human CMV promoter and metallothionein polyadenylation signal was subcloned from pBS185 generously provided by Dr. Brian Sauer into the adenovirus shuttle plasmid (22Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This shuttle plasmid and the Ad5 backbone, sub360, were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Adcre was purified using conventional techniques (23Jones N. Shenk T. Cell. 1979; 17: 683-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 24Rowe D.T. Graham F.L. Branton P.E.

Recombinant Adcre were plaque-purified and concentrated using CsCl centrifugation. Adβgal has been previously described in detail elsewhere (26Engelhardt J.F. Yang Y. Stratford-Perricaudet L.D.

Adenoviruses at a concentration of 1.1 × 1012 plaque-forming units/ml (in 0.1 ml) were administered intravenously via tail vein injection or direct cannulation of the right jugular vein. For implantation of the jugular vein catheter, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), and a catheter (PE10) was inserted into the right jugular vein. Following the delivery of adenovirus, the catheter was trimmed, sealed, and enclosed inside the mouse. For mice in which the pressor response to infused human renin was tested, the catheter was tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized between the scapulae as described (28Davisson R.L. Yang G. Beltz T.G. Cassell M.D. Johnson A.K. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). No differences in the overall efficiency or tissue specificity of infection were observed between the two methods of delivery (data not shown). Blood pressure was measured in conscious, freely moving mice surgically instrumented with a left common carotid artery catheter, and infusions of purified recombinant human renin were made via a catheter implanted into the right jugular vein as described (28Davisson R.L. Yang G. Beltz T.G. Cassell M.D. Johnson A.K. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Catheters were tunneled subcutaneously, exteriorized between the scapulae, and were filled and flushed daily with sterile dilute heparinized saline (50 units/ml). Mean arterial blood pressure was measured on a Grass Model 7 polygraph using Cobe transducers. Data was acquired on a Gateway 2000 model E-3000 computer running the Polyview Software provided by Grass Instruments. After a 15-min stabilization period, human renin (500 ng or 1 μg in a 10-μl volume, the gift of Drs. Walter Fischli and Klaus Lindpaintner at F. Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel Switzerland) was infused while blood pressure was continuously recorded. Mice in which infusion of purified human renin did not elicit a pressor response after 15 min were then given an infusion of a known pressor dose of angiotensin II (10 mg/kg). Genomic DNA was purified from tail biopsies and subjected to Southern blot or PCR analysis as described (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine tissue-specific recombination, genomic DNA was isolated from various tissues from adenovirus-infected mice using the proteinase K-phenol extraction protocol (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). For Southern blot analysis, 10 μg of purified genomic DNA was digested withEcoRI and separated on 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with a radioactively labeled probe derived from either intron 3 or exon 2 of the hAGTgene. The probe detects a 12.5-kb wild-type band and a 7-kb Cre-mediated deletion band. Total tissue RNAs were isolated by a modified guanidine isothiocyanate method as described previously (18Yang G.

A mouse β-actin probe was used to determine the integrity of purified RNA and the equal loading of samples (pTRI-actin, Ambion). Mouse and human AGT can be differentiated in the plasma on the basis of the strict species specificity of the biochemical reaction between renin and AGT (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W.

Plasma samples were obtained daily by orbital eye bleed from Adcre and Adβgal mice except for groups in which the pressor response to infused human renin was studied. Mice in those groups were bled at the start of the experiment and then again on day 5 and day 7 post-infection, before the infusion of human renin. Approximately 125 μl of whole blood was collected at each bleed and placed in chilled tubes containing 2.5 μl of 0.5 mol/liter EDTA. The specimens were then immediately centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min at 2 °C, and a 50-μl plasma sample was obtained and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Plasma samples were treated as described previously (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31Ding Y. Davisson R.L. Hardy D.O. Zhu L.-J. Merrill D.C. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol.

Radioimmunoassays were then performed using the RIANEN angiotensin I 125I-labeled radioimmunoassay kit (Dupont) using the directions and reagents supplied by the manufacturer. Samples were appropriately diluted with reagent blank so that the radioimmunoassay results were on the linear portion of the standard curve. Plasma levels of AGT were then extrapolated using the 1:1 molar relationship between Ang-I and its precursor, AGT, using the formula ng of Ang-I/ml × 0.77 pmol/ng Ang-I × 0.05 μg of hAGT/pmol. Liver and kidney samples were removed immediately after mice were killed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution on ice for 2 h. Tissue samples were then rinsed in ice-cold PBS and prepared for cryo-sectioning using standard techniques. Processed tissues were stored at −80 °C in O.C.T. compound until use. Tissue sections (10-μm thick) were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Superblock (Pierce) for 10 min at room temperature and incubated 16–18 h with a polyclonal antibody against hAGT, kindly provided by Dr. Duane Tewkbury, Marshfield Medical Research Foundation (1:5,000 dilution) at 4 °C. Samples were washed in PBS and exposed to CY3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution) for 2 h at 37 °C. Images were obtained using fluorescence confocal microscopy and were captured digitally. Plasma samples (3 μl) were run on a 10% SDS-acrylamide gel, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, and probed with the same polyclonal antibody as above (1:10,000 dilution). Protein bands were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Opti-4CN substrate kit, Bio-Rad) using directions provided by the manufacturer. All numerical data are presented as the mean ±S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's ttest using the SigmaPlot software package or by ANOVA using the Systat software package. To appraise the utility of the Cre-loxP recombinase system to examine the significance of tissue AGT expression and to assess the efficiency of liver-specific deletion of AGT, we designed a transgene (hAGTflox) in which exon 2 of thehAGT gene is flanked by loxP sites (Fig.1). Exon 2 contains the angiotensin precursor peptide sequences and a majority of the protein coding region of the gene, and thus its elimination upon exposure to Cre recombinase will render the gene nonfunctional for the production of hAGT or angiotensin II. However, a normal hAGT mRNA should be transcribed in cells lacking Cre recombinase because the loxP sites were inserted into introns and will be spliced out during mRNA processing. Four lines of hAGTflox mice were initially established that exhibited widely varying levels of plasma hAGT protein, due likely to differences in both transgene copy number and integration site (TableI). We limited further experimentation to lines 4258/1 and 4284/1, which express hAGT at a low (10.5 ± 1.6 μg/ml) and moderate (237 ± 17.5 μg/ml) level, respectively. Lines 4331/1 and 4252/1 were eliminated from further analysis as the level of plasma hAGT was much higher than that found in normal human plasma (32Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins P.N. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.-M. Corvol P. Cell. 1992; 71: 169-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific pattern of expression of the hAGTflox transgene in both lines was similar to the expression of hAGT transgenes lacking loxP sites (Fig.2) (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The highest level of expression was observed in liver and kidney with much lower level expression in a number of extra-renal and extra-hepatic tissues. In addition, as previously reported for hAGT transgenes lacking loxP sites, expression of hAGT in the kidney was higher in males than in females.Table IPlasma hAGT in hAGTloxP miceTransgenic linePlasma human angiotensinogenNng angiotensin I converted/mlμg/ml4258 /1274 ± 4210.5 ± 1.6204284 /16,203 ± 457237 ± 17.5194331 /115,086 ± 1,100577 ± 42.1104252 /1125,2754,7951Plasma hAGT was examined in each of the indicated lines and is represented as both ng of angiotensin I converted/ml in the assay and was also extrapolated to μg of hAGT/ml as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Plasma hAGT was examined in each of the indicated lines and is represented as both ng of angiotensin I converted/ml in the assay and was also extrapolated to μg of hAGT/ml as described under “Materials and Methods.” To assess the overall efficiency of Cre-loxP-mediated deletion of hAGTflox, we first measured circulating hAGT protein before and after intravenous administration of an adenovirus containing either Cre recombinase (Adcre) or β-galactosidase (Adβgal). This is an ideal model system to examine the efficiency of the system as adenoviruses administered intravenously mainly infect the liver, which is the major source of circulating hAGT (33Bosch A. McCray P.B.J. Chang S.M. Ulich T.R. Simonet W.S. Jolly D.J. Davidson B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2683-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in circulating hAGT 5-days after administration of Adcre but no change after administration of the control Adβgal virus (Fig.3 A). We examined the time course of Cre-mediated hAGTflox deletion by obtaining plasma samples before and each day after adenovirus administration and employed a biochemical assay to accurately measure hAGT after its complete conversion by human renin to Ang-I (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of the Adβgal adenovirus had no significant effect on the levels of circulating hAGT in the plasma of either transgenic line (Fig. 3,B and C). However, a decrease in circulating hAGT was evident 1 day after Adcre administration, and levels continued to decline through day 3 in line 4258/1 (Fig. 3 C) and through day 5 in line 4284/1 (Fig. 3 B). There was essentially no circulating hAGT in line 4258/1 after 3 days of Adcre infection, as 2 μg/ml represents the background of the assay under these conditions. Circulating hAGT in line 4284/1 fell by approximately 90% from 180.2 μg/ml to 19.4 μg/ml after 5 days of Adcre. Neither Adcre or Adβgal had any effect in transgenic mice containing a hAGT construct lacking loxP sites (data not shown). Northern blots examined with an exon 2-specific probe (internal to the deletion) revealed a marked decrease in hAGT mRNA in the liver of Adcre-infected mice but not Adβgal-infected mice, consistent with hAGT levels in plasma (Fig. 4). Northern blots using an exon 5-specific probe lying outside of the deleted region revealed the presence of a truncated hAGT mRNA in liver of Adcre mice, and reverse transcription-PCR followed by sequence analysis indicated that this resulted from an accurate splicing of exon 1 to exon 3 (data not shown). The tissue specificity of Cre-mediated recombination was validated by the unaltered level of hAGT mRNA in the kidney of both Adcre- and Adβgal-infected mice. We were also unable to detect any mRNA arising from a Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of hAGTflox gene in the kidney of Adcre-infected mice using reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). We assayed for hAGT protein in liver sections from line 4284/1 by immunofluoresence using a polyclonal antibody specific for hAGT. Only background staining was observed in nontransgenic mice or in sections lacking primary antibody (data not shown). High levels of hAGT were detected uniformly throughout the liver in mice infected with the Adβgal virus (Fig. 5, left panel), but only background staining and occasional small patches of hAGT-positive cells were detected in liver from Adcre-treated mice (Fig. 5, right panel). This data along with the analysis of plasma hAGT and hepatic hAGT mRNA strongly suggests that the overall efficiency of Cre-mediated hAGT gene deletion exceeded 90%. The tissue specificity of intravenously administered Adcre was further validated by Southern blot analysis. Preliminary analysis suggested that the transgene copy number in each line was between 5 and 10. Genomic DNA was isolated from several different organs of a 4258/1 line mouse and an approximately 7.0-kb band representing Cre-mediated recombination was evident in the liver (Fig.6). There was no evidence of recombination in brain, kidney, lung, or spleen, confirming that Adcre administration can specifically target recombination in the liver. The 7.0-kb band was positively identified as the Cre-mediated deletion product, as it was not detected when the Southern blots were reprobed with an exon 2-specific (internal to the deletion) probe (data not shown). Despite the very efficient elimination of hepatic hAGT mRNA and circulating hAGT, the extent of recombination detected by Southern analysis was reproducibly observed to be between 50 and 75% in representative mice from both lines (data not shown). Finally, we examined the physiological significance of the decreased levels of circulating hAGT in hAGTflox mice by measuring the pressor response to an infusion of purified recombinant human renin. Pressor responses were measured in both transgenic lines under control conditions or after infection with either Adcre or Adβgal. There is a strict species specificity in the enzymatic reaction between renin and AGT (30Hatae T. Takimoto E. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, human renin will only cause a pressor response if hAGT is also circulating simultaneously (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dose-response curves were first performed in both the 4284/1 and 4258/1 transgenic lines to obtain a dose of purified human renin that would elicit a significant pressor response. Under control (uninfected) conditions, infusion of 0.5 μg of purified recombinant human renin elicited a 30 mm of Hg increase in blood pressure in 4284/1 mice (Fig.7 A). In 4258/1 mice, 1 μg of purified recombinant human renin was found to be necessary to elicit the same response. Both of these doses of purified human renin had no effect on blood pressure when administered to nontransgenic mice (data not shown). Infusions of purified human renin were then performed in separate groups of transgenic mice 5 days post-infection with Adcre or Adβgal (Fig. 7, B–D). Pressor responses to human renin were unchanged 5 days after Adβgal infection (data not shown). Two response patterns were noted in the Adcre-treated group: 1) those that exhibited a pressor response of normal magnitude but of very short duration (Fig. 7 B) and 2) those that exhibited no pressor response (Fig. 7 C). All mice exhibited a normal pressor response to an infusion of angiotensin II, indicating the mice did not loose the ability to respond to angiotensin II (Fig. 7 D). When analyzed as a group, human renin elicited a pretreatment 31.2 ± 2.7 and 25.6 ± 2.7 mm of Hg pressor response in lines 4284/1 and 4258/1, respectively, which lasted for nearly 60 min before returning to base line (Fig. 8). Five days after Adcre, the pressor response decreased to 20.5 ± 6.0 and 11.5 ± 4.5 mm of Hg and lasted only 20.0 ± 4.0 and 14.4 ± 6.5 min for the two lines, respectively. Because some mice still exhibited a pressor response after 5 days of treatment, the human renin infusion was repeated in some of these mice on day 7. There was essentially no pressor response in either line 7 days after Adcre treatment (Fig. 8).Figure 8Summary of blood pressure data.

This domain is isolated as a low buoyant membrane fraction after the extraction with a nonionic detergent such as Triton X-100. The characteristic low density of this fraction is ascribed to the enrichment of several lipids including cholesterol. To clear the molecular mechanism of raft formation, several extraction methods were applied to solubilize raft components. Cholesterol extraction using methyl-β-cyclodextrin was found to be effective to solubilize NAP-22, a neuron-enriched Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding protein as well as one of the main protein components of brain raft. Purified NAP-22 bound to the liposomes that were made from phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. This binding was dependent on the amount of cholesterol in liposomes. Calmodulin inhibited this binding in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the presence of a calcium-dependent regulatory mechanism works on the assembly of raft within the neuron.

The largest pool and concentration of cholesterol in the body exists in the brain. Being a constituent of cell membrane, including myelin, cholesterol is important for the function of this organ, and an inborn defect in cholesterol metabolism is associated with serious neurological and mental dysfunctions (1Tint G.S.

In accordance with this, most recent studies have favored the view that the majority of brain cholesterol is synthesized locally, although at a low rate (8Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Spady D.K. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1637-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Snopes G.J. Suter U. Subcell. Biochem. 1997; 28: 173-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of cholesterol in the brain has been estimated to be 4–6 months in rats using in vivo and in vitro techniques (10Serougne-Gautheron C. Chevallier F. Biochim. Biophys.

Lateral heterogeneities in the classical fluid-mosaic model of cell membranes are now envisaged as caveolae-like microdomains or “rafts” (also referred to as “Triton-insoluble low density fraction,” “detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-enriched complexes,” or “detergent-resistant membrane domains,” and so on), that are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, specific membrane proteins, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; MCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; SM, sphingomyelin-anchored proteins (12Simons K.

Since many signal transducing molecules (e.g.trimeric G proteins, protein-tyrosine kinases, cytoskeletal proteins, calmodulin-binding proteins) are proven to be enriched in the nonionic detergent-insoluble fraction of low density and whose fraction is considered to correspond to the caveolae or to the raft region, this region is recognized to be important not only for the transport of membrane components but also for the compartmentation of these signal-transducing molecules (12Simons K.

Elucidating the molecular interaction in this region, hence, will facilitate understanding the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction in cells and the intracellular sorting mechanisms of this region. In case of the brain, the expression of caveolin, a caveolae marker protein, is relatively low. The brain-derived Triton-insoluble fraction of low density is therefore considered to correspond to the raft region (17Olive S. Dubois C. Schachner M. Rougon G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2307-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Wu C. Butz S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Since the brain is a very complicated system organized for the effective signal transduction as well as a rich source of cholesterol, characterization of this raft region in neuronal cells will be efficient in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction as well as the role of cholesterol in this process. In addition, it is suggested that rafts participate in the formation of cell polarity in neuronal cells (12Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 572-596Crossref Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that changes in the membrane cholesterol contents have effects not only on the processing of the amyloid precursor protein and amyloid β-peptide but also on the Ca2+ signaling (24Hartmann H.

Elucidating the assembly mechanism of the rafts is, therefore, of primary importance. In previous studies, we have shown the characterization of NAP-22, a novel calmodulin-binding membrane protein expressed predominantly in the brain (29Maekawa S. Maekawa M. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Maekawa S. Matuura Y. Nakamura S. Biochim. Biophys.

NAP-22 (also known as CAP-23 and BAPS1) has physicochemical characteristics that are very similar to those of GAP-43 (neuromodulin, F1, B50, p57, and p46) and myristoylated alanine rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS, p80, and p87) in heat stability, solubilization in 2.5% perchloric acid solution, low hydrophobicity, and anomalous behavior on SDS-PAGE. Namely, the apparent molecular mass of NAP-22 obtained by SDS-PAGE changes depending on the concentration of acrylamide used (58 kDa in 7.5% gel and 45 kDa in 12.5% gel), and this value is much larger than the molecular mass calculated from its amino acid sequence (22 kDa). The myristoylation of NAP-22 was independently confirmed by using a vaculovirus expression system and by the analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry. Also, the membrane localization of NAP-22 was partly ascribed to the myristoylation in its N terminus (30Maekawa S. Matuura Y. Nakamura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Caroni P. Aigner L. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Mosevitsky M.I.

Further biochemical studies showed its strong Ca2+-dependent association with calmodulin (31Maekawa S. Murofushi H. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19462-19465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue fractionation studies showed that NAP-22 accumulates in a Triton-insoluble fraction during brain development and is recovered, after applying a sucrose density centrifugation, in a low density region, called “raft” (18Maekawa S. Kumanogoh H. Funatsu N. Takei N. Inoue K. Endo Y. Hamada K. Sokawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of this fraction showed that NAP-22 is one of the major proteins of brain raft, and further studies showed the localization of other proteins such as GAP-43 (neuromodulin), several GPI-anchored proteins, Src family tyrosine kinases, and trimeric G proteins (18Maekawa S.

Since the enrichment of the latter three protein groups in rafts prepared from various cells is well recognized, neuronal raft is characterized with the enrichment of two calmodulin-binding proteins, NAP-22 and GAP-43 (12Simons K.

To elucidate the assembly mechanism of the raft region, we first tried the biochemical fractionation of the raft. Extraction of whole lipids with chloroform and methanol resulted in the solubilization of GAP-43 and NAP-22, suggesting the localization of these proteins through lipid anchors. Butanol extraction was also effective in eluting out these proteins. Since the detergent insolubility of this fraction is attributed to the enrichment of cholesterol and sphingomyelin (12Simons K.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2307-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), extraction of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin was attempted. This treatment resulted in the selective solubilization of NAP-22. Further in vitro studies showed that NAP-22 binds liposomes in a cholesterol-dependent manner and that this binding is inhibited by calmodulin. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Whole brain was isolated from 2-week-old rats and cooled in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at −80 °C until use. For the preparation of raft, frozen whole brain was thawed, minced with scissors, and homogenized in TME solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 2% Triton X-100. An aliquot of 2.4 msucrose solution was added to this homogenate, and the final sucrose concentration was adjusted to 0.8 m. The sample was then placed on the bottom of the centrifuge tube and overlaid with 0.7m sucrose in TME solution and with TME solution successively. After centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 6 h (Hitachi SW27–2), a clear white band concentrated on the interface of TME solution and 0.7 m sucrose solution was collected and diluted with TME solution containing 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the pellet fraction was suspended in TME solution and was frozen as brain raft fraction. Brain raft fraction (obtained from 60-g brain) was mixed with 1 volume of butanol, shaken vigorously, and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 ×g and 25 °C to separate the butanol phase (upper) and the water phase (lower), the water phase was recovered and dialyzed against TE solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, pH 7.5). After mixing with Triton X-100 (final concentration 1%), the sample was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.6 × 10 cm), that was equilibrated with TE solution. The column was washed with TE solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–500 mm) in TE solution. After SDS-PAGE, fractions containing NAP-22 was recovered and fractionated further under 40% saturation of ammonium sulfate. Precipitated proteins were removed with centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.4 × 6.5 cm). Proteins were eluted with 2 m NaCl solution in TME, followed with 1.5 mNaCl solution in TME. Fractions containing NAP-22 were collected and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The sample was then applied to a hydroxyapatite column (1.4 × 6.5 cm), and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate buffer (20–350 mm, pH 7.0). Eluted NAP-22 was dialyzed against TE solution and stored at −80 °C until use. For lipid analysis, brain raft fraction was further purified by NaCl wash and recentrifugation. Namely, the raft fraction was suspended in TME solution containing 1m NaCl and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was suspended in TME solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.8 m sucrose, and the discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation was repeated. The membrane fraction that floated through the 0.7 m sucrose solution was collected, diluted, and centrifuged. After washing twice with TME solution to remove remaining Triton X-100, the sample was used for the lipid analysis. The isolation procedures for total lipids and for neutral and acidic lipids were described previously (13Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 34Ariga T. Macala L.J. Saito M. Margolis R.K. Greene L.A. Margolis R.U. Yu R.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, total lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1 and 1:1, v/v) and chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8, v/v/v). The combined supernatants were applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (CH3COO− form, 1-ml bed volume, equilibrated with 1 column volume of chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8, v/v/v)). The neutral lipid fraction was eluted with 1 column volume of chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8) and 2 column volumes of methanol. Acidic lipid fraction was eluted with 2 column volumes of 0.3m ammonium acetate in methanol. The acidic fraction was desalted by a Sephadex G-50 column (0.5 × 51 cm, water). Neutral and acidic lipid fractions were analyzed by HPTLC as described previously (35Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, HPTLC was prewashed with chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, v/v/v). Samples were loaded on the silica gel HPTLC plate, developed in solvent A (chloroform/methanol/CH3COOH/HCOOH/water, 35:15:6:2:1, v/v/v/v/v) until the solvent front ascended to about 4.5 cm from the bottom for neutral lipid analysis or about 6 cm for acidic lipid analysis. Following this development, excess solvent on the plates was evaporated in a fume hood for 15 min and then in a vacuum desiccator for 15 min. The plates were then developed in solvent B (hexane/diisopropylether/acetic acid, 65:35:2, v/v/v) until the solvent front ascended to the top. Excess solvent was evaporated as described above. The plates were then dipped into a 3% cupric acetate (w/v), 8% phosphoric acid (v/v) solution and heated at 180 °C for 15 min. Each of the bands was quantitated by an ATTO Densitograph lane and spot analyzer (ATTO, Japan, version 5.0) as referenced to authentic lipid samples. For glycolipid analysis, acidic lipid fractions and authentic gangliosides were loaded on HPTLC, developed in solvent C (chloroform/methanol/0.25% CaCl2, 55:45:10, v/v/v), and visualized with the resorcinol reagent (36Svennerhorn L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Each band was purified by a preparative TLC and was analyzed by GLC (Shimadzu GC-14A, Japan) as described previously (37Song Y. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21929-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MCD was employed to remove cholesterol from membrane fractions (38Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). After dilution with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, brain raft was collected through centrifugation and suspended in a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, which contained various amounts of MCD. After incubation at 37 °C or on ice, fractions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants and pellets were separated and processed for SDS-PAGE and a cholesterol assay. In this study, cholesterol was assayed spectrophotometrically using a diagnostic kit (Cholesterol C-Test Wako catalog no. 274-46401) (40Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholtz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Based on the lipid contents in the brain raft fraction described below, phosphatidylcholine (PC)-based liposomes were used. Lipids solubilized in chloroform/methanol were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. Liposomes were obtained through sonication in ME solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) in the presence of various amounts of the proteins. In some cases, sonication was done in MC solution (ME solution containing 0.4 mm CaCl2). After incubation at 37 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants and pellets were separated and analyzed with SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, the pellet fraction was suspended in ME solution, loaded on a discontinuous Ficoll gradient (2, 6, and 10% Ficoll in ME solution, top to bottom), and recentrifuged at 170,000 × g for 5 h at 35 °C. After centrifugation, concentrated materials at the interfaces were collected for analysis with SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. DEAE- and phenyl-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hydroxyapatite (ceramic hydroxyapatite type I) was purchased from Bio-Rad. For liposome construction, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine (bovine brain), and phosphatidylinositol (porcine liver) obtained from Sigma; phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, chicken egg) obtained from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratory; and sphingolipid (egg) obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. were used. For lipid analysis, triacylglycerol, cholesterol (egg), cholesterol assay kit (Cholesterol Test C, Wako), glucoceramide, and galactosylceramide were purchased from Wako (Japan). Gangliosides were gifts from Dr. Masao Iwamori (Kinki University, Japan). Silica gel HPTLC plates were purchased from Baker. Protein determination, calmodulin preparation, and SDS-PAGE were performed as described previously (29Maekawa S. Maekawa M. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric scan of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels was done to measure the amount of NAP-22 using a scanner and the NIH Image program. Known amounts of NAP-22 were elelctrophoresed in the same gel for the standard to quantify the protein. Since many of the lipid-anchored proteins are known to be hydrophilic proteins, removal of lipids from raft is anticipated to solubilize these proteins if these proteins are anchored in raft simply through the lipid insertion into the lipid bilayer. Extraction of lipids with various alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, and pentanol, was tried, and butanol extraction was found to be effective to solubilize several proteins including NAP-22. Butanol extraction separates the components of raft into three parts: the butanol phase, the water phase, and the precipitate. Protein components in these fractions analyzed with SDS-PAGE are shown in Fig.1. Over 90% of the proteins were recovered in the precipitate fraction. NAP-22, GAP-43, and Thy-1 were identified as major proteins recovered in the water phase from their mobilities in SDS-PAGE and reactivities with specific antibodies. Since over 80% of NAP-22 in the raft was solubilized with butanol, this extraction method was used to purify the protein. NAP-22 was separated from other proteins through several column procedures and used in this experiment. Its purity is shown in Fig. 1 (lane 4) and also confirmed with Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody (data not shown). TableI shows the lipid composition of raft and the partition of lipids after butanol treatment. The lipid content of brain raft is characterized by the enrichment of PC and cholesterol. A lesser amount of SM existed in this fraction compared with other cell-derived rafts (13Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 41Mescher M.F. Apgar J.R. Adv. Exp. Med. 1986; 184: 387-400Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After butanol extraction, about 90% of lipids were recovered in the butanol phase. Some amount of gangliosides and a small amount of other lipids were recovered in the water phase, and no lipid was detected in the precipitate fraction. Solubilization of NAP-22 and other proteins in the water phase suggested that these proteins localize to raft through lipid binding rather than through protein binding.Table ILipid composition of raft and butanol-treated fractionsLipidFractionRaft1-aμg of lipid/mg of protein in raft.Butanol extracts1-bμg of lipid after fractionation of raft (1 mg of protein).

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since low buoyant density of rafts from several cells and tissues is ascribed to the enrichment of SM and cholesterol, cholesterol extraction from raft was attempted using β-cyclodextrin. β-Cyclodextrin and its methylated form (MCD) are recognized to be effective at removing cholesterol from cells and isolated membranes (38Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The addition of MCD to the raft fraction resulted in a dose-dependent, specific solubilization of a protein (Fig.2 A). The mobility of this protein coincided with that of NAP-22 under different acrylamide concentrations and exhibited the same retardation behavior in gels of decreasing acrylamide concentration. Also, a monoclonal antibody against NAP-22 reacted with this protein (Fig. 2 B). For these reasons, this protein was identified as NAP-22. Interestingly, the extent of NAP-22 solubilization was correlated fairly well with the extraction of cholesterol (Fig. 2 C). Consequently, it is calculated that extraction of about 460 cholesterol molecules resulted in the solubilization of one NAP-22 molecule. Analysis of the lipid contents of the MCD-solubilized fraction showed that except for some solubilization of PE, little or no solubilization of other lipids by MCD occurred, consistent with the results reported by others (data not shown; Refs. 38Kilsdonk E.P.C.

https://openalex.org/W2065458745,"Swi5 and Ace2 are cell cycle-regulated transcription factors that activate expression of early G1-specific genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Swi5 and Ace2 have zinc finger DNA-binding domains that are highly conserved, and the two proteins bind to the same DNA sequences in vitro. Despite this similarity in DNA binding, Swi5 and Ace2 activate different genes in vivo, with Swi5 activating the HO gene and Ace2 activating CTS1expression. In this report we have used chimeric fusions between Swi5 and Ace2 to determine what regions of these proteins are necessary for promoter-specific activation of HO and CTS1. We have identified specific regions of Swi5 and Ace2 that are required for activation of HO and CTS1, respectively. The Swi5 protein bindsHO promoter DNA cooperatively with the Pho2 homeodomain protein, and the HO specificity region of Swi5 identified in the chimeric analysis coincides with the region of Swi5 previously identified that interacts with Pho2 in vitro. Swi5 and Ace2 also activate expression of a number of other genes expressed in G1 phase of the cell cycle, including ASH1,CDC6, EGT2, PCL2, PCL9,RME1, and SIC1. Analysis of the Swi5/Ace2 chimeras shows that distinct regions of Swi5 and Ace2 contribute to the transcriptional activation of some of these other G1-regulated genes.

Analysis of the Swi5/Ace2 chimeras shows that distinct regions of Swi5 and Ace2 contribute to the transcriptional activation of some of these other G1-regulated genes. How do transcription factors of the same DNA-binding class activate specific target genes? This problem, called promoter-specific activation, can be explained by several simple mechanisms involving differential DNA binding, subcellular localization of related transcription factors, or the timing of expression of those factors. The zinc finger DNA-binding transcription factors Swi5 and Ace2 bind to the same sequences in vitro with approximately the same affinity, yet in vivo they activate distinct genes (1Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Swi5 activates transcription of the HO gene, encoding the site-specific endonuclease required for mating type switching (3Stillman D.J. Bankier A.T. Seddon A. Groenhout E.G. Nasmyth K.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ace2 activates CTS1, which encodes chitinase, required to degrade the cell wall between mother and daughter cells to complete cytokinesis (2Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Both CTS1 and HO are expressed in late G1 of the cell cycle, while SWI5 andACE2 genes are transcribed in late G2 (2Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J.

When these factors are translated during G2, both proteins are retained in the cytoplasm. At the end of mitosis, the transcription factors enter the nucleus and are subsequently degraded after activating their gene targets (2Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R.

Cell. 1990; 62: 631-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although the timing of entry into the nucleus for both proteins has not been determined simultaneously, it is clear that the times of nuclear entry are very close. In addition, the nuclear localization sequence for Swi5 has been mapped, and this region is conserved between Swi5 and Ace2, making it unlikely that there are large differences in their nuclear localization patterns (2Dohrmann P.R.

Cell. 1990; 62: 631-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Swi5 and Ace2 proteins show similarity at the amino acid level, as shown in Fig. 1. The two proteins are almost identical in the zinc finger DNA-binding domain region, with 83% identity, rising to 94% with conservative amino acid substitutions. The amino acids predicted to make nucleotide-specific contacts with DNA, based on the Zif268 zinc finger protein/DNA co-crystal (6Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar), are highly conserved between Ace2 and Swi5, leading to the prediction that these two proteins would recognize the same DNA sequences (2Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In vitro DNA-binding experiments with both truncated proteins expressed in Escherichia coli and full-length proteins produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysates demonstrated that Swi5 and Ace2 do in fact bind to HO and CTS1 promoter sequences with similar affinity (1Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7.Dohrmann, P. R., Transcriptional Regulation by ACE2 and SWI5.Ph.D. thesis, 1994, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal regions of Swi5 and Ace2 (520 and 570 amino acids, respectively, are poorly conserved, with 18% identity through this region. There are, however, three small blocks of similarity, ranging from 20 to 27 amino acids each, in this large N-terminal region (Fig. 1). In addition to HO and CTS1, Swi5 and Ace2 also activate transcription of the ASH1, CDC6,EGT2, RME1, SIC1, PCL2, andPCL9 genes (8Bobola N. Jansen R.P. Shin T.H. Nasmyth K.

These genes encode a diverse set of proteins (Table I), but a common feature is that all of these genes are expressed in early G1 phase of the cell cycle. The Swi5 and Ace2 proteins are present in the nucleus for a limited time in early G1 and are thus G1-specific transcription factors. The role of Swi5 and Ace2 in the activation of these G1 genes is complex. For some of these target genes, either Swi5 or Ace2 is competent for activation, while for other genes Swi5 is the primary activator with only a minor role for Ace2. We describe these genes as being “jointly” regulated by Swi5 and Ace2, to distinguish their regulation from that of HO and CTS1, where only one of the zinc finger proteins is an effective transcriptional activator. Therefore, promoter-specific activation by Swi5 and Ace2 cannot be explained by a simple mechanism, inasmuch as, at some target genes, Swi5 and Ace2 appear equivalent for transcriptional activation.Table IGenes jointly regulated by Swi5 and Ace2GeneFunctionASH1Daughter specific repressor of HO expressionCDC6Initiator of DNA replicationEGT2Required for cell separationPCL2Partner for Pho85 cyclin-dependent kinasePCL9Partner for Pho85 cyclin-dependent kinaseRME1Repressor of meiosis; activator of CLN2 transcriptionSIC1Inhibitor of Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase Open table in a new tab We expect that specific domains within the Swi5 and Ace2 proteins are involved in promoter-specific activation of HO andCTS1. Both positive and negative factors determine the ability of Swi5 and Ace2 to activate HO and CTS1(1Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and presumably these transcription factors interact with Swi5 and Ace2. For example, Swi5 binds to the HO promoter cooperatively with another factor, the Pho2 homeodomain protein (17Brazas R.M. Stillman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11237-11241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ace2 does not interact with Pho2 (1Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and thus the interaction of Swi5 with Pho2 may contribute to the specific activation of HO. Similarly, we have identified negative regulators that prevent Swi5 from activating CTS1 expression (1Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the identification of regions for both the Swi5 and Ace2 proteins that are responsible for promoter-specific activation ofHO and CTS1, respectively. In addition, we show that particular regions of Swi5 and Ace2 contribute to the activation of some of the jointly regulated genes. These results are a first step toward understanding the mechanism of promoter-specific activation by the Swi5 and Ace2 transcription factors. Plasmids used in this study are listed in TableII.

Quantitative analysis was performed using ImageQuant software and a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Radioactivity in each lane was measured, the background level was subtracted, and the value was normalized by dividing by the value for the CMD1 internal control. Quantitative determinations of β-galactosidase activity were performed as described previously (22Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Each value is the average of four independent transformants. Western blots were performed with 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and ECL Western kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to identify what regions of Swi5 and Ace2 contribute to promoter-specific activation of HO andCTS1, we generated chimeric fusions between Swi5 and Ace2. In a previous report we described Swi5/Ace2 chimeras that were created by exchanging restriction fragments (2Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In particular, the Swi5-(1–538)/Ace2-(591–770) chimera was unable to activate eitherHO or CTS1 (2Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Due to the insertion of an oligonucleotide linker with a restriction site, this particular chimera has a two-amino acid insertion in a region highly conserved between Swi5 and Ace2. An NMR structural analysis of the DNA-binding domain of Swi5 has recently shown that these two extra nucleotides are part of an α-helical region that contributes to the stability of the first zinc finger of Swi5 (23Dutnall R.N. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Structure. 1996; 4: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the failure of this Swi5-(1–538)/Ace2-(591–770) chimera to activate either HOor CTS1 can be attributed to perturbation of the protein structure. We therefore made more precise fusions using recombinant PCR. We were concerned that the fusion junction between two proteins would affect protein secondary structure, and decided to use the regions of homology shown in Fig. 1 as locations for fusions. This method of generating the chimeras proved much more successful in that all the fusions were active at least one of the transcriptional reporters tested. In addition, the chimeras activated transcription to the degree of either wild type Swi5 or Ace2, indicating that not only are the proteins expressed, but perhaps more importantly, that they are functional. Chimeric constructs were cloned into YCp vectors. The chimeras were expressed from either the SWI5 or ACE2 promoters, depending on what protein fragment is N-terminal. Using the regions of similarity as a guide, Swi5 and Ace2 were broken into six parts, designated A, B, C, D, E, and F. Region E contains the DNA-binding domain, and region F contains the nuclear localization and cytoplasmic retention sequences. This nomenclature will be used throughout this paper to indicate what protein domains a chimeric fusion contains. For example, ABCDSwi5EFAce2 contains regions A, B, C, and D from Swi5 and regions E and F from Ace2. The chimeric fusions between Swi5 and Ace2 were analyzed for their ability to activate HO-lacZ orCTS1-lacZ reporter. YCp plasmids with the chimeric fusions were transformed into yeast strains that lacked endogenous Ace2 and Swi5, and that contained an integratedHO-lacZ or a CTS1-lacZreporter. Promoter activity was quantitated by measuring β-galactosidase levels, and are shown as a percentage of either the level of activation that Swi5 gives at HO-lacZ or that Ace2 gives at CTS1-lacZ (Fig.2). The first set of chimeras show that the DNA-binding domain does not determine promoter specificity at HO and CTS1. Chimeras ABCDAce2EFSwi5 and ABCDSwi5EFAce2 (Fig. 2, lines 3 and 4) were constructed with regions E and F, containing the DNA-binding domain of one transcriptional activator, fused to regions A–D of the other. The results show clearly that the N-terminal part of the proteins, regions A–D, confer promoter-specific activation. Swi5 and Ace2 proteins bind in vitro toHO or CTS1 promoter fragments with similar affinities (1Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and thus it was not unexpected that the DNA-binding domains of Swi5 and Ace2 are not the critical determinants of promoter-specific activation. Region F, which controls the regulated nuclear entry of Swi5, is highly conserved between Swi5 and Ace2. Since Swi5 and Ace2 enter the nucleus at similar times (2Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), this region was not expected to be critical for promoter specificity. What regions within A–D are important for promoter-specific activation? To address this question, additional chimeric fusion proteins were generated. Chimera ABCAce2DEFSwi5(Fig. 2, line 5) is able to activateHO-lacZ, while ABCDAce2EFSwi5 (Fig. 2, line 4) cannot. These results suggest that region D of Swi5 (amino acids 394–521) is necessary for activation of theHO-lacZ reporter, and we designate this region theHO specificity region. This region of Swi5 has been also shown to be necessary for interaction of Swi5 with the Pho2 homeodomain protein (25Brazas R.M. Bhoite L.T. Murphy M.D. Yu Y. Chen Y. Neklason D.W. Stillman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29151-29161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Bhoite L.T. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6436-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The next set of chimeras suggest that region C of Ace2 is required for specific activation of CTS1. Chimera ABCAce2DEFSwi5 (Fig. 2, line 5) can activate CTS1-lacZ, while ABAce2CDEFSwi5 (Fig. 2, line 7) cannot, and the difference between these two constructs is the presence of region C of Ace2. An additional chimera was constructed to test whether region C of Ace2 is sufficient forCTS1 activation in the context of the Swi5 protein. The ABSwi5CAce2DEFSwi5 chimera can activate HO-lacZ, due to the presence of region D from Swi5, and it can also activate CTS1-lacZ (Fig.3). We have designated region C of Ace2 (amino acids 303–469) as the CTS1 specificity region. A fusion protein consisting of the lexA DNA-binding domain fused to region C of Ace2 is a strong activator of a transcriptional reporter containing lexA binding sites in the CYC1 promoter (data not shown). This result demonstrates that region C contains a transcriptional activation domain capable of activating transcription from the CYC1 TATA element. The ABCSwi5DEFAce2 chimera is not able to activate either HO-lacZ or CTS1-lacZ(Fig. 2, line 6), raising the concern that this protein is not functional or stable in vivo. We used two other reporter constructs that can be activated by either Swi5 or Ace2 to determine whether ABCSwi5DEFAce2 is functional. The CTS1 (46)-lacZ reporter, which contains the Ace2 binding sites but lacks the negative regulatory site that blocks activation by Swi5, is inactive in a swi5 ace2double mutant (1Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but can be activated by either Swi5 or Ace2 (Fig.4). The HIS4-lacZreporter responds similarly to either Swi5 or Ace2 (Fig. 4; Ref. 7.Dohrmann, P. R., Transcriptional Regulation by ACE2 and SWI5.Ph.D. thesis, 1994, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.Google Scholar). The ABCSwi5DEFAce2 chimera is able to activate both CTS1 (46)-lacZ andHIS4-lacZ equivalently to full-length Swi5, indicating that this chimeric fusion is functional in vivo. To directly determine levels of the chimeric proteins in vivo, we generated strains with a Myc epitope fused in frame at the C terminus of Ace2, Swi5, and each of the chimeras. Western analysis shows that the fusion proteins are expressed at similar levels as the wild type Ace2 and Swi5 proteins (Fig.5). Although the ABCSwi5DEFAce2 chimera (lane 7) is expressed at slightly lower levels than other chimeras, it is expressed at a level similar to that of native Swi5 (lane 2). We conclude that the reason the ABCSwi5DEFAce2 chimera is unable to activateHO-lacZ and CTS1-lacZ is because it lacks a promoter specificity domain from either Swi5 or Ace2.Figure 5Chimeras are expressed at wild type levels. Western blotting was used to determine protein levels of strains with Swi5, Ace2, or various chimeras containing a C-terminal Myc epitope tag. Electrophoretic mobilities of the different proteins are consistent with their predicted molecular masses. The cross-reacting material (C.R.M.) serves as a loading control. Lane 1, DY150 with no epitope tag;lanes 2–10, epitope tags were added to wild type Swi5 in strain DY1142, wild type Ace2 in strain DY150, and various chimeras in strains DY4497 through DY4503.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We used an S1 nuclease protection assay of mRNA levels to measure the ability of the various chimeras to activate transcription of the native HO and CTS1 genes in strains generated by integrating the various chimeric fusions at the URA3 locus of a swi5 ace2 double mutant strain. The rationale for this experiment is twofold. First, we have observed differences in regulatory properties of the integrated HO-lacZreporter compared with the native HO locus (18McBride H.J. Brazas R.M. Yu Y. Nasmyth K. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27.Yu, Y., Dorland, S., Bhoite, L. T., and Stillman, D. J. (1998) Submitted for publication.Google Scholar). Second, we have also noted subtle differences in regulation of the jointly regulated genes (i.e. SIC1) when YCp plasmids with SWI5 and ACE2 were used compared with integrated genes (data not shown). We attribute this difference to the slightly higher copy number of YCp plasmids compared with single copy integrants. The pattern of activation by the different chimeras at the endogenous HO and CTS1 genes was similar to that seen for the lacZ reporters (Fig.6). There are a number of genes expressed in early G1 whose expression has been reported to be activated by Swi5 or Ace2 (Table I). RNA was isolated from four isogenic strains differing at the SWI5and ACE2 loci and used for S1 nuclease protection analysis using probes specific for each of these seven genes. The experiment was performed three times, and the average values are presented in TableIV. All of these genes show a significant reduction in expression in the swi5 ace2 double mutant. However, none of them show a reduction as strong as that seen forHO and CTS1 in either the swi5 orace2 single mutants. For convenience, we have designated these as jointly regulated genes. These genes show varying dependence on Swi5 and Ace2 for transcriptional activation. For example, either Swi5 or Ace2 can activate ASH1, EGT2,RME1, or PCL2 as expression is only modestly reduced in the swi5 and ace2 single mutants, but is significantly reduced in the swi5 ace2 double mutant. Reduction in mRNA levels in the swi5 ace2 double mutant is more substantial for EGT2 and RME1 than forASH1 or PCL2. In contrast, Swi5 is the major activator of SIC1 and PCL9 expression, but we note that expres"

The recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit to the 5′-end of an mRNA molecule is often the rate-limiting step in the eucaryotic translation initiation pathway (reviewed in Ref. 1Mathews M.B.

The 5′-ends of eucaryotic mRNAs are distinguishable from other RNAs in the cell due to the presence of the m7GpppX (whereX is any nucleotide) cap structure (2Shatkin A.J.

Phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs under growth-promoting conditions leads to their release from eIF4E, the subsequent association of eIF4G with eIF4E, and increases in cap-dependent translation. Conversely, in mammalian cells, dephosphorylation of eIF4E under conditions of cellular stress, such as heat shock or viral infection, leads to a decrease in its binding to eIF4G and capped mRNAs (6Feigenblum D. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5450-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Regulation of the phosphorylation state of eIF4E is currently thought to occur via the control of the eIF4G-associated kinase Mnk1p (7Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.-C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a single eIF4E gene, CDC33 (8Brenner C. Nakayama N. Goebl M. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3556-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and two eIF4G genes, TIF4631 andTIF4632 (9Goyer C. Altmann M. Lee H.S. Blanc A. Deshmukh M. Woolford J.L. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), encoding the eIF4G1 and eIF4G2 proteins, respectively. Yeast eIF4E associates with these eIF4Gs and is responsible for mediating cap-dependent translation (10Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 11Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4467-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Goyer C. Altmann M. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7603-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae also contains at least one 4E-BP, encoded by the CAF20 gene, which functions as a negative regulator of the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction (13Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Cruz J. Iost I. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although both eIF4E and Caf20p are phosphoproteins, the physiological relevance of their modifications remains unknown (15Zanchin N.I.T. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26505-26510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Pioneering studies on the regions of eIF4G and the 4E-BPs that interact with eIF4E identified a consensus binding sequence, YXXXXLΦ (where X is any amino acid and Φ is an aliphatic residue), common to eIF4G and the 4E-BPs (16Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conserved sequence (which will be referred to here as the eIF4E binding peptide) is necessary for eIF4E binding (for instance, see Refs. 18Lang V. Zanchin N. Lunsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and17Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6876-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of a ternary complex between the cap, eIF4E, and a 17-residue peptide containing the eIF4E binding peptide of 4E-BP1 revealed that the eIF4E binding peptide associates directly with a conserved surface of eIF4E. 2J. Marcotrigiano, A.-C. Gingras, N. Sonenberg, and S. K. Burley, submitted for publication. Based on the findings that mutations in eIF4E have differential effects on the binding of eIF4G and Caf20p, it has been suggested that the interactions of eIF4G and the 4E-BPs with eIF4E are not limited to the eIF4E binding peptide (19Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhager R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The association of eIF4G with eIF4E has been shown to significantly enhance the affinity of eIF4E for the cap structure (20Haghighat A. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21677-21680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As the level of functional eIF4E (i.e. not bound to 4E-BP) is considered to be one of the limiting factors during the translation initiation process, this discovery suggested that the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction serves not only to bridge the ribosomal subunit to the mRNA but also to increase the effective concentration of eIF4E within the cell. The eIF4G protein is also associated with other translation initiation factors, including the poly(A) tail-binding protein Pab1p (10Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), the RNA-stimulated ATPase eIF4A (21Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 22Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and at least in mammalian cells, eIF3 (for instance, see Ref. 21Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The effects of these proteins, when bound to eIF4G, on the affinity of eIF4E for the cap structure remains unknown. In order to define the structural basis for the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the S. cerevisiae eIF4G-eIF4E complex. This information will help us to understand how the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G occurs and is regulated, how this interaction leads to alterations in eIF4E affinity for the cap structure, and how other eIF4G-binding proteins could affect the eIF4G-eIF4E interaction. Here, we report that the association of eIF4E with eIF4G1 results in the formation of a protease-resistant, 98-residue fragment of eIF4G1. This fragment was shown by NMR analysis to be unfolded in the absence of eIF4E and nearly completely folded in the presence of eIF4E. Characterization of charge-to-alanine mutations within the essential 55.4-kDa region of eIF4G1 identified two mutations within this 98-amino acid fragment that resided outside of the consensus eIF4E binding peptide and that decreased eIF4G binding to eIF4E in vivo and in vitro. These data support the hypothesis that in addition to the previously defined eIF4E binding peptide, flanking regions of eIF4G1 are necessary for binding to eIF4E with high affinity. Moreover, eIF4E binding results in folding of a substantial domain of eIF4G. These results suggest a model in which eIF4E binding creates a new binding surface on eIF4G1 that may allow for the binding of other components of the translational machinery. Genes encoding the GST-eIF4G1 fusion proteins were created as follows. The eIF4G1 fragment eIF4G1381–506 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction amplification from yeast genomic DNA with the 5′ primer CGGGATCCGAAGTTGAGGCTGAAGC and the 3′ primer CGGAATTCTCAACGACTAGAATTATTGCCG. The amplified DNA fragment was cut with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into a similarly digested pGEX2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). eIF4G1393–490 was made using the above construct as a template for polymerase chain reaction amplification with the 5′ primer CGGGATCCATTGGACTTGAAGCTGAAATCG and the 3′ primer CGGAATTCTCATCTGCCCATTCCTGGTGG. The polymerase chain reaction amplified fragment was digested with BamHI andEcoRI and ligated into BamHI/EcoRI double digested pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Strain BAS3428, which is bacterial strain BL21 containing the GST-eIF4G1381–506, was induced atA 600 = 0.6–0.7 with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm PMSF, 1.0 μm leupeptin, 1.0 μm pepstatin, and 200 μg/ml lysozyme and lysed by sonication in a dry ice/ethanol bath. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet, which contained the majority of the induced fusion protein, was used for an inclusion body preparation. The pellet was resuspended in 80 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid, briefly sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was solubilized in 100 ml of 6 mguanidine hydrochloride, 200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and then dialyzed versus 6 liters of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following clarification by centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 10 ml Glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in PBS. The column was washed in 5 column volumes of PBS and incubated at room temperature with 10 ml of PBS containing 10 NIH units/ml thrombin (Sigma) for 2 h. The eluted eIF4G1381–506 was concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon 3 device (Amicon). Recombinant yeast eIF4E (23Vasilescu S. Ptushkina M. Linz B. Muller P.P. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7030-7037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was purified as described previously (24Edery I. Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Gene. 1988; 74: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) from strain BAS2024. Briefly, cells from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm PMSF, 1.0 μm leupeptin, 1.0 μm pepstatin, and 200 μg/ml lysozyme, lysed by sonication in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholic acid, briefly sonicated, and centrifuged. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 30 ml of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 200 mmTris, pH 8.0, and dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA (Buffer A). This was loaded onto a 15-ml m7GDP column equilibrated in Buffer A, washed in 5 column volumes of Buffer A, washed in 2 column volumes of Buffer A + 0.1 mm GDP, and then eluted with Buffer A + 0.1 mm m7GDP. Pooled fractions (typically 15 ml) were concentrated using a collodian concentrator (Schleicher and Shuell). Digests were performed using purified recombinant yeast eIF4E and eIF4G1381–506. 0.5 mg/ml total substrate protein (equimolar eIF4E and eIF4G1381–506 or eIF4G1381–506 alone) were incubated in 10 μl with 1:50, 1:500, or 1:5000 w/w trypsin (Sigma) in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.8, for 1.5 h at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and immediately boiled for 5 min. Reactions were visualized on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To identify the boundaries of the eIF4G1 subfragment present in the eIF4E/eIF4G1381–506 complex digestion (1:500 w/w trypsin), both microsequencing and mass spectrometry were used. For N-terminal microsequencing, the sample was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a 0.45 μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and microsequenced using an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer. The exact mass and purity of the eIF4G1 fragment were assessed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The digest was separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac semipreparative C18 column using linear gradients of acetonitrile in water, both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mass of the eIF4G393–490 measured was within 0.5 atomic mass units of expected values. BL21 cells containing the GST-eIF4G1393–490 fusion protein (BAS3430) were grown in M9 minimal medium with ampicillin at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.5, and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. For isotope labeling, the M9 medium was supplemented with15N labeled ammonia (1 g/L). The cell pellet from 1 liter of medium was resuspended in 25 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 μm pepstatin, 1.0 μm leupeptin, and 1.0 mm PMSF. Cells were lysed with a French press (three times) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a SS-34 rotor for 30 min. Pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of detergent buffer containing 100 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% deoxycholic acid. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min in a SS-34 rotor, pellets were solubilized in 5 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl, 200 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The solubilized protein was then diluted at 1 ml/min into 400 ml of refolding buffer consisting of 0.8m arginine HCl, 200 mm Tris base, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 with slow stirring at 4 °C. The fusion protein from 1 liter of starting medium (∼ 35 mg) was purified on a 6-ml glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column as described above and cleaved with 7 NIH units/mg of fusion protein of hThrombin (Sigma) in 8 ml of PBS, pH 7.4. Eluted eIF4G1393–490 in PBS with 0.5 m NaCl was loaded onto two columns in series containing 4 ml of benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in PBS and 0.5 m NaCl. The eIF4G1393–490 eluate was then dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl. For the eIF4E used in the NMR experiments, the entire eIF4E open reading frame from the yeast CDC33 gene was subcloned into the pGEM.2 vector (Promega), and this construct was transformed into the BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain (Novagen) to yield BAS3431. This strain was grown in M9 minimal medium with ampicillin at 37 °C and induced at 25 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. The expression level was typically 10 mg/liter. For preparation of the eIF4G1-eIF4E complex, the cells were lysed with a French press and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a SS-34 rotor for 30 min. The supernatant containing eIF4E (∼10 mg) was loaded onto a 4-ml m7GDP-agarose affinity column in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The column was then washed with 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 3 ml/min for 40 min, followed by the addition of 20 ml of 0.1 mm GDP in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES. eIF4G1393–490 (∼ 5 mg) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) was then added at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The complex was eluted with 0.2 mmm7GDP in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES. The eluate was then dialyzed into PBS, pH 7.4, and further purified by gel filtration over a 120 ml (diameter = 1.6 cm) HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 1H-15N-HSQC spectra for free 15N-labeled eIF4G393–490 and for the complex of 15N-labeled eIF4G393–490and unlabeled eIF4E were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer at 26 °C, pH 7.5. The sample concentrations were 0.2 mm in PBS. Polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was used to introduce the alanine codons into the recombinant eIF4G1 gene (10Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) by the method of Barettino et al. (25Barettino D. Feigenbutz M. Valcarcel R. Stunnenberg H.G. Nuc. Acids Res. 1993; 22: 541-542Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A single mutagenic oligonucleotide and two other oligonucleotides that flanked the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the eIF4G1 gene were used. The correct DNA sequence within 50 nucleotides of either side of the site of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant eIF4G1 genes (TableI) were introduced into the indicated yeast strains (Table II) by lithium acetate transformation and subsequent plating on YM-Trp medium (26Guthrie C. Fink G. Abelson J. Simon M.I. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology: Methods in Enzymology. 194. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 14-15Google Scholar). Transformants that had lost their wild type version of eIF4G1 (YAS2095) or eIF4G2 (YAS2229 and YAS2282) were selected for on YM-Trp medium containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (27Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Abelson J. Simon M.I. 5-Fluoroorotic Acid as a Selective Agent in Yeast Molecular Genetics: Methods in Enzymology. 154.

Open table in a new tab Translation extracts from yeast expressing the HA epitope-tagged eIF4G1 were prepared as described previously (28Tarun S. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). For all experiments, extracts were adjusted to 2 mm EGTA and were not treated with micrococcal nuclease. Translation assays were performed as described previously (28Tarun S. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 200 ng of LUC mRNA was utilized, and the incubation of the 15 μl reaction mixture was carried out at 24 °C for 30 min. Production of luciferase was occurring linearly at this time. For experiments shown in Fig. 4, B and C,the extracts were incubated with cap analog (New England Biolabs) and recombinant eIF4E (17Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6876-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), respectively, for 15 min at 4 °C prior to mRNA addition. The data shown are representative of results from at least four experiments. For the experiments described in Fig. 5 A, the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was coupled to protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (10Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). 50 μl of a 50% suspension of this was incubated with 50 μl of yeast translation extract containing the HA epitope-tagged eIF4G1 protein and 200 μl of PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound eIF4G1 and its associated proteins were eluted from the resin with 25 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The eIF4G1 and eIF4E proteins were detected by Western analysis as described previously (17Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6876-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For studies involving GST-4G1 proteins, each TIF4631 gene was inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pGEX2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and expressed in bacterial strain BL21 (see Table I). At A 600 = 0.5, cultures were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, harvested after 3 h, washed once in Buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3) and quick-frozen in liquid N2 in 1/100 the volume of the original culture. 0.5-ml aliquots were thawed, adjusted to 4 mm dithiothreitol and 2 mm PMSF, treated with 400 μg/ml lysozyme, and lysed gently by brief sonication. Clarified lysates were incubated with 40 μl of 50% suspension of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in Buffer C + 0.1% Triton X-100 (Buffer CT). The resin containing the bound eIF4G1 protein was then washed three times in 1 ml of Buffer CT before performing the experiments described below. For the experiments described in Fig. 5 B, the washed resin was resuspended in 200 μl of Buffer CT containing 5 μg of recombinant eIF4E (17Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6876-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Following three washes in 1 ml of Buffer CT, the bound proteins were eluted 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The eIF4G and eIF4E proteins were detected by Western analysis as described previously (17Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6876-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The experiments described in Fig. 5 C were performed in a manner similar to that previously described (17Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6876-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the eIF4G1 proteins were eluted from the washed resin with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gel, and electroblotted onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following blocking with BLOTTO, the membrane with the immobilized eIF4G1 was probed with recombinant eIF4E (1 μg/ml) in Blotto, and the bound eIF4E was detected by Western analysis. Deletion analysis of the yeast eIF4G1 protein defined a region of approximately 100 residues (between residues 400 and 500) that is required for binding to eIF4E (10Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). This region contains the eIF4E binding peptide. A recombinant fragment containing this region will be referred to as eIF4G1381–506. To characterize further the structure of the eIF4G1-eIF4E complex, we performed a protease trimming experiment on both eIF4G1381–506 alone and a stoichiometric complex of eIF4G1381–506 and eIF4E. In these experiments, equal amounts (by weight) of either eIF4G1381–506 or the eIF4G1381–506-eIF4E complex were incubated with different amounts of trypsin for a fixed time. Following inactivation of the protease, the reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). At a concentration of trypsin that degraded the majority of eIF4G1381–506 in the absence of eIF4E, there appeared a resistant smaller fragment of eIF4G1381–506 when it was incubated with eIF4E (Fig.1 A, filled circle, compare lane 2 with lane 7). The sequence boundaries of the protected fragment within eIF4G1381–506 were determined by mass spectrometry and microsequencing (Fig. 1 B). The N terminus of the degraded product mapped to residue 393, and the C terminus mapped to residue 490. Contained within the fragment is the eIF4E binding peptide (residues 454–460). Importantly, the fragment contains multiple protected residues that could have been cleaved by trypsin and that lie outside of the eIF4E binding peptide region (Fig. 1 B, open circle). The protection of these residues from digestion in the presence but not the absence of eIF4E indicated that they become inaccessible upon the formation of the eIF4G-eIF4E complex. The identification of a 98-residue protease-resistant eIF4G1 fragment within the eIF4G-eIF4E complex was surprising because recent work has shown that the eIF4E binding peptide and several flanking residues interact with a considerable portion of the conserved surface of eIF4E that is not involved in binding to the cap structure.2 Our protease protection data implied that a greater portion of eIF4G1 is directly bound to eIF4E than had been previously supposed and/or that the eIF4E binding domain of eIF4G1 forms a folded structure when the eIF4E binding peptide binds to eIF4E. To help distinguish among these possibilities, we wished to determine whether the eIF4G1393–490 f"

Arrestin exists as a latent inhibitor which must be 'activated’ upon contact with a phosphorylated receptor. X-ray crystal structures of visual arrestin exhibit a tetrameric arrangement wherein an asymmetric dimer with an extensive interface between conformationally different subunits is related to a second asymmetric dimer by a local two-fold rotation axis. To test the biological relevance of this molecular organization in solution, we carried out a sedimentation equilibrium analysis of arrestin at both crystallographic and physiological protein concentrations. While the tetrameric form can exist at the high concentrations used in crystallography experiments, we find that arrestin participates in a monomer/dimer equilibrium at concentrations more likely to be physiologically relevant. Solution interaction analysis of a proteolytically modified, constitutively active form of arrestin shows diminished dimerization. We propose that self-association of arrestin may provide a mechanism for regulation of arrestin activity by (i) ensuring an adequate supply for rapid quenching of the visual signal and (ii) limiting the availability of active monomeric species, thereby preventing inappropriate signal termination.

G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is a ubiquitous mode of communicating information from the extracellular surroundings to the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. A wide variety of signals, ranging from light to small molecules to macromolecules, are sensed with this pathway. The signal sensor is a seven-transmembrane helical receptor protein which activates heterotrimeric G-proteins by catalyzing nucleotide exchange, enabling the G-protein subunits to associate with and modulate the action of effectors. G-protein receptor kinases and arrestins, respectively, attenuate and then quench signaling (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 2Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The arrestin family of molecules terminates the signal by binding tightly to the activated and phosphorylated receptors, occluding the competing G-proteins. In addition, in nonvisual systems, they mediate the interaction with clathrin in the endocytic sequestration of the receptor. Association of visual arrestin with rhodopsin is highly selective for light-activated and phosphorylated receptor (Rho*-P) 1The abbreviations used are: Rho*-P, light-activated and phosphorylated rhodopsin; Rho*, light-activated and nonphosphorylated rhodopsin; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (3Gurevich V.V.

Arrestins appear to be inactive latent inhibitors whose basal conformation prevents effective interaction with the cytosolic surface of the activated receptor. The structural basis for the activation of arrestin has been elucidated by crystallographic and mutational analyses. 2Hirsch, J. A., Schubert, C., Gurevich, V. V., and Sigler, P. B. (1999) Cell 97,257–269., 3Vishnivetskiy, S. A., Paz, C. L., Schubert, C., Hirsch, J. A., Sigler, P. B., and Gurevich, V. V. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 11451–11454.Contact with the C-terminal segment of phosphorylated receptor is required to activate the inhibitory action of arrestin, apparently by releasing the constraints that maintain the inactive state of arrestin thus permitting a conformational adjustment (6Palczewski K. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Proteolytic and mutational variants can also release these constraints, resulting in a constitutively active form of arrestin that bypasses the need for contact with the phosphorylated C-terminal segment of the receptor (7Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of visual arrestin in its inactive, basal state have revealed a tetrameric quaternary structure (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)2in which there are two asymmetric dimers, each with an extensive internal interface between conformationally different arrestin subunits. The two asymmetric dimers are arranged in a 2-fold symmetrical tetramer. The quaternary structure was found in the asymmetric unit of two different crystal forms that were grown under markedly different conditions (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).2 These findings led us to ask whether this oligomerization state applied to arrestin in solution and at concentrations that are likely to be physiologically relevant. In addition, the oligomerization state of arrestin ΔV8 was determined. Arrestin ΔV8 is a proteolytically modified, constitutively active form of arrestin that binds to light-activated, nonphosphorylated rhodopsin (Rho*) in addition to Rho*-P. Recombinant arrestin (the encoding gene contains a single glycine inserted at residue 2 of the wild-type sequence) was expressed in Escherichia colistrain ER2508 (New England Biolabs) using the pTrcB vector (Invitrogen) and purified by sequential heparin-Sepharose, Mono-Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Mono-S chromatography (9Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7058-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Transformed ER2508 cells were grown for 4–5 h at 30 °C in 12 liters of LB containing 100 μg/ml−1 ampicillin. Upon reaching anA 600 of 0.6, cells were induced with 20–30 μm IPTG over a 17–20-h period. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 2 mmdithiothreitol; 1 mm PMSF; 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA). After lysis in a microfluidizer (Microfluidics), cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, followed by precipitation in a 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution. The precipitate was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm PMSF (C buffer). The ionic strength was adjusted to 100 mm NaCl by dialysis against C buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, and the protein was loaded onto a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with C buffer containing 100 mm NaCl at 4 °C (flow rate = 1–1.5 ml/min−1). The column was washed with C buffer containing 150 mm NaCl until a stable base line was achieved. After elution with a linear gradient of C buffer from 150 mm NaCl to 400 mm NaCl, arrestin-containing fractions (approximately 250 mm NaCl) were pooled and buffer was exchanged by ultrafiltration to 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF (Q buffer), with 100 mm NaCl. Immediately before loading onto a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (21 °C), the protein was diluted 1:5-fold with Q buffer. The column was washed with Q buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and fractions were eluted with a shallow linear gradient of Q buffer containing 150–500 mm NaCl. Arrestin-containing fractions were pooled (180–200 mmNaCl) and concentrated, and buffer was exchanged by ultrafiltration to 10 mm Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4 (pH 6.5) (S buffer) containing 100 mm NaCl and was diluted 1:5-fold with S buffer. The diluted sample was loaded onto a Mono-S (10/10) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a linear gradient of S buffer from 100–500 mm NaCl (eluted at 150–170 mm NaCl). As assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrospray mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing, arrestin is > 95% pure after this step. The N-terminal methionine is cleaved in vivo as determined from sequencing and mass spectrometry. Following buffer exchange to 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, the pooled fractions were concentrated to 10 mg ml−1 using Centricons (Amicon), divided into 30-μl aliquots and flash frozen in liquid N2. Arrestin ΔV8 (residues 2–368 versus full-length 2–404) was prepared as follows. Purified recombinant arrestin was diluted to 2.5 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl. Proteolysis was initiated by addition of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a ratio of 150:1 (by weight) of arrestin to enzyme. The digestion was performed at 4 °C for 18 h. The digested material was then diluted with an equal volume of 10 mm MES (pH 5.95), 100 mmNaCl (buffer M) and loaded onto a previously equilibrated Source S cation exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A linear gradient was developed (100–400 mm NaCl), and arrestin ΔV8 was eluted at approximately 250 mm NaCl. Fractions were assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration in a buffer of 10 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.25), 150 mm NaCl to 10 mg/ml, and frozen in 25-μl aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Some samples were further processed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex S75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in buffer M at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were then pooled, concentrated, and frozen as above. Samples were submitted to analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry and C-terminal sequencing to determine the precise point of cleavage by V8. A Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge was used to obtain the equilibrium distribution of bovine arrestin at seven initial concentrations and at eight speeds in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl at pH 8.5. The buffer conditions were chosen to reflect the crystallization conditions2 and are near the physiological range (NaCl substituted for KCl). The protein concentration was detected using the absorbance optics at either 250 or 280 nm, chosen so that the absorbance would fall within the linear range. Six initial concentrations were evaluated ranging from 9 to 62 μm (.40–2.8 mg/ml) at 4 °C. Rotor speeds were 7000, 8800, 10,800, 13,300, 16,300, 20,000, 24,500, and 30,000 rpm. Sample setups for these six concentrations were carried out using standard six-sector cells equipped with quartz windows. Sample volumes were 110 μl. Data at 16 °C and 37 °C were collected for the same concentrations at rotor speeds of 16,300 and 20,000 rpm. An additional initial concentration of 220 μm (10 mg/ml) was examined using a two-sector cell equipped with spacers and a 0.3-mm path-length centerpiece (37-μl sample volume). Sedimentation equilibrium was established using the algorithm MATCH. The Windows 95 version of NONLIN (11Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) was used to analyze sedimentation equilibrium data to obtain estimates for the association states and equilibrium constants. Values for the protein partial specific volume at each temperature were calculated from the amino acid composition using SEDNTERP, which is based on the method of Laue (12Laue T.M. Shah B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). They were 0.7346, 0.7397, 0.7486 ml g−1 at 4, 16, and 37 °C, respectively. The solvent densities at each temperature were also calculated using SEDNTERP. They were 1.00452, 1.00349, and 0.99785 g/ml−1 at 4, 16, and 37 °C, respectively. Data in absorbance units were converted to molar concentrations using molar extinction coefficients of 26,360 at 280 nm and 9922 at 250 nm for a 1-cm path-length, also calculated using SEDNTERP. 4The software programs MATCH, SEDNTERP, and NONLIN are available as shareware from the RASMB web site athttp://www.bbri.org/rasmb/rasmb.html. A Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge was used to obtain the equilibrium distribution of bovine arrestin ΔV8 at three initial concentrations and at four speeds in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 100 mmNaCl at pH 8.5. The protein concentration was detected using the absorbance optics at 280 nm so that the absorbance would fall within the linear range. Three initial concentrations were evaluated ranging from 16 to 40 μm at 4 °C. Rotor speeds were 16,300, 20,000, 24,500, and 30,000 rpm. Sample setups and data analysis were carried out using standard procedures given above. The values for the protein partial specific volume (0.7476 ml/g−1) and the solvent density (1.00452 g/ml−1) were calculated using SEDNTERP. Data in absorbance units were converted to molar concentrations using a molar extinction coefficient of 24,870 at 280 nm for a 1-cm path-length, which was also calculated using SEDNTERP. The self-association propensity for visual arrestin at micromolar concentrations was investigated using sedimentation equilibrium. A global nonlinear least squares analysis of 15 data sets collected at six initial concentrations and three speeds was carried out using NONLIN. The results of fitting trials suggest that the simplest model that adequately describes the data contains three species with molecular weights corresponding to an arrestin monomer, dimer, and tetramer. A typical distribution is shown in Fig.1. The formal expression, ci=crefexp[ς(ξi−ξref)]+cref2K1,2exp[2ς(ξi−ξref)]+cref4K1,4exp[4ς(ξi−ξref)]+baseEquation 1 where ci is the total absorbance at a radial position, ri; c refis the monomer absorbance at a reference position,r ref; ς = M(1 −ν̄Prρ)ω2/RT; Mis the monomer molecular mass; ν̄Pr is the monomer partial specific volume; ρ is the solvent density;ω is the angular velocity (radians sec−1);R is the universal gas constant; T is the absolute temperature; ξ = r 2/2;K 1,2 is the monomer-dimer equilibrium constant (in absorbance units) that was common for all data sets,K 1,4 is the apparent monomer-tetramer equilibrium constant that was different for each data set, andbase is a base-line term for nonsedimenting material. The fit was judged to be good by examination of the residuals (small and random) and minimization of the variance (5.17 × 10−3 with 1443 degrees of freedom). A value of 34 (±4) μm for the dimer/monomer dissociation equilibrium constant was determined from this global fit using Equation (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Attempts to globally fit the data using a fitting function containing a common tetramer/dimer dissociation constant for all data sets failed to converge as indicated by non-randomness of the residuals (data not shown) and a significant increase in the variance (6.25 × 10−3 with 1454 degrees of freedom). The global analysis thus suggests that the tetramer is not reversibly associating with the other species on the time scale of this experiment and so is taken as thermodynamically heterogeneous. The tetramer concentration is low (Fig. 1). To obtain additional information on the thermodynamics of arrestin dimerization, the temperature dependence of arrestin self-association was examined by sedimentation equilibrium experiments carried out at 16 and 37 °C. Twelve data sets (six concentrations at two speeds each) at each temperature were used in a global analysis of the equilibrium data. At both temperatures, Equation (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) was found to best describe the arrestin equilibrium distributions. Dimer/monomer dissociation constants were estimated to be 26 (±5) μm at 16 °C and 30 (±5) μm at 37 °C. The temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant using an Arrhenius analysis shows that the association enthalpy change is too small to be measured over the experimentally accessible temperature range. To determine the oligomeric state of arrestin at crystallographic concentrations, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted on a highly concentrated sample (10 mg/ml) using small path-length cells. The simplest model that adequately describes the data contains two noninteracting species. The formal expression is, ci=cref,tetexp[4ς(ξi−ξref)]+cref,nmerexp[nς(ξi−ξref)]+baseEquation 2 where the symbols are as described as above. The best fit value for n was found to be 12. Thus, the higher order species corresponds to an arrestin dodecamer. Inclusion of a nonideality term did not lead to significant improvements in the fit. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the tetramer was found to be the predominant species in solution under these conditions. The fit also notes the absence of lower oligomeric species (such as the dimer), which is consistent with the thermodynamically heterogeneous behavior of the arrestin tetramer. Arrestin ΔV8 is a proteolyzed form of arrestin produced by digestion withS. aureus V8 protease, an endopeptidase that cleaves the peptide bond on the carboxylic side of glutamate residues. Electrospray mass spectrometry in conjunction with C-terminal peptide sequencing determined that arrestin ΔV8 comprises residues 2–368. (The N-terminal methionine is cleaved in the bacterial expression system.) Arrestin ΔV8 binds significantly to both Rho*-P and Rho*. Such a binding profile is identical with that of engineered recombinant C-terminal truncations of similar segments and indicates an active conformation. A global nonlinear least squares analysis of twelve data sets collected at three initial concentrations and four speeds was carried out using NONLIN. The results of fitting trials show that the simplest model that adequately describes the data contains three species with molecular weights corresponding to an arrestin ΔV8 monomer, dimer, and tetramer (Equation 1). A distribution of species is given in Fig.3. The tetramer was present in small amounts (<10%) in the observed concentration range. The fit was judged to be good by examination of the residuals (small and random) and minimization of the variance (5.48 × 10−3 with 1311 degrees of freedom). A value of 114 (±5) μm for the dimer/monomer dissociation equilibrium constant was determined from a global fit of the data using Equation 1. Attempts to globally fit the data using a fitting function containing a common tetramer/dimer dissociation constant for all data sets failed to converge as indicated by non-randomness of the residuals (data not shown) and a significant increase in the variance (6.14 × 10−3 with 1318 degrees of freedom). The global analysis thus suggests that the tetramer is not reversibly associating with the other species on the time scale of the experiment. This behavior is similar to that observed for the full-length arrestin protein. Arrestin is the second most abundant soluble protein in rod outer segments. By comparison to rhodopsin and transducin (Gt) concentrations, it is estimated that the physiological concentration of arrestin is in the range of 50–170 μm (13Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Kawamura S. Djamangoz M.B.A. Archer S.N. Vallerga S. Neurobiology and Clinical Aspects of the Outer Retina. Chapman & Hall, London1995: 105-131Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the concentration-dependent distribution of oligomeric species for the thermodynamically homogeneous monomer and dimer arrestin forms. Extrapolation of the distribution reveals that arrestin is monomeric at micromolar concentrations and below. The distribution is poised such that the monomer/dimer ratio of arrestin would be 45:55% in the biologically relevant concentration range. However, this estimate of the monomer fraction is an upper limit due to excluded volume effects in vivo. As stated in the introduction, arrestin appears as a dimer of dimers in the crystalline state (Fig. 5A) (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).2 The protomeric dimer is a heterodimer of arrestins having similar overall folds but distinctly different local conformations. We call the dimer subunits α and β. The α′β′ dimer is thus related by a noncrystallographic two-fold rotation axis to αβ. As described in detail in the structure report,2arrestin has a bipartite architecture, divided into an N-domain (N for N-terminal; residues 1–179) and a C-domain (C for carboxyl terminal; residues 184–362) with a C-tail (residues 372–404). The question then arises: what is the quaternary structure in solution? Close inspection of the molecular arrangement in the crystal structure reveals that there are three possible permutations for dimerization. The permutations are 1) α and β, head to tail, i.e. the C-domain of one molecule interacts with the N-domain of the other (Fig.5 B); 2) α′ and β, tail to tail, i.e. the C-domain of one molecule interacts with the C-domain of the other (Fig.5 C); and 3) β and the crystallographic symmetry mate of β′, head to head, i.e. the N-domain of one molecule interacts with the N-domain of the other (Fig. 5 D). Computation of the total buried surface due to dimerization would strongly favor either permutation one or three (∼2000 Å2) versus permutation two (∼1000 Å2). For reasons explained below, we favor permutation one (αβ). The dimer interface between α and β involves two loci of interactions. One region is a parallel strand-strand interaction, forming a continuous sheet from one molecule to the next. This area extends for ten residues of the main chain and also involves side chain interactions with several van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonding. The second region is less extensive in terms of hydrogen bonds but is noteworthy because of its unusual interclasping of rolled sheet surfaces. Analysis by the method of Richards (15Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar) gives a value of 2100 Å2 total surface area that is buried upon dimerization of α and β. This value is in the range thought to represent bona fide dimers (16Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) as opposed to the much smaller values (<800 Å2) which arise due to crystal packing. Crystallographic and mutational analysis have implicated the C-tail as a central component in stabilizing the inactive, basal state of arrestin by contributing to the N- and C-domain interface of arrestin. Consequently, removal of the C-tail either in a natural splice variant (p44), by proteolysis, or by engineered recombinant truncations relaxes the discrimination of arrestin against nonphosphorylated, activated receptor, allowing significant binding to both Rho* and Rho*-P (17Palczewski K.

The proposal that arrestin oligomers are comprised of inactive, basal state molecules2 leads to the hypothesis that the C-tail might also play an indirect role in stabilizing oligomerization of arrestin by supporting stable domain interactions of the inactive state. Such a stable conformation may better enable head to tail dimer formation (permutation one)versus the head to head configuration of permutation three. To test the possible role of the C-tail in oligomerization, we carried out solution interaction analysis of a constitutively active arrestin form, arrestin ΔV8, which lacks the C-tail. Consistent with similar arrestin forms, e.g. p44, receptor binding experiments with arrestin ΔV8 demonstrate its ability to bind to both Rho* and Rho*-P (data not shown). Our solution interaction analysis studies reveal a nearly 4-fold reduction in association propensity for this proteolytic form. This result strongly suggests that the C-tail not only stabilizes the basal state through its myriad of interactions with the N- and C-domains, but as a consequence, also plays a role in stabilizing oligomerization. Since rhodopsin binding experiments are performed with nanomolar concentrations of arrestin, well within the monomeric regime (Fig. 4), arrestin must be competent to undergo its conformational changes to bind Rho*-P as a monomer (20Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Why then does arrestin self-associate? Because the structure suggests that arrestin oligomers are comprised of inactive, basal state molecules,2 we propose that regulation of arrestin activity by self-association may provide a mechanism to limit the concentration of arrestin capable of activation in the cell. In this sense, the dimeric form of arrestin might then represent a “storage” form of the protein, which could be quickly mobilized by dissociation to meet increased needs for terminating the visual signal. Furthermore, the tetramer may represent a long term storage form, because its dissociation is characterized by a much longer time scale. At the same time, oligomerization prevents potentially high concentrations of monomeric arrestin from dampening a receptor response inappropriately. A biological precedent for self-association playing a negative regulatory role can be found in the case of TATA binding protein (TBP), a general transcription factor. In that case, TBP is primarily an inactive homodimer in solution (4Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Coleman R.A.

Science. 1996; 272: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Upon dissociation, it binds to its target DNA sequence, the TATA box, located approximately 35 nucleotides upstream from the start site of transcription. When bound to DNA, TBP serves as the nucleating molecule for assembly of the transcription machinery. It has been proposed that dimerization is a storage mechanism, providing a readily accessible supply for immediate transcription initiation. Moreover, in a manner parallel with arrestin, TBP dimerization may prevent adventitious binding to promoters and therefore potentially undesirable nucleation of preinitiator assemblies. In summary, we have shown using analytical ultracentrifugation that visual arrestin at in vivo concentrations will have a monomer/dimer distribution. The dominant species in vivowill most likely be a dimeric “storage” form. The C-tail, an important functional segment of the molecule, stabilizes self-association of the inactive form. Dimerization of arrestin therefore furnishes a mechanism for its self-regulation. We thank Joe Leykam of Michigan State University for C-terminal sequencing."

To understand the regulation of CYP4F3 expression, we analyzed the CYP4F3 gene and cloned a novel isoform (CYP4F3B) that is expressed in fetal and adult liver, but not in neutrophils. The CYP4F3 gene contains 14 exons and 13 introns. The cDNAs for CYP4F3A (the neutrophil isoform) and CYP4F3B have identical coding regions, except that they contain exons 4 and 3, respectively. Both exons code for amino acids 66–114 but share only 27% identity. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the K m of CYP4F3B was determined to be 26-fold higher than the K m of CYP4F3A using leukotriene B4 as a substrate. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA end studies reveal that the CYP4F3A and CYP4F3B transcripts have 5′-termini derived from different parts of the gene and are initiated from distinct transcription start sites located 519 and 71 base pairs (bp), respectively, from the ATG initiation codon. A consensus TATA box is located 27 bp upstream of the CYP4F3B transcription start site, and a TATA box-like sequence is located 23 bp upstream of the CYP4F3A transcription start site. The data indicate that the tissue-specific expression of functionally distinct CYP4F3 isoforms is regulated by alternative promoter usage and mutually exclusive exon splicing.

The bioactivity of LTB4 is determined by the regulation and kinetic properties of the enzymes that control its synthesis and catabolism. LTB4 is inactivated by ω-oxidation of its terminal carbon to yield 20-OH LTB4 and 20-COOH LTB4 (10Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W.

Two members of this subfamily have been identified in humans and are designated CYP4F3 (16Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Endo K. Yamamoto S. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kusunose M. J. Biol.

Kusunose M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CYP4F3 is expressed in neutrophils and monocytes, whereas CYP4F2 is expressed in liver (20Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Kondo T. Yamamoto S. Kinoshita H. Kusunose M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CYP4F2 has aK m for the ω-hydroxylation of LTB4that is ∼60-fold higher than CYP4F3 (20Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Kondo T. Yamamoto S. Kinoshita H. Kusunose M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Both enzymes have 520 amino acids and share 93% amino acid sequence identity throughout most of the molecule. However, the sequence diverges between amino acids 66 and 114, where there is only 27% identity. It is not known whether the sequence variation within this 48-amino acid segment accounts for the different K m values of the two enzymes. We have cloned both a novel isoform of CYP4F3 expressed in fetal and adult liver and the CYP4F3 gene. The liver and neutrophil transcripts of CYP4F3 are generated by tissue-specific splicing of exons 3 and 4, respectively, and are initiated from different transcription start sites. Exons 3 and 4 are identical in size and each code for amino acids 66–114 of CYP4F3. Mutually exclusive selection of the exons is correlated with the generation of high K m and lowK m forms of the enzyme; liver CYP4F3 containing exon 3 has a K m for LTB4 which is ∼26-fold higher than neutrophil CYP4F3 containing exon 4. Analysis of the gene indicates that putative TATA boxes are located upstream of both the liver and neutrophil transcription start sites. These findings suggest that the generation of CYP4F3 isoforms is regulated by a combination of alternative promoter usage and tissue-specific splicing. In addition, we propose a general model for CYP4F family gene organization and expression. A human genomic P1 library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) was screened by PCR using primers N1 and N3 (Table I). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; 35 cycles were followed by 1 cycle with a 10 min extension time. Clones that gave a PCR product of 78 bp on a 1% agarose gel were isolated. Two P1 clones, each with genomic inserts spanning more than 75 kb, were isolated to purity after 3 rounds of screening. ABamHI restriction digest of one clone (P1-A) was shotgun subcloned into pZErO-1 vector (Invitrogen). Positive subclones were identified by Southern blotting using the 32P-labeled coding region of CYP4F3 cDNA as a probe. Five differentBamHI fragments were identified, which collectively span the CYP4F3 gene when arranged in a linear order. Plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen plasmid kits and sequenced at the Massachusetts General Hospital core facility using a combination of forward and reverse primers. Exons and intron-exon junctions were sequenced using primers designed from the cDNA of CYP4F3. Introns and the 3′- and 5′-flanking regions of the gene were sequenced by primer walking. The distances of the large introns were determined by PCR using the Expand Long Template System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and primer pairs from flanking exons.Table ISummary of primersNameDirectionPositionExonSequence (5′ to 3′)N1Sense1–212ATGCCACAGCTGAGCCTGTCCN2Antisense49–322ATGCTGCCATTGGCCAAAN3Antisense78–562CCCAACCAGCAGCAGGAGCAGCCL4Antisense138–1212GCGGCAGTTGTCATAGAAN5Sense165–1842GAAACGGAATTGGTTCTTGGL5Sense165–1842AAGACGGAACTGGTTTTGGGNL6e3Antisense340–3223AGGCGTTGATGACAGACCGNL6e4Antisense340–3224GAGCAAAGAGCACAGGCTTN7Antisense1205–118811CAGCAGCGAGAGACGGCAL7Antisense1205–118811ACATGGCGGGAGATGACCN8Sense1201–122111TGCTGCACCCAAGACATTGTGNL9Antisense1560–154314GCTCAGGGGCTCCACCCGNL10Antisense1865–184414ACTGCTTCATTCCTTTTTATGGSequences of primers referred to in text are shown.

Human peripheral blood neutrophils were separated from whole blood by fractionation on Mono-Poly resolving medium (ICN) and total RNA was prepared from the cells by the RNA STAT-60 procedure (Tel-Test Inc.). Total RNA from human liver and fetal liver (15–24 weeks) was purchased fromCLONTECH. Total RNA was isolated from COS-7 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the cDNA Cycle Kit (Invitrogen) with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and random primers. The cDNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Alternative splice forms of CYP4F3 and CYP4F2 were assayed by PCR using forward primers N5 and L5 and reverse primers NL6e3 and NL6e4. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles were followed by 1 cycle with a 10-min extension time. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. A novel isoform of CYP4F3 containing exon 3 (CYP4F3B) was cloned from fetal liver total RNA following first strand cDNA synthesis with a specific primer for the 3′-UTR of CYP4F genes (NL10). The product was amplified by a single round of PCR using primers N1 and NL9 and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; 30 cycles were followed by 1 cycle with a 10-min extension time. Clones containing exon 3 were identified by PCR screening with primers N5 and NL6e3 and were sequenced. The start sites of transcription were determined by 5′-RACE (Life Technologies, Inc.). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with a primer (NL10) that recognized the 3′-UTR of CYP4F3 and CYP4F2. The cDNA was purified and tailed with dCTP by terminal transferase. First-round PCR was with the anchor primer and either primer N7 (CYP4F3) or L7 (CYP4F2). Second-round PCR was with the universal amplification primer and either primer NL6e3 (exon 3 of CYP4F2 and CYP4F3) or NL6e4 (exon 4 of CYP4F2 and CYP4F3). PCR conditions were as before. The final PCR product was ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into TOP10 cells. Plasmid DNA was purified with SNAP kits (Invitrogen) and sequenced using primer N2 (CYP4F3) or L4 (CYP4F2). A partial CYP4F3 cDNA coding for amino acids 410–520 was amplified by PCR using primers N8 and NL10 and ligated into pCRII TA vector (Invitrogen). The partial cDNA was then subcloned in frame into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which generates an N-terminal GST fusion protein, and also into the EcoRI site of pMAL-p2 (New England Biolabs), which generates an N-terminal MBP fusion protein. To induce the expression of fusion proteins, DH5α cells were transformed with the pGEX-2TK or pMAL-p2 constructs and incubated with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and were resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were disrupted by sonication for 3 × 1 min on ice using a Vibracell probe sonicator (50% output, setting 6), and the sonicate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The GST fusion protein was found in the pellet of sonicated DH5α cells. The pellet was resuspended in SDS gel loading buffer and the proteins separated on a 10% SDS gel and detected with Coomassie Blue staining. The portion of the gel containing the GST fusion protein (38 kDa) was excised, ground in a minimal volume of PBS, and mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant for immunization of rabbits. Blood samples (15 ml) were obtained biweekly from the ear veins, and antiserum was prepared and stored at −20 °C. The MBP-CYP4F3-(410–520) fusion protein was found in the supernatant of sonicated DH5α cells and was purified by amylose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity of the fusion protein was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Blue staining. It was then coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B. Antibodies to CYP4F3 were precipitated from serum at a concentration of 55% saturated ammonium sulfate, resuspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and collected in the flow-through of a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer. The antibodies were then bound to the CYP4F3-(410–520) affinity column, washed with 10 column volumes of PBS, and eluted with glycine chloride buffer (0.05 mglycine, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.3) into 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.7. The final composition of each fraction was 0.5 ml of eluate and 0.25 ml of sodium phosphate buffer. The fractions were screened at a dilution of 1:1000 against Western blots containing 1 μg of MBP-CYP4F3-(410–520) fusion protein. Peak fractions (2, 3, and 4) were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and stored in PBS containing 0.05% azide. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown to 50% confluence and transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA/100-mm dish using SuperFect Reagent (Qiagen). After 48 h the cells were washed three times in PBS and harvested in disruption buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA). They were disrupted with a Vibracell probe sonicator (3 × 30 s, 50% output, 5 × 107 cells/ml) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The microsomal membrane pellet was resuspended in disruption buffer by brief sonication. All fractionation procedures were at 4 °C. Total protein content was assayed by the Bio-Rad method, and the membranes were stored at −70 °C. Proteins in cell extracts and microsome preparations were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose Trans-Blot membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 3% nonfat dried milk, pH 7.4, and then incubated for 1 h with affinity purified anti-CYP4F3-(410–520) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. The membranes were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The conversion of LTB4 to 20-OH LTB4 was determined as described previously (14Soberman R.J. Harper T.W. Murphy R.C. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2292-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 20 μg of microsomal protein, [3H]LTB4 (40,000 cpm/nmol), 100 μm NADPH, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, were incubated in a final volume of 0.1 ml for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 drops of 2 mcitric acid, and the substrate and product were extracted twice with 0.1 ml of ethyl acetate, resolved by thin layer chromatography, and quantitated by β-scintillation counting. The genomic clone P1-A was used as a probe to map the chromosomal localization of the CYP4F3 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization at Genome Systems. The clone was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation and then hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived fromPhaseolus vulgaris agglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from a male donor. The hybridization buffer was 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 × SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating hybridized chromosome slides with fluoresceinated anti-digoxigenin, followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. An anonymous genomic clone known to map to chromosome 19q was used as an internal control in cohybridization experiments with the P1-A probe to confirm the identity of chromosome 19. A map of the CYP4F3 gene comprising 14 exons and 13 introns was constructed by DNA sequencing and PCR analysis of genomic subclones as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first exon is non-coding, and the ATG translation start codon is located at the beginning of exon 2. All introns conform to the gt-ag rule (24Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar), and a summary of the splice junctions is shown in Table II. These data are in agreement with a recent description of the gene (19Kikuta Y. Kato M. Yamashita Y. Miyauchi Y. Tanaka K. Kamada N. Kusunose M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but include a previously unrecognized exon, designated exon 3, which is not incorporated into the characterized cDNA of neutrophil CYP4F3 (16Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Endo K. Yamamoto S. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kusunose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9376-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the sequence of exons 3 and 4 and the genomic flanking regions (Fig. 1 A) revealed several features that suggested exon 3 might have the capacity to participate in alternative splicing reactions with exon 4. 1) The sequences bordering exon 3 conform to recognizable splice junctions. 2) Exon 3 is identical in size to exon 4 (145 bp), and its predicted translation product has 13 amino acids in common with exon 4. 3) Exon 3 has a homolog, which is expressed in the CYP4F2 gene. Analysis of the genomic sequence of CYP4F2 deposited by the Human Genome Project (GenBank accession AC005336) reveals that it contains 14 exons that are directly analogous to those of CYP4F3. A comparison of the similarities in gene sequences in the regions of exons 3 and 4 is shown in Fig.1 A. Examination of the characterized CYP4F2 cDNA from liver (20Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Kondo T.

To confirm the possibility that exon 3 provides an alternative substrate for splicing we searched for CYP4F3 transcripts which incorporate this exon. An important consideration is that the assay used must be capable of distinguishing related CYP4F2 transcripts that are encoded by a separate gene. The sequences of exons 3 and 4 shown in Fig. 1 A were used to develop an RT-PCR assay that distinguishes between all possible isoforms that might be generated by alternative splicing of CYP4F3 and CYP4F2. Forward primers specific for exon 2 of either CYP4F3 (N5) or CYP4F2 (L5) were paired with reverse primers, which had an identical sequence in the genes for CYP4F2 and CYP4F3 but which were specific for either exon 3 (NL6e3) or exon 4 (NL6e4). The four different combinations of primers each generate an isoform-specific PCR product of 158 bp and collectively give a profile of the alternatively spliced transcripts expressed in a given tissue (Fig. 1 B). The RT-PCR assay demonstrated that peripheral blood neutrophils derived from an adult donor exclusively express CYP4F3 containing exon 4 (Fig.1 B, lanes 1–4). This isoform corresponds to the previously characterized cDNA from neutrophils (16Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Endo K. Yamamoto S. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kusunose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9376-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It could not be detected in adult liver (lane 8), but is expressed in fetal liver (lane 12). This observation may derive from hematopoiesis in fetal liver (33Tavassoli M. Blood Cells. 1991; 1: 269-281Google Scholar). Adult liver expresses CYP4F2 containing exon 3 (lane 5), and this corresponds to the previously characterized cDNA from liver (20Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Kondo T. Yamamoto S. Kinoshita H. Kusunose M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This CYP4F2 isoform could also be detected in fetal liver (lane 9), but no transcripts of CYP4F2 containing exon 4 were detected in any of the tissues tested (lanes 2, 6, and10). In contrast, we obtained evidence for a novel isoform of CYP4F3 containing exon 3 in both adult liver (lane 7) and fetal liver (lane 11). We then cloned a cDNA of the entire coding region of the novel CYP4F3 isoform detected by RT-PCR. The tissue source was fetal liver, which expresses high levels of this transcript, and the cloning conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The comp"

A bacterial expression system using a synthetic gene coding for the 215-amino acid, full-length Hmu O has been constructed. Expressed at very high levels in Escherichia coli BL21, the enzyme binds hemin stoichiometrically to form a hexacoordinate high spin hemin-Hmu O complex. When ascorbic acid is used as the electron donor, Hmu O converts hemin to biliverdin with α-hydroxyhemin and verdoheme as intermediates. The overall conversion rate to biliverdin is approximately 4-fold slower than that by rat heme oxygenase (HO) isoform 1. Reaction of the hemin-Hmu O complex with hydrogen peroxide yields a verdoheme species, the recovery of which is much less compared with rat HO-1. Reaction of the hemin complex withmeta-chloroperbenzoic acid generates a ferryl oxo species. Thus, the catalytic intermediate species and the nature of the active form in the first oxygenation step of Hmu O appear to be similar to those of the mammalian HO. However, the considerably slow catalytic rate and low level of verdoheme recovery in the hydrogen peroxide reaction suggest that the active-site structure of Hmu O is different from that of its mammalian counterpart.

Not a hemoprotein per se, HO binds heme at a 1:1 ratio and utilizes it as both a substrate and a prosthetic group (2Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar, 3Sono M.

Among the well characterized isoforms of the mammalian HO are HO-1, which is 33 kDa, inducible, and highly expressed in the spleen and liver, and HO-2, which is 36 kDa, constitutive, and found primarily in the brain and testes (2Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar). Both isoforms function similarly in their catalytic cycle (5Ikeda-Saito M. Fujii H. Mansfield Matera K. Takahashi S. Migita C.T. Yoshida T. Ishimura Y. Shimada H. Suematsu M. Oxygen Homeostasis and Its Dynamics. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo1998: 304-314Crossref Google Scholar). HO first binds hemin stoichiometrically to form a hemin-HO complex. Then, an electron donated from NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase reduces the hemin iron to the ferrous state (7Schacter B.A. Nelson E.B. Marver H.S. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3601-3607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This allows dioxygen to bind to the ferrous iron, forming a metastable oxy complex (8Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4418-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional electron donation to this oxy complex initiates the conversion of the heme to biliverdin IXα with α-meso-hydroxyheme and verdoheme as intermediates (Scheme 1) (3Sono M. Roach M.P.

The CO released during HO catalysis has been reported to act as a messenger molecule, participating in neuronal transmission and vascular regulation through the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (9Verma A.

The product biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (2Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar, 12Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J.

Chem. 1984; 259: 13066-13069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The significant outcome of this is the removal of excess heme via the excretion of bilirubin and the recycling of iron (14Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Iron is required for the survival of most bacteria and is particularly essential for pathogens to cause diseases (15Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tao X. Schiering N. Zeng H. Ringe D. Murphy J.R. Mol.

To circumvent the low concentration of free extracellular iron, pathogenic bacteria have developed sophisticated systems to acquire iron from iron-containing proteins found in their hosts (17Lee B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4359-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Mills M. Payne S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Braun V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 779-786PubMed Google Scholar). One mechanism is via a bacterial heme degradation enzyme (18Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4359-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 21Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mammalian HO, whose primary purpose is to maintain iron homeostasis, that of the bacterial HO is to release iron from heme so that the iron may be utilized. Within the last few years, through genetic studies, the presence of heme-degrading enzymes has been identified in pathogenic bacteria (17Lee B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hmu O, the first and only prokaryotic HO isolated to date, is expressed by the hmu O gene found in Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of diphtheria. In comparison to the mammalian HO, Hmu O is not membrane-bound but soluble and has a smaller molecular mass of 24 kDa. It is 33% identical in sequence to the first 221 amino acids of human HO-1 (22Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme has been proposed to be utilized by C. diphtheriae to release iron from the heme supplied by the pathogen's host. Using anEscherichia coli expression system, Wilks and Schmitt (23Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have purified a 24-kDa Hmu O protein that stoichiometrically binds hemin and converts it to biliverdin IXα and CO upon the aerobic addition of electron donors. However, the oxygen activation mechanisms and the catalytic pathway of Hmu O are not clear. Whether or not they are similar to the mammalian system remains to be established. In this study, we have constructed a highly efficient bacterial expression system of Hmu O using a synthetic gene based on thehmu O gene sequence (22Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have examined the heme degradation reaction catalyzed by Hmu O using the hemin-, α-hydroxyhemin-, and verdoheme-complexes of the purified recombinant Hmu O. Reactions of the hemin-Hmu O complex with H2O2 and mCPBA have also been studied. We have found that the nature of the active form in the first oxygenation step and the catalytic intermediates of Hmu O are similar to those of the mammalian HO. However, the distal heme pocket structure of Hmu O appears to be different from that of its mammalian counterpart. Plasmid purification, subcloning, and bacterial transformations were performed according to Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A T7 promoter-based expression vector, pMW172, was a gift from Dr. K. Nagai (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). A 48-base pair double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide with unique restriction enzyme sites for XhoI, ClaI, and AvrII was incorporated between the NdeI andHindIII sites in the multiple cloning site of pMW172 to make pMWA. Eight oligonucleotides and their complements, 82–91 nucleotides in length, were synthesized to prepare a 648-base pair synthetic gene coding for the entire Hmu O from the initiator ATG to the TAA stop codon. Each oligonucleotide was phosphorylated with a T4polynucleotide kinase, then annealed with its complement to make a double-stranded DNA, e.g. Oligo I to Oligo VIII. Oligos I and II were designed so that the 5′ end of Oligo I could be ligated to the NdeI site, whereas its 3′ end was complementary to the 5′ end of Oligo II. The 3′ end of Oligo II could be ligated to theXhoI site. Similarly, the 5′ ends of Oligos III, V, and VII were designed to ligate to the XhoI, ClaI, andAvrII sites, respectively, and their 3′ ends had sequences complementary to the 5′ ends of Oligos IV, VI, and VIII, respectively. The 3′ ends of Oligos IV, VI, and VIII had sequences for ligation to the ClaI, AvrII, and HindIII sites. Given these Oligos I to VIII, the construction of pMWHmuO was as followed. pMWA was excised with NdeI and XhoI, and the resulting larger fragment of the digests was gel-purified. Using T4 ligase, both Oligos I and II were ligated simultaneously between the NdeI and XhoI sites of theNdeI/XhoI fragment. The resulting plasmid, pMWB, was cleaved with XhoI and ClaI, and the larger fragment was gel-purified. Both Oligos III and IV were ligated between the XhoI and ClaI sites of the largerXhoI/ClaI fragment, and pMWC was obtained. Excised by ClaI and AvrII, the largerClaI/AvrII fragment from pMWC was gel-purified and ligated with Oligos V and VI simultaneously. The ligation of these fragments yielded pMWD, which then was cut with AvrII andHindIII. Oligos VII and VIII were ligated to the largerAvrII/HindIII fragment from pMWD. Ligation of Oligos VII and VIII resulted in the formation of pMWHmuO, the expression plasmid for the recombinant bacterial heme oxygenase Hmu O of C. diphtheriae. The nucleotide sequence was determined by an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. Fig.1 is a comparison of the coding sequence of the synthetic gene to that of the cloned DNA (22Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 10-ml inoculum in LB-Amp media of A 600 nm 1.0 was prepared with a fresh colony of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the expression construct pMWHmuO. 500-ml cultures were inoculated with 1 ml of the prepared inocula and grown in LB-Amp media at 37 °C until A 600 nm reached 1.3–1.4. The cells were grown for an additional 16 h at 25 °C before being harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until use. Typically, 2 g of cells were obtained from a 500-ml culture. Thawed on ice, the cell pellets were resuspended in 100 mmTris buffer, pH 8, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. Lysozyme (2 mg/g cells) and phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride of final concentration 1 mm were added to the resuspension, which was stirred continuously at 4 °C for 2 h. The cells then were sonicated (Branson 450 Sonifier) until no longer viscous and centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was recovered for further purification. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 60% saturation, and the solution was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant then was increased to 85% ammonium sulfate saturation and centrifuged. The subsequent precipitates, which contained the Hmu O protein, were dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. The dissolved solution was gel-filtered through a Sephadex G75 column, which had been equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. Fractions with A 400 nm greater than 0.35 were pooled and loaded onto a column of DEAE-cellulose equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. Eluted in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7, with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.4m KCl, fractions withA 400 nm/A 280 nm values greater than 0.3 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The enzyme was stored at 77 K until use. 250 μmhemin in 5-μl increments was added to 10 μm of Hmu O in 800 μl of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 20 °C. After each addition of hemin, the absorption spectrum was recorded. By plotting the absorbance at 404 nm against the amount of hemin added, titration curves were constructed, and the amount of hemin required to form the hemin-Hmu O complex was determined. To ensure that all Hmu O were hemin-bound, hemin of concentration twice that of Hmu O was added to the purified protein solution. After incubation at 4 °C, the excess hemin was removed by a DEAE-cellulose column. Fractions withA 404 nm/A 280 nm greater than or equal to 3 were collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored at 77 K until use. Verdoheme (protoverdoheme-IXα) was synthesized as described by Saito and Itano (25Saito S. Itano H.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1986; : 1-7Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). α-Hydroxyhemin (α-meso-hydroxyprotohemin) was made by hydrolyzing α-meso-benzoyloxyprotohemin as described previously (26Mansfield Matera K.

The ferric α-hydroxyheme- and ferrous verdoheme-Hmu O complexes were prepared as described by Mansfield Matera et al. (26Mansfield Matera K. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T.

Heme degradation catalyzed by Hmu O was studied using ascorbic acid as the electron donor (12Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ascorbic acid of final concentration 17.5 mm was added to an optical cuvette containing 10 μm hemin-Hmu O in 2.3 ml of 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 20 °C. Spectral changes between 300–800 nm were recorded until the reaction was complete, as indicated by the maximum loss of the Soret band (A 404 nm) and the formation of biliverdin. For experiments performed with CO, the hemin-Hmu O complex was prepared as described above but injected into a sealed cuvette filled with phosphate buffer that had been presaturated with 50% CO and 50% O2. Ascorbic acid of final concentration 17.5 mm was added to initiate heme degradation. The formation of the verdoheme-CO complex was monitored spectrophotometrically. When there was no further change in the spectrum, pyridine (20% final concentration) was added to the mixture (28Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the formation of the pyridine-verdoheme complex was recorded. In other experiments, after the reaction had been arrested at the verdoheme-CO stage, the verdoheme that had accumulated in the presence of CO was allowed to continue to the fully oxidized product by displacing the CO with 100% O2. Preparation for the assays of the hemin-Hmu O complex with H2O2 andmCPBA was similar to that described previously (29Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reagent grade 30% H2O2 was diluted in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7, to make working solutions, the concentrations of which were determined spectroscopically using ε240 nm = 43.6m−1·cm−1 (30Beers Jr., R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The appropriate amount of H2O2 was added to separate solutions containing the hemin-Hmu O complex in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7, to yield final H2O2:hemin-Hmu O ratios of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. mCPBA:hemin-Hmu O of these final concentration ratios were also prepared. Reactions at these different concentration ratios were monitored spectroscopically at 20 °C. Protein expression and purity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% gradient gels. The isoelectric point of the purified Hmu O was determined by a Pharmacia FastSystem following the manufacturer's instruction. Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 spectrophotometer at 20 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7. Sligar and co-workers (31Stayton P.S. Atkins W.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Sigel H. Metal Ion in Biological Systems. 25. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY1989: 417-475Google Scholar) have pioneered the use of synthetic genes for bacterial expression of hemoproteins. The advent of efficient and inexpensive synthesis has made it feasible to obtain longer (80–90-mer) oligonucleotides than those (∼20 mer) used earlier (31Stayton P.S. Atkins W.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Sigel H. Metal Ion in Biological Systems. 25. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY1989: 417-475Google Scholar). In our approach here, using longer oligonucleotides has enabled us to ligate the eight double-stranded oligonucleotides (Oligos I to VIII) to the expression vector in minimal ligation steps. The ligation products generated during the plasmid preparation were conveniently purified by standard agarose gel electrophoresis, and the final expression plasmid was readily obtained. Furthermore, the synthetic gene has allowed for the incorporation of unique restriction enzyme sites convenient for cassette mutagenesis. Using pMWHmuO, we have expressed successfully a recombinant Hmu O protein, as depicted in the SDS-PAGE (Fig.2, lane 2). The initial expression of Hmu O by culturing the transformed BL21 cells at 37 °C resulted in an accumulation of the expressed protein mostly in inclusion bodies. Solubilization of the inclusion bodies, following the methods used for mammalian HO mutants (32Mansfield Matera K. Zhou H. Migita C.T. Hobert S.E. Ishikawa K. Katakura K. Maeshima H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4909-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), successfully yielded an active Hmu O. However, our current method of culturing the E. coli at 37 °C then 25 °C, instead of 37 °C continuously, has increased significantly the yield of the protein in the soluble form. Both the purified Hmu O in the soluble form and from inclusion bodies have the same enzymatic properties and optical absorption spectra. Our expression of Hmu O mostly in the soluble form has facilitated the purification process and yields 100–120 mg of purified Hmu O/liter of bacterial culture, 5-fold greater than that reported by Wilks and Schmitt (23Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As indicated by SDS-PAGE, the purified Hmu O we obtain is homogeneous and has a single band at 24 kDa (Fig. 2,lane 3), the size as expected from the deduced Hmu O amino acid sequence (24.1 kDa) (22Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pI value estimated by isoelectricphoresis is 5.4. We have observed that the transformed E. coli cultured at 37 °C are pale yellow, whereas those cultured at 37 °C then 25 °C are green. The former is because of the expressed protein being in mostly inclusion bodies, whereas the latter is in the soluble form. The green E. coli cells indicate that biliverdin has been formed from the hemin degradation catalyzed by the expressed Hmu O and a reductase system in the E. coli, a phenomenon observed also for the E. coli expression of mammalian HO isoforms (29Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mansfield Matera K. Zhou H. Migita C.T. Hobert S.E. Ishikawa K. Katakura K. Maeshima H.

During the purification of Hmu O, even after DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, the fractions with the heme oxygenase enzyme activity have a broad Soret band between 380 and 400 nm, indicating that biliverdin is bound to Hmu O. In the case of rat HO-1, most of the biliverdin is removed by the DEAE-cellulose. Thus, the biliverdin affinity of Hmu O appears to be higher than that of rat HO-1. However, despite biliverdin being attached to the enzyme, hemin still binds to Hmu O readily, as described below. This indicates that biliverdin bound to Hmu O can be easily displaced by hemin, contrary to that claimed by Wilks and Schmitt (23Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows the optical absorption spectra of the purified recombinant Hmu O (broken line) and its stoichiometric complex with hemin (solid line). The optical absorption spectrum of the hemin-Hmu O complex at pH 7 has a Soret maxima at 404 nm and peaks at 500 and 630 nm in the visible region (Fig. 3, solid line). The absorption spectrum is similar to those of the mammalian hemin-HO complexes and indicates that the hemin-Hmu O complex is ferric hexacoordinate high spin at neutral pH, which is the case for the mammalian HO isoforms (5Ikeda-Saito M.

Yoshida, and M. Ikeda-Saito, submitted for publication. Because the Soret region of the optical absorption spectrum of the hemin-Hmu O complex is different from that of free hemin in pH 7 buffer, spectrophotometric titration of Hmu O with hemin was carried out utilizing this difference. Illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3, the titration curve of Hmu O with hemin has a well defined inflection point. From this, the molar stoichiometry of their binding has been established to be 1:1, which is in agreement with that reported by Wilks and Schmitt (23Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). By the pyridine hemochrome method (35Paul K.G. Theorell H. Akeson A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1284-1287Crossref Google Scholar), the extinction coefficient at 404 nm for the hemin-Hmu O complex is determined to be 150 mm−1·cm−1, larger than the 121 mm−1·cm−1 value reported by Wilks and Schmitt (23Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our value of 150 mm−1·cm−1 is within the range of Soret extinction coefficients for hexacoordinate high spin protohemin complexes including the hemin complex of rat HO-1 (165 mm−1·cm−1) (34Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ascorbic acid can serve as the electron donor in the oxidative degradation of hemin by mammalian HO (12Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, ascorbic acid is shown to support the Hmu O-catalyzed conversion of hemin to biliverdin. As depicted in Fig.4, the addition of ascorbic acid to the hemin-Hmu O complex initiates heme degradation. In a period of 2 h, the Soret peak at 404 nm disappears, and broad absorption bands centered near 380 and 680 nm appear, indicating that hemin is converted to biliverdin (Fig. 4, spectrum b). Independently, by high performance liquid chromatography analysis, we have confirmed biliverdin-IXα formation. We have noticed that heme degradation by Hmu O is 4-fold slower than that by rat HO-1 when ascorbic acid is used as an electron donor. In previous HO-1 studies, Yoshida and Kikuchi (12Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that when ascorbic acid was used as the electron donor, the heme degradation product was not biliverdin but an Fe3+-biliverdin complex. This differs from the Hmu O system, in which biliverdin, not the Fe3+-biliverdin complex, is the final product of the ascorbic acid-supported heme degradation. The implication of this is that iron is more readily extruded in the Hmu O system in contrast to the mammalian HO. This appears to be consistent with the physiological role of Hmu O, which is to release iron from heme for iron utilization by the bacteria (23Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Heme catabolism catalyzed by mammalian HO yields biliverdin with verdoheme as a precursor (28Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When the hemin-HO complex is incubated with reducing equivalents under an atomosphere of O2 and CO, heme degradation can be arrested by CO at the verdoheme stage, resulting in an accumulation of the ferrous verdoheme-CO complex and thus inhibiting biliverdin formation (28Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

We looked for regulatory elements in the 5823-nucleotide-long 3′-untranslated region of the FGF-2 mRNA that contains eight potential alternative polyadenylation sites. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that poly(A) site utilization was cell type-dependent, with the eighth poly(A) site being used (95%) in primary human skin fibroblasts, whereas proximal sites were used in the transformed cell lines studied here. We used a cell transfection approach with synthetic reporter mRNAs to localize a destabilizing element between the first and second poly(A) sites. Although AU-rich, the FGF-2-destabilizing element had unique features: it involved a 122-nucleotide direct repeat, with both elements of the repeat being required for the destabilizing activity. These data show that short stable FGF-2 mRNAs are present in transformed cells, whereas skin fibroblasts contain mostly long unstable mRNAs, suggesting that FGF-2 mRNA stability cannot be regulated in transformed cells. The results also provide evidence of a multilevel post-transcriptional control of FGF-2 expression; such a stringent control prevents FGF-2 overexpression and permits its expression to be enhanced only in relevant physiological situations.

It is involved in embryogenesis and morphogenesis, especially in the nervous system and bone formation (6Wagner J.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 165: 95-118PubMed Google Scholar,7Coffin J.D.

It is also involved in cancer pathophysiology, notably in tumor neovascularization coupled with intrinsic oncogenic potential (9Kandel J. Bossy-Wetzel E. Radvanyi F. Klagsbrun M. Folkman J.

FGF-2 expression is regulated both at the transcriptional level and more especially at the translational level. Its mRNA constitutes a complex example of alternative initiation of translation with five start codons that include four CUG codons (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Sommer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The five FGF-2 isoforms resulting from the alternative initiation process have different localizations and functions within the cell (10Couderc B. Prats H. Bayard F. Amalric F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.-C. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The regulation of their expression is also different: the largest 34-kDa isoform is exclusively translated in a cap-dependent manner, whereas the other isoforms are translated by a process of internal ribosome entry mediated by an internal ribosome entry site located between the first and second CUG codons (14Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to its GC-rich 5′-region that contains an internal ribosome entry site as well as other elements able to regulate alternative initiation of translation (18Prats A.-C. Vagner S. Prats H. Amalric F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), the 6775-nt-long FGF-2 mRNA exhibits a very uncommon feature: it is 90% composed of untranslated regions due to the presence of a huge 3′-untranslated region. This AU-rich 5823-nt-long 3′-untranslated region is not only the longest 3′-UTR described to date, but also contains eight potential polyadenylation sites. The existence of more than three FGF-2 mRNA species reported in the literature (from 1 to 7 kilobases) would suggest that several of these poly(A) sites can be functional (20Bensaid M. Malecaze F. Prats H. Bayard F. Tauber J.P. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 45: 801-813Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar,21Knee R.S. Pitcher S.E. Murphy P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). No information was available from the literature about the putative role of the huge and multiple-sized 3′-UTR present in the FGF-2 mRNA. However, the 3′-UTRs of many mRNAs are now known to play a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by controlling mRNA subcellular localization, stability, or translation initiation (22Wickens M. Anderson P. Jackson R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Interestingly, such regulation essentially concerns the messengers coding for proteins that have potent growth or developmental effects or whose function is temporarily restricted, for instance, during a particular phase of the cell cycle. The genes expressing unstable mRNAs include proto-oncogenes, cytokines, growth factors, hormones, receptors, and cell cycle-regulated genes (for review, see Ref. 23Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1997; 18: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The stability of most of these mRNAs is regulated by AU-rich elements (AREs) present in the 3′-UTR (23Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1997; 18: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The unusual length and AU-rich composition of the FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR, together with the existence of eight potential alternative length-modifying polyadenylation sites, prompted us to determine its regulatory role in FGF-2 isoform expression. In this report, we show that poly(A) site utilization varies with cell type, and we identify a destabilizing element between the first and second polyadenylation sites of FGF-2 mRNA. These observations suggest that regulation of FGF-2 expression occurs at the level of RNA stability, conditioned by use of the poly(A) site. PCRs were performed using the complete FGF-2 cDNA as a template and the primer couple RTA1/PA1rev, RTA2/PA2rev, or RTA8/PA8rev, hybridizing upstream from the first, second, or eighth poly(A) site, respectively (TableI). The resulting fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the vector Bluescript pKS. The corresponding plasmids, pKS-PA1, pKS-PA2, and pKS-PA8, were digested by XcmI + MscI, AflIII, orDraI and religated to obtain an internal deletion, giving the plasmids pKS-PA1Δ, pKS-PA2Δ, and pKS-PA8Δ, respectively.Table ISequence of oligonucleotides used for PCROligonucleotideSequenceRTA15′-TCGACTGGCTTCTAAATGTGTTAC-3′PA1rev5′-ACACATTTATTTTCTTTTACTCTC-3′RTA25′-CTCTGATGTGCAATACATTTG-3′PA2rev5′-CCCATAATTTATTTTCAAGCATA-3′RTA85′-TATAAGTGGTTTTGTTTGGTTAA-3′PA8rev5′-CAATTTTATTCATACTACTCATG-3′CAT-RT55′-ATGGCAATGAAAGACGGTGAG-3′GMrev5′-AATTATTACGGTAAAACATCTTG-3′ Open table in a new tab The constructs pCAT-A0, p5′CAT-A0, p5′CAT-A1, and p5′CAT-A8 have been described previously (14Arnaud E.

Plasmids of the p5′CAT series were obtained by subcloning theBspEI-XbaI fragments obtained from plasmids of the pCAT series into p5′CAT-A0.

Plasmids pCAT-A2Δ1, pCAT-A2Δ2, and pCAT-A2Δ3 were obtained by subcloning the SpeI-Klenow-BspEI,NsiI-Klenow-BspEI, andEcoRV-BspEI fragments of pCAT-A2, respectively, between the BspEI-SmaI sites of pCAT-A0 (see Fig.3 B). Plasmids pCAT-dest208 and pCAT-dest334 were obtained by subcloning the SpeI-Klenow-XbaI andAvrII-Klenow-XbaI fragments of pCAT-A2, respectively, into pCAT-A0 digested by SmaI plusXbaI (AvrII, SpeI, NsiI, and EcoRV sites at positions 3114, 3233, 2726, and 1932 from the 5′-end of FGF-2 cDNA, respectively). TheBspEI-XbaI fragments from the pCAT series plasmids were subcloned into plasmid p5′CAT-A0 to obtain the corresponding 5′CAT plasmids. pCAT-destΔA and pCAT-destΔS were obtained by digestion of plasmid pCAT-dest by AflIII and SpeI, respectively, followed by religation (see Fig. 4). pCAT-A8Δdest was obtained by digestion of pCAT-A8 by AvrII plus BamHI, followed by Klenow treatment and religation. DNAs were obtained either by plasmid linearization or by PCR amplification using T3 tail-containing primers (for antisense RNAs). Transcription was performed with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase using transcription kits provided by Ambion Inc.: the mMESSAGE mMACHINETM kit was used for capped mRNAs, and the MAXIscriptTM or the MEGAscriptTM kit for uncapped and/or labeled RNAs. RNA transcripts were quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm and ethidium bromide staining on agarose gel, and their integrity was verified. The templates for T3 transcription of antisense RNAs against the dest element were obtained by PCR using primers RTA2 and PA2revT3 (Table I), followed by AflII,SpeI, or AvrII digestion (AS1, AS2, and AS3, respectively) (see Fig. 4). A piece of human skin obtained from the plastic surgery department of Rangueil Hospital (Toulouse, France) was washed for 15 min at 20 °C in six antibiotic/PBS baths (15 ml): 1) penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:50; 2) gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:750; 3) Bactrim (80 mg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a dilution of 1:660; 4) Cyflox (2 mg/ml; Bayer) at a dilution of 1:1000; 5) Fortum (333 mg/ml; Glaxo Wellcome) at a dilution of 1:1000; and 6) amphotericin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:100. The skin was cut into 1-mm2 pieces, which were left to dry in a Petri dish for 10 min. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin were added, and cultivation was pursued for 3–4 weeks until fibroblasts grew from the skin pieces, before trypsinization and seeding into new dishes (P0). The fibroblasts could then be used for seven passages. COS-7, HeLa, and SK-Hep-1 cells (see Ref. 24Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were transfected by the DMRIE-C method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 100 μl of serum-free medium containing 2 pmol of RNA (1–10 μg depending on RNA size) was mixed with 100 μl of serum-free medium containing 10 μl of DMRIE-C reagent. After addition of 0.8 ml of serum-free medium, the mixture was added to PBS-washed cells and incubated for 14 h at 37 °C. Primary human skin fibroblasts were electroporated using a Bio-Rad apparatus. PBS-washed cells were scraped, resuspended in 10% fetal calf serum-containing medium, and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was washed with PBS and centrifuged twice. Cells were resuspended in serum-free medium at a final concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. 400 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 2 pmol of RNA (1–10 μg) and transferred to a 4-mm electroporation cuvette. An electric shock of 260 V/950 microfarads was applied, and then the cells were seeded in medium-containing dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 12–16 h. Seven dishes (5 cm in diameter) were transfected with 1 μg of RNA/dish to measure mRNA stability. After incubation for 2 h, the RNA-containing medium was removed; the cells were washed with PBS; and fresh medium was added. The cells were harvested either immediately or after increasing periods of time (7.5–360 min). CAT activity determinations were performed as described previously (14Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega luciferase assay system. The cell monolayers (5 × 106 cells) were lysed in 0.5 or 1 ml of RNABle (Eurobio) in 60- or 90-mm dishes, respectively. Extraction was continued by adding 100 μl of chloroform/0.5 ml of RNABle and precipitating the aqueous phase with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol (15 min at 4 °C). After centrifugation, the pellets were rinsed with 75% ethanol. The RNA was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and checked for integrity by electrophoresis on agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. The cDNAs were synthesized using the SuperscriptTM preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out using 1 μg of total RNA and 50 ng of random hexamers in a final volume of 20 μl. Variable amounts of internal standard RNAs synthesized from the pKS-PA1Δ, pKS-PA2Δ, and pKS-PA8Δ plasmids (see above) were added to the reactions as described previously (24Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to quantify the different regions of the FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR. PCR was performed with the primer couple RTA1/PA1rev, RTA2/PA2rev, or RTA8/PA8rev, hybridizing upstream from the first, second, or eighth poly(A) site, respectively. The resulting fragments corresponded as follows: nt 737–1040, 3183–3441, and 6455–6763 of the FGF-2 cDNA, respectively. The PCR reactions were carried out using 0.5 units of Goldstar Taq DNA polymerase (Eurogentec) in a final volume of 50 μl, with variable amounts of cDNA (1 μl or less). The reaction was performed on a TrioThermoblock apparatus (Eurogentec) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min and then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and finally 72 °C for 5 min. Amplification results (one-fifth of the reactions) were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels (Tris borate/EDTA), followed by ethidium bromide staining. The intensity of the ethidium bromide luminescence was measured by image acquisition on a UV max apparatus (OSI), followed by image treatment with NIH Image software as described previously (24Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Poly(A) site utilization was analyzed in different cell types by quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNAs were purified from three transformed simian or human cell lines (COS-7, HeLa, and SK-Hep-1 cells) as well as from primary human skin fibroblasts. RT-PCR was performed as described in our previous report (24Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with internal standard RNAs and oligonucleotide primer couples specific to the region upstream from the first (A1), second (A2), and eighth (A8) poly(A) sites, respectively (Fig.1 A; see “Experimental Procedures”). We were able from the results to divide the FGF-2 mRNAs into three groups of messengers: (i) cleaved at A1, (ii) cleaved between A2 and A7, and (iii) cleaved at A8. As shown in Fig.1 B, COS-7 and HeLa cells exhibited 100 and 92% short mRNAs cleaved at A1, respectively, whereas skin fibroblasts exhibited 95.5% long mRNAs cleaved at A8. SK-Hep-1 cells showed a more heterogeneous profile, with 28, 49, and 23% of each mRNA species, respectively. The presence of 100% A1-cleaved mRNA was also checked by Northern blotting in COS-7 cells, thus ruling out the possibility of a bias in our quantification due to 3′-UTR species variability between monkeys and humans (data not shown). These data clearly indicate a regulation of the use of the poly(A) sites favoring the appearance of the longest 5823-nt-long 3′-UTR in skin fibroblasts and of the shortest and intermediary 3′-UTRs in the three transformed cell lines. The observed variations in the 3′-UTR length due to cell type-specific alternative polyadenylation prompted us to look for regulatory elements in the 5823-nt-long 3′-UTR of FGF-2 mRNA. To avoid interference from the alternative polyadenylation process and to analyze the expression of one mRNA species at a time, cell transfection was performed usingin vitro transcribed, capped, and polyadenylated mRNAs (25Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This procedure has been previously validated for mRNA half-life analysis in a study of the GM-CSF ARE (26Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19871-19876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with CAT mRNAs bearing five of the different FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTRs (measuring 83, 2390, 3073, 4446, and 5823 nt, respectively), fused or not to the leader region of FGF-2 mRNA (Fig. 2 A). CAT mRNA expression was first analyzed by CAT activity measurement (Fig. 2 B). CAT-A1 mRNA with the shortest 3′-UTR was efficiently expressed, in comparison to the CAT-A0 control, whereas CAT expression from A2, A3, A4 and A8 mRNAs was very inefficient. The same profiles were obtained in the presence of the FGF-2 mRNA leader (Fig. 2 B, 5′CAT series). This suggested the existence of an inhibitory element in the FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR between the first and second poly(A) sites. The half-lives of the different CAT mRNAs were measured to determine whether this inhibitory element was an RNA-destabilizing element or a translational silencer (Fig. 2 C). This analysis revealed a CAT-A1 mRNA half-life (110 min) similar to the CAT-A0 mRNA half-life (126 min), whereas a drastic shortening of the half-life was measured for CAT-A2, CAT-A3, CAT-A4, and CAT-A8 mRNAs (26, 25, 18, and 14 min, respectively). This demonstrated that the inhibitory element located between the first and second poly(A) sites was a destabilizing element. The same destabilizing effect was observed in the presence of the FGF-2 mRNA 5′-region, even though the 5′CAT mRNAs were slightly more stable than their CAT counterparts (Fig.2 C). CAT mRNAs half-lives were also measured in skin fibroblasts and HeLa and SK-Hep-1 cells (Fig. 2, D–F). The destabilizing element clearly shortened the mRNA half-life by 4-fold in all these cell types, as in COS-7 cells, thus indicating that the activity of the FGF-2 mRNA-destabilizing element was not cell type-specific. Prior to further characterization of the FGF-2 mRNA-destabilizing element, the possibility of a nonspecific destabilizing effect due to the large size of the 3′-UTR was considered by analyzing the effect of the 5823-nt-long 3′-UTR in a reverse orientation (Fig.3 A, CAT-3′inverted) on mRNA stability. The results showed that the CAT-A8-inverted mRNA, like the control CAT-A0, was four times more stable than the CAT-A8 mRNA, both in COS-7 cells and in skin fibroblasts, so the hypothesis of nonspecific effects generated by the unusual length of the 3′-UTR could be ruled out. The efficiency of the FGF-2 mRNA-destabilizing element was also compared with that of the well characterized GM-CSF ARE. COS-7 cells and skin fibroblasts were transfected with CAT mRNAs bearing the 3′-UTR of the GM-CSF mRNA, with or without its ARE (Fig.3 A, CAT-3′GM-CSF and CAT-3′GM-ΔAU). Measurement of the mRNA half-life showed that the GM-CSF ARE was able to reduce the CAT mRNA half-life, under our conditions, by a factor of 3 (Fig.3 A), in accordance with the report of Rajagopalan and Malter (26Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19871-19876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The FGF-2 mRNA-destabilizing element, which could shorten the mRNA half-life by a factor of 4, could thus be considered an efficient destabilizing element. The destabilizing element was then more precisely localized by a deletion approach (Fig. 3 B). RNA transfection of human skin fibroblasts showed that removal of the 208 nt upstream from the second poly(A) site abolished the destabilizing effect (Fig. 3 B, CAT-A2Δ1). However, this 208-nt-long fragment, when directly inserted 3′ of the CAT gene, was not sufficient to generate mRNA destabilization (CAT-dest208). In contrast, a fragment corresponding to the 334 nt upstream from the second poly(A) site was sufficient to induce the destabilizing effect (Fig. 3 B, CAT-dest334). Removal of this fragment (called DEST hereafter) from the complete FGF-2 3′-UTR also abolished RNA destabilization (Fig.4 C, A8Δdest). Examination of the DEST nucleotide sequence revealed the existence of two 122-nt-long direct repeats with 88% identity, 79% of which consisted of A and U residues. However, each of these repeats contained only a single AUUUA motif (Fig. 4 A), whereas AREs described in proto-oncogene and lymphokine mRNAs always contain reiterated AUUUA motifs (23Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1997; 18: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Deletions were therefore performed within the DEST element, and RNA transfection was carried out in skin fibroblasts as described above. The deletion of a 57-nt-long AflIII fragment corresponding to the 3′-part of the upstream repeat did not affect RNA destabilization (Fig. 4, B and C, destΔA), whereas the deletion of a 126-nt-long SpeI fragment, which removed a complete repeat, abolished the destabilizing effect (Fig. 4,B and C, destΔS). An alternative strategy was to cotransfect CAT mRNA with an excess of antisense RNAs targeting different parts of the DEST element. The results given in Fig. 4 D show that an antisense RNA targeting the complete DEST element was able to prevent RNA destabilization, whereas an antisense RNA directed against the CAT sequence had no effect (Fig. 4, B and D, AS3 and ASCAT). Furthermore, shorter antisense RNAs directed against part or all of the downstream repeat were also able to abolish the destabilizing effect (AS1 and AS2). These data show that the DEST element involves the two AU-rich direct repeats. Apparently both repeats, except for the 3′-part of the upstream repeat, are required and are responsible for the entire destabilizing effect of the long FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR. We show in this report that the length of the FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR is conditioned by a process of alternative polyadenylation, specific to the cell type. The proximal poly(A) sites seem to be preferentially used in three transformed cell lines, whereas the eighth poly(A) site is mostly used in primary skin fibroblasts, giving rise to the huge 5823-nt-long 3′-UTR. This regulation of alternative polyadenylation has consequences for the regulation of FGF-2 expression, as a destabilizing element, corresponding to two AU-rich tandem repeated sequences, has been localized between the first and second poly(A) sites. No study of FGF-2 mRNA half-life had been carried out up to now because of the technical difficulty of detecting the mRNA on Northern blots. Furthermore, the presence of several mRNA species resulting from alternative polyadenylation rendered interpretation very complex and prevented the expression of homogenous mRNAs after DNA transfection. The development and optimization of the RNA transfection procedure described here, novel for primary cells, were crucial in studying the expression of a single mRNA species in the absence of alternative polyadenylation. We provide the first evidence that a member of the ever-increasing FGF family is regulated at the level of mRNA stability by acis-acting element, the presence of which is controlled by alternative polyadenylation. Regulation of FGF-2 mRNA stability has been reported only in Xenopus, in which the gfgantisense RNA that induces FGF-2 mRNA destabilization by a process of RNA editing is involved (27Kimelman D. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1989; 59: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, the mammalian gfgmRNA, although present in cells, has never been shown to affect FGF-2 mRNA stability (28Murphy P.R. Knee R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that mammalian FGF-2 mRNA stability is regulated by a process similar to that controlling other cytokines and involving AU-rich elements. The AU-rich FGF-2 mRNA-destabilizing (DEST) element described here is unique. It does not contain the tandem AUUUA motifs described for most proto-oncogenes, cytokines, and growth factor mRNAs or the long U-rich region enhancing the destabilizing effect of AREs found in c-fos mRNA, for example (23Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1997; 18: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In fact, sequence comparison revealed homology of the FGF-2 DEST element to the interleukin-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor AREs, which are also unusual (29Henics T. Sanfridson A. Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5377-5383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Claffey K.P. Shih S.C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, neither of these destabilizing elements contains the 122-nt-long direct repeat observed for FGF-2 (Fig. 4). Evidence is provided here that the presence of AUUUA motifs is not sufficient to destabilize FGF-2 mRNA: the 3′-UTR contains 15 AUUUA motifs outside the DEST element, which do not influence mRNA decay (Fig. 4) (13Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.-C. Klagsbrun M. Lélias J.M. Liauzun P. Chalon P. Tauber J.P. Amalric F. Smith J.A. Caput D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the two AUUUA motifs located in the 5′-part of each repeat in the DEST element are unable to generate RNA instability by themselves and require the presence of tandem repeats for RNA destabilization. This raises the question of protein involvement in the regulation of FGF-2 ARE activity. The ARE-mediated destabilization mechanism, although still mechanistically unclear, involves RNA/protein interactions. At least 10 ARE-specific binding proteins have been identified to date, with different affinities for specific RNA sequences (23Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1997; 18: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nine of them are able to bind to the c-mycARE, and six of them are able to bind to poly(U); two of these proteins, AU-B and AU-C, are unable to bind to the c-myc ARE or poly(U). Interestingly, the AU-B protein binds to the interleukin-2 ARE (31Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inactivation of the vascular endothelial growth factor ARE, involved in hypoxia-induced mRNA stabilization, is correlated with the binding of three proteins with molecular masses of 17, 28, and 32 kDa (30Claffey K.P. Shih S.C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This supports the hypothesis that the FGF-2 DEST element could also be regulated by cellular protein binding. The requirement of both elements of the repeat for RNA destabilization suggests that the potential regulatory protein(s) has two binding sites in the DEST element; one possibility would be the cooperative binding of two protein molecules, only active as a dimer, to the DEST element. There are few examples in the literature of regulation involving processes of alternative polyadenylation coupled with RNA stability. One interesting case of inducible stability dependent on polyadenylation is provided by the glutaminase mRNA. This mRNA is expressed with two forms of 3′-UTR, the longer of which contains a pH-responsive stability element (32Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA stability is regulated by a hypoxia-controlled ARE located between two alternative polyadenylation sites (33Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The FGF-2 DEST element, located between the first and second poly(A) sites, could ensure a rapid turnover of the FGF-2 mRNA in cells presenting polyadenylation at A2 or downstream. The coupled polyadenylation and destabilization of FGF-2 mRNA in such a case could enable the cell to provide a rapid regulation change in response to exogenous stimuli. An interesting hypothesis is provided by the results in Fig. 1, which show that the shortest mRNA (cleaved at A1) is present in the three transformed cell lines (28–100%), but constitutes only 4.5% of the FGF-2 mRNA in primary skin fibroblasts. These results suggest that the FGF-2 mRNA can be destabilized in skin fibroblasts, but is stable in transformed cells, where it is devoid of the destabilizing element. We have shown in a previous report that FGF-2 expression is translationally regulated in normal skin fibroblasts, but constitutively expressed in transformed cell lines (SK-Hep-1 and HeLa) as well as in skin fibroblasts transformed by SV40 large T antigen (34Galy B. Maret A. Prats A.-C. Prats H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 165-171PubMed Google Scholar). The present data once again suggest that FGF-2 expression cannot be regulated in transformed cells, a feature that could be a cause or a consequence of the transformed phenotype. All these observations indicate that although FGF-2 expression undergoes transcriptional control, it is mostly regulated post-transcriptionally at three levels: mRNA polyadenylation, stability, and translation. The existence of several post-transcriptional regulations for a given mRNA renders the control of FGF-2 expression very stringent, which permits its expression only under relevant conditions. It also provides the possibility for untransformed cells to very rapidly modulate the level of FGF-2 expression in response to exogenous stimuli. The unlocking of these regulations may be one of the parameters responsible for cell transformation. We thank R. Couret for pictures and D. Warwick for English proofreading.

https://openalex.org/W2060597438,"Spheroplasts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae oxidize pyruvate at a high respiratory rate, whereas isolated mitochondria do not unless malate is added. We show that a cytosolic factor, pyruvate decarboxylase, is required for the non-malate-dependent oxidation of pyruvate by mitochondria. In pyruvate decarboxylase-negative mutants, the oxidation of pyruvate by permeabilized spheroplasts was abolished. In contrast, deletion of the gene (PDA1) encoding the E1α subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase did not affect the spheroplast respiratory rate on pyruvate but abolished the malate-dependent respiration of isolated mitochondria. Mutants disrupted for the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALD7) did not oxidize pyruvate unless malate was added. We therefore propose the existence of a mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass different from the cytosolic one, where pyruvate is decarboxylated to acetaldehyde in the cytosol by pyruvate decarboxylase and then oxidized by mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. This pathway can compensatePDA1 gene deletion for lactate or respiratory glucose growth. However, the codisruption of PDA1 andALD7 genes prevented the growth on lactate, indicating that each of these pathways contributes to the oxidative metabolism of pyruvate.

Pyruvate is a key intermediate in sugar metabolism. Three major pathways of pyruvate metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been described (for a review, see Ref. 1Pronk J.T. Steensma H. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1607-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). During fermentative growth, pyruvate is decarboxylated into acetaldehyde by pyruvate decarboxylase, which is, in its turn, reduced into ethanol in the cytosol by ADH1, one of the four known alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes (2Ciriacy M.

This sequence of reactions allows the reoxidation of NADH, which is produced at the level of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. During respiratory metabolism, pyruvate can enter the mitochondria by a specific carrier (4Briquet M. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1991; 1085: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this system works unidirectionally; i.e. acetyl-CoA can only move from the outside into inside (13Kispal G. Cseko J. Alkoyi I. Sandor A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, direct oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex does not require ATP hydrolysis, since the energy required for the thioester formation is provided by oxidation of the carbonyl into carboxyl groups (Fig. 1). It is generally assumed that in wild-type S. cerevisiae grown under glucose limitation, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is primarily responsible for pyruvate catabolism (14Van Urk H. Schipper D. Breedveld G.J. Mak P.R. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 191: 769-774Google Scholar). The pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass by cells reduces the net ATP yield. A deletion of the gene encoding the enzyme E1α of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex leads to complete loss of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. However, in aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures of this strain, pyruvate metabolism has been shown to be fully respiratory (15Pronk J.T. Wenzel T.J. Luttik M.A. Klaassen C.C. Scheffers W.A.

Biochem. 1992; 209: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the anaplerotic synthesis of oxaloacetate from pyruvate is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, an exclusively cytosolic enzyme, in contrast to many higher organisms in which this enzyme is mitochondrial (14Van Urk H. Schipper D. Breedveld G.J. Mak P.R. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 191: 769-774Google Scholar, 18Rohde M. Lim F. Wallace J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We recently observed that permeabilized yeast spheroplasts oxidized pyruvate at a high rate, while isolated mitochondria did not (19Averet N. Fitton V. Bunoust O. Rigoulet M. Guérin B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 67-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This respiration is now shown to be due to the oxidation by mitochondria of acetaldehyde produced in the cytosol; moreover, the pathway can compensate for the absence of functional mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Pyruvate decarboxylase, the key enzyme in alcoholic fermentation is operative under conditions in which alcoholic fermentation is absent. We propose that the acetaldehyde produced by this enzyme is oxidized by the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, allowing the reduction of NAD+ inside the matrix. The acetate produced can be converted into acetyl-CoA in the cytosol or excreted in the culture medium. The role of this pathway in ethanol metabolism is discussed. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were either the diploid PS194 (Yeast Foam, from the Slonimski laboratory) or the haploids listed in Table I. They were cultivated in rich yeast peptone medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.12% ammonium sulfate, pH 5) or yeast nitrogen base medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, pH 5) containing auxotrophic supplements for growth. Carbon sources used at a concentration of 2% were lactate, ethanol, glycerol, and glucose. Cells were grown in a New Brunswick incubator at 28 °C, and they were harvested in the logarithmic growth phase (20Guérin B. Labbe P. Somlo M.

The resulting vector was digested with BglII to delete a 2.618-kilobase pair fragment and replaced by the 1.096-kilobase pairBglII fragment carrying the yeast URA3 gene. The resulting vector interrupted by URA3 was then digested withEcoRI, giving a 2.245-kilobase pair fragment with ends identical to regions flanking PDA1. This fragment was used to construct a null mutant by the one-step gene replacement method of Rothstein (21Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 10: 202-211Crossref Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Gene deletion was verified by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Spheroplasts were prepared according to the enzymatic procedure described previously (20Guérin B. Labbe P. Somlo M.

The postmitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g, and the new one was submitted to the following steps of protein fractionation. Proteins were precipitated at 65% ammonium sulfate saturation. The pellet was suspended in the buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8, and dialyzed overnight against this buffer. The dialyzed fraction was loaded on a Mono Q column fast protein liquid chromatography system (MonoQ-HR 5/5; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with this buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m KCl. The concentrated active fraction (defined under “Results”) was loaded on a gel filtration Superose-12 HR 10/30 column. Elution was carried out with the buffer without added KCl. Fractions containing proteins were stored at −20 °C. All steps were performed at 4 °C and in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aminocaproic acid, and 10 mm para-aminobenzamidine). Oxygen consumption by isolated mitochondria and spheroplasts suspended in their isolation medium was measured at 28 °C in a 1.5-ml thermostatically controlled chamber equipped with a Clark oxygen electrode (Gilson) connected to a microcomputer giving an on-line display of rate values. Enzyme assays were carried out at 30 °C with an Eppendorf spectrophotometer at 334 nm. Pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) activity was assayed according to Ref. 14Van Urk H. Schipper D.

Malate in spheroplast extract was determined enzymatically with a malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.83) according to Bergmeyer (27Bergmeyer H.J. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed.

Pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from brewers yeast were purchased from Sigma. Malic enzyme and all other substrates and auxotrophic supplements were obtained from Sigma. Table IIcompares the respiration rates on different substrates between isolated mitochondria and permeabilized spheroplasts. ADP stimulated the respiration rate on spheroplasts as it did with isolated mitochondria, indicating that nystatin did not uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory values in the presence of ADP were also expressed as a percentage of ethanol respiratory rate. Indeed, the respiration of permeabilized spheroplasts on ethanol was due to oxidation inside the mitochondrial matrix, as for isolated mitochondria, since cytosolic NAD+ was diluted into the medium. The main result was the high respiration rate on pyruvate observed with permeabilized spheroplasts as compared with that observed with isolated mitochondria. It is known that mitochondria do not oxidize pyruvate unless malate is added, since the oxaloacetate produced by malate dehydrogenase reacts with acetyl-CoA, a potent inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase (6Kresze G.B. Ronft H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The spheroplast extract contained 30 ± 5 μm malate (determination on four different preparations), and the apparent affinity constant of the stimulation by malate of pyruvate respiration on isolated mitochondria was 125 ± 20 μm of malate. Therefore, it appears that the medium did not contain enough malate to explain the respiration on pyruvate. Moreover, Table II shows that malate addition stimulated the respiration on pyruvate, suggesting two kinds of spheroplast respiration on pyruvate: one dependent on malate and another not.Table IIComparison of respiratory rates between isolated mitochondria and permeabilized spheroplasts from PS194 strain incubated with different substratesSubstratesRespiratory ratePermeabilized spheroplastsPercentageIsolated mitochondriaPercentage−ADP+ADP−ADP+ADPnatom 0/min/mg protein%natom 0/min/mg protein%Ethanol76 ± 5144 ± 6100227 ± 20409 ± 45100Pyruvate65 ± 4110 ± 97614 ± 415 ± 44Malate6 ± 16 ± 1414 ± 312 ± 32Pyruvate + malate87 ± 4148 ± 810266 ± 883 ± 1520Mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) and spheroplasts (1 mg/ml) were incubated in the medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Permeabilization of spheroplasts was performed by incubation with 20 μg/ml nystatin for 10 min.

Open table in a new tab Mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) and spheroplasts (1 mg/ml) were incubated in the medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Permeabilization of spheroplasts was performed by incubation with 20 μg/ml nystatin for 10 min.

To compare the relative activities of spheroplasts and isolated mitochondria, the respiratory values (+ADP) were expressed as a percentage of ethanol respiratory rate. Experimental results are the average ± S.D. of measurements with at least four independent preparations. First, we tried to determine the step of mitochondrial preparation corresponding to the loss of the factor involved in respiration on pyruvate. This step corresponded to the first centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min), which led to the separation of the mitochondrial fraction from the cytosolic one. The cytosolic factor was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the activity was measured as its capacity to induce the respiration of isolated mitochondria on pyruvate. As shown in Fig. 2, the active fraction copurified with the pyruvate decarboxylase activity. The electrophoretic gel pattern of the partially purified active fraction showed a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa, corresponding to the monomer of pyruvate decarboxylase (data not shown). Moreover, respiration of isolated mitochondria with pyruvate as the sole substrate was induced by addition of commercial pyruvate decarboxylase: a respiration of 367 ± 35 nanoatoms of oxygen/min/mg of protein was determined in the presence of 2 mm ADP and 1 unit/ml enzyme, a value identical to the one obtained with a nonlimiting amount of ethanol (four independent determinations). These results could suggest that the pyruvate was first decarboxylated in the cytosol and that the acetaldehyde oxidized to acetate in the mitochondria. This interpretation was confirmed by the use of different mutants. Two structural genes, PDC1 and PDC5, encode pyruvate decarboxylase in yeast (28Hohmann S. Cederberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity is poorly affected or not affected by deletion of either of these genes but is undetectable in mutants lacking both PDC1 and PDC5 (28Hohmann S. Cederberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29Hohmann S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7669-7963Crossref Google Scholar). It is known that the double mutant cannot grow in rich medium with glucose, even in glucose-limited chemostat culture at a low dilution rate corresponding to a respiratory metabolism (30Flikweert M.T. van der Zanden L. Janssen W.M. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Yeast. 1996; 12: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We also observed that the double mutant was unable to grow on lactate as a carbon source unless acetate or ethanol were added (TableIII) as proposed previously for culture on glucose by Flikweert et al. (30Flikweert M.T. van der Zanden L. Janssen W.M. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Yeast. 1996; 12: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), who proposed that this inability of the pdc1Δ pdc5Δ mutant to grow on glucose is due to the need for C-2 compounds in lipid biosynthesis (30Flikweert M.T. van der Zanden L.

Open table in a new tab In the mutant T2–3C, PDA1 encoding the E1α subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase is disrupted (pda1Δ). The mutation leads to a complete loss of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (17Wenzel T.J. van den Berg M.A. Visser W. van den Berg J.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In agreement with a previous report on glucose-limited chemostat cultures (15Pronk J.T. Wenzel T.J. Luttik M.A. Klaassen C.C. Scheffers W.A. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this mutation had no significant effect on the specific growth rate on the different nonfermentable carbon sources tested (TableIII). In yeast cells, two kinds of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase have been characterized; one is Mg2+-activated (Mg2+-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase), NADP+-linked, and localized in the cytosol (8Dickinson F.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Meaden P.G. Dickinson F.M. Mifud A. Tessier W. Westwater J. Bussey H. Midgley M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the other is K+-activated (K+-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase), NAD(P)+-linked, and localized in the mitochondrial matrix (25Jacobson M.K. Bernofsky C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 350: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Keith A.B. Graham F.B. Biochem. J. 1977; 173: 787-798Google Scholar). The former is thought to be involved in cytosolic biosynthetic pathways (26Keith A.B. Graham F.B. Biochem. J. 1977; 173: 787-798Google Scholar). Recently, ALD7 coding for the mitochondrial enzyme was identified and interrupted in the strain RY271 by the HIS3 gene (31Tessier W.D. Meaden P.G. Dickinson F.M. Midgley M. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1998; 164: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We verified that the mitochondrial K+-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase was lacking in the mutant by measuring its activity in cells grown under different conditions. The growth of mutant ald7Δ on glucose or lactate was not affected, whereas growth on ethanol was severely impaired (Table III). In conclusion, mutants lacking either pyruvate dehydrogenase or mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity grow on lactate. However, the co-disruption of both PDA1 and ALD7genes abolishes the growth on lactate (Table III), showing that either K+- acetaldehyde dehydrogenase or pyruvate dehydrogenase is necessary for growth. We compared the respiratory rate on pyruvate of permeabilized spheroplasts from the different mutants used above with their parental isogenic strain. The respiratory rate of the pdc1Δ pdc5Δ double mutant was very low on pyruvate compared with that in the parental strain (TableIV); this respiratory rate was stimulated by malate, indicating that the unique pathway of pyruvate oxidation in the mutant is the pyruvate dehydrogenase tricarboxylic cycle pathway. In contrast, spheroplasts from the strain T2–3C lacking pyruvate dehydrogenase activity oxidized pyruvate, but the respiration was not stimulated by malate. Table IV shows that ald7Δ strain did not oxidize pyruvate unless malate was added, pointing to an essential role of the mitochondrial K+-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in the pyruvate oxidation process. The cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass cannot replace the mitochondrial one, since we observed that the addition of the different cofactors (NADP+, CoASH, and ATP) did not restore the respiratory rate on pyruvate.Table IVComparison of respiratory rates of the permeabilized spheroplasts with various substrates between mutants and their parental strainsStrainsRespiratory rateEthanolSuccinatePyruvateMalatePyruvate + malatenatom 0/min/mg proteinYSH6.36.-3 (PDC1 PDC5)125 ± 11130 ± 954 ± 67 ± 264 ± 10YSH4.136.-2D (pdc1::LEU2 pdc5::URA3)112 ± 991 ± 117 ± 18 ± 340 ± 6T2–3D (PDA1/PDA1)150 ± 10104 ± 7138 ± 108 ± 2162 ± 10T2–3C (pda1::Tn5ble/pda1::Tn5ble)120 ± 8100 ± 4124 ± 93 ± 1120 ± 8RY601 (ALD7)104 ± 472 ± 652 ± 74 ± 156 ± 9RY271 (ald7::HIS3)100 ± 574 ± 55 ± 15 ± 240 ± 5Respiratory activities were measured in the presence of 2 mm ADP; the other conditions are described in legend of Table II.

Open table in a new tab Respiratory activities were measured in the presence of 2 mm ADP; the other conditions are described in legend of Table II. Experimental results are the average ± S.D. of measurements with at least three independent spheroplast preparations. Taken together, these results indicate that the mitochondrial K+-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase pathway could be an alternative to pyruvate oxidation by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, as proposed in Fig. 3. Most of the experiments described in this paper were done with cells grown on lactate, a substrate that is a direct metabolic precursor of pyruvate. To establish whether growth under our conditions influenced the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, we determined their activities on cells grown on three nonfermentable carbon source cultures: 2% lactate, 2% glycerol, and 2% ethanol. The pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in crude cell extract interfered with pyruvate decarboxylase, a cytosolic enzyme. Therefore, we measured these activities on mitochondrial extract, and we did not observe a significant difference regardless of the carbon source used (Table V). The respiration of isolated mitochondria of yeast cells cultured under different conditions was measured as a function of pyruvate concentration in the presence of a fixed malate concentration. The results show that the affinity of mitochondria for pyruvate was approximately the same whatever the culture condition (Table V). The apparent affinity constant was about 0.4 mm, which is near the K m value reported for the isolated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (6Kresze G.B. Ronft H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and that for pyruvate transport by mitochondria (5Nalecz M.J. Nalecz K.A. Azzi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results show that malate-dependent pyruvate oxidation by mitochondria is not influenced by the carbon source (Table V). It should be noted that the respiratory rate on pyruvate is about 2-fold higher than the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, suggesting the contribution of other dehydrogenases of tricarboxylic acid cycle to respiration. Similarly, the level of activity of the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase did not depend on the nature of the nonfermentable carbon source. The comparison of these activities indicated that the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase was approximately 10-fold higher than pyruvate dehydrogenase and similar to the isolated mitochondria respiration on pyruvate, in the presence of the large excess of commercial pyruvate decarboxylase added in the medium (see above).Table VEffect of carbon source on pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity and on kinetic parameters of pyruvate oxidation by isolated mitochondria from PS194 strainCarbon source for growthKinetic parameters of respiration on pyruvateSpecific activityK mV maxPyruvate dehydrogenaseAcetaldehyde dehydrogenasemmnatom 0/min/mg proteinnmol/min/mg proteinYeast peptone lactate0.38 ± 0.1390 ± 1539 ± 8400 ± 35Yeast peptone glycerol0.43 ± 0.1570 ± 730 ± 7450 ± 55Yeast peptone ethanol0.46 ± 0.1960 ± 433 ± 5475 ± 59Respiratory rates by isolated mitochondria given below were measured in the presence of 2 mm ADP and 5 mm dl-malate.

The dehydrogenase activities were measured as reported under “Experimental Procedures” and in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Experimental results are the average ± S.D. of measurements with at least three independent mitochondrial isolations. The present results show that pyruvate can be oxidized inside mitochondria by a pathway involving the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. We propose to call this pathway the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass to distinguish it from the cytosolic one described by Pronk et al. (15Pronk J.T. Wenzel T.J. Luttik M.A. Klaassen C.C. Scheffers W.A. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). This system can compensate the absence of pyruvate dehydrogenase when yeast grow aerobically on glucose or lactate (two pyruvate-donating substrates) because of the production of both intramitochondrial NADH and acetate. Up to now, no acetyl-CoA synthetase in the mitochondrial matrix has been described. However, acetate can diffuse through the inner membrane, and acetyl-CoA formed in the cytosol may enter the mitochondria via the carnitine system to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle (12Kispal G. Sumegi B. Dietmeier K. Bock I. Gajdos G. Tomesanyi T. Sandor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1824-1829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet the pyruvate mitochondrial bypass does not seem to be essential when pyruvate dehydrogenase is functional. Recently, Tessieret al. (31Tessier W.D. Meaden P.G. Dickinson F.M. Midgley M. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1998; 164: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that deletion of ALD7renders the yeast unable to grow on ethanol. It has previously been reported that deletion of the gene encoding the mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH3) does not prevent growth on ethanol, suggesting a cytosolic metabolism for that alcohol under these conditions (32Lutstorf U. Megnet R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports suggest that the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase is necessary for growth on ethanol despite a lack of mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase. We can postulate that growth on ethanol required intramitochondrial oxidative metabolism, although the cytosolic NADH is oxidized by the NADH-dehydrogenase at the cytosolic side of inner membrane (33Small W.C. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Luttik M.A.H. Overkamp K.M. Kötter P. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24529-24534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). When ADH3 is deleted, the acetaldehyde produced in the cytosol by alcohol dehydrogenase is oxidized, at least partly, in the mitochondria by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Since the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate by the NAD+-linked acetaldehyde dehydrogenase is a very exergonic reaction, this pathway should be sufficiently active to allow a growth on ethanol. On the contrary, growth of the ald7 mutant on ethanol was poor, since acetaldehyde accumulation limits the mitochondrial ethanol oxidation. Moreover, it has already been shown that both cytosolic and mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenases are required for growth on ethanol, with neither being able to suppress the loss of the other (31Tessier W.D. Meaden P.G. Dickinson F.M. Midgley M. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1998; 164: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, it appears that if the cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase is necessary for biosynthesis (15Pronk J.T. Wenzel T.J. Luttik M.A. Klaassen C.C. Scheffers W.A. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial one is required for the bioenergetic pathway for growth on ethanol.

To identify components of the signal transduction pathway from the outer membrane-localized TspO to the DNA-active transcription factor(s), we examined the involvement of TspO in the regulation of tetrapyrrole metabolism in R. sphaeroides. By analyzing the tetrapyrrole pigments accumulated by resting cell suspensions of R. sphaeroides, we demonstrated that TspO negatively regulates the activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase in this bacterium. hemN, encoding one of the isoenzymes of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase ofR. sphaeroides, provided in trans to the wild type strain, produced a TSPO1 mutant phenotype by abolishing the negative effect of TspO on the transcription of the photosynthesis genes, crtI and puc. It is proposed that TspO, by regulating the exit of certain tetrapyrrole intermediates of the heme/bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathways in R. sphaeroides in response to the availability of molecular oxygen, causes the accumulation of a biosynthetic intermediate that serves as a corepressor for both specific pigment gene transcription and thepuc operon. The relationship between the bacterial TspO and the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor is discussed.

The relationship between the bacterial TspO and the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor is discussed. Rhodobacter sphaeroides is a facultative phototrophic bacterium capable of growth both aerobically and anaerobically (photosynthetically). Decreased oxygen tension induces the development of the intracytoplasmic membrane system, which harbors all the components of the photosynthetic apparatus. Several regulatory systems have been identified in R. sphaeroides that govern the synthesis and/or assembly of the components of the intracytoplasmic membrane system (1Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Gomelsky M. Eraso J.M. Yeliseev A. O'Gara J. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these, the tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) has been demonstrated to modulate the synthesis of the structural polypeptides of the B800–850 photosynthetic antenna complex as well as the photopigments, bacteriochlorophyll, and carotenoids, in response to variations in oxygen tension and/or light intensity. TspO has been shown to negatively affect the transcription of specific bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis genes as well as thepuc operon under aerobic, semiaerobic, or photosynthetic conditions (2Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Using polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified protein, TspO has been shown to reside in the outer membrane of R. sphaeroides, similar to the localization of its mammalian homolog pk18, a drug-binding component of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR). 1The abbreviations used are: MBR, mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; kb, kilobase(s); ALA, aminolevulinic acid; PBG, porphobilinogen1The abbreviations used are: MBR, mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; kb, kilobase(s); ALA, aminolevulinic acid; PBG, porphobilinogen Although the precise biological role of MBR is not yet understood, this receptor was shown to take part in the regulation of a number of metabolic activities in mammalian cells including steroidogenesis, heme biosynthesis, and mitochondrial respiratory control (3Krueger K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 453-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone of the rat pk18 gene, when expressed in R. sphaeroidesTSPO1 cells, functionally substituted for the bacterial homolog, negatively affecting the expression of the crtI gene, involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, and puc operon, encoding the polypeptides of the peripheral light harvesting complex (LH2). These results suggested that TspO is both evolutionarily and functionally related to the mammalian MBR and indicated the possibility that in both mammalian and bacterial cells these proteins are involved in similar metabolic activities (4Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The cellular localization of TspO and its effect upon transcription of a number of photosynthesis genes in R. sphaeroides pose a question concerning the pathway and mechanism of signal transduction from this outer membrane-localized receptor to the regulated DNA-bound transcription factors. Useful information on the possible mechanism of TspO activity is provided by studies of the mammalian MBR. Because MBR binds with nanomolar affinity to a variety of benzodiazepines as well as to the dicarboxylic porphyrins, it was proposed to be involved in the regulation of the heme biosynthetic pathway, controlling the flow of tetrapyrrole intermediates across the mitochondrial membrane (5Taketani S. Kohno H. Okuda M. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7527-7531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Taketani S. Kohno H. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. J. Biochem.

Matthews E.K. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As such we focused our attention on the pathways for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in R. sphaeroides. In the present study we provide further insight into the mechanism of the biological activity of this receptor by demonstrating that TspO appears to affect the activity of hemN-encoded coproporphyrinogen III oxidase ofR. sphaeroides and thereby negatively regulates the expression of specific photosynthesis genes by causing the accumulation of a specific corepressor molecule. Fig. 1 depicts the organization of the heme biosynthetic pathway in mammalian cells. It has been proposed that 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), formed in the mitochondrion, is exported to the cytoplasm where it is converted to coproporphyrinogen via porphobilinogen (PBG) and uroporphyrinogen III (10Granick S. Goodwin T.W. Biochemistry of Chloroplast. Academic Press, New York1967: 373-410Google Scholar). Coproporphyrinogen III then re-enters the mitochondrion, where it is converted subsequently to protoporphyrinogen IX, protoporphyrin IX, and heme. Although the mitochondrially localized biosynthesis of ALA and the conversion of coproporphyrinogen to heme are well documented, little is known about the mechanism of intracellular transport of coproporphyrinogen. It has been proposed that MBR may play a role in this process (7Rebeiz N. Arkins S. Kelley K.W. Rebeiz C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, our studies on the TspO-mediated regulation of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in R. sphaeroidesmay help to shed light on the function of this receptor in mammalian cells. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. Cultures ofR. sphaeroides 2.4.1 and its derivatives were grown in Sistrom's minimal medium A containing 0.4% succinate as a carbon source (11Cohen-Bazire G. Sistrom W.R. Stanier R.Y. J. Cell. Comp.

Aerobic cells were grown in 200-ml glass bottles filled with 100 ml of medium, under continuous sparging with a mixture of gases 78% N2/20% O2/2% CO2. Semiaerobic cells were grown by sparging gas mixture of 96% N2/2% O2/2% CO2.

To minimize tetracycline photooxidation (13Martin Jr., J.P. Colina K. Logsdon N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2516-2522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), liquid cultures of R. sphaeroides grown photoheterotrophically in the presence of tetracycline were placed behind a CS7–69 filter (620–1100 nm; Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY). Strains of Escherichia coli were grown as described previously (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). When appropriate, antibiotics were added to the following final concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 25 μg/ml; spectinomycin, 50 μg/ml; streptomycin, 50 μg/ml; and tetracycline, 10 μg/ml for E. coli, 1 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides. Conjugal matings between E. coli andR. sphaeroides were performed as described by Moore and Kaplan (15Moore M.D. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R. sphaeroides cultures were grown to a cell density of approximately 1.8 × 108 cells/ml, and chloramphenicol was added to a final concentration of 80 μg/ml to terminate protein synthesis. Assay of β-galactosidase activity in cell extracts was performed as described previously (15Moore M.D. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments involving β-galactosidase assay were performed at least twice, with results being reproducible to within ± 15%. R. sphaeroides cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C) and disrupted by sonication for 5 min (50% duty cycle). Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (30 min, 30,000 × g, 4 °C). Absorption spectra were analyzed with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. Equivalent protein concentrations of the cleared lysate were used when the spectral profiles of different strains of R. sphaeroides were compared. For the analysis of pyridine spectra, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in alkaline pyridine (pyridine: 0.1n NaOH, 2:1 v/v). After incubation for 10 min in the dark, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and analyzed spectrophotometrically. Extinction coefficients for the porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were used as reported previously (16Falk J.E. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. B. B. A. Library 2, Elsevier, Amsterdam1964Google Scholar). R. sphaeroides cells were grown either aerobically or photosynthetically to a cell density of approximately 1.8 × 108 cells/ml, harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 10,000 × g, 10 °C), washed with 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer containing 80 μg/ml chloramphenicol to terminate protein synthesis. HPLC analysis of the tetrapyrrole pigments accumulated by resting cells of R. sphaeroides was performed according to the method described previously (17Rossi E. Curnow D.H. Lim C.K. HPLC of Small Molecules: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 261-313Google Scholar). Cells were separated by centrifugation (15 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the pH level of the supernatant was adjusted to 3.5 with 6 n HCl. Talc powder was added (1 g/100 ml) to the supernatant, and the suspension was vigorously shaken for 30 min. The talc was than collected by filtration and washed with water, and the porphyrin pigments were eluted with a mixture of acetone and 0.1 n HCL (9:1 v/v). Eluates were dried under vacuum, and pigments were stored at −80 °C prior to further analysis. HPLC analysis of pigments was performed with a Shimadzu SCL-10A HPLC system equipped with an SPD-M10AV diode array detector. Pigments were separated on a SAS Hypersil (Keystone Scientific Inc, Belleforte, PA) reversed-phase column (150 × 4.6 mm) using a gradient elution system as described (18Lim C.K.J.M.R. Wright D.J.

Analysis of the magnesium and iron content in the isolated metalloporphyrins was done using atomic absorption spectroscopy at the Analytical Chemistry Center at The University of Texas Medical School. Analysis of the enzymatic activities of ALA synthase, ALA dehydratase, and PBG deaminase was conducted as described earlier (20Araujo L.S. Lombardo M.E. Rossetti M.V. Battle A. Comp. Biochem.

DNA sequencing was performed with an ABI 373A automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) at the DNA Core Facility of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. Plasmid pUI 2730 was constructed by introducing a 1.6-kb HindIII-BamHI fragment of pUI2080 containing hemN with the upstream promoter region into the HindIII-BamHI sites of the broad host range expression vector pRK415. Plasmid pUI2731 was constructed by introducing a 1.1-kb HindIII-Asp718 fragment of pUI1124 containing tspO under PrrnB into the pUI2080 digested with HindIII-Asp718.

Restriction endonucleases and nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antibiotics, ALA, PBG, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside,o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and vitamins were obtained from Sigma. Porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were purchased from Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT). [14C]Coproporphyrin was from Leeds Radioporphyrins (Leeds, UK). R. sphaeroides cells accumulate only minute amounts of free porphyrins when grown in minimal Sistrom's medium aerobically in the dark or anaerobically (photosynthetically). Our preliminary studies revealed no significant differences in the accumulation of heme pigments by either the wild type or TSPO1 cells grown under these conditions. We previously reported, however, elevated levels of bacteriochlorophyll in TSPO1 cells grown semiaerobically (2Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which could be accounted for by the increased transcription of the respective bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis genes in the TSPO1 cells. Thus, to study the possible effect(s) of TspO on the early steps in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles, common to both hemes and bacteriochlorophylls, it was necessary to create conditions that would result in an increased flow of the tetrapyrrole intermediates along the pathway. This was achieved by addition of exogenous ALA, a common biosynthetic precursor of all tetrapyrroles. It has been repeatedly demonstrated in this laboratory 2J. Zeilstra-Ryalls, A. Yeliseev, and S. Kaplan, unpublished data. that addition of exogenous ALA to growing R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 cells leads to a marked inhibition of growth under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Prolonged incubation of the cells in the presence of exogenous ALA (concentrations in the range 0.02–1 mm) can lead to the accumulation and enrichment of spontaneous mutations, many of which are altered in pigment biosynthesis. To avoid these undesirable effects of ALA, experiments were conducted using resting cell suspensions of R. sphaeroides. Wild type or TSPO1 cells were grown aerobically, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were challenged with 0.02–0.1 mm ALA followed by incubation for 4–8 h. Following incubation, cells were collected by centrifugation, and endogenous and exogenous tetrapyrrole pigments were analyzed separately. Differences between the wild type and TSPO1 mutant cells in the accumulation of endogenous tetrapyrrole pigments are demonstrated by the absorption spectra of the alkaline pyridine extracts. Tetrapyrroles accumulated in wild type cells exhibited an aethio-type spectrum with the Soret maximum at 402–404 nm, characteristic of free porphyrins (Fig. 2). HPLC analysis of these pigments demonstrated that they were represented by a mixture of uro-, copro-, and protoporphyrin as well as some small amounts of hemes and other metalloporphyrins (Results not shown). The pigments extracted from the mutant TSPO1 cells produced a spectrum with a maximum at 423 nm with a shoulder at 404 nm, as well as two other peaks of lower amplitude, 549 and 587 nm, characteristic of the magnesium-containing protoporphyrins or monomethyl ester of the magnesium-protoporphyrin. Oxidized (air) and reduced (sodium dithionite) spectra of these pigments are identical to that of an authentic magnesium-protoporphyrin (not shown). The introduction of the tspO gene in trans(approximately five copies) under a strong rrnB promoter into the TSPO1 strain led to a marked decrease in the accumulation of tetrapyrrole pigments from exogenously supplied ALA, well below the levels observed for the wild type or TSPO1 mutant cells. Theinset in Fig. 2 shows the relative levels of TspO in the outer membranes of the various cell types used in this study. The dramatic decrease in the accumulation of tetrapyrrole pigments by the TSPO1 (pUI2701) inversely correlates with the significant increase of TspO levels in these cells. On the other hand, wild type cells containing the “physiological” concentration of TspO were characterized by relatively higher amounts of accumulated free porphyrins than found in the TSPO1 cells (Fig. 2). Therefore, it appears that depending upon the levels of normal TspO in the outer membrane, it can either positively (when present at low levels) or negatively (when present at very high levels) affect the accumulation of tetrapyrroles in the cells. But what is clear is that in the absence of TspO, cells accumulate considerably less porphyrins than found in the wild type. HPLC analysis of the pigments accumulated in the culture supernatant demonstrated that wild type cells excreted predominantly uroporphyrin III and I as well as the decarboxylation products (Fig.3). The total amount of porphyrin pigments excreted from the mutant cells was 30–35% of that of the wild type cells. The mutant TSPO1 cells excreted almost exclusively coprpoporphyrin (III and I), as well as magnesium-coproporphyrin. Magnesium-coproporphyrin was identified by HPLC and by electronic absorbance spectra. The presence of magnesium in this metalloporphyrin was supported by the results of atomic absorption analysis (results not shown). Mutant TSPO1 cells harboring the tspO gene in trans under the rrnB promoter accumulated significantly lower amounts of porphyrin pigments (∼7–8% of that of the wild type accumulation) in the culture supernatants, consistent with the decreased accumulation of endogenous tetrapyrroles in these cells. A similar effect of the tspO gene in trans was observed when pUI2701 was introduced in the wild type cells (results not shown). Exogenous pigments were represented by magnesium-coproporphyrin, coproporphyrin, as well as other decarboxylation products of uroporphyrinogen. Therefore it appears that the presence of increased levels of normal TspO in the outer membrane inversely affects the ability of R. sphaeroides cells to excrete porphyrin pigments. On the other hand, wild type cells excreted significantly more porphyrins into the supernatant than the cells devoid of TspO. These results correlate with the differential accumulation of tetrapyrroles in R. sphaeroides cells, depending on the levels of TspO in the outer membrane (Fig. 2). The results suggest that when TspO is present in cells in concentrations not exceeding certain physiological levels, this protein positively affects the efflux of tetrapyrroles from the cells. When the tspO gene is provided in multicopy and expressed from the strong rrnB promoter, the levels of this protein in the outer membrane increase dramatically (our estimates show about an 30–50-fold increase over the levels observed in the wild type cells). When present at such high concentrations, TspO inversely affects the efflux of tetrapyrroles and behaves more like a TspO mutant strain. Such an effect could be explained by the presence of excess TspO engaging in “interactions” that are not conducive to normal TspO function. It had been demonstrated previously that deprivation of methionine limits bacteriochlorophyll synthesis in R. sphaeroides, because the methylation of magnesium-protoporphyrin involvesS-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor (24Gibson K.D. Neuberger A. Tait G.H. Biochem. J. 1963; 88: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Lascelles J. Hatch T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 98: 712-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In wild type R. sphaeroides, limitation of methionine can be achieved by the addition of threonine, which inhibits its formation at the stage of homoserine dehydrogenase (26Gibson J.D. Neuberger A. Tait G.H. Biochem. J. 1962; 84: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the effect of threonine upon the accumulation of tetrapyrroles by the wild type and TSPO1 cells. The results summarized in Fig.4 indicated that threonine had no appreciable effect on the wild type 2.4.1 cells upon the accumulation of porphyrins from exogenously supplied ALA. However, when threonine was added to a suspension of TSPO1 cells, challenged with ALA, the composition of the accumulated tetrapyrroles in these cells was severely affected, as judged by the absorption spectra of the pyridine extract. The total absorption increased 2.5-fold, and the peak maximum shifted from 423 to 409 nm with a shoulder at 406 nm, indicating a decrease in the accumulation of magnesium-protoporphyrin and an increase in the amounts of free porphyrins, namely protoporphyrin IX, which is characterized with an absorption maximum at 409 nm in alkaline pyridine. These observations were additionally supported by HPLC analysis of the tetrapyrrole pigments extracted from the cells (TableII). Uroporphyrin and its decarboxylation products (hepta-, hexa-, and penta-carboxylic porphyrins) constituted the majority of the tetrapyrrole pigments accumulated by wild type cells. These cells also contained small amounts of coproporphyrin III and magnesium-containing porphyrins. In contrast, mutant TSPO1 cells accumulated predominantly early intermediates of the bacteriochlorophyll branch of the pathway, magnesium-protoporphyrin and magnesium-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester. The addition of threonine to the TSPO1 cells challenged with 0.2 mm ALA led to the decreased proportion of magnesium-containing porphyrins and increased amounts of protoporphyrin and early decarboxylation products of uroporphyrinogen III.Table IIEffect of threonine on the accumulation of tetrapyrrole pigments by R. sphaeroides cellsStrainAdditionsTotal porphyrinsUroporphyrin and its decraboxylation products, coproporphyrinProtoporphyrinMagnesium-proto, magnesium-proto-monomethyl esterμg/ml%%%2.4.1threonine0.08026721ALA6.81985141ALA + threonine5.53479182TSPO1threonine0.05428683ALA2.56372269ALA + threonine5.991106721 Open table in a new tab To obtain further insight into the mechanism of TspO involvement into tetrapyrrole metabolism, we studied the accumulation of porphyrins and metalloporphyrins in R. sphaeroides cells incubated in the presence of PBG, the next (after ALA) common intermediate of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway.

In a series of studies with deletion mutants in this region, the ten arginine-rich amino acids (amino acids 369–378) were identified as the site of interaction. The interaction was confirmed by specific co-immunoprecipitation of gC1q-R with full-length α1B-adrenergic receptors expressed on transfected COS-7 cells, as well as by fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy, which showed co-localization of these proteins in intact cells. Interestingly, the α1B-adrenergic receptors were exclusively localized to the region of the plasma membrane in COS-7 cells that expressed the α1B-adrenergic receptor alone, whereas gC1q-R was localized in the cytoplasm in COS-7 cells that expressed gC1q-R alone; however, in cells that co-expressed α1B-adrenergic receptors and gC1q-R, most of the α1B-adrenergic receptors were co-localized with gC1q-R in the intracellular region, and a remarkable down-regulation of receptor expression was observed. These observations suggest a new role for the previously identified complement regulatory molecule, gC1q-R, in regulating the cellular localization and expression of the α1B-adrenergic receptors. gC1q-R, a multifunctional protein, was found to bind with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the α1B-adrenergic receptor (173 amino acids, amino acids 344–516) in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library prepared from the rat liver.

G protein-coupled receptors interact with several classes of cytoplasmic proteins including heterotrimeric G proteins, kinases, phosphatases, and arrestins, and the binding of cytoplasmic protein with the receptor regulates receptor signaling (1Sterne M.R.

Very recently, however, several unexpected interactions between cytoplasmic proteins and receptors have been observed; for instance, the adrenergic receptor interacts with the α-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (9Klein U.

These raise the possibility that receptors may interact with other types of cellular proteins that could play unanticipated roles in regulating the function of the receptor.We conducted a search for novel proteins that interact with the α1B-adrenergic receptor, specifically focusing on the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain, because mutations within this domain have pleiotropic effects on receptor physiology (11Valiquette M.

These results suggest that gC1q-R plays a role in the regulation of the subcellular localization as well as the function of α1B-adrenergic receptors.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe yeast two-hybrid system (17Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar, 18Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) was used to identify candidate cellular proteins that interact with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the hamster α1B-adrenergic receptor. The screening of approximately 2 × 107 transformants resulted in the isolation of eleven independent clones that interacted specifically with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the α1B-adrenergic receptor. Sequence analysis revealed that all eleven clones encoded the same polypeptide, gC1q-R (EBI data base AJ001102) (19Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 20Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); two clones encoded the full-length gC1q-R, whereas the remaining nine clones encoded gC1q-R from the 26th residue to beyond the stop codon. The gC1q-R open reading frame encodes a prepro-protein of 279 amino acid residues (Fig.1 A). The mature protein is preceded by a 13-residue-long leader peptide, which probably contains the signal peptide. The precise function of the 57 residues immediately preceding the mature protein has not been determined, but is predicted to play a role in cellular translocation. The mature protein is presumed to be generated by site-specific cleavage and removal during post-translational processing. We, therefore, constructed the prepro form of gC1q-R (gC1qR), the amino terminus fragment cleaved from prepro gC1q-R (gC1qR1), and the mature form of gC1q-R (gC1qR71) by PCR and compared the binding of each construct with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the α1B-adrenergic receptor in the yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 1 B, both the prepro form and mature form of gC1q-R, but not the amino-terminal fragment, were found to interact with the α1B-adrenergic receptor; however, the prepro form of gC1q-R (gC1qR) interacted with the α1B-adrenergic receptor to a much lesser degree than the mature form of gC1q-R (gC1qR71).We next examined the interaction between the α1B-adrenergic receptor and gC1q-R in vivo. Both gC1qR and gC1qR71 were epitope-tagged with HA at the carboxyl terminus (gC1qR/HA and gC1qR71/HA), and the α1B-adrenergic receptor was transiently co-expressed with either gC1qR/HA or gC1qR71/HA in COS-7 cells. The cell lysate was then immunoprecipitated with the anti-α1B-adrenergic receptor polyclonal antibody and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2). Anti-α1B-adrenergic receptor antibody coprecipitated gC1qR and gC1qR71 only in the cells that co-expressed the α1B-adrenergic receptor, demonstrating in vivothat the α1B-adrenergic receptor interacts with gC1q-R (Fig. 2). Furthermore, in the cells transfected with the full-length gC1q-R cDNA and in the cells transfected with gC1qR71, a 32-kDa protein was detected, indicating that the HA-tagged prepro-gC1q-R was efficiently processed to the mature form in the COS-7 cells (Fig. 2). Taken together with the results from the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig.1) and immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 2), the mature form of gC1q-R (gC1qR71) rather than prepro-gC1q-R (gC1qR) is considered to bind more efficiently with the α1B-adrenergic receptor. Therefore, in the following experiments, we examined the interaction of gC1qR71 with the α1B-adrenergic receptor.Figure 2Interaction of the α1B-adrenergic receptor with gC1qR.COS-7 cells were transfected with the expression vector gC1qR (lane 1 and 2) or gC1qR71 (lanes 3–6) with (lanes 1-4) or without α1B-adrenergic receptor (lanes 5 and6). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or without (lanes 2, 4, and 6) anti-α1B-adrenergic receptor polyclonal antibody at 4 °C overnight. The samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody.

AR, adrenergic receptor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Furthermore, to search the site of interaction within the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the α1B-adrenergic receptor (α1B-AR), which interacts with gC1qR71, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the α1B-adrenergic receptor. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the hamster α1B-AR344–516 (amino acids 344–516) that we had used as a bait contains the NPXXY motif at amino acids 344–348, which is highly conserved among G protein-coupled receptors, the putative acidic/dihydrophobic sequence motif (amino acids 349–364), which was recently shown to mediate cell surface delivery of a vasopressin receptor (21Schulein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the arginine-rich region (amino acids 371–378). Thus, we constructed thirteen truncated forms of the α1B-adrenergic receptor carboxyl-terminal tail as shown in Fig. 3 A and compared the binding of each construct with gC1qR71 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 3 B, gC1qR71 could bind with the α1B-adrenergic receptor carboxyl-terminal tail that contains the arginine-rich region.Figure 3Two-hybrid assay of gC1qR with carboxyl-terminal truncated α1B-adrenergic receptor. A, constructs of fourteen carboxyl-terminal truncated α1B-adrenergic receptors (numbers denote amino acid residues of the α1B-adrenergic receptor primary sequence).

After incubation, the level of β-galactosidase activity of three colonies was analyzed employing a colony-lift filter assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate. AR, adrenergic receptor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we examined the subcellular localization of the α1B-adrenergic receptor (FLAG-tagged α1B-adrenergic receptor) using a fluorescent antibody, as well as the endogenous fluorescence (gC1qR71/GFP) by fluorescent confocal microscopy. As seen in Fig. 4(A, C, E, H, andK) immunocytochemical analysis of cells transiently transfected with only FLAG-tagged α1B-adrenergic receptor showed that the fluorescence distribution was typical of that of a plasma membrane-labeling pattern (Fig. 4 A, red by Cy3). The fluorescence distribution of gC1qR71/GFP in cells transiently transfected with only gC1qR71/GFP was characteristic of that of a cytoplasmic distribution (enhanced perinuclear fluorescence) (Fig. 4,middle, green by GFP). In COS-7 cells transfected with both gC1qR71/GFP and FLAG-tagged α1B-adrenergic receptor, a marked change in the subcellular localization of α1B-adrenergic receptor was observed; the α1B-adrenergic receptor was co-localized with gC1qR71/GFP in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 G). Furthermore, a remarkable decrease in the fluorescent signal of FLAG-tagged α1B-adrenergic receptor was observed in these cells, compared with that in the cells expressing only FLAG-tagged α1B-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 4, E andG). Further, as shown in Fig. 4, K-M, in COS-7 cells transfected with both gC1qR71/GFP and FLAG/α1B-T378-adrenergic receptor, a similar change in cellular localization of the FLAG-tagged α1B-adrenergic receptor as seen in COS-7 cells transfected with both gC1qR71/GFP and the FLAG-tagged α1B-adrenergic receptor (Fig.4 G) was observed; however, the FLAG/α1B-T368-adrenergic receptor, which lacked the amino acid region 379–516, was found not to be co-localized with gC1qR71/GFP (Fig. 4, H-J), confirming the results of the yeast two-hybrid assays that gC1qR71 could interact with the α1B-adrenergic receptor carboxyl-terminal tail that contains the arginine-rich region.Figure 4Co-localization of gC1qR71 with α1B-adrenergic receptors. COS-7 cells were transfected with the carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length α1B-adrenergic receptor (α1B-adrenergic receptor/FLAG) alone (A andB), gC1qR71/GFP alone (C and D), α1B-adrenergic receptor/FLAG and gC1qR71/GFP (E-G), FLAG/α1B-T368-adrenergic receptor and gC1qR71/GFP (H-J), or FLAG/α1B-T378-adrenergic receptor and gC1qR71/GFP (K-M), and immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells transfected with the α1B-adrenergic receptor/FLAG were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, stained with Cy-3-labeled anti-mouse antibody, and observed using the redfluorescence channel (A, C, E, H, and K). GFP fluorescence was observed using the green fluorescence channel to detect gC1qR71/GFP (B, D, F, I, andL). In cells transfected with α1B-adrenergic receptor/FLAG alone, the α1B-adrenergic receptor was distributed over the cell surface (A and E), whereas in cells transfected with gC1qR71 alone, gC1qR71 was localized throughout the cytoplasm (D and F). In cells co-transfected with α1B-adrenergic receptor/FLAG and gC1qR71/GFP or FLAG/α1B-T378-adrenergic receptor and gC1qR71/GFP, α1B-adrenergic receptors were co-localized with gC1qR71 throughout the cytoplasm, as shown in yellow in the two-color merged image (G and M); however, in cells co-transfected with FLAG/α1B-T368-adrenergic receptor and gC1qR71/GFP, α1B-adrenergic receptors were found not to be co-localized with gC1qR71 (J).

AR, adrenergic receptor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the carboxyl-terminal FLAG/GFP-tagged α1B-adrenergic receptor (α1B-adrenergic receptor/GFP), we further examined the effect that gC1qR71 has on the subcellular localization of the α1B-adrenergic receptor upon co-transfection. GFP fusion in this manner does not perturb normal ligand binding nor the subcellular localization of α1B-adrenergic receptor (22Awaji T. Hirasawa A. Kataoka M. Shinoura H. Nakayama Y. Sugawara T. Izumi S. Tsujimoto G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1099-1111PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analysis of GFP fluorescence enables us to detect the α1B-adrenergic receptors. Cells transfected with the α1B-adrenergic receptor/GFP and gC1qR71/HA were examined by flow cytometry. In cells transfected with the α1B-adrenergic receptor/GFP alone and in cells co-transfected with the α1B-adrenergic receptor/GFP and gC1qR71/HA, approximately 10–20% of the COS-7 cells were positively detected as having GFP-associated fluorescence, indicating successful transfection with α1B-adrenergic receptor/GFP (Fig. 5 A). However, as shown in Fig. 5 A, the GFP fluorescence of cells, which co-expressed the α1B-adrenergic receptor/GFP and gC1qR71, was significantly lower than the GFP fluorescence of cells, which expressed only α1B-adrenergic receptor/GFP. The mean value of the fluorescence intensity of GFP in cells co-expressing α1B-adrenergic receptor/GFP and gC1qR71 was 87% lower than that in the cells expressing only the α1B-adrenergic receptor-GFP (Fig. 5 B). Additionally, the mean value of the fluorescence intensity of α1B-adrenergic receptor-GFP in cells that co-expressed β-galactosidase as a negative control did not differ significantly from that of cells expressing α1B-adrenergic receptor/GFP alone (Fig.5 B).To further assess the effect that gC1qR71 has on the level of expression of the α1B-adrenergic receptor upon co-transfection, a radioligand binding assay was performed on COS-7 cells transiently expressing the α1B-adrenergic receptor with or without gC1qR71. Membrane preparations of these cells were used to determine the saturation binding isotherms for125I-labeled HEAT (Table I). Although the K d value was not significantly altered by co-expression of α1B-adrenergic receptor with gC1qR71, the B max value of the α1B-adrenergic receptor dramatically decreased when co-transfected with gC1qR71 (Table I). These results are in agreement with the results from the flow cytometry analysis in that the level of expression of α1B-adrenergic receptors on the cell surface is lower in the cells co-expressing gC1qR71. Co-expression of β-galactosidase did not significantly affect the125I-labeled HEAT binding site (Table I).Table IEffect of gC1q-R on α1B-adrenergic receptor bindingSaturation isothermsα1B-ARα1B-AR/β-galactosidaseα1B-AR/gC1qR71B max (pmol/mg protein)5.3 ± 1.24.3 ± 1.50.7 ± 2.6K d (pm)61.3 ± 1350 ± 23.230 ± 21.8COS-7 cells were transfected with α1B-adrenergic receptor alone or co-transfected with α1B-adrenergic receptor and either gC1qR71 or β-galactosidase.

Open table in a new tab In this study, we identified a novel cellular protein that interacts with the α1B-adrenergic receptor, gC1q-R. Expression studies indicated that gC1q-R regulates the expression level and cellular localization of the α1B-adrenergic receptor through its carboxyl terminus. gC1q-R was previously identified as a protein that binds to the globular heads of C1q. Recent accumulating evidence suggests that gC1q-R is a multiligand-binding, multifunctional protein with affinity for diverse ligands including thrombin, vitronectin, and high molecular weight kininogen (23Lim B.L.

Also, the carboxyl terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor interacts with the Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor family of PDZ proteins (10Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrated that gC1q-R binds with the carboxyl tail of the α1B-adrenergic receptor at the arginine-rich region, which differs from the known domains described above, and that gC1q-R regulates the cellular localization and expression of the α1B-adrenergic receptor through their interaction. Further studies to clarify the functional significance of this protein interaction in the regulation of α1B-adrenergic receptor signaling would be of value. G protein-coupled receptors interact with several classes of cytoplasmic proteins including heterotrimeric G proteins, kinases, phosphatases, and arrestins, and the binding of cytoplasmic protein with the receptor regulates receptor signaling (1Sterne M.R.

These interactions were first inferred from the functional effects of cytoplasmic proteins on receptor signaling and desensitization and were later confirmed by biochemical observation of the binding of the protein with receptor (5Goodman O.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Very recently, however, several unexpected interactions between cytoplasmic proteins and receptors have been observed; for instance, the adrenergic receptor interacts with the α-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (9Klein U. Ramirez M.T. Kobilka B.K. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19099-19102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and with the Na+/H+-exchange regulatory factor (10Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T.

These raise the possibility that receptors may interact with other types of cellular proteins that could play unanticipated roles in regulating the function of the receptor. We conducted a search for novel proteins that interact with the α1B-adrenergic receptor, specifically focusing on the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain, because mutations within this domain have pleiotropic effects on receptor physiology (11Valiquette M.

These results suggest that gC1q-R plays a role in the regulation of the subcellular localization as well as the function of α1B-adrenergic receptors.

Occurrence of amino acid residues in functional variants is positively correlated with their propensity to be generally found in β-turns. The folding pathway of two selected variants, EETI-βNEDE and EETI-βTNNK, was found to be indistinguishable from EETI-II and occurs through formation of a stable 2-disulfide intermediate.

Substantial amounts of misfolded byproducts, however, were obtained upon refolding of these variants corroborating the importance of the wild type EETI-II GPNG sequence to direct quantitative formation of the cystine knot architecture. Numerous small proteins, typically not longer than 40 residues in length, share a common structural motif consisting of a cystine knot and a small triple-stranded β-sheet. Members of the “knottin” family (1Le-Nguyen D. Heitz A. Chiche L. Castro B. Boigegrain R.A. Favel A. Coletti-Previero M.A. Biochimie. 1990; 72: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) of small proteins have a common architecture, but diverse biological activities and negligible amino acid sequence identity. Examples are (i) ω-conotoxin MVIIa, a 26-residue polypeptide found in the venom of the cone snail Conus magus, which acts as a neurotoxin by its high affinity binding to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (2Kohno T. Kim J.I. Kobayashi K. Kodera Y. Maeda T. Sato K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10256-10265Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); (ii) potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI), 1The abbreviations used are: PCI, potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor; CMTI-I, C. maxima trypsin inhibitor I; EETI-II, E. elaterium trypsin inhibitor II; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction a 39-amino acid peptide (3Rees D.C. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 77: 4633-4637Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar); and (iii) EETI-II from the squirting cucumberEcballium elaterium, a member of the squash family of protease inhibitors (4Heitz A. Chiche L. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2392-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These proteins are mainly stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bonds, where the first cysteine residue in the polypeptide chain is connected with the fourth, the second with the fifth, and the third with the sixth (Fig. 1, top panel). The cystine knot formed by these three disulfide bonds is defined by a ring formed by the first and the second disulfide bond in the peptide sequence and the intervening polypeptide backbone, through which the third disulfide bond passes (Fig. 1, bottom panel). Structural alignment of several cystine knot proteins revealed that the second and third disulfide bond together with the three β-strands that are interconnected by these disulfide bridges superimpose very well (5Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1833-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 6Isaacs N.W. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 7Tamaoki H. Miura R. Kusunoki M. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Moroder L. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, the first disulfide bond shows greater structural variation. Therefore, it was proposed that the region stabilized by the other two bridges forms a 2-disulfide motif serving as a basic scaffold (5Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1833-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 8Le-Nguyen D. Heitz A. Chiche L. El Hajji M. Castro B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This view is supported by the finding that the cellulose binding domain of the fungal enzyme cellobiohydrolase from Trichoderma reesei displays the typical cystine knot fold, but contains the central two pairs of cysteine residues only, and lacks the cysteine residues forming the first disulfide bond (9Kraulis P.J. Clore G.M. Nilges M. Jones T.A. Pettersson G. Knowles J. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Cucurbitaceae seeds have proven to be a rich source of trypsin inhibitors with cystine knot folding motif, thereby defining a family of serine protease inhibitors known as the squash family (10Otlewski J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All members possess an extended amino-terminal inhibitor loop, which is tethered at its amino and carboxyl termini to the cystine knot framework. A structurally and functionally well characterized member of the squash inhibitor family is the E. elaterium trypsin inhibitor II (EETI-II) (1Le-Nguyen D. Heitz A. Chiche L. Castro B. Boigegrain R.A. Favel A. Coletti-Previero M.A. Biochimie. 1990; 72: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Heitz A. Chiche L. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2392-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The major features of the EETI-II secondary structure are a short 310-helix for sequence 11–15, a β-turn 16–19, and a triple antiparallel β-sheet 20–28, with a β-turn formed by residues 22–25 (4Heitz A. Chiche L. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2392-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). During the folding of EETI-II, formation of a rigid core, which contains two native disulfide bonds (C9-C21, C15-C27) precedes inhibitor loop anchoring. This core, which comprises residues 9–28, appears to be the direct precursor of the natural, fully oxidized product and is structurally closely related to it (8Le-Nguyen D. Heitz A. Chiche L. El Hajji M. Castro B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional NMR study of an EETI-II variant, where all six cysteine residues have been replaced by serine, revealed presence of native-like secondary structures for segments 10–15 (310-helix) and β-turns 16–19 and 22–25, but no native tertiary interactions were observed (12Heitz A. Chiche L. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, it was hypothesized that these native-like local conformations could play a major role early in the folding of EETI-II (12Heitz A. Chiche L. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Folding of EETI-II was found to be a clean and quantitative process (8Le-Nguyen D. Heitz A. Chiche L. El Hajji M. Castro B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Unlike any other protein of the cystine knot family, EETI-II contains the sequence GPNG in the 22–25 β-turn segment connecting β-strands 2 and 3 (Fig. 1). The quantitative folding of EETI-II has been mainly attributed to the high β-turn propensity of this tetrapeptide sequence (13Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 135-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 14Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), which may facilitate association of β-strands in early folding stages of EETI-II followed by covalent fixation of the tertiary fold by disulfide bond formation (8Le-Nguyen D. Heitz A. Chiche L. El Hajji M. Castro B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the influence of the 22–25 turn sequence on the folding of EETI-II, we have generated a molecular repertoire of EETI-II variants with variegated 22–25 turn sequences and displayed this repertoire on the surface of Escherichia coli cells. This library was then selected for binding to trypsin to assess whether we could generate EETI-II mutants that allow formation of the correctly disulfide-bonded cystine knot framework. We have obtained numerous inhibitory active EETI-II derivatives and analyzed the in vitro refolding kinetics of selected variants compared with the wild type protein. E. coli strain BMH71–18 dsbA (F' lacIq lacZΔM15,proA+B+; Δ(lac-proAB),supE, thi, dsbA) was constructed by P1 transduction (15Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) into BMH71–18. Biotinylated bovine pancreas trypsin was obtained from Sigma. Streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate was purchased from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma. Synthetic oligonucleotides wereAW-blabio (biotin-5′-CTCACCCAGAAACGCTGGTG),AW-Etilo (5′-GCGCGGATCCGCAGAA), betaturn(5′-GCGCGGATCCGCAGAASNNSNNSNNSNNGCAAACGCAGCCAGCC; N = A, C, G, T; S = G, C), IgAseup(5′-CCCGGATCCGCGCAAGCCGATGCAGTC), IgAselo(5′-GCGCTCTAGATTAGAAACGAATCTGTAT), PLZMET(5′-CCGGAATTCATGCCCGGGTGCCCGCGGATTCTGATTCGTTGCAAACAGGAC),JuFoup (5′-GCGAAGATCTAGGCCTCCAACGCCC), and RSPX(5′-GTGAATTTCGACCTCTAG). The library of variant EETI-II genes was constructed by PCR amplification of the bla-EETI-II gene residing in pHK-EETI-II using the primers AW-blabio andbetaturn. Polymerase chain reaction using Tflpolymerase was as follows: 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 55 °C, and 40 s of elongation at 72 °C, 30 cycles. The PCR product was used as template DNA for PCR amplification with the primer pair AW-blabio andAW-Etilo. The EETI-II encoding sequence was released from the resulting PCR product by cleavage with AvaI andBamHI. After removal of the bla fragment by binding to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Promega), the library of EETI-II genes was ligated to similarly digested pHK-EETI-CKSend-Igaβ with the EETI-CKSend encoding fragment removed by sucrose gradient density centrifugation (17Kramer W. Fritz H.-J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 350-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). pHK-EETI-CKSend-Igaβ was constructed by ligation of a BamHI/XbaI-cleaved Igaβ encoding PCR product (obtained with primersIgAseup and IgAselo from vector pEX1000; kindly provided by J. Pohlner and T. F. Meyer) into similarly digested pHK-EETI-CKSendplasmid. 2Christmann, A., Walter, K., Wentzel, A., Krätzner, R., and Kolmar, H., in press. With the ligation mixture, electrocompetent cells of BMH71–18 dsbA were transformed. Cells were grown overnight in rich medium in the presence of chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). 5 ml of medium containing 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol were inoculated 1:100 with the library cell culture and incubated for 14 h at 37 °C. 50 μl of the bacterial culture were centrifuged, and cells were resuspended in 10 μl of biotinylated trypsin (1 mg/ml, diluted in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After washing in the same buffer without trypsin, cells were consecutively labeled with streptavidin superparamagnetic beads and streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate and subjected to magnetic and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.2 Cells obtained from the enrichment were lysed by heating to 98 °C for 2 min and directly subjected to PCR amplification of the variant EETI-II genes using the primer pairJuFoup and RSPX, which flank the EETI-II gene at its 5′ and 3′ ends. The resulting DNA fragment was recloned into pHK-EETI-CKSend-Igaβ as described above. EETI-II wild type and selected variants were produced in E. coli as soluble periplasmic proteins via fusion to maltose-binding protein by cloning the respective EETI-II gene as an AvaI/BamHI fragment into similarly digested pMETI-II plasmid.2 To obtain sufficient amounts of the respective variant for refolding experiments, the respective EETI-II gene was amplified by PCR using the primersPLZMET and RSPX, cleaved with EcoRI and XbaI, and ligated into similarly digested pLZPWB1 (18Preuss K.D. Krauhs E. Scheit K.H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).E. coli W3110 (18Preuss K.D. Krauhs E. Scheit K.H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was used as expression host. Inclusion bodies were obtained from French press lysates of bacterial liquid cultures overnight grown at 37 °C in rich medium with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) added. These were dissolved in 15 ml of 70% formic acid/g of inclusion bodies. After 24 h of incubation with cyanogen bromide (150 mg/g of inclusion bodies), proteins were precipitated with two volumes of diethylether. The precipitate was dissolved by sonication in 8 m urea, 100 mmNaCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and subjected to immobilized metal ion adsorption chromatography.2 To the EETI-II containing fractions from the imidazole step gradient elution, dithiothreitol was added at 50 mm final concentration and samples were subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using the following conditions. The HPLC column was Waters μBondapak C18 (3.9 × 150 mm); solvent A was water, containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient was 10% B to 37% B linear in 16 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The detector wavelength was set to 217 nm. Samples were freeze-dried and dissolved in 10 mm HCl. Protein concentration was determined by derivatization of fully reduced EETI-II with 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (19Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21762) Google Scholar). Refolding was performed in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 9.1, at 25 °C at a concentration of 3.5 μm for EETI-II and 10 μm for EETI-βNEDE and EETI-βTNNK. Folding intermediates were trapped in a time-course manner by mixing aliquots of the sample with 1/20 volume of concentrated phosphoric acid and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using the conditions described above. The nucleotide sequence of 40 individual clones of the EETI-βXXXX unselected library and of 30 trypsin-binding variants was determined. Of the 480 nucleotides of codons 22–25 from the unselected library, 119 were A, 45 T, 167 C, and 149 G. Using a NN(G/C) coding scheme, one would expect to find in a set of 480 nucleotides 80 A, 80 T, 160 G and 160 C nucleotides. Since the observed distribution deviated significantly from the expected, a correcting weight factor was calculated for a given nucleotide N, as shown in Equation 1, whereFN is the scored number of nucleotideN and PN is the expected number. wN=FNPNEquation 1 The probability of obtaining a particular codon was then calculated as shown in Equation 2. P(N1N2S)=14wN1×14wN2×12wSEquation 2 The probability for a particular amino acid residueaa defined by i codons is given as shown in Equation 3. P(aa)=∑iPi(N1N2S)Equation 3 The score for a particular residue aa is given by Equation 4 (20Bowie J.U. Lüthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar), Score(aa)=lnF(aa)P(aa)Equation 4 where F(aa) is the observed frequency of a residue found in region 22–25 of the set of trypsin-binding EETI-II variants. If the number of residue aa in the obtained data set was found to be zero, it was increased to 0.5 so that F(aa) was never zero. In squash inhibitors, the inhibitor loop is held in place by amino- and carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues tethering it through disulfide bond formation to the structural framework. Removal of any of the three disulfide bonds in EETI-II by cysteine to serine replacement (C2S, C21S, C27S) was found to abolish cystine knot formation and trypsin binding (data not shown). Likewise, misfolded variants ofCucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor I (CMTI-I) containing three non-native intramolecular disulfide bonds had no inhibitory activity (21Kojima S. Katsunori M. Miura K. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that trypsin binding could be used as an indicative for manifestation of the correct cystine knot framework. Initial experiments to present EETI-II and derived variants on the surface of phage in order to enrich functional variants via binding to immobilized trypsin were unsuccessful (data not shown). As a practicable alternative, we opted for the presentation of a repertoire of EETI-II variants on the outer membrane of E. colicells. Cells displaying an EETI-II variant, which retains the ability to bind trypsin can then be isolated by labeling with biotinylated trypsin followed by specific fluorescence labeling with streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate and enrichment of binders by magnetic and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Display of proteins on the surface of E. coli cells requires passage across two membranes, the inner and the outer membrane. TheNeisseria gonorrhoeae IgA protease COOH-terminal domain (Igaβ) has been shown to translocate passenger proteins fused to the amino terminus through the outer membrane and anchor them on the bacterial cell surface (22Klauser T. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Igaβ integrates into the outer membrane and is assumed to form a translocation pore for covalently attached protein domains. To ensure transport of the EETI-Igaβ fusion across the cytoplasmic membrane, we fused in-frame the EETI-Igaβ encoding sequence to the gene coding for periplasmically located β-lactamase (23Kolmar H. Ferrando E. Hennecke F. Wippler J. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This tripartite gene fusion resides in expression vector pHK-EETI-Igaβ under lac promoter/operator control (23Kolmar H. Ferrando E. Hennecke F. Wippler J. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Efficient translocation of a passenger domain fused to Igaβ, which contains an intramolecular disulfide bond, was achieved only in an E. coli mutant carrying a defect in the dsbA gene encoding periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductase. This finding suggests that translocation through the outer membrane requires an unfolded conformation of the passenger domain and can be blocked by disulfide loop formation (24Jose J. Kramer J. Klauser T. Meyer T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy of BMH71–18 dsbA cells containing pHKEETI-Igaβ treated with biotinylated trypsin, followed by incubation with streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin revealed that only a small fraction of the cell population (approximately 5–10%) were phycoerythrin-labeled (No fluorescent cells were detected with non-presenting control cells (data not shown).). A majority of the cells that carried a phycoerythrin label could be simultaneously stained with propidium iodide (data not shown), which preferentially stains non-viable cells (25Lopez-Amoros R.

Whether the high mortality of EETI-II presenting cells is the cause or the result of the cell surface presentation of the β-lactamase-EETI-II fusion protein is currently not clear. Nevertheless, the finding that EETI-II producing cells labeled with biotinylated trypsin/streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate were distinguishable by FACS from cells producing an EETI-II variant that is unable to bind trypsin (Fig. 2) prompted us to use indirect fluorescent trypsin labeling followed by magnetic and fluorescent-activated cell sorting to identify and isolate cells carrying a functional EETI-II protein. A library of EETI-II genes was generated by randomizing PCR, where the EETI-II codons 22–25 were randomized using a NN(G/C) coding scheme. These variant EETI-II genes were ligated to pHK-EETI-Igaβ. Transformation of BMH71–18 dsbA yielded 2.2 × 107 individual transformants, which represents a 20-fold coverage of the theoretical number of possible combinations (324). Cells from 10 individual transformants of the EETI-βXXXX repertoire were tested for their ability to bind anti-β-lactamase antibody and trypsin. Upon labeling with anti-β-lactamase antibody followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody and streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate, at least 10% of the cells of each clone revealed a phycoerythrin label, while no specific label was obtained with biotinylated trypsin (data not shown). This indicates that only a fraction of the variants in the repertoire has trypsin binding activity. To enrich cells presenting trypsin-binding EETI-II variants on their cell surface, 5 × 107 cells of the library were subjected to labeling with biotinylated trypsin followed by incubation with streptavidin-coupled colloidal superparamagnetic microbeads. After washing, cells were incubated with streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate. Prior to FACS, labeled cells were presorted by magnetic separation by passage through a high gradient magnetic separation column2 (26Miltenyi S. Pflüger E. Radbruch A. Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting. Springer Laboratory, Berlin1992: 141-152Crossref Google Scholar). Since the colloidal magnetic particles are too small to be detected by the flow cytometer, the 8 × 106 cells eluted from the magnetic separation column could be immediately subjected to FACS and were run through a MoFlo cell sorter (Cytomation) and sorted on the basis of fluorescence intensity. After immediate resorting, 65% of the 450,000 cells obtained fell into the positive window (Fig.3). To rescue the EETI-βXXXX genes from the non-viable cells, the EETI-II genes encoded in the enriched population of bacterial cells were amplified by PCR from cell lysates and ligated into pHK-EETI-Igaβ expression vector. After transformation, overnight cultures from 120 individual transformants were labeled with trypsin and subjected to flow cytometer analysis. Clones were classified as trypsin-binding, when at least 4% of the cells fell into the positive window. Of the 120 clones, 58 were positive for trypsin binding. The nucleotide sequence of the respective EETI-II gene was determined for 30 of the 58 positive clones exhibiting trypsin binding activity (TableI). 40 clones from the initial, unselected library were also sequenced to compare the distribution of residues in the 22–25 region before and after enrichment of trypsin-binding EETI-II variants (data not shown). A score was calculated for each residue, which reflects the deviation of the occurrence of a particular amino acid in the data set of residues 22–25 of trypsin-binding EETI-II variants from the probability to find the respective residue in the initial unselected library. A negative value indicates underrepresentation of the respective amino acid, a positive value overrepresentation. The 20 amino acids were ordered according to their overall β-turn potentials, which have been determined by Hutchinson and Thornton by classification of β-turns from proteins with known three-dimensional structure (14Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). As can be seen from Fig. 4, amino acid residues that are rarely found in β-turns are also underrepresented in the set of functional EETI-II variants, while asparagine, which has the second highest overall β-turn potential, is most frequently found (26/180). Exceptions to this correlation are cysteine and proline.Table IAmino acid sequence of the 22–25 region and dissociation constants of trypsin-binding EETI-II variants obtained from combinatorial library screening22–25K d22–2522–2522–25mGPNG (wild type)6.09 ± 1.97 × 10−9HTYSIGSSTNNIQQNHHQNKNNNKNEDE3.00 ± 0.55 × 10−9RNHTTDQNTHQGTNNK7.53 ± 3.37 × 10−9ESGRAPDSDQMKLDET9.97 ± 0.91 × 10−9EYRGNSGHRRNPNNTD13.79 ± 0.16 × 10−9SDMSGKQDQNGMERNE21.14 ± 8.05 × 10−9NLTTNKNTKNTEHKRT9.83 ± 3.16 × 10−9TNHNSYAVATNNThe combinatorial library of EETI-II variants differing in the amino acid sequence of the 22–25 turn region was presented on the surface ofE. coli cells.

To quantitatively assess the trypsin binding activity of the selected peptides, six EETI-II variants together with the EETI-II wild type protein were produced in soluble form via secretion into the E. coli periplasmic space by fusion to maltose-binding protein.2 These proteins were purified from osmotic shock fluid of the bacterial cells by immobilized metal ion adsorption chromatography. Very similar dissociation constants toward trypsin were measured for MalE-EETI-II wild type and the selected library variants (Table I). We have further characterized the disulfide-coupled folding of EETI-II wild type, of the trypsin-binding variants EETI-βNEDE and EETI-βTNNK, and of EETI-βATVF, which was obtained from library screening as a variant devoid of trypsin binding activity. To obtain sufficient amounts of protein for the study of refolding kinetics, proteins were produced in E. coli as insoluble inclusion bodies via fusion to a modified β-galactosidase shortened to 449 residues, where all methionine as well as cysteine residues are replaced by leucine (18Preuss K.D.

By PCR amplification of the respective EETI gene, methionine codon 7 was replaced by a leucine codon. Simultaneously, a single methionine codon was introduced at the junction between the lacZ and the EETI-II gene to allow release of the EETI-II moiety from the fusion protein by cyanogen bromide cleavage.

Here, we present evidence that exogenously added C6-ceramide induces enlargement of late endosomes and lysosomes. 10 μm C6-ceramide caused the formation of numerous vesicles of varying sizes (2–10 μm) in fibroblasts (3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A), without toxic effects.

These studies point to a possible effect of ceramide on the process of vesicular transport. Here, we present evidence that C6-ceramide induces endocytic vesicle formation, causing enlarged late endosomes and lysosomes in two mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines, 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A.

[Hexanoyl 1-14C]N-hexanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine and [octanoyl 1-14C]N-octanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Ceramide and other sphingolipids were prepared in ethanol (except for d-erythro-sphingosine 1-phosphate, which was dissolved in methanol) at 4 mm and stored at −20 °C. In each experiment, ceramide and sphingolipids were added directly into the medium by diluting the stock solutions. The final concentration of ethanol in the culture medium was ≤0.2% (v/v). The cell lines used in this study were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT); 3T3-F442A cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum. These fibroblasts were adherent to the plastic and grown as monolayers. For cell passage, cells were seeded at 2.4–4.0 × 103 cells/cm2 in culture flasks, and the culture medium was changed every 3 days. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. The effect of ceramide on proliferation of 3T3-L1 cells was assessed by direct cell counting and by [3H]thymidine uptake. To determine cell numbers, 3T3-L1 cells were seeded at 105 cells/25-cm2flask (∼4 × 103 cells/cm2) and cultured for 24 h. The culture medium was then replaced with 7 ml of fresh medium containing either C6-ceramide (10–20 μm) or ethanol. The cells were counted at 24-h intervals. For the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, 3T3-L1 cells were plated at 103 cells/well in 96-well cell culture clusters (area, 0.32 cm2; Costar). One day after plating, the culture medium was replaced with 100 μl of fresh medium/well containing either C6-ceramide (10–20 μm) or ethanol. At 24-h intervals, triplicate cultures were pulsed for 3 h with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine per well. The cells were harvested, and cellular [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined. 3T3-L1 cells were seeded at 105 cells/25-cm2 flask or 2.2 × 105 cells/culture dish (100 × 20 mm; growth area, 55 cm2) in complete culture medium, and were exposed to either C6-ceramide or other sphingolipids at final concentrations of 5–20 μm on the following day. Cells cultured in medium containing ethanol were used as controls. The cell number was ∼2 × 105 cells/25-cm2 flask and ∼4 × 105 cells/culture dish when C6-ceramide or other sphingolipids were added to the culture medium. The culture volume was 7 ml/25-cm2 flask and 10 ml/culture dish (100 × 20 mm). To evaluate the possible effect of cell density on vesicle formation, cells were also examined at higher densities (0.5–1.5 × 106cells/25-cm2 flask). Vesicle formation (the number of cells bearing vesicles and the number of vesicles appearing in each cell) was assessed at different time points, and the cells were photographed under a phase-contrast microscope. 3T3-L1 cells were plated in 96-well cell culture clusters (area, 0.32 cm2; Costar) at three densities: 1 × 103, 5 × 103, and 1 × 104 cells/well. After an 18-h incubation, in which the cell number doubled, the culture medium was replaced with 100 μl of fresh medium containing 10 μm14C-labeled C6-ceramide (N-[hexanoyl 1-14C]hexanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine; specific activity, 50 mCi/mmol) or 10 μm14C-labeled C8-ceramide (N-[octanoyl 1-14C]octanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine; specific activity, 53 mCi/mmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) per well. At different time points, cells were harvested, and the uptake of 14C-labeled ceramide was determined. 3T3-L1 cells were seeded in two-well tissue culture slide chambers (2 × 104 cells/well) (Lab-Tek, Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL), which contained 2 ml of culture medium. The cells were cultured for 24 h in normal culture medium and then exposed to C6-ceramide for 24 h. The cells were fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline for 30 min and then processed as described previously (13Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the cells were permeabilized by saponin (1 mg/ml), lysosomes were stained with the anti-lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) antibody, ABL-93 (14Chen J.W. Murphy T.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. August J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight, followed by rhodamine labeled goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cellular neutral lipids were detected by staining with 0.01% Nile Red (Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. In selected experiments, cells were pretreated with 10 μm C6-ceramide to induce the appearance of vesicles and were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 20 μm C6-NBD-ceramide (Molecular Probes). After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were either cooled to 4 °C and fixed or further incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then fixed, to trace the intracellular localization of C6-NBD-ceramide. All cells were mounted in buffered glycerol containing para-phenylenediamine (15Johnson G.D. Nogueira Araujo G.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 43: 349-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) to prevent fading and analyzed with an LSM-410 laser scanning confocal imaging system equipped with an Omnichrome krypton-argon laser (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Because ceramide has been shown to cause cell growth arrest and apoptosis (1Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), we first examined the effect of C6-ceramide on 3T3-L1 cell proliferation. The doubling time for 3T3-L1 cells was determined to be ∼16 h. As shown in Fig.1 A, C6-ceramide had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell growth. Treatment of the cells with 10 μm C6-ceramide had only a minor effect on cell growth, whereas 15 μmC6-ceramide caused modest inhibition of growth of 3T3-L1 cells, without reducing cell viability, as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. At 20 μm, cell growth was totally blocked, but nearly all the adherent cells were viable. In parallel with this inhibition of cell proliferation, the rate of DNA synthesis (measured as [3H]thymidine uptake) of cells exposed to C6-ceramide was inhibited (Fig. 1 B). Finally, when cells were treated with higher concentrations of C6-ceramide (>20 μm) for prolonged periods of time, there was detectable cell death, consistent with previous reports (16Hauser J.M. Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 1994: 6803-6809Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). C6-ceramide has been shown to regulate protein secretion and endocytosis under certain conditions (6Rosenwald A.G. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4577-4579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Chen C.-S. Rosenwald A.G. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13291-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of ceramide in vesicular trafficking, we studied the effect of C6-ceramide on vesicle formation in the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1. When these cells were treated with 10 μmC6-ceramide for 24 h, numerous vesicles of varying sizes (2–10 μm) were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy (Fig.2). Large vesicles were found in the perinuclear region, whereas small ones were present at the cell periphery (Fig. 2, B and C). The effect of ceramide was dose-dependent. Within 24 h, 30% of the cells treated with 10 μm C6-ceramide bore vesicles (Fig. 2 D). This increased to 67 and 74% when the cells were treated with 15 and 20 μmC6-ceramide, respectively. The effect of ceramide was also time-dependent. Sequential observations revealed that initial vesicle formation was quite rapid, with numerous small vesicles starting to appear within 8 h following the treatment of the cells with 10 μmC6-ceramide. These vesicles gradually became larger. Vesicle formation reached its maximal level on day 2. The vesicles then began disappearing, and after 4 days, most of the vesicles had disappeared unless fresh ceramide was added to the culture medium. When ceramide was removed from the culture medium and the cells were cultured in fresh medium without ceramide, nearly all of the vesicles disappeared within 24 h (Fig. 3). Re-exposure of the cells to ceramide caused the vesicles to reappear within 24 h, indicating that these cells can be repeatedly induced to form enlarged vesicles and that this formation of enlarged vesicles caused by C6-ceramide is reversible. We confirmed the above effects of C6-ceramide on vesicle formation in another mouse fibroblast cell line, 3T3-F442A. When treated with 10–20 μm C6-ceramide, these cells also demonstrated enlarged vesicles, similar to those of the 3T3-L1 cells (not shown), suggesting that exogenous C6-ceramide may induce such vesicle formation in mouse fibroblasts in general. To evaluate the possible influence of cell density on vesicle formation, we examined the effect of C6-ceramide on vesicle formation over a range of cell densities (0.2–1.5 × 106 cells/25-cm2 flask). The vesicles were prominent over the density range of 2–4 × 105cells/25 cm2 when exogenous C6-ceramide was added to the culture medium (Fig. 2). The vesicle formation induced by C6-ceramide also occurred at higher densities. For example, when 3T3-L1 cells were treated for 24 h with 15 μmC6-ceramide at the density of 0.55–1.5 × 106 cells/25-cm2 flask (the assay starting and ending cell densities, respectively), 67% of the cells bore vesicles (Fig. 4 B). Further studies revealed that confluent and nearly confluent cells were less sensitive to the effect of C6-ceramide than were the more rapidly proliferating cell populations, i.e. those at lower densities (20–70% of confluence). To determine whether this influence of cell density on vesicle formation might reflect the relative availability of C6-ceramide to the cells, we measured uptake of radiolabeled C6-ceramide at three different cell densities: 2 × 103, 1 × 104, and 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well cell culture clusters (area, 0.32 cm2). The uptake of C6-ceramide by 3T3-L1 cells decreased with increasing cell density (Fig.5 A). At the density of 2 × 103 cells/well, 3T3-L1 cells incubated with 10 μm14C-labeled C6-ceramide (1 nmol/well) underwent prominent vesicle formation and had a maximal uptake of 7.5–9.8 pmol/103 cells. This uptake is in the same range as the previously reported uptake of ceramide by other cell types (17Younes A. Kahn D.W. Besterman J.M. Bittman R. Byun H.-S. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 842-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Yu. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). At the higher density of 2 × 104cells/well, uptake of the 14C-labeled C6-ceramide was lower (3.0–3.9 pmol/103 cells; Fig. 5 A), suggesting that the reduced ceramide effect at high cell density is at least partially due to decreased uptake of C6-ceramide molecules by the cells. We characterized the vesicles induced by C6-ceramide using confocal microscopic analysis. The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1 is one of the well established models that undergoes differentiation into mature lipid-laden adipocytes (19MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Under a phase contrast microscope, the vesicles induced by C6-ceramide appeared much like the fat droplets known to exist in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Thus, 3T3-L1 cells treated with C6-ceramide were first stained with Nile Red with the expectation that the vesicles would be identical to fat droplets. Surprisingly, however, although both control and ceramide-treated cells contained neutral lipids (Fig.6, B and D), the vesicles themselves were conspicuously devoid of neutral lipids. Additionally, the distribution pattern of neutral lipids stained by Nile Red (Fig. 6 D) differed from the pattern of vesicles visualized by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 6 C). All of the vesicles were Nile Red negative, indicating that the vesicles induced by C6-ceramide were not lipid droplets. Likewise, cell staining by periodic acid-Schiff reagent revealed the vesicles to be unstained (not shown). Thus, these vesicles were determined to be neither neutral lipid-containing nor glycol-containing cellular components. We then considered the possibility that the vesicles were endocytic vesicles. Early endosomes exist in the periphery of the cell and are the first structures to receive endocytosed materials. The residence time as early endosomes is on the order of minutes (20Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). The internalized materials that do not recycle from early endosomes to the cell plasma membrane are subsequently transported to late endosomes. Late endosomes are formed by the fusion of early endosomes containing materials coming in for digestion and the vesicles containing lysosomal hydrolases coming out from the Golgi apparatus. After acquiring lysosomal membrane proteins, such as LAMPs, late endosomes gradually mature into lysosomes (20Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Taking into account this knowledge, we used the antibody against LAMP, ABL-93, to test whether the vesicles induced by C6-ceramide were lysosomes. In fact, in 3T3-L1 cells treated with C6-ceramide, the antibody specifically stained the membrane of the vesicles. As indicated by thearrows (Fig. 6 F), the lysosomal membrane staining appears as ring-shaped structures, which resulted from immunolocalization of LAMP present in the lysosomal membrane and colocalized with the lucent vesicles seen by phase microscopy (Fig.6 E). The control cells had small, scattered bodies, which is the characteristic staining pattern of normal lysosomes (not shown). Although specific, it should be noted that this LAMP staining cannot distinguish lysosomes from late endosomes, because there is no clear distinction between the two compartments, as discussed above. Thus, some of these vesicles identified by LAMP staining may be late endosomes. In any case, these studies clearly identify the ceramide-induced vesicles as endocytic vesicles. To determine whether the enlarged lysosomes/late endosomes were caused by storage of C6-ceramide, we used C6-NBD-ceramide as a fluorescent probe to trace the localization of C6-ceramide (Fig.7), because both C6-NBD-ceramide and 14C-labeled C6-ceramide have been shown to equilibrate into and accumulate in the Golgi apparatus (8Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Science. 1985; 228: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 2661-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Following the appearance of vesicles induced by 10 μm C6-ceramide, 3T3-L1 cells were either incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 20 μm C6-NBD-ceramide or first incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 20 μm C6-NBD-ceramide, washed, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After the 15-min incubation, cells showed a diffuse pattern of C6-NBD-ceramide staining (Fig. 7 B) throughout the cytoplasm, whereas after the additional 2-h incubation C6-NBD-ceramide fluorescence was concentrated in the perinuclear region, the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 7 D). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that C6-NBD-ceramide is a vital stain for the Golgi apparatus (8Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Science. 1985; 228: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In both cases, the vesicles induced by C6-ceramide were not stained by the fluorescent C6-NBD-ceramide. Accompanying the appearance of the large vesicles in the cells treated with ceramide was a profound morphological change. The cell size doubled, and sometimes tripled (Fig. 2, B and C). It has been known that in most plant and fungal cells, each cell contains one or several, large, fluid-filled vacuoles, or versatile lysosomes. These vacuoles typically occupy more than 30%, and sometimes as much as 90%, of the cell volume (21Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994: 612Google Scholar). In animal cells, vacuoles are related to lysosomes, which contain a variety of hydrolytic enzymes with diverse functions. Thus, the increase in cell size and volume in 3T3-L1 cells treated with ceramide possibly resulted from the accumulation of enlarged lysosomes. Nevertheless, the relationship between the present findings and the growth inhibitory effect of C6-ceramide remains unclear. To further delineate the ceramide effect, we determined the influence of the molecular structure of ceramide on induction of enlarged lysosomes/late endosomes in 3T3-L1 cells. In these experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/25-cm2flask in complete culture medium and cultured overnight. The cell number was ∼ 2 × 105 cells when ceramide analogues were added to the culture medium at a range of ceramide concentrations (10–20 μm). Vesicle formation was assessed after exposure of the cells to ceramide for 24–48 h. These studies revealed the stereospecificity of ceramide effect. Among the stereoisomers of C6-ceramide,d-erythro-C6-ceramide was the most active isomer, whereas l-threo-C6-ceramide was inactive. l-Erythro-C6-ceramide andd-threo-C6-ceramide had a minor effect on vesicle formation. Thus, the natural form of ceramide (d-erythro-) appears to be the most active one. When ceramide analogues with different fatty acyl chain length were compared for their effect on vesicle formation,d-erythro-C6-ceramide was the most active molecule among ceramide analogues tested,d-erythro-C8-ceramide was less effective, and d-erythro-C2-ceramide was not active at all under these experimental conditions. For example, 3T3-L1 cells treated with 10 or 15 μmd-erythro-C8-ceramide for up to 48 h did not have any enlarged vesicle formation, and only <10% of the cells bore vesicles when treated with 20 μmd-erythro-C8-ceramide for 24–48 h. In contrast, 30% and of the cells bore large vesicles when treated with 10 μmd-erythro-C6-ceramide for 24 h (Fig. 2 D), and 67% of the cells treated with 15 μm for 24 h bore vesicles (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether the difference in effect of ceramide analogues on vesicle formation was related to possible differences in their uptake, we compared the uptake of 10 μm14C-labeledd-erythro-C6-ceramide andd-erythro-C8-ceramide by 3T3-L1 cells. The uptake was equal (Fig. 5). For example, at the density of 2 × 103 cells/well, both 14C-labeledd-erythro-C6-ceramide and14C-labeled d-erythro-C8-ceramide were rapidly incorporated into the cells, reaching maximal levels of 9.8 and 9.0 pmol/103 cells, respectively. These studies exclude reduced cellular uptake of C8-ceramide as the cause of its lack of effect on vesicle formation. Ceramide has a central role in sphingolipid metabolism and is actively metabolized in most cells. For example, in HL-60 cells,3H-labeled C2-ceramide was rapidly incorporated into the cells, and a substantial amount of [3H]C2-ceramide remained intact even after prolonged incubation at 37 °C. Only a small amount of [3H]C2-ceramide was converted to sphingomyelin but not to sphingosine (22Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using C6-ceramide in MOLT-4 cells (23Dbaibo G. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwarz J. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In B16 melanoma cells, C2- and C6-Cer were rapidly glycosylated and converted to short chain ceramide-containing cerebrosides and GM3, in addition to short chain ceramide-containing sphingomyelin (12Komori H. Ito M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because these and other studies have shown that ceramide can be metabolized to a number of molecules, which have also been shown to have potential roles in cell function, we investigated whether the effect of ceramide on vesicle formation could be attributed to one of its metabolites. Under the conditions at which C6-ceramide induced enlarged vesicles (treatment of 3T3-L1 cells for 1 or 2 days at 5–20 μm), the ceramide metabolites sphingosine, sphingosine 1-phosphate, C6-Cer sphingomyelin, C2-Cer cerebroside, and C2-Cer GM3 were all inactive in causing vesicle formation (Fig. 4,C–F). Thus, these ceramide metabolites, when added exogenously, do not have the same effect as ceramide. It has been shown that the small GTPases of the Rab family are actively involved in vesicular docking and membrane fusion at various steps of biosynthetic and endocytic transport (24Sluijs P.v.d. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Bruno G. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 25Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K.

Gournier H. Rybin V. Rubino M. Auvinen P. Lutcke A. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 384: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that pinocytosis and membrane ruffling are regulated by distinct Ras signal transduction pathways: activation of Rab5 via Ras stimulates endosome fusion and pinocytosis, whereas activation of Rac via Ras stimulates actin polymerization and membrane ruffling (28Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Cooper J.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10337-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because ceramide activates several protein kinases (3Westwick J.K. Bielawska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22689-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 29Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. McGinley M. Chan-Hui P.-Y. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), one possibility is that exogenous C6-ceramide causes numerous enlarged late endosomes/lysosomes by an effect of ceramide on the small GTPases. For example, ceramide could activate one of the small GTPases, such as a Rab protein, and thereby enhance or accelerate the vesicular traffic to lysosomes. In turn, this could cause the appearance and accumulation of enlarged late endosomes/lysosomes. Alternately, ceramide could cause their persistence and enlargement by inhibiting lysosome catabolism. Clearly, the mechanism of ceramide action will be important to elucidate. Finally, the present study suggests that C6-ceramide may be a useful probe for studying endocytic vesicle transport and membrane fusion along the endocytic pathway in fibroblasts.

In this disease, mutations in the vasopressin prohormone cause defects in the synthesis of vasopressin and hence result in a large increase in urine production (polyuria) and fluid intake (polydipsia) (1Fujiwara T.M.

The vasopressin prohormone consists of vasopressin, its carrier protein neurophysin and a glycopeptide, which are separated by arginine/lysine rich cleavage sites (see Fig. 1 A) (3Breslow E.

In the secretory granules, processing of the vasopressin prohormone takes place, and upon stimulation of the nerve terminals, processing products are released (5Gainer H. Altstein M. Whitnall M.H.

The disease displays two unexpected features for a deficiency caused by a defective prohormone. First, the disease is dominant, demonstrating that one mutant prohormone allele suffices to cause the defect. Second, the onset of disease symptoms is delayed to several months or years of age. These peculiarities suggest that the mutant human vasopressin prohormone somehow interferes with synthesis, transport, or processing of the wild type prohormone or with the viability of the vasopressin-producing cells. To determine the mechanism of human FNDI, we investigated the intracellular fate of five vasopressin prohormones containing an established diabetes insipidus mutation. Because most FNDI mutations are present within the neurophysin moiety and concern substitution of amino acids implicated in determining protein structure, like cysteines involved in disulfide-bridge formation or prolines and glycines, which can make turns in polypeptide chains (see Fig. 1 B) (8Rittig S.

In addition, we analyzed both mutations identified in NP47E, which is the residue involved in vasopressin binding (NP47E→G and NP47ΔE) (see Fig. 1 B) (8Rittig S. Robertson G.L. Siggaard C. Kovacs L. Gregersen N. Nyborg J. Pedersen E.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 107-117PubMed Google Scholar). All five mutated residues display full interspecies conservation (4de Bree F.M. Burbach J.P. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To examine sorting and processing, we stably expressed the mutant prohormones in neuroendocrine cell lines. The results suggest the involvement of the endoplasmic reticulum in the pathogenicity of human FNDI and reveal that the structural requirements of the vasopressin prohormone for trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus are much more strict than for sorting into the regulated secretory pathway. Point mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction with the enzyme Pfu (Stratagene) in either a 178-base pair KspI-SmaI fragment (mutant NP14G→R) or a 443-base pair SmaI-EclXI fragment (other mutants) of the cloned human vasopressin gene (GenBankTM accession number M11166) (18Sausville E. Carney D. Battey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10236-10241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations made were exactly the same as described (8Rittig S. Robertson G.L. Siggaard C.

To facilitate cloning, an EcoRI site was introduced into the NotI site, which is located 40 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box of the gene. A secondEcoRI site was present immediately downstream of the gene in the polylinker of the pJB327 vector. The expression plasmid pRc/RSV (Invitrogen) was digested with EcoRI, and the 2.5-kbEcoRI fragment containing the entire vasopressin gene was cloned in. In the expression plasmid obtained in this way, the vasopressin gene is expressed from its own TATA box and uses its own polyadenylation signal. An expression vector with hygromycine selection (pRSVhyg) had been constructed by replacing the 2.3-kb PvuII fragment containing the G418 resistance gene of pRc/RSV by the 1.9-kbNruI-SalI fragment of pREP4 (Invitrogen) containing the hygromycine resistance gene. Wild type and mutant vasopressin genes were cloned as 3.0-kb partialBglII-SacI fragments from the pRc/RSV plasmids to the pRSVhyg vector. The mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2A (ATCC CCL 131) (19Klebe R.J. Ruddle F.H. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 69aGoogle Scholar) was cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 200 IU/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in an atmosphere with 5% CO2. Neuro-2A cells were transfected with gene constructs cloned into the pRc/RSV vector with the calcium phosphate method (20van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Stable clones were selected on medium supplemented with 1200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in medium with 600 μg/ml G418. The rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 transfected with mouse prohormone convertase 2 (PC12/PC2) (21Dittie A.S. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was cultured in poly-l-lysine coated flasks in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 200 IU/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycine, 5% fetal calf serum, and 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in an atmosphere with 10% CO2. PC12/PC2 cells were transfected with gene constructs cloned into the pRSVhyg vector with Lipofectine (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (21Dittie A.S. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Stable clones were selected on medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and maintained on medium with 50 μg/ml hygromycine. Analysis of clones from independent transfection experiments gave similar results. Rabbit antiserum D5 is raised against swine neurophysin and cross-reacts with human neurophysin (22Robinson I.C. Russell J.T. Thorn N.A. Acta Endocrinol. 1976; 83: 36-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum HenryK was raised against rat neurophysin and displays some cross-reactivity with human neurophysin (23North W.G. LaRochelle F.T.J. Hardy G.R. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 96: 373-386Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum BorisY2 recognizes the human glycopeptide (24North W.G. Pai S. Friedmann A. Yu X. Fay M. Memoli V. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 34: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera W4 and W1 (25Liu B. Burbach J.P. Peptides. 1987; 8: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are raised against vasopressin. W1 recognizes fully processed vasopressin, whereas W4 recognizes both processed and unprocessed vasopressin (25Liu B. Burbach J.P. Peptides. 1987; 8: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Monoclonal 1D3 was raised against the C terminus of the ER protein protein-disulfide-isomerase and recognizes both protein-disulfide-isomerase and calreticulin (26Vaux D. Tooze J. Fuller S. Nature. 1990; 345: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The monoclonal NM4 recognizes the cytosolic protein B50, which associates with the plasma membrane via palmitoyl chains (27Mercken M. Lubke U. Vandermeeren M. Gheuens J. Oestreicher A.B. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates, washed with PBS, and starved for one hour in DMEM without cysteine (DMEM without cysteine, methionine, and glutamine (ICN) supplemented with 30 μg/ml methionine (Life Technologies, Inc.), glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Neuro-2A cells) or 5% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum (PC12/PC2 cells)). Labeling was performed with 25 μCi of [35S]cysteine (ICN) for 18 h unless indicated otherwise. In case of a pulse-chase analysis, the chase was initiated by addition of ¼ volume of DMEM supplemented with 4 mm cold cysteine (ICN) and serum. Cells were harvested by scraping and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis mix (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) TX-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), and immunoprecipitations were performed as described (28Nijenhuis M. Hammerling G.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5467-5477PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum D5 was used for immunoprecipitation of neurophysin-containing proteins. Where indicated, endoglycosidase H digestions of the immunoprecipitates were performed with 4 units of endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 32 h at 37 °C in digestion buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.2% SDS). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). Routinely, nonreducing SDS-PAGE was performed, because the vasopressin prohormone and its products gave sharper bands and thus a better separation under nonreducing conditions. Because the MW-SDS-17S marker (Sigma) used as a molecular mass marker was defined for reducing gels, we first show one gel run under reducing conditions to prove that the absence of reduction does not change the migration positions of the vasopressin prohormone products compared with the marker. In addition, because the separation between the vasopressin prohormone and the slightly slower migrating background band from the medium was better on reducing gels, we used reducing SDS-PAGE when we wanted to focus at the vasopressin prohormone (in case of the endoglycosidase H digestions). Protein gels were dried, and radioactive bands were detected by analysis on a BAS1000 phosphoimager (Fujix). Regulated secretion was analyzed for radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled proteins. For analysis of radiolabeled proteins, cells were cultured and metabolically labeled for 24 h, the medium was removed, and cells were washed twice and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mmNaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose) with or without 3 mm barium chloride (21Dittie A.S. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Proteins were recovered from cells and incubation buffer by immunoprecipitation. For analysis of nonradiolabeled proteins, the regulated secretion assay was the same, but the incubation buffer from two wells was pooled, and vasopressin was extracted as described (30van Wimersma Greidanus T.B. Janssen S. Frankhuijzen-Sierevogel J.C. Maigret C. van de Heijning B.J. Neuropeptides. 1996; 30: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The amount of vasopressin was determined by a radioimmunoassay using the W1 antiserum, recognizing primarily the processed form of vasopressin (25Liu B. Burbach J.P. Peptides. 1987; 8: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Only in the absence of processed vasopressin, W1 also recognizes some vasopressin precursor (this paper). With the aid of two transfected cell lines expressing similar amounts of vasopressin prohormone but either performing or lacking processing of the vasopressin prohormone, we determined the recognition of the vasopressin prohormone by W1 in a radioimmunoassay to be at least 45 times less (≤2.2%) than that of processed vasopressin (data not shown). Cells were grown on coverslips and transiently transfected for 48 h. Fixation and immunofluorescence were performed as described (31Bottger G. Nagelkerken B. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29191-29197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32de Bree F.M. Burbach J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed with a 1:1000 dilution of the HenryK antiserum followed by a 1:300 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories) and with a 1:50 dilution of the 1D3 monoclonal (hybridoma supernatant) or 1:4000 dilution of NM4, followed by a 1:2400 dilution of Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The coverslips were mounted with DABCO/Mowiol and examined with a 63× planapo objective on a Leitz DMIRB fluorescence microscope (Leica, Voorburg, The Netherlands) interfaced with a Leica TCS4D confocal scanning laser microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). For each photograph a series of eight recordings of one section through the cell was averaged. To detect the presence of nontransfected cells after single staining with fluorescein, auto-immunofluorescence was recorded in the cy3 channel at high detector amplifications. We selected five familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus mutations (two mutations of the Glu47 residue of neurophysin implicated in binding of vasopressin (NP47E→G and NP47ΔE) and three mutations of glycine residues in neurophysin (NP14G→R, NP57G→S, and NP65G→V) (Fig.1 B)) and stably expressed wild type and mutant prohormone genes in the neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2A. After metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation with an antiserum against neurophysin, we obtained wild type proteins of 20 and 10.6 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4), correlating well with the calculated molecular masses for the glycosylated vasopressin prohormone (approximately 20 kDa) and the intermediate processing product vasopressin-neurophysin (11.2 kDa). Indeed, immunoprecipitation with a panel of antibodies against different moieties of the prohormone, demonstrated that the 20-kDa protein contained vasopressin (VP), neurophysin (NP), and glycopeptide (GP), whereas the 10.6-kDa protein contained only VP and NP. In addition, a minor labeled protein of 9 kDa, correlating well with the calculated mass for neurophysin (9.8 kDa), was recovered for the wild type (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Whereas the prohormone and VP-NP were present in both cells and medium, the 9.8-kDa protein was retained intracellularly. The data show that in Neuro-2A cells, the wild type human vasopressin prohormone was efficiently processed to VP-NP but only to a very limited extent to fully processed neurophysin. As for many cell lines, the prohormone and the incompletely processed product were partially secreted via the constitutive pathway. The fate of the mutant prohormones differed considerably from that of the wild type prohormone in two aspects. First, processing of the mutant prohormones to VP-NP was severely impaired. Second, the amount of neurophysin-containing protein secreted was strongly reduced (Fig.2 A, even lanes). As a result, most of the mutant prohormone remained in the cells in an unprocessed form. Processing and secretion were impaired to different extents among the different mutants. The reduction in processing and secretion was largest for the NP14G→R and NP65G→V mutations in which both processing to VP-NP and secretion of prohormone into the medium were virtually absent (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5, 6,13, and 14). The NP57G→S mutant displayed a relatively efficient processing and secretion (Fig. 2 A,lanes 11 and 12), and NP47E→G and NP47ΔE showed an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–10). Neuro-2A cells express low levels of the (neuro)endocrine-specific prohormone convertases PC1 and PC2 (33Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Day R. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), both of which are expressed in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus (34Seidah N.G. Marcinkiewicz M. Benjannet S. Gaspar L. Beaubien G. Mattei M.G. Lazure C. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 35Birch N.P. Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Mezey E. Neuropeptides. 1994; 27: 307-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because this might be the cause of the incomplete processing observed for the wild type vasopressin prohormone, we stably transfected wild type and mutant prohormones in PC12/PC2 cells, stably expressing mouse PC2 (21Dittie A.S. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Three wild type neurophysin-containing proteins, migrating with apparent molecular masses of approximately 20, 10.5, and 8.5 kDa, were obtained (Fig.3 A, lane 3) and identified as respectively the prohormone, VP-NP, and NP (Fig.3 B). Although processing of the wild type prohormone was not complete in the PC12/PC2 cells, a significant amount of neurophysin was produced (Fig. 3 A, lane 3 and 4). In contrast to the prohormone and the VP-NP intermediate product that were efficiently secreted via the constitutive secretory pathway, neurophysin was mainly stored intracellularly, suggesting its transport to the regulated secretory pathway. For the mutant prohormones, constitutive secretion was reduced (Fig.3 A, even lanes), and the severity of this reduction followed the same order as observed in the Neuro-2A cells (NP65G→V ≥ NP14G→R > NP47ΔE ≥ NP47E→G > NP57G→S). With the exception of the NP14G→R and NP65G→V mutants, processing to neurophysin was observed for the mutant prohormones, and this fully processed product was selectively retained intracellularly. However, the efficiency of neurophysin formation was diminished, and a clear correlation between the extent of decrease in constitutive secretion and that of neurophysin formation was observed, suggesting these two defects to be coupled. We conclude that for the mutant prohormones NP47E→G, NP47ΔE, and NP57G→S, processing to neurophysin can occur. To establish the time course of processing and secretion, pulse-chase experiments were performed in PC12/PC2 cells for the wild type, one moderately deficient (NP47E→G) and one severely deficient (NP65G→V) mutant prohormone (Fig.4, A, B, andC, respectively). The wild type prohormone was rapidly processed to VP-NP, which was followed by conversion to neurophysin (Fig. 4 A). Secretion of prohormone and VP-NP, and to a smaller extent neurophysin, into the medium occurred rapidly in the absence of a stimulus, consistent with this secretion being constitutive. The moderately deficient NP47E→G prohormone demonstrated a delay in secretion, with the maximum amount of prohormone in the medium appearing only after 4 h of chase as compared with 1 h for the wild type (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, processing of this mutant prohormone displayed a similar delay. Whereas the amount of wild type VP-NP in cells and medium is maximal after 1 h of chase, for the NP47E→G prohormone this point is only reached after 4 h of chase. Even so, the first neurophysin appeared after 20 h of chase for the mutant, as compared with 4 h for the wild type (Fig. 4, A and B). The severely deficient NP65G→V prohormone was neither secreted nor processed during the 20-h chase period, as indicated by the lack of appearance of prohormone in the medium and the lack of biosynthesis of the mutant VP-NP and NP proteins (Fig. 4 C). Despite this, only a small amount of prohormone remained after 20 h of chase, indicating a slow intracellular degradation of the mutant prohormone. Based on the data it is concluded that the investigated mutations either delay or abrogate processing and secretion of the mutant prohormones. The biosynthesis and storage of the fully processed neurophysin of several mutants suggested that the mutant prohormones were sorted at least in part to the regulated secretory pathway in PC12/PC2 cells. To test this, regulated secretion was stimulated in metabolically labeled cells expressing either the wild type or the NP47E→G mutant prohormone. Because PC12 cells do not always contain sufficient amounts of voltage-gated calcium channels (36Lang T. Wacker I. Steyer J. Kaether C. Wunderlich I. Soldati T. Gerdes H.H. Almers W. Neuron. 1997; 18: 857-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), secretion was induced by 3 mm BaCl2. Barium ions permeate the cell easier than calcium ions and once inside can substitute for calcium in inducing release of secretory granules (37Verhage M. Hens J.J. De Graan P.N. Boomsma F.

BaCl2 evoked secretion of approximately 50% of wild type prohormone, VP-NP and NP (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–4). Evoked secretion of VP-NP and NP was as efficient fo"

Although both MafK and MafG are expressed in overlapping but distinct tissue distribution patterns during embryonic development, the physiological consequences of loss-of-function mutations in either gene are modest. This suggested that compensation by the third small Maf protein, MafF, might be a major reason for such mild phenotypes and that further analysis of MafF might therefore provide important insights for understanding small Maf regulatory function(s). We therefore cloned, mapped, transcriptionally and developmentally characterized, and finally disrupted themafF gene. We show that murine mafF is transcriptionally regulated by three different promoters and is most abundantly expressed in the lung. The lacZ gene inserted into the mafF locus revealed prominent expression sites in the gut, lung, liver, outflow tract of the heart, cartilage, bone membrane, and skin but not in hematopoietic cells at any developmental stage. Homozygous mafF null mutant mice were born in a normal Mendelian ratio and displayed no obvious functional deficiencies, indicating that MafF activity may be dispensable even in tissues where the expression of other small Maf proteins is quite low.

How a single cell differentiates into a variety of different tissues and organs to form a coherent multicellular organism is the central question of developmental biology. Transcription factors have been shown both genetically and biochemically to be key mediators of cellular differentiation, because they bind to specific DNA sequences to activate specific target gene transcription and often appear to be direct targets of cellular responses to inductive queues from the environment. The c-Maf transcription factor, originally discovered as a retrovirally transduced oncogene (1Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), was the founding member of a family of six related proteins that have been identified in vertebrate organisms. All of the Maf family members possess a conserved basic region closely flanked by a heptad repeat motif (bZip), which mediates DNA binding and dimer formation, respectively. These proteins commonly recognize a specific palindromic sequence, TGCTGACTCAGCA or TGCTGACGTCAGCA, called a MARE (mafrecognition element (2Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar)) through which they potentiate tissue-specific gene transcription. The Maf family is subdivided according to molecular size. The large Maf proteins, c-Maf, MafB, and NRL, have similar conserved sequence domains and also possess potent trans-activation sequences (2Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Swaroop A. Xu J. Pawar H. Jackson A. Scolnick C. Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The small Maf proteins, MafF, MafG, and MafK, do not possesstrans-activation activity, and indeed these three genes encode proteins with little more than the basic and heptad repeat motifs, which identify them as members of the Maf protein family (6Fujiwara K. Kataoka T.K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar,7Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The small Mafs can affect transcription either by forming heterodimers with other bZip factors or by forming homodimers and heterodimers among themselves. When two small Maf proteins homo- or heterodimerize, they bind to MAREs and negatively regulate transcription, either indirectly, by competitively inhibiting the binding of activating molecules, or directly, by repressing transcription from the basal apparatus (8Nagai T. Igarashi K. Akasaka J. Furuyama K. Fujita H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Sassa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5358-5365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Over the last several years, three groups of small Maf interacting molecules, which can form either productive or unproductive complexes, have been described (3Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 9Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The most physiologically important of these partner molecules are probably the vertebrate CNC 1The abbreviations used are: CNC, Cap'n‘Collar protein; ES, embryonic stem cells; RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; kbp, kilobase pair(s); nls, nuclear localization signal; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; dpc, days post-coitus; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism transcription factors (p45, Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3), so named originally for their sequence homology to the DrosophilaCap'n‘Collar protein (10Mohler J. Vani K. Leung S. Epstein A. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In general, the small Maf proteins heterodimerize with CNC family members to generate strong transcriptional activators, whereas CNC homodimers will not bind to MARE sequences (e.g. 11). MafK and p45 form a heterodimer that was the founding member of this family of vertebrate transcription factors called NF-E2 (12Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H.

Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Although p45 was originally believed to be important for erythroid-specific gene transcription, it has subsequently been shown to have a far more profound effect on megakaryopoiesis (15Shivdasani R.A.

The second group of small Maf-interacting proteins are the Bach factors (Bach1 and Bach2), which recent experiments suggest may be more important for their affects on chromatin assembly rather than on transcription per se (16Oyake T.

Finally, the small Maf proteins as well as some of the large Mafs and CNC proteins can also form heterodimers with Fos and Jun family members (2Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol.

Loss of function mutants for several of the CNC proteins have been generated by targeted mutagenesis in embryonic stem (ES) cells followed by the generation of germ line mutant mice. p45 mutant mice displayed impaired platelet formation but little disturbance of erythropoiesis (15Shivdasani R.A.

Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Because all three of these CNC proteins are capable of activating transcription from MARE elements in tissue culture co-transfection assays, the lack of prominent erythroid phenotypes in any of the mutant mice indicated that these activities could be compensating for one another in erythroid cells. This conclusion in turn indicated that unraveling the transcriptional responses mediated by individual MARE-binding proteins was going to be complicated. To clarify in vivo functions of this extensively interacting regulatory network, we previously described null mutations in both the murine mafG and mafK loci. These studies showed that the mafK loss of function resulted in no discernable phenotype in homozygous mutant animals (24Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3514-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2164-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereasmafG mutant mice displayed both hematopoietic and behavioral deficiencies (25Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2164-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mafK- andmafG-directed expression patterns (following insertion oflacZ into both chromosomal loci) showed, to our surprise, that both factors were expressed in highly tissue-restricted spatial and temporal patterns during embryonic development. This analysis clearly contradicted our earlier perception that the small Maf proteins were ubiquitously expressed (13Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26Igarashi K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7445-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the lack of severe phenotypes in these mutant mice implied that the pattern of expression of the small Maf proteins might be extensively overlapping, suggesting that one small Maf might be able to compensate for the loss of another during development. If this hypothesis was correct, it would be very difficult to ascribe specific functional roles to individual small Maf family members because the effects of mutation of one protein would be masked by the expression of another. To complete the initial analysis of this family to determine the contribution(s) of the small Maf proteins to this growing regulatory network, we cloned and characterized the gene encoding the third small Maf protein, mafF. MafF, like MafK and MafG, is expressed in a highly tissue-restricted pattern during embryonic development and is also found in some tissues that overlap expression of the other small Mafs in pattern, but it is also unique to a subset of tissues where the other proteins do not significantly accumulate. HomozygousmafF mutant mice were viable and apparently normal and healthy. The data show that although MafF, like MafK and MafG, is expressed in a distinct pattern during development, its loss of function in vivo is probably fully compensated (3Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The mafF gene was cloned from a 129/SvJ genomic DNA library in λFix vector (Stratagene). The chicken mafF cDNA clone (6Fujiwara K. Kataoka T.K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a probe under low stringency screening conditions. Filter hybridization was carried out in 50% formamide, 5× SSC (0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 1× Denhart's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C overnight. Filters were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 37 °C for 1 h. Positive clones were purified by three additional plaque purifications. The threemafF phage clones were subcloned into the XbaI site of Bluescript II (Stratagene). DNA sequences were determined by automated analysis (ABI, model 373A). Sequences of the murinemafF and mafG clones are available from Genbank™ (accession numbers AB009694 and AB009693, respectively). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) assays were performed utilizing the Marathon cDNA amplification kit following the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). The sequences of the gene-specific primers (mMafF-F2 and mMafF-F1 nested primers) are shown in Table I. RACE products were subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and their sequences were determined as described above.Table ISmall Maf oligonucleotide primers5′-RACEmMafF-F1:TTC AGG GCT TTG GTG GAT AAG GGA TCC AmMafF-F2:TGT TCT CGC TCA ACT CGC GCT TGA CCT TRT-PCRmMafF-P:(FAM)-TGA AGG TCA AGC GCG AGT TGA GC-(TAMRA)mMafF-F:GTG GAT CCC TTA TCC AGC AAA GmMafF-R:CAT CAG CGC TTC ATC CGAmMafG-P:(FAM)-TAA AGG TGA AGC GGG AGC CAG G-(TAMRA)mMafG-F:CCC AAT AAA GGA AAC AAG GCCmMafG-R:TCG CAC CGA CAT GGT TAC CmMafK-P:(FAM)-AGG CAT TGA AGG TCA AGA AGG AGG CG-(TAMRA)mMafK-F:GAC AGG GCC CGG GTT ATGmMafK-R:AGC TCA TCA TCG CTA AGA ACA GGmmfu1:AGA GGT CAT CTT CTG CGA AAmmfd1:CAG CTT GTC CAC CTC ACG CT Open table in a new tab DNA was obtained from the ([C57Bl/6JEi × SPRET/Ei]F1 × SPRET/Ei) interspecific backcross panel generated by The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine; Jackson BSS). For the mafF locus, a 1.0-kbp XbaI fragment 5′ to the second exon was used to detect a TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The more intensely hybridizing Mus spretus and C57Bl/6J bands were 6.5 kbp and 1.9 kbp, respectively, with 0.9 and 8.0 kbp faintly hybridizing fragments. TaqI digestion of DNA from each of 94 N2 progeny was performed, followed by electrophoresis and blotting to a Nylon membrane. Hybridization and washing were performed using standard conditions. For the mafG locus, a 5.3-kbpBamHI fragment that spanned the second and third exons was used to detect the TaqI RFLP. The M. spretusfragment was 4.0 kbp, whereas C57Bl/6J DNA showed two bands of 1.9 and 1.7 kbp. In addition, there was a nonpolymorphic 1.3-kbp hybridizing band. The typing data for the segregation of these two polymorphisms were submitted to The Jackson Laboratory Backcross DNA panel mapping resource and compared with approximately 3000 loci that had already been mapped. Linkage was observed for mafF to markers on chromosome 15 and for mafG to the distal end of chromosome 11. 2http://lena.jax.org/. To generate themafF ES cell targeting vector, a 7.8-kbpSpeI-BamHI genomic fragment and a 1.9-kbpSphI-XbaI fragment were used. This replacement strategy removes a 1.1-kbp BamHI-SphI fragment that includes the entire mafF coding sequence except for the first three amino acids. In the first step of the cloning strategy, nuclearlocalization signal (nls)-lacZ was introduced 3′ to the 7.8-kbp SpeI-BamHI fragment, producing plasmid p7.8SB-nls-lacZ. To confirm that no mutations were introduced during cloning, the insert was sequenced to ensure that the nls-lacZ gene would be translated in-frame from the mafF initiation codon. Simultaneously, aloxP-flanked MC1promoter-neomycin resistance gene-poly(A)-MC1promoter-thymidinekinase-poly(A) (called MC1 neoMC1tk (25Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2164-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)) cassette and a MC1promoter-diphtheria toxin (MC1-DT (27Yagi T. Nada S. Watanabe N. Tamemoto H. Kohmura N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)) cassette were cloned 5′ and 3′ to the 1.9-kbpSphI-XbaI genomic fragment, producing ploxPMC1neoMC1tk-1.9SX-DT. To minimize the possibility of affecting nls-lacZ expression, the loxPMC1neoMC1tk cassette was introduced in reverse orientation with respect to mafF. In the second cloning step, the insert of p7.8SB-nls-lacZ was introduced into ploxPMC1neoMC1tk-1.9SX-DT, producing the finalmafF targeting vector. The targeting vector was linearized and introduced into R1 ES cells (28Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow N.W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) by electroporation. Recombined ES cells were selected for G418 resistance (215 μg of active component/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). After 8 days of selection, G418-resistant colonies were picked and subjected to PCR screening. After confirming homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis, positive ES cell clones were aggregated with CD-1 eight-cell stage embryos. After overnight culture, the blastocysts were transferred into the uterus of pseudopregnant foster females. Fourteen highly chimeric 129/Sv+c+pJ/CD-1 mice (>80%) male mice were born starting with four different ES cell clones. To confirm germ line transmission, the chimeric mice were intercrossed to CD1 females. Three of the ten chimeric animals transmitted the mutation through the germ line, and each was derived from a different ES cell clone. F1 and F2 heterozygous mafF mutants were intercrossed to determine any effects on viability, and the resulting pups were genotyped by PCR. The results were the same for all threemafF mutant lines. We removed the MC1neoMC1tk cassette using Cre-loxP-mediated recombination, because the MC1 promoter 5′ to the neomycin or thymidine kinase genes could, in principal, affect nls-lacZ expression from the endogenousmafF promoter. For this purpose, we injected a Cre expression plasmid into fertilized eggs recovered from mafFheterozygous mutant females (CD1 background (33Tanimoto K. Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Nature. 1999; 398: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)). The resulting pups were analyzed for the presence or absence of the MC1neoMC1tk cassette by Southern blotting (data not shown). One mouse (line 801) was found to have precisely excised the positive selection cassette after Cre treatment, and after one additional backcross, lacZ expression was also analyzed in this line. For the detection of mRNA expression, we used real time PCR analysis using a probe labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye (TaqMan probe). It was demonstrated that this analysis provides a quantitative measurement for mRNA levels (29Gilson U.E.M. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). cDNAs were synthesized from the RNA samples using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II; Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamer oligonucleotide primers. TaqMan probes, primers, and cDNAs were added to the master mixture that contained all reagents for PCR (Perkin-Elmer). Standard curves for MafF, MafG, MafK, and ribosomal RNA were generated by serial dilution of cDNA derived from intestine RNA. Sequences of the probes and primers are described in Table I. The primers for detection of MafF cDNA were mMafF-F and mMafF-R, and the probe was mMafF-P. mMafG-F, mMafG-R (primers), and mMafG-P (probe) were used for MafG. mMafK-F, mMafK-R (primers), and mMafK-P (probe) were used for MafK. The ribosomal RNA primers and probe (TaqMan Ribosomal RNA control reagents) were purchased from Perkin-Elmer. The relative increase in reporter fluorescent dye emission because of the progression of the PCR reaction was monitored in real time by the 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Signals were analyzed by the sequence detector 1.6 program (Perkin-Elmer). PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min. For RT-PCR analysis of mafF mutants, another set of primers (mmfu1 and mmfd1; Table I) were used. The anticipated product size for the mafF amplicon was 299 bp. Reactions were performed in 1× Perkin-Elmer PCR buffer (containing 1.5 mm MgCl2), 0.2 mm each dNTPs, 0.4 μm each primer, and 0.03 units/μl AmpliTaq Gold. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 5 s (Ramp 30 s), and 72 °C for 30 s. for 30 cycles. For Southern blots, a 0.4-kbp XbaI-KpnI fragment located outside of the targeting vector was used as a probe. The hybridization and washing conditions were described previously (25Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2164-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To confirm homologous recombination in ES cells, five different restriction enzyme digests using three different probes were employed for Southern analysis. Noon of the day that vaginal plugs were detected is taken as e (embryonic day) 0.5 or 0.5 dpc (days post-coitus). The fixation and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside staining conditions were described previously (25Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2164-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thin tissue sections marking MafF expression were counterstained with eosin, whereas those displaying the MafG and MafK patterns were counterstained with nuclear fast red. All threemafF mutant lines, including one in which the neo gene was removed by cre excision, were analyzed for lacZ expression. There were no expression differences detected among any of themafF lines. The murine mafF locus was cloned from a 129/SvJ genomic DNA library using a chicken MafF cDNA (6Fujiwara K. Kataoka T.K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar) and screening under low stringency conditions. Three recombinants were identified, and all three were found to overlap the mafFlocus. After detailed structural analysis (below), the murinemafF gene exons II and III were found to comprise the entire coding region. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the chicken MafF protein revealed 84% overall identity and less homology to other small Maf proteins, suggesting that this was indeed the mouse counterpart of chicken mafF (Fig.1). To determine the transcriptional initiation site for MafF mRNA, 5′-RACE analysis was performed (“Experimental Procedures”). Exon Ib was found using adult lung mRNA as the initial template, and two additional first exons called Ia and Ic (as well as Ib) were found when 16.5 dpc whole embryo mRNA was used as the initial reverse transcriptase substrate (Fig. 2). The proximal promoter sequence of mafF exon Ib shows extensive homology with the chicken mafF first exon. 3K. Onodera, J. A. Shavit, H. Motohashi, F. Katsuoka, J. Akasaka, J. D. Engel, and M. Yamamoto, our unpublished observations. We conclude that the murine mafF locus is organized with two coding exons, in similar fashion to the mafG and mafK genes, but that three different promoters are alternatively spliced to the common exon II to generate three MafF mRNAs that encode the same protein product. Interspecific backcross mapping was employed to map the chromosomal position of themafF locus. A TaqI RFLP was used for screening an interspecific backcross panel generated by The Jackson Laboratory (“Experimental Procedures”). After Southern blotting of the DNA from 94 backcross progeny, the results were submitted to a data base search containing approximately 3000 previously typed markers from the same backcross, thereby placing the mafF locus on chromosome 15 (Fig. 3). At the same time, we also determined that the mafG locus was on mouse chromosome 11 (Fig. 3). Together with a prior report describing the position of themafK locus on chromosome 5 (30Peters L.L. Eicher E.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 490-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), these data complete the chromosomal positioning of all three small maf genes. Neither of the positions corresponds to a murine locus or human disease phenotype that might be because of the loss of mafF ormafG function (below). To generate mafF null mutant mice, a targeting vector was designed as depicted in Fig.4 A. Except for the first three amino acids, the entire coding region of mafF was deleted by substitution with an in-frame lacZ fusion bearing a nuclear localization sequence (“Experimental Procedures”). At the same time, we introduced tandemly repeated loxP sites into the targeting vector, surrounding the neomycin resistance/thymidine kinase selection cassette, anticipating later excision by Cre recombinase, because it has been shown that the introduction of foreign promoters into genomic loci can disrupt normal gene regulation (e.g. Ref. 31Kim C.G. Epner E.M. Forrester W.C. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The targeting vector (“Experimental Procedures”) was electroporated into R1 ES cells, and clones were positively selected by culturing in the presence of G418. Of 240 ES cell transformants, 11 were found to be homologous recombinants by PCR and Southern blotting (Fig.4 B). Several of these ES clones were then aggregated with CD1 8-cell stage embryos to generate chimeras (32Wood S.A. Allen N.D. Rossant J. Auerbach A. Nagy A. Nature. 1993; 365: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and then F1 mice were generated by intercrossing the chimeras to CD1 females. From 10 initial chimeric males derived from the aggregation of four different ES cell clones, three transmitted the mutant allele through the germ line. F1 and subsequent generation mice heterozygous for themafF mutant allele were used for further intercross analysis. All three lines (in addition to a fourth, in which the positive selection cassette was removed by Cre microinjection into eggs of F1 backcrosses (33Tanimoto K. Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Nature. 1999; 398: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)) that were established using the three different ES cell clones gave identical genetic and expression results (below). To clarify possibly unique versuspotentially compensated MafF function(s), we analyzed lacZexpression in heterozygous or homozygous gene-targeted mafFmutant embryos as a reflection of natural MafF mRNA temporal- and tissue-specific accumulation. We then compared this pattern to those generated by the mafK- and mafG/lacZmutant embryos (25Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2164-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). LacZ expression was detected in the egg cylinder ofmafF homozygous mutant embryos as early as 6.5 dpc, in the boundary between the extraembryonic and embryonic regions (Fig.5 A). This pattern is clearly distinct from that conferred by the mafG gene, which is expressed strongest in the embryonic region, and mafK, which is far more abundant in extraembryonic tissue. At 8.5 dpc,mafF/lacZ was weakly expressed in the future gut, allantois, and yolk sac endoderm but more strongly in the ectoplacental cone (Fig.5 B). Once again this pattern is in contrast tomafG expression at the same stage, which is strongly expressed throughout the embryo proper, whereas mafKexpression is strong in the yolk sac endoderm and ectoplacental cone (25Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2164-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At 9.5 dpc, strong mafF expression was observed in the primordial gut (Fig. 5 C) and presumptive fetal liver (not shown), in the floorplate of the myelencephalon as well as in neural crest cells (not shown), and in spongiotrophoblasts and giant c"
https://openalex.org/W2003633706,"We analyzed a mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the human insulin gene by cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) through four cyclic AMP response elements (CREs). We isolated two novel CREM isoforms (CREMΔQ1 and CREMΔQ2), which lack one of the glutamine-rich domains, Q1 and Q2 respectively, and six known isoforms (CREMτα, CREMα, inducible cyclic AMP early repressor (ICER) I, ICER Iγ, CREM-17X, and CREM-17) from rat pancreatic islets and the RINm5F pancreatic β-cell line. CREM isoforms functioned as efficient transcriptional activators or repressors to modulate insulin promoter activity by binding to all of the insulin CREs. The binding activity of repressors is higher than that of activators and suppressed not only basal activity but also activator-induced activities. Furthermore, CREM activator interacted directly with the transcription factor IID components hTAFII130 and TATA box-binding protein (TBP). These results suggest that the activation of the insulin gene transcription by CREM activator is mediated by not only direct binding to the CREs but also by recruiting transcription factor IID to the insulin promoter via its interaction with hTAFII130 and TBP. On the other hand, the CREM repressor ICER competitively interrupts the binding of the activators to CREs and does not interact with either TBP or hTAFII130; therefore, it might fail to stabilize the basal transcriptional machinery and repress transactivation.

Insulin gene transcription is regulated throughcis-acting elements in response to stimulation, such as glucose concentration or increased cAMP level (1Sander M. German M.S. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). One of thecis-acting elements, cAMP response element (CRE), 1The abbreviations used are: CRE, cyclic AMP response element; CREM, cyclic AMP response element modulator; CREB, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; ICER, inducible cyclic AMP early repressor; nt, nucleotide(s); TBP, TATA box-binding protein; hTBP, human TBP; TAF, TBP-associated factor; hTAF, human TAF; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was first identified as an inducible enhancer of genes that can be transcribed in response to increased cAMP levels (2Comb M.

In a previous study, we identified four functional CREs in the human insulin gene and demonstrated that each of these CREs has different sequences from the others and also from the consensus CRE motif (TGACGTCA) (4Inagaki N. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Ishii S. Seino Y. Imura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since a remarkable reduction of insulin gene transcription is observed when CREs are mutated (4Inagaki N. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Ishii S. Seino Y. Imura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), transcription factors that bind to this regulatory element might play an important role in the regulation of insulin gene transcription. However, which transcription factors are primarily involved in the regulation of insulin gene transcription through CREs is unclear. Transcription factors such as CREB, CRE-BP1, and ATF1, which belong to the ATF/CREB family, bind to CRE (5Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F.

CRE modulator (CREM) is a member of this family, and the CREM gene generates both transcriptional activators (CREMτ, -τα, -τ1, and -τ2) and repressors (CREMα, CREMβ, CREMγ, S-CREM, CREM-17X, and CREM-17) by alternative splicing (9Sassone-Corsi P.

In addition, use of an intronic promoter (P2) generates inducible cAMP early repressors (ICERs) (15Stehle J.H. Foulkes N.S. Molina C.A. Simonneaux V. Pévet P. Sassone-and Corsi P.

CREMτ and CREMτα contain the phosphorylation domain (P-box) and two glutamine-rich domains (Q1 and Q2), which may be essential for gene activation and function as transcriptional activators. The CREM repressors, CREMα, -β, and -γ, contain the P-box but lack both Q1 and Q2. Thus, by a shuffling of exons, various combinations of functional domains are generated, and a large number of functionally different CREM isoforms are produced (12Laoide B.M. Foulkes N.S.

We identified two novel CREM isoforms, CREMΔQ1 and CREMΔQ2, and six known isoforms in pancreatic islets and the pancreatic β-cell line. We demonstrated that these isoforms regulated insulin gene transcription by binding to CREs and that CREM and its phosphorylation were involved in glucose-induced insulin promoter activity. We showed the direct interaction between CREM isoforms and the TFIID component, hTAFII130 or TBP, suggesting a mechanism by which CREM isoforms might regulate insulin gene transcription. Wistar rat pancreas embedded in paraffin was cut into serial sections at 3.5 μm. For immunocytochemistry, the avidin-biotin complex method with alkaline-phosphatase was used as described previously (30Hsu S.M. Raine N. Fanger H. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1981; 75: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, normal goat serum (diluted to 1:75; DAKO, Kyoto, Japan) for the inhibition of nonspecific binding of secondary antibody, the anti-CREM polyclonal antibody (diluted to 1:500; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or the anti-insulin polyclonal antibody (diluted to 1:500; DAKO), biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG serum (diluted to 1:300; DAKO), and avidin-biotin-alkaline phosphatase complex (diluted to 1:100; DAKO) were sequentially applied. Staining was visualized by alkaline phosphatase substrate (red) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). A section of rat testis was used as a positive control for CREM. Anti-CREM polyclonal antibody was raised against recombinant mouse CREMτ expressed in Escherichia coli. For each experiment, about 5000 islets were isolated from the pancreases of 12 Wistar rats by collagenase digestion (31Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Satomi S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), followed by purification on Ficoll gradients. Total RNA was isolated from freshly isolated islets by the guanidium thiocyanate-cesium chloride method (32Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) and were used as a template for cDNA synthesis (Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Rat pancreatic islet cDNA and the pancreatic β-cell line RINm5F (33Oie H.K. Gazdar A.F. Minna B. Wier G.C. Baylin S.F. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) cDNA were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using rat CREM-specific oligonucleotides. To exclude any amplification product derived from genomic DNA that could contaminate the RNA preparation, total RNA without reverse transcription was amplified as a negative control. The sequences of the 5′ primers for the full-length of CREM and ICER were as follows: primer a, 5′-CCGTATGACCATGGAAACAG-3′ (nt 5–24, Ref. 34Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); primer b, 5′-ATGGCTGTAACTGGAGATGA-3′ (nt 1–20, Ref. 15Stehle J.H. Foulkes N.S. Molina C.A. Simonneaux V. Pévet P. Sassone-and Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 365: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), respectively. The sequence of the 3′ primer (primer c) was 5′-CAGGTCCAAGTCAAACACAG-3′ (nt 1054–1035). Exon-specific primers were set to determine the expression of each isoform. The sequences of the isoform-specific 5′ primers for CREM were as follows: primer d, 5′-TCTAGCTCAGGTTTCTGTAG-3′ (nt 113–132); primer e, 5′-TCTAGCTCAGGTAGCAACAA-3′ (nt 113–122, nt 270–279). Sequences of the 3′ primers were as follows: primer f, 5′-GTCTCCTCATCTTGAACAAC-3′ (nt 706–687); primer g, 5′-GTCTCCTCATTGTATTGCCC-3′ (nt 706–697, nt 507–498). Primers a, b, c, d, e, f, and g correspond to Fig. 1 B. Each DNA fragment was subcloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II SK(+), and the sequences were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure. The full-length sequences of the CREM isoforms, CREMτα, CREMΔQ1, CREMΔQ2, CREMα, ICER I, and ICER Iγ, were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression plasmid. Mutation of CREMτα serine 117 to alanine, S117ACREMτα, was constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site mutagenesis using an in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) and the following nucleotide primer: 5′-TCACGAAGACCCGCATATAGAAAA-3′ (boldface denotes the mutation). The sequences of the activation domains were as follows: primer h, 5′-GGTAGCAACAATTGCAGAGA-3′ (nt 270–289), primer i, 5′-GATTGCTATAGCCCAAGGTGG-3′ (nt 508–527); primer j, 5′- TTAGTATTGCCCCGTGCTAGTC-3′ (nt 507–488); primer k, 5′-TTATTGAACAACAACCTGGCT-3′ (nt 696–677). Primers h, i, j, and k correspond to Fig. 3. DNA fragments of P, Q2, PQ2, and S117APQ2 (mutation of CREMτα serine 117 to alanine) were subcloned in frame to the 3′-end of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in plasmid pCG4. The control pCG4 was generated by introducing the coding sequence for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) from pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter in plasmid pCMV6c.Figure 3Transcriptional activity of the activation domain. To investigate the function of the P domain and Q2 domain, P domain alone, Q2 domain alone, and the combination of P and Q2 domain (PQ2) were fused in-frame to the 3′-end of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (black box) in plasmid pCG4. To further examine if the phosphorylation is involved, Ser117 was mutated by Ala (S117APQ2). The arrows, h–k, represent the positions of the synthetic oligonucleotide primers used. Exons E and F correspond to the phosphorylation (P) domain, and exon G corresponds to the glutamine-rich (Q) domain, Q2. The asterisk in exon E represents a serine residue at position 117 (Ser117), which is the target for the phosphorylation.

Diabetologia. 1986; 29: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfections in HIT-T15 cells were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Briefly, the media were switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum 4 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with a mixture of 12 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid, pHI-luc, which contains human insulin gene promoter (nt −339 to +112; Ref. 4Inagaki N. Maekawa T. Sudo T.

For CREB and ΔCREB expression plasmid, human CREB and ΔCREB cDNA were amplified from human liver cDNA and were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression plasmid. The sequence of the 5′ primer was 5′-ATGACCATGGAATCTGGAGC-3′ (nt 144–163; Ref. 37Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the sequence of the 3′ primer was 5′-TTAATCTGATTTGTGGCAGT-3′ (nt 1169–1150). Expression plasmids of CREB, ΔCREB, and CRE-BP1 (7Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S.

To analyze promoter activity stimulated by glucose, cells were treated with various concentration of glucose. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared for luciferase assays and β-galactosidase assays. β-Galactosidase assays were performed for internal control. All transfection experiments were repeated more than three times. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out to measure binding activity of CREMτα, CREMΔQ2, and ICER Iγ to the human insulin CREs with double-stranded oligonucleotide probes. For production of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, the DNA fragments of CREMτα, CREMΔQ2, and ICER Iγ were subcloned into pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and transformed into E. colistrains M15. Following induction of protein expression with isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside, the GST fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. To check the size of products, the proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining following fractionation by SDS-PAGE. Cy5-labeled DNA probes and 0–1.5 μg/μl proteins were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Electrophoreses were performed at 15 °C, at 38 milliamps constant current, and the binding activity was analyzed using an ALF DNA sequencer.

HIT-T15 cells were harvested and were suspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 22 mm EDTA, 1% Trasilol). Cell lysis was sonicated in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After removal of insoluble debris by centrifugation, supernatants were loaded on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with anti TBP-antibody (diluted to 1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at 37 °C. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 37 °C. Each of these steps was followed by three washes for 10 min in 5% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline. Detection was performed as described in the ECL protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid encoding human TAFII130 (hTAFII130) cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. N. Tanese (New York University). Human TBP (hTBP) cDNA was amplified from human liver cDNA. The sequence of the 5′ primer was 5′-ATGGATCAGAACAACAGCCT-3′ (nt 242–261; Ref. 38Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and the sequence of the 3′ primer was 5′-TTACGTCGTCTTCCTGAATC-3′ (nt 1261–1242). hTBP and hTAFII130 cDNA were subcloned into the SmaI site of pGEM 3Z and the EcoRI site of pBluescript II SK(+), respectively. hTBP and hTAFII130 proteins were synthesized in a coupled in vitrotranscription-translation system in the presence of [35S]methionine (Promega). The radioactive products were visualized by separation on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (39Tao Y. Guermah M. Martinez E.

Each assay contained GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, HIT-T15 cell extract or [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated hTBP or hTAFII130 was incubated with GST, GST-CREMτα, GST-CREMΔQ2, GST-CREMα, GST-ICER Iγ in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer. The bound proteins were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or by an anti-TBP antibody as described above. To determine if CREM is expressed in pancreatic islets, immunohistochemical studies of 8-week-old rat pancreatic islet sections were performed using anti-CREM antibody. To ascertain the specificity of the CREM antibody, a testis section was used as a positive control (data are not shown). In agreement with previous data (9Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4717-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Delmas V. Van Der Hoon F. Mellström B. Jégou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol.

Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), the expression of CREM protein was found to be restricted to round spermatides, mostly at stage VII–VIII of spermatogenesis, when the spermatozoa begin to be released into the lumen. We used two continuous rat pancreatic islet sections, one for the anti-insulin antibody (Fig.1 A, left panel) and the other for the anti-CREM antibody (Fig.1 A, right panel). Pancreatic β cells were stained red with the anti-insulin antibody. The CREM proteins were detected both in the nuclei and cytoplasm of the pancreatic islets, mainly in the pancreatic β cells. To identify which isoforms were present in the pancreatic islet cells and the pancreatic β-cell line, we performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with rat pancreatic islet cDNA and the RINm5F β-cell line cDNA using primers a–g (Fig. 1 B). We isolated eight CREM isoforms, of which two are novel isoforms and the other six are known isoforms. A schematic presentation of two novel isoforms (CREMΔQ1 and CREMΔQ2), five repressors (CREMα, ICER I, ICER Iγ, CREM-17X, and CREM-17), and an activator (CREMτα) is shown in Fig. 1 B. CREMΔQ1 and CREMΔQ2 lack one of the glutamine-rich domains (Q1 and Q2, respectively) and contain an exon Ia (DNA binding domain (DBD) I). These structures are similar to those of CREMτ2 and -τ1 (9Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4717-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Laoide B.M. Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which also lack one of the glutamine-rich domains (Q1 and Q2, respectively), and contain an exon Ib (DBD II). Previously, we have reported that CREM-17X and CREM-17 functioned as strong repressors (13Inada A. Yamada Y. Someya Y. Kubota A. Yasuda K. Ihara Y. Kagimoto S. Kuroe A. Tsuda K. Seino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To analyze the function of the other CREM isoforms in insulin gene transcription, the isolated isoforms were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression plasmid vector and were transfected into HIT-T15 cells with the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the human insulin promoter (pHI-luc). CREMτα, CREMΔQ1, and CREMΔQ2 activated insulin promoter 9-, 8-, and 2-fold, respectively (Fig.2 A). On the other hand, CREMα, ICER I, and ICER Iγ repressed the activity to about 30, 25, and 25% of controls, respectively. We then tested the abilities of the repressors, CREMα and ICER, to repress not only basal transcriptional activity but also activator-induced transcriptional activity. CREM activator induced transcriptional activity, whereas CREMα and ICER Iγ blocked this effect to about 30–50% of controls (Fig. 2,B and C). Moreover, CREMα and ICER Iγ also repressed CREB-, ΔCREB-, and CRE-BP1-induced transcriptional activity to about 30% of controls. To investigate the function of the phosphorylation (P) and glutamine-rich (Q) domains in the transcriptional activity of CREM, the P domain alone, the Q2 domain alone, and the combination of P and Q2 domains (PQ2) were fused in frame to the 3′-end of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in plasmid pCG4. To further examine if the phosphorylation is involved in CREM activation, we mutated the serine residue to alanine at position 117 in the P domain (S117APQ2), which is the target for the phosphorylation (9Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4717-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42deGroot R.P. Derua R. Goris J. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol.

Schematic presentation of GAL4-fused expression plasmids is shown (Fig. 3,left). HIT-T15 cells were transfected with the GAL4-fused expression plasmid, and the luciferase reporter plasmid containing 5xGAL4-binding sites (5xGAL4-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid). Luciferase activity increased about 6- and 13-fold in the presence of Q2 domain alone or PQ2 domains, respectively, but showed no change in the absence of Q2 domain (Fig. 3, right). The Ser to Ala mutation substantially decreased PQ2 domain activity. Glucose stimulation has been reported to increase insulin mRNA (44Hammonds P. Schofield P.N. Ashcroft S.J.H. Sutton R. Gray D.W.R. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 45Hammonds P. Schofield P.N. Ashcroft S.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We investigated whether CREM and CREB are involved in glucose-induced insulin promoter activity. To determine the involvement of the phosphorylation in CREM, Ser117 in the P domain of CREMτα was mutated by Ala (S117ACREMτα). CREMτα, CREB, and S117ACREMτα were transfected into HIT-T15 cells with pHI-luc, and the cells were treated with various concentrations of glucose. Interestingly, insulin promoter activity was increased remarkably by glucose stimulation in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of CREMτα (Fig.4 A). However, in the presence of S117ACREMτα and CREB, no significant increase in insulin promoter activity was observed by glucose stimulation, suggesting that CREM but not CREB is involved in glucose-induced insulin promoter and that the increase is dependent on Ser117. We next examined if glucose stimulation induces PQ2 domain activation; the PQ2 and S117APQ2 domains were transfected with 5xGAL4-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid, and the cells were treated with various concentrations of glucose.

Although previous experiments failed to identify the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-1β by CHO/CD14 cells, LPS did induce the expression of IL-6 mRNA and the subsequent release of the IL-6 protein. To identify additional LPS-inducible genes, a cDNA library derived from LPS-stimulated CHO/CD14 cells was screened by subtractive hybridization. Fourteen genes were found to be expressed differentially, and two were analyzed in detail: hop (Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein), which is the hamster homologue of the stress-inducible yeast gene,STI1, and clone H411, which encodes a novel LPS-inducible growth factor. In response to LPS, the expression of Hop mRNA was also increased in both the murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, as well as in primary hamster macrophages. This suggested that the up-regulation of Hop expression is part of the macrophage stress response to LPS. Clone H411 encodes a protein in the epidermal growth factor-like repeat protein family. Overexpression of H411 cDNA in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line promoted an increased growth rate, suggesting that expression of H411 is part of the proliferative cell response to LPS.

Paradoxically, the excessive production of these gene products, such as the proinflammatory cytokines (6Bayston K.F. Cohen J. J. Med. Microbiol. 1990; 31: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Sci. Am. 1992; 267: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 8Morrison D.C. Ryan L.J. Adv. Immunol. 1979; 28: 293-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), may eventually cause the septic shock syndrome. Thus, bacterial invasion and the subsequent proinflammatory response represent a major survival challenge for the host. Most studies of the biological response to infection have focused on the mononuclear phagocyte as a mediator of tissue damage. These cells express CD14, a major LPS receptor, on their surface (9Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar). A great amount of data supports the concept that mononuclear phagocytes have a special role in the pathophysiology of endotoxin-induced inflammation resulting from LPS-inducible cytokine production. Other cell types, including cells of mesenchymal origin such as epithelium, fibroblasts, and endothelium, also serve as targets for released bacterial products. To date, the data suggest that the majority of these cells use a proteolytic fragment of CD14 as a soluble LPS receptor (10Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 fibroblasts are a well characterized cell line (11Hampton R.Y. Golenbock D.T. Penman M. Krieger M. Raetz C.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) which become exquisitely sensitive to LPS, when CD14 is expressed following transfection (CHO/CD14) (12Golenbock D.T. Liu Y. Millham F.H. Freeman M.W. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22055-22059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO/CD14 cells mimic many of the responses observed in natural target cells. These responses include the inducible release of arachidonic acid metabolites (12Golenbock D.T. Liu Y. Millham F.H. Freeman M.W. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22055-22059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (13Delude R.L. Fenton M.J. Savedra Jr., R. Perera P.Y. Vogel S.N. Thieringer R. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22253-22260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPS-induced cellular activation represents a strong stress signal for cells. Among the various proteins that help cells respond to stress is a family referred to as “heat shock proteins” (Hsp). First described as being up-regulated in response to hyperthermia (14Burdon R.H. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), heat shock proteins are also induced by other environmental stressors, including UV light, mechanical trauma, or exposure to a variety of pathogens (15Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins are thought to function as protein chaperones (16Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) that act by stabilizing intermediate polypeptides during folding, assembly, and disassembly. Protein maturation requires the highly organized machinery of chaperones. A well described example is the assembly of the progesterone receptor, which involves at least eight different proteins (17Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), including Hsp70 and Hsp90, p48, and an organizing protein. This organizing protein, formerly known as p60, has recently been renamed Hop (Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein) because of its apparent function in human cells (18Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hop appears to be the human homologue of the yeast stress-inducible protein 1 (STI1) (19Honore B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), first described by Nicolet and Craig (20Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although STI1 is apparently not essential for cellular survival and growth under normal conditions, null mutants ofSTI1 have reduced target protein activity (21Chang H.C. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and survive poorly after thermal shock (20Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition to intracellular responses to external stimuli, cells may release substances that result in extracellular remodeling. The inflammatory potential of such substances may be quite different from cytokines. The type of environmental signal encoded by an extracellular growth factor, for example, may be more important for development and/or repair than for microbicidal activity. The extracellular matrix appears to be especially rich in such proteins. Many of these proteins such as fibrillin (22Maslen C.L. Corson G.M. Maddox B.K. Glanville R.W. Sakai L.Y. Nature. 1991; 352: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), Notch of Drosophila (23Wharton K.A. Johansen K.M. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1985; 43: 567-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), or transforming growth factor-β1-binding protein (24Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Moren A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) contain epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains that are crucial for proper function of the proteins (25Hewett D.R. Lynch J.R. Child A. Sykes B.C. J. Med. Genet. 1994; 31: 338-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Dietz H.C. Pyeritz R.E. Hum. Mol.

Lynch J.R. Smith R. Sykes B.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These domains consist of motifs of 35–40 amino acids, with a conserved spacing of six cysteine residues, as was first described for EGF (29Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins with EGF-like domains are often implicated in cell growth and differentiation (30Engel J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We report here that LPS induces the production of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, from CD14-bearing CHO cells, similar to responses observed in primary phagocyte cultures (31Wang M.-H. Flad H.-D.

Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 144-147PubMed Google Scholar, 35Takada H. Mihara J. Morisaki I. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 295-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Yamaji Y. Kubota T.

Periodontal Res. 1991; 26: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, when LPS-inducible gene expression was examined by the analysis of a subtractive hybridization, a number of novel genes were found to be induced. These include the STI1 homologuehop and an EGF-like protein that we have designated as “H411.” The biologic properties of these gene products suggest that they participate in the repair process that would be necessary after a septic insult. Unless otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from Sigma. All solutions used for tissue culture were provided as “pyrogen-free” by the manufacturer. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F-12 medium with l-glutamine, pyrogen-free water, and PBS were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum (<20 pg/ml LPS) was from HyClone (Logan, UT). Ciprofloxacin was a gift from Miles Pharmaceuticals (West Haven, CT). G418 was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. ReLPS was the gift of Dr. Nilofer Qureshi (Middleton Veterans Administration Hospital, Madison, WI) and was extracted with phenol from Salmonella minnesota, wild-type ReLPS. An LPS stock solution (1 mg/ml) was stored in baked glass tubes at −20 °C. LPS was sonicated in an 80-watt sonicator-bath (model G112SP1G; Laboratory Supply Co., Hicksville, NY) for 2 min prior to use. RAW 264.7 cells (TIB71) cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). CHO/CD14 and CHO/neo were engineered as described previously (12Golenbock D.T. Liu Y. Millham F.H. Freeman M.W. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22055-22059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were grown in complete medium, consisting of either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (RAW 264.7 cells) or Ham's F12 (CHO cells) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 10 μg/ml, penicillin/streptomycin 100 units, 0.1 μg/ml). All cells were grown in a saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Eight- to ten-week-old female Chinese hamsters (Cytogen Research and Development Inc., Boston) were injected with sterile 3% thioglycollate solution (Sigma). After 3–5 days, peritoneal exudate cells were collected by lavage with 10 ml of RPMI 1640. Cells were washed twice with PBS by centrifugation at 200 × g and then plated overnight in a 150-mm tissue culture dish containing RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal calf serum. The next morning, cells were washed twice with PBS. The remaining adherent cells were subjected to treatment with trypsin/versene, washed in complete medium, and counted in a hemocytometer. Cells were plated at a final density of 4 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well dish. Macrophages were stimulated with 10 ng/ml ReLPS for the indicated time points before total RNA and genomic DNA (TriReagent, Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) were isolated. Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml in CM and incubated overnight before addition of LPS. Supernatants were collected after 24 h and bioassayed for IL-6 activity using the B-9 hybridoma cell line as described (38Aarden A.L. Lansdorp P. deGroot E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Total RNA from CHO/CD14 cells or Chinese hamster peritoneal macrophages was harvested using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to manufacturer's protocol. One to two μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a volume of 20 μl using Superscript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two μl of the resulting cDNA was used in a 25-μl PCR reaction as described (39Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13338) Google Scholar). The PCR was conducted in an automatic thermal cycler (Hybaid, Franklin, MA).

The resulting 354-bp fragment was subsequently subcloned (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced at the Boston University Core Facility using an Applied Biosystems Inc. 3373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) (GenBankTM accession number AF044667). A cDNA library was constructed from CHO/CD14 cells using the ZAP Express cDNA Gigapack III Gold cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, CHO/CD14 cells were exposed to 100 ng of LPS/ml. After 4 h of stimulation, total RNA was extracted with TriReagent. Messenger RNA was purified from total RNA using the Poly(A)Ttract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Five μg of poly(A)+ mRNA were used as starting material for the library. The primary 4-h library was titered and found to contain 3.5 × 106 individual clones. The library was amplified on solid medium and assessed for quality by Southern hybridization. The percentage of GAPDH-encoding clones was approximately 0.05%, as determined by probing phagelifts on nitrocellulose with 32P-labeled GAPDH probe. To identify novel LPS-induced genes, we generated subtracted cDNA from CHO/CD14 cells that had been stimulated for 4 h with 100 ng of LPS/ml using the Subtractor Kit (Invitrogen), closely following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, mRNA from stimulated CHO/CD14 cells was purified and used to generate cDNA; contaminating mRNA was removed by alkali treatment. RNA from unstimulated CHO/CD14 cells was photobiotinylated, and 10 μg was hybridized with 1 μg of stimulated cDNA for 66 h at 42 °C. RNA/cDNA hybrids derived from both the unstimulated photobiotinylated RNA pool and the stimulated cDNA pool were then removed by adding streptavidin followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. The remaining cDNA was used as a template to generate random primed 32P-labeled DNA probe (40Ausubel F.M. Bent R. Kingston E. Moore D.D. Seidmann J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 3-22-3-23Google Scholar). Screening of the cDNA library for induced genes was performed with the subtracted probe. Thirty-five thousand plaque-forming units/plate were transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and dehydrated at 42 °C overnight. Membranes were hybridized with the labeled DNA probe (∼1 × 106cpm/ml) at 65 °C overnight, washed 3 times, and subjected to autoradiography (Kodak X-AR, Eastman-Kodak Co.) at −80 °C with intensifying screen (NEN Life Science Products). Positive clones were localized and removed from the original plates using the wide end of Pasteur pipette. The phages were re-titered and used for the second round of screening. Nineteen isolated positive clones were subsequently converted into phagemids by single clone excision. Co-infection of theEscherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF′ cells with a positive phage and a helper phage led to the excision of the phagemid vector including the original cDNA insert packaged as filamentous phage particles. After infection of the susceptible bacterial strain XLOLR, these were converted into plasmids. Restriction enzyme analysis revealed that 14 of these cDNA clones appeared to represent unique clones. Sequence assembly was performed using the SEQMAN II module of Lasergene biocomputing software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Additional gene analysis and sequence alignment was performed using GeneInspector software (Textco, West Lebanon, NH). The phagemids, pBK-CMV-411 and pBK-CMV-neo (no insert), were obtained by single clone excision. RAW 264.7 (1 × 106 cells) were plated in a 10-cm tissue culture dish (Falcon) and, after overnight adhesion, were transfected with either 10 μg of pBK-CMV-411 or pBK-CMV-neo using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (41Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4792) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected with one mg/ml G418 and analyzed after cell death had ceased and they had returned to logarithmic growth conditions. RAW 264.7 cells, stably transfected with pBK-CMV phagemids containing either cDNA for clone 411 or the mock vector insert, were plated in complete medium at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in a 12-well tissue culture dish. Cell growth was determined by serially trypsinizing each well and counting viable cells (determined by trypan blue exclusion) using a hemocytometer. All points represent the mean ± S.D. deviation of three wells. This experiment was repeated using four individual transfections and yielded nearly identical results. We previously observed that LPS induces NF-κB translocation in CHO/CD14 cells (13Delude R.L. Fenton M.J. Savedra Jr., R. Perera P.Y. Vogel S.N. Thieringer R. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22253-22260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate if CHO/CD14 cells were also capable of producing proinflammatory cytokines, we examined IL-6 mRNA expression in CHO/CD14 cells after stimulation with LPS. Hamster-specific IL-6 primers were designed only after we subcloned a hamster cDNA fragment of 303 bp using murine IL-6 primer (∼54% of the mature murine IL-6 peptide). Sequence comparison of this fragment (GenBankTM accession number AF044667) revealed ∼83% identities to murine and rat IL-6 at the cDNA level and 69 and 76%, respectively, at the protein level (Fig.1). We determined the expression of steady-state IL-6 mRNA levels following the stimulation of CHO/CD14 cells with LPS by using reverse transcriptase PCR (Fig.2). Unstimulated CHO/CD14 cells expressed low but detectable levels of IL-6 mRNA, but this expression was significantly up-regulated after 1–2 h of exposure to LPS. After 8 h, IL-6 mRNA expression returned to basal level.Figure 2LPS-induced up-regulation of IL-6 mRNA. CHO/CD14 cells were incubated for the denoted times with 100 ng/ml ReLPS. After isolation of mRNA, RT-PCR was performed using hamster IL-6-specific primers (top panel) or GAPDH primers (lower panel). Amplified fragments were electrophoresed on an ethidium bromide containing 3% agarose gel. Data show one representative experiment out of three. Controls: no cDNA (lane −), defined cDNA for hamster IL-6 (lane +). Marker: DNA molecular weight marker, φX174 RFHaeIII digest (lane M).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Consequently, we tested if CHO/CD14 cells were also able release IL-6 protein following the stimulation with LPS. We compared the LPS-induced IL-6 release of CHO/CD14 cells with CHO cells transfected with the empty, neomycin-conferring vector (CHO/neo). LPS concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml induced secretion of ∼1450 pg/ml IL-6, whereas the release of IL-6 in CHO/neo cells was only minimally increased over basal IL-6 levels (Fig. 3). To identify novel LPS-inducible genes, we screened a cDNA library derived from CHO/CD14 cells stimulated for 4 h with LPS. We used cDNA generated by the subtraction of unstimulated CHO/CD14 cell mRNA from LPS-induced cDNA as a radiolabeled probe for differentially expressed genes. After three rounds of screening, we obtained 14 distinct clones, shown by comparison of different restriction enzyme digestion patterns (data not shown). Sequence analysis of a single sequence run on these clones revealed hamster homologues to six known mammalian genes and eight novel genes (data not shown). The first gene we cloned was identified as the hamster homologue ofhop (GenBankTM accession number AF039202), which encodes a protein homologous to the stress-inducible yeast protein, STI1 (20Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). STI1 protein is highly conserved among eukaryotic species. At the cDNA level, the hamster sequence shares 94, 93, and 89% identities to rat, murine, and human hop sequences, respectively. It also shares 54% identity to the nucleotide sequence of yeast STI1 (data not shown). At the protein level, sequences from hamster, rat, mouse, and human show an even higher degree of similarity (about 97%), whereas hamster Hop and yeast STI1 share 42% identical amino acids (Fig.4). We then confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR that LPS induces the up-regulation of Hop mRNA not only in CHO/CD14 cells (Fig.5 B) but also in primary cultures of Chinese hamster peritoneal macrophages (Fig.5 A). RT-PCR results were confirmed by performing Northern blot analysis of LPS-treated RAW-264.7 cells (data not shown). After 4 h of stimulation with LPS, mRNA expression of Hop was consistently up-regulated in both cell types. We were also interested to determine if Hop and other Heat shock proteins were up-regulated simultaneously, since Hop has recently been shown to organize complexes of Hsp70 and Hsp90 (42Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Over the same time course, Hsp70 was even more strongly up-regulated than hop or Hsp90 (Fig. 5 B). The second clone that we investigated further was designated H411 (GenBankTMaccession number AF046870). After complete sequencing of the cDNA, we designed specific PCR primers for this clone. We observed induction of H411 mRNA in CHO/CD14 cells as early as 1 h after stimulation with LPS. H411 expression continued to increase over the 4-h stimulation period tested (Fig.6 B). The same induction pattern could be seen in peritoneal macrophages from Chinese hamsters (Fig. 6 A). The complete sequence of the isolated cDNA encoding for H411 includes one large open reading frame (bp 235–1623) that contains at least two potential translation start sites at 235 and 292. The second ATG is more likely to be the true initiation codon since it starts with a 27-amino acid signal sequence with a cleavage site between Pro-27 and Gln-28 2On-line address for SignalP WWW-Server,http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ servers/SignalP/. (43Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4906) Google Scholar). H411 contains six EGF-like repeats, sequences that are common to a broad family of proteins involved in cell growth and differentiation (e.g.fibulin (44Argraves W.S. Tran H. Burgess W.H. Dickerson K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3155-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), fibrillin (22Maslen C.L. Corson G.M. Maddox B.K. Glanville R.W. Sakai L.Y.

Cell. 1985; 43: 567-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar)). The 3′-untranslated region contains a single polyadenylation site. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of H411 with GenBankTM entries using the NCBI Blast Search program 3On-line address,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. revealed similarities (56% identity at the amino acid level) to the sequence of human extracellular protein S1–5 (Fig.7). Human extracellular protein S1–5 has been shown up-regulated in both the senescent and quiescent human fibroblasts from a patient with Werner's syndrome of early aging (45Lecka-Czernik B. Lumpkin Jr., C.K. Goldstein S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, the sequence of a protein named HCABA58X, a putative extracellular-epidermal growth factor, was reported in a proprietary patent data base (accession number 32110 in the GENESEQ data base, Derwent Scientific Publications and The Oxford Molecular Group). 4Derwent Scientific Publications and The Oxford Molecular Group on-line address,http://www.oxmol.com/prods/geneseq/. Sequence comparison of HCABA58X with H411 demonstrated 96% identity (Fig. 7), suggesting that HCABA58X represents the human homologue of H411.

https://openalex.org/W1967784783,"Activation of the transcription factor NFκB requires rapid degradation of its inhibitor, IκBα. To facilitate the study of IκBα degradation, we fused IκBα protein to enhanced green fluorescent protein to construct IκBα-enhanced green fluorescent protein (IG). We demonstrated by both flow cytometry and Western blot analysis that the half-life of IG in the presence of human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α is approximately 5 min, which is similar to the half-life of native IκBα. The degradation coincided with NFκB translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and NFκB-mediated induction of transcription. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but not forskolin, also induces degradation of IG fusion protein. The half-life of IG in the presence of PMA is approximately 15 min, longer than when induced with TNFα. Co-treatment with TNFα and PMA did not result in a synergistic effect on IG degradation, although they stimulate different kinases in two different signaling pathways. Degradation of IG was inhibited by mutations at serine residues 32 and 36, which are the target sites of the phosphorylation modification that initiates degradation of IκBα. We also demonstrated that basal degradation of IG in the presence of cycloheximide is inhibited by such mutations, suggesting that basal degradation of IκBα also requires phosphorylation as the signal for degradation. Finally, we showed that the rate of TNFα-induced degradation of IG remains almost constant throughout the cell cycle, except at the mitotic phase, in which IG degrades more slowly. Activation of the transcription factor NFκB requires rapid degradation of its inhibitor, IκBα. To facilitate the study of IκBα degradation, we fused IκBα protein to enhanced green fluorescent protein to construct IκBα-enhanced green fluorescent protein (IG).

The half-life of IG in the presence of PMA is approximately 15 min, longer than when induced with TNFα. Co-treatment with TNFα and PMA did not result in a synergistic effect on IG degradation, although they stimulate different kinases in two different signaling pathways. Degradation of IG was inhibited by mutations at serine residues 32 and 36, which are the target sites of the phosphorylation modification that initiates degradation of IκBα. We also demonstrated that basal degradation of IG in the presence of cycloheximide is inhibited by such mutations, suggesting that basal degradation of IκBα also requires phosphorylation as the signal for degradation. Finally, we showed that the rate of TNFα-induced degradation of IG remains almost constant throughout the cell cycle, except at the mitotic phase, in which IG degrades more slowly. Regulated degradation of specific proteins is part of the intracellular biochemical changes that contribute to the regulation of signal transduction pathways, cell proliferation, growth arrest, and apoptosis.

Once released from the IκBα complex, NFκB immediately translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it mediates the transcriptional activation of genes, such as interleukin 2 and IκBα. IκBα degradation is rapid and is completed within 5–40 min after stimulation by TNFα (1Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 2Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A.

IκBα also degrades in the absence of TNFα, but this basal degradation is much slower than induced degradation. The half-life of the basal degradation is around 2 h (2Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 29Miyamoto S. Chiao P.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 14: 3276-3282Crossref Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the basal degradation of IκBα also requires phosphorylation for initiation of the degradation process (30Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relationship of basal degradation to induced degradation remains uncertain.Both the gene and cDNA of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) have been cloned from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria (31Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). GFP has been widely used to study gene expression and protein localization (32Chalfie M. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C.

Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar) because its fluorescence emission does not require substrates or cofactors (36Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar), and fluorescence detection can be made in real time. The key sequence of Ser-Tyr-Gly (amino acids 65–67) within GFP undergoes spontaneous oxidation to form a cyclized chromophore that emits fluorescence (37Inouge S. Tsuji F.I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser to Thr in the chromophore (S65T) leads to a higher fluorescence intensity of GFP. Enhanced GFP (EGFP) is one such mutant. It contains the mutations S65T and F64L and is encoded by a gene with human-optimized codons (38Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar, 39Haas J. Park E.C. Seed B. Curr.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4592-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structures of wild-type GFP and the mutant S65T reveal that the tertiary structure of GFP resembles a barrel (41Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar, 42Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), and this compact structure makes GFP a very stable protein. Fusing EGFP to the degradation domain of mouse ornithine decarboxylase, we were able to generate a destabilized EGFP with a half-life of 2 h (43Li X. Zhao X. Fang Y. Jiang X. Duong T. Fan C. Huang C.-C. Kain S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34970-34975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). This study indicates that EGFP is able to degrade in vivo when fused with a degradation domain and suggests that EGFP can be used as a general reporter to measure protein degradation in vivo when fused to a full-length rapid turnover protein.In the present study, we used EGFP to monitor IκBα degradation by making a fusion protein of IκBα and EGFP. The fusion protein was found to be degraded as well as IκBα upon TNFα treatment. Therefore, IκBα degradation can be analyzed simply by monitoring the change of the fluorescence intensity of the fusion protein without cell disruption. Using EGFP, we were able to analyze the degradation more efficiently and rapidly than possible with other methods. We showed that both TNFα and PMA, but not forskolin, induce degradation of the fusion protein. Degradation induced by PMA is slower than that induced by TNFα, and no synergistic effect was detected when cells were treated with both TNFα and PMA simultaneously. During the study, we also found that the basal degradation of IκBα, like the induced degradation, also requires phosphorylation at serines 32 and 36 for initiation of the degradation process. Finally, we found that IG degradation at the mitotic phase is slower than IG degradation at the other phases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe cDNAs encoding IκBα and EGFP were amplified withPfu DNA polymerase. IκBα was amplified with primers that incorporated a SacII recognition sequence at the 5′ end and a BamHI sequence at the 3′ end. The stop codon of IκBα was deleted during polymerase chain reaction amplification to make an open reading frame with EGFP. EGFP was amplified with primers that incorporated a BamHI recognition sequence at the 5′ end and an EcoRI sequence at the 3′ end. The amplified polymerase chain reaction products were ligated at the BamHI site, and the resulting fusion construct (IκBα-EGFP) was cloned into theSacII and EcoRI sites of the pTRE expression vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for use in the tetracycline-regulated expression system (44Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4228) Google Scholar). The IκBα mutant S32A/S36A was made with overlap extension mutagenesis (45Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Peasse L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar).pTRE-IG and pTRE-IGS32A/S36A expression vectors were transfected into HeLa Tet-OffTM cells (CLONTECH) for degradation studies. HeLa Tet-OffTM cells stably express a fusion protein of the tet repressor and the herpes simplex virus VP16 (tTA) and thus can be used for tetracycline-regulated expression of a gene cloned into the pTRE vector (44Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4228) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the transfected cells were subject to functional analyses. To make stable cell lines, cell were co-transfected with pTK-Hyg and cultured in medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Drug-resistant colonies were then screened for green fluorescence under a Zeiss Axioskop Model 50 fluorescence microscope.To examine the fluorescence intensity of EGFP or IG, the cells were cultured on coverslips. After transfection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The coverslips were mounted on a glass slide for examining fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope. To determine protein turnover, the cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml recombinant human TNFα (CLONTECH) for varying times before paraformaldehyde fixation. The transfected cells with/without TNFα treatment were collected by EDTA treatment, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. Cell suspensions were analyzed for fluorescence intensity using a FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Inc., San Jose, CA). EGFP was excited at 488 nm, and emission was detected using a 510/20 bandpass filter.The transfected cells with/without CHX treatment were collected in PBS, and cell lysates were prepared by sonication. Proteins were resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a membrane. IG fusion proteins were detected using a monoclonal antibody against GFP (CLONTECH). Bands were visualized with the Western Exposure chemiluminescent detection kit (CLONTECH).To examine NFκB translocation, cells stably expressing IG were treated with TNFα. The treated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS three times. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with a blocking solution for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with a 1:250 dilution of anti-Rel p65 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in the blocking solution for 2 h. After washing with PBS three times, the cells were incubated with a 1:250 dilution of rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) for 45 min in PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin. After rinsing three times with PBS, the stained cells were mounted in Citifluor (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). To determine the induction of SEAP mediated by NFκB, IG cells were transfected with pNFκB-SEAP. TNF-mediated induction was determined by comparing SEAP levels within cells with and without TNFα treatment, using the Great EscAPeTM chemiluminescent detection kit (CLONTECH).We treated cells with different compounds for 16 h to arrest them at various stages in the cell cycle. The G1-phase-arrested cells were obtained by treatment of the cells with 100 μmmimosine, the G1-S-phase-arrested cells were obtained by treatment of the cells with 2 mm thymidine, and the mitotic phase-arrested cells were obtained by treatment of the cells with 50 ng/ml nocodazole. The cell cycle-arrested cells were then challenged with TNFα to determine the degradation rate of IG.RESULTSTo investigate whether the biochemical degradation of IκBα can be monitored by fluorescence decay of the EGFP fusion protein, we appended EGFP to the C terminus of IκBα. The fusion was designated IG. The fusion IG was transiently expressed in HeLa Tet-OffTM or 293 Tet-OffTM cells by transfecting the expression vector pTRE-IG. The transfected cells were treated with TNFα for 1 h and collected for analysis by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1, TNFα treatment resulted in decreased fluorescence of transfected cells, indicating sensitivity of IG fluorescence to TNFα treatment. To examine whether TNFα-mediated fluorescence decay of IG requires the phosphorylation of IκBα, we mutated serines 32 and 36 to Ala to make IG-S32A/S36A. The results from flow cytometry analysis demonstrated no decrease in the green fluorescence of IG-S32A/S36A after TNFα treatment in both HeLa and 293 cells (Fig. 1). Therefore, we concluded that TNFα-mediated fluorescence decay of IG, like IκB degradation, needs the specific phosphorylation modification at serines 32 and 36.To establish stable expression of the IG fusion protein in HeLa cells, we co-transfected pTRE-IG with pTK-Hyg, selected drug-resistant colonies in the presence of hygromycin, and screened for fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope. One of green fluorescent clones, designated as HeLa-Off/IG, is shown in Fig.2. HeLa-Off/IG cells were treated with TNFα for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. Green fluorescence was not detectable within 20 min after treatment with TNFα (Fig. 2 A). Next we used flow cytometry to quantitatively analyze the half-life of IG fluorescence. Both total fluorescence and the percentage of fluorescent cells declined to a basal level after 15 min of treatment. Fluorescence declined to 50% of uninduced levels 5 min after induction. This half-life is similar to that of endogenous IκBα protein in HeLa cells (1Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 2Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A.

The results suggest that the EGFP tag changes neither TNFα-mediated regulation of IκBα turnover nor the protein's half-life.Figure 2TNF α-mediated IG degradation in the stable cell line HeLa-Off/IG. HeLa-Off/IG cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml TNFα and subjected to fluorescence microscopy (A), flow cytometric analysis (B), and Western blot analysis with GFP antibody (C). A, the fluorescence intensity of HeLa-Off/IG cells after TNFα treatment for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min was examined under a fluorescence microscope. B, the cells were treated with TNFα for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min and collected in PBS/EDTA. 10,000 cells were subjected to FACS analysis, and the percentage of the fluorescent cells was plotted. C, the cells were treated with TNFα for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min and collected for preparing cell lysates. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the decay in fluorescence correlates with a decrease in IG protein levels, we measured the amount of the fusion protein by Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against GFP. At 0 min, we saw a band at 65 kDa, corresponding to the predicted size of the IG protein (Fig. 2 C). The intensity of this band declined with increasing length of TNFα treatment. The band's intensity was reduced to about 50% at approximately 5–10 min of treatment, confirming the IG protein half-life of 5–10 min. Therefore, the intracellular fluorescence intensity of the IG fusion protein correlates directly to the IG protein level.To examine whether IG degradation leads to NFκB translocation, we detected NFκB protein in IG cells with polyclonal antibodies against p65 as the primary antibody and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Before TNFα treatment, both NFκB and IκBα are localized to the cytoplasm. Degradation of IG was induced by adding TNFα, which leads to immediate translocation of NFκB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig.3 A). No difference in translocation of NFκB was found in IG cells and control HeLa cells. NFκB-mediated transcription was measured by the induction of the NFκB response elements, κB4, located on a reporter vector transiently transfected into the cells. The TNF-induced induction of the reporter protein SEAP in the IG cells is the same as that in control HeLa cells (Fig. 3 B). These results indicated that degradation of the IG fusion protein is associated with NFκB translocation and transcription induction. Therefore, the EGFP tag on IκBα does not change normal NFκB function.Figure 3TNF α-mediated NFκB localization and NFκB-mediated induction of SEAP in HeLa-Off/IG cells. HeLa-Off/IG cells were treated with TNF for 50 min. NFκB translocation was examined with antibodies against p65 and rhodamine-labeled IgG, and IκBα degradation was examined by green fluorescence (A). HeLa-Off/IG cells were transfected by the reporter construct pNFκB-SEAP. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml human TNFα and collected for SEAP detection (B). SEAP activities of HeLa-Off and HeLa-Off/IG cells were plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been shown that protein kinase A in vitro (46Shirakawa F.

Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) are able to activate NFκB. We first examined whether protein kinase A can induce degradation of IG by treatment of HeLa-Off/IG cells with forskolin. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that fluorescence of the treated cells remained the same during the 3-h period of treatment (Fig. 4 A). This result indicates the insensitivity of IκB degradation to protein kinase A, which does not agree with the in vitro study in which protein kinase A activates NFκB. We also tested whether protein kinase C can activate NFκB by treatment of HeLa-Off/IG cells with PMA. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the fluorescence of IG rapidly decayed after PMA treatment, and the half-life of IG fluorescence is about 15 min. The sensitivity of IG degradation to protein kinase C is similar to that seen in the previous studies. The degradation rate of IG fluorescence induced by PMA is slower that induced by TNFα (Figs.2 B and 4 B). To examine the difference more carefully, we did a side-by-side comparison of the degradation of IG fluorescence induced by TNFα and PMA. Treatment of HeLa-Off/IG cells with TNFα resulted in rapid degradation of IG, but treatment with PMA produced a slightly delayed degradation response (Fig.5). This delay is approximately 5 min.Figure 4Treatment of HeLa-Off/IG cells with forskolin or PMA.

A dominant negative mutant of pp90rsk inhibits PMA-induced but not TNFα-induced degradation of IκB, further suggesting that these two pathways are different. To examine whether PMA has any additive effect on TNFα-induced degradation, we co-treated HeLa-Off/IG cells with TNFα and PMA. The resultant degradation rate is identical to that induced by TNFα (Fig. 5). Therefore, there is no synergistic effect of these two inducers on the degradation of IG.IκBα is subject to both TNFα-induced and basal degradation. The basal degradation of IκBα has been characterized in the presence of CHX. In the absence of de novo protein synthesis, IκBα exhibits a baseline half-life of 2 h in HeLa cells (2Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) and 2.5 h in the 70Z/3 murine pre-B cell line (29Miyamoto S.

To determine whether basal degradation of IG has a half-life similar to that of IκBα, we treated HeLa-Off/IG cells with CHX for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h and collected the cells for analysis by flow cytometry. The time-course fluorescence decay was plotted and is shown in Fig.6 A. The data revealed that the half-life of the fusion in the constitutive degradation is about 2 h, which is similar to that of"

Multiple potential binding sites for universal and tissue-specific transcription factors were suggestive of a promoter region within this DNA sequence. Potential promoter activity was confirmed by coupling the new sequence to the open reading frame of a luciferase reporter gene in transient expression experiments with nerve and muscle cells. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends with templates from multiple sources revealed a novel transcription start site (at position −626, relative to translation start), located 32 bases downstream from a TATAA sequence. This start site appeared to mark a novel exon (1a) comprising 291 base pairs between positions −335 and −626, relative to the translation start. Supporting this conclusion, polymerase chain reactions with cDNA from mouse brain, heart, and other tissues, consistently amplified a transcript containing the exon 1a sequence fused to the invariant sequence beginning at position −22 in exon 2, but lacking exon 1. Northern blot analyses confirmed the in vivo expression of exon 1a-containing transcripts, especially in heart, brain, liver, and kidney. These results indicate that the murine acetylcholinesterase gene has a functioning alternative promoter that may influence expression of acetylcholinesterase in certain tissues.

The results have consistently demonstrated a proximal promoter that is active in both muscle and nervous tissue.

Functional alternative promoters have been observed for many genes (17Ayoubi T.A.Y. ven der Ven W.J.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and can be involved in regulating gene expression in different tissues. For example, alternative promoters generate four tissue-specific alternative noncoding first exons of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (18Timmusk T. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Persson H. Metsis M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By transcribing a single gene from multiple promoters, an organism gains flexibility in controlling gene expression (19Schibler U. Sierra F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 237-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).In this study, we characterized a portion of the 5′-flanking region of mouse Ache beginning about 400 bp upstream from the proximal promoter (12Li Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two of these have been characterized as single copy genes and have been shown by hybridization studies to be present in both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic RNAs, suggesting that they are targeted to both compartments (14Mottram J.C.

The majority of the tRNA genes identified have been selected with a heterologous population of labeled tRNAs. Due to the ability of closely related tRNAs to cross-hybridize it is difficult to determine whether the other identified genes encode tRNAs targeted to the mitochondrion. The identification of nuclear genes encoding tRNAs targeted to the mitochondrion is crucial in identifying the substrate requirements and mechanism of mitochondrial RNA import.Little is known about the mechanism by which a nuclear encoded RNA can be imported into the mitochondrion. It has been suggested that import of tRNAs may be in association with the cognate nuclear encoded aminoacyl tRNA synthetase of the tRNA (16Suyama Y. Hamada J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that a tRNALys is imported into yeast mitochondria associated with the cognate synthetase (17Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transfection studies with both Trypanosoma and Leishmania have demonstrated mitochondrial import of endogenous, mutated, and exogenous tRNAs. These results suggest that the substrate requirement for import is contained within the mature tRNA structure, independent of the genomic 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (18Chen D.H.T. Shi X. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Hauser R. Schneider A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Schneider A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An antisense transcript from the 5′ upstream region of β-tubulin appears to be imported, suggesting that import of small RNAs may be nonspecific in this system. More recent studies have suggested the presence of mitochondrial membrane proteins that serve as receptors for Leishmania tRNAs and the antisense tubulin transcript (22Mahaptra S. Adhya S. J. Biol.

We have previously reported the presence of a population of potential precursor tRNAs within T. bruceimitochondria. These RNAs were identified based on their ability to be posttranscriptionally labeled at their 3′ end by tRNA nucleotidyl transferase and the ability of RNase P to cleave them to the same size and pattern as mature tRNAs (24Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that for at least a subset of tRNAs imported into the mitochondria of T. brucei, the import substrate consists of a precursor tRNA. Attempts to characterize these precursors by Northern blot hybridization and primer extension analysis have failed, suggesting that the initial identification of precursor molecules may have been artifactual or that the precursors are present in very low abundance (25Aphasizhe R. Karmarkar U. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the cloning of a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial tRNALeu. The tRNALeu gene is immediately downstream of a tRNASer gene. This unusual genomic organization has been seen for other tRNA genes of T. brucei (13Hancock K. Hajduk S.L.

The 5′ end of this transcript was determined by 5′ RACE. This low abundance tRNALeu precursor contains the tRNASer, a 59-nucleotide intergenic sequence and the tRNALeu. This demonstrates the existence of an imported dicistronic precursor tRNA for a specific mitochondrial tRNA inT. brucei.DISCUSSIONWe have previously defined a population of mitochondrial RNAs with characteristics of precursor tRNAs (22Mahaptra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A subset of the precursor size molecules can be processed by an E. coli RNase P RNA to mature mitochondrial tRNAs. These findings suggest that import of at least a subset of the tRNAs may require sequences flanking the tRNAs. In this paper we have identified the nuclear genes encoding two tRNAs targeted to the mitochondrion and determined that a dicistronic precursor tRNA exists within the mitochondrion.We have separated individual mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNAs using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B). A complementary oligonucleotide was designed based on the partial enzymatic sequence of one mitochondrial tRNA. This oligonucleotide was used to identify a genomic DNA fragment containing three tRNAs, tRNA1Ser,tRNALeu, and tRNA2Ser (Fig.5).The genomic organization of the tRNA genes of T. brucei is unusual (11Campbell D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9479Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Campbell D.A. Suyama Y. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 37: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Mottram J.C. Bell S.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). tRNA1Ser and tRNALeu are closely linked, separated by only 59 nucleotides. This genomic arrangement may play a role in distinguishing between tRNAs targeted to the mitochondrion or targeted to the cytoplasm. We have shown that the tRNA1Ser and tRNALeu genes are transcribed to give a dicistronic precursor transcript. Normally RNA polymerase III initiates tRNA transcription 10–20 nucleotides upstream of the mature 5′ tRNA sequence (reviewed in (29Sharp S.J. Schaack J. Cooley L. Burke D.J. Soll D. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 19: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). The 5′ terminus of the dicistronic precursor tRNA was determined to be 14 nucleotides upstream of the tRNA1Ser. This suggests that the precursor tRNA1Ser/tRNALeu is formed by the inability of polymerase III to efficiently terminate the transcription of the upstream tRNA1Ser. The presence of the tRNA1Ser/tRNALeu dicistronic molecule within the mitochondrion implies that these precursor tRNAs must somehow escape the tRNA processing events that normally occur within the nucleus. A tRNA precursor consisting of two linked tRNAs may fold into an unusual structure (30Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which could allow the precursor to escape nuclear processing. Alternatively, the precursor molecule may be recognized by specific RNA binding proteins that participate in the export of the unprocessed RNA from the nucleus and its subsequent import into the mitochondrion. In mammalian cells it has recently been demonstrated that processing of precursor tRNAs by RNase P is modulated by the La antigen phosphoprotein (31Fan H. Goodier J.L. Chamberlain J.R. Englke D.R. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3201-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A similar pathway for protein-mediated protection of precursor tRNALeu may allow it to be exported from the nucleus in an unprocessed form.Some processing events may occur prior to, during, or shortly after mitochondrial import. Processing or modifications of the precursor tRNASer/tRNALeu once inside the mitochondria may allow these transcripts to be recognized and processed into mature functional tRNAs by the mitochondrial RNase P and nucleotidyl transferase (24Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this, a mitochondrial specific modification at position 32 of tRNALeu was identified as 2′-O-methylcytidine and occurs following mitochondrial tRNA import (20Schneider A. McNally K.P. Agabian N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).2 Import of tRNAs does not appear to be dependent on this modification, and the importance of this modification in forming functional mitochondrial tRNAs is not known (20Schneider A. McNally K.P. Agabian N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating modifications of imported tRNAs and the roles these modifications may play in correctly processing precursor tRNAs and forming functional mature tRNAs.In previous studies (22Mahaptra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), oligonucleotides complementary to conserved sequences in tRNAs (D-loop and stem) were used in both Northern hybridization and primer extension reactions to identify putative precursor tRNAs. When similar experiments were performed using an oligonucleotide complementary to specific sequences immediately upstream of the mature tRNALeu 5′ terminus, no products were observed in the mitochondrial or the cytosolic fractions.2 This is consistent with a recent study indicating that precursor molecules with 5′ extended sequences were not detected either by primer extension analysis or Northern blot hybridization (25Aphasizhe R. Karmarkar U. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this report we have used a highly sensitive RT-PCR assay to identify precursor tRNALeu molecules within the mitochondrion and cytosol, suggesting that precursor tRNASer/tRNALeu is present at very low abundance in T. brucei. We now believe that the majority of higher molecular weight RNAs observed to incorporate radiolabeled CTP in a metabolic labeling experiment (Fig. 1 A) are actually artificial ligation products that are formed during our mitochondrial isolation procedure. We have observed during metabolic labeling experiments with isolated mitochondria that over time there is an increase in both CTP incorporation and intensity of ethidium staining in precursor size RNA molecules with a corresponding decrease in mature tRNA molecules.2 This would explain why only a small percentage of the metabolically labeled precursor tRNAs are cleaved in our RNase P assay (Ref. 24Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 2).Transfection studies have been used to investigate the determinants of tRNA import into trypanosome mitochondria (18Chen D.H.T. Shi X. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Hauser R. Schneider A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Mahaptra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The results from these studies suggest that the mature tRNA structure alone can direct import of several tRNAs into the mitochondria, irrespective of their genomic context or genetic origin. These findings are an apparent contradiction to our findings. Although we do not have an explanation for these differences, it is possible that the high levels of tRNAs expressed from the episomal vectors used in the transfection studies may have influenced the distribution of tRNAs. The studies reported here do not directly address whether the dicistronic precursor or mature tRNAs are preferentially imported into trypanosome mitochondria. However, the data demonstrate the presence of a nuclear encoded, dicistronic, tRNA1Ser/tRNALeu precursor within the mitochondria. Recently, we have investigated the import of RNAs into the mitochondria of T. brucei. The dicistronic tRNA1Ser/tRNALeu molecules are efficiently imported in this in vitro system, whereas mature tRNA1Ser and tRNALeuare poor import substrates. 3A. E. Yermovsky-Kammerer and S. L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5427-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) are two organisms in which all of the mitochondrial tRNAs are encoded in the nucleus. The nuclear encoded tRNA genes in T. brucei have been categorized into three different classes: tRNAs specific to the cytoplasm, tRNAs specific to the mitochondria, and tRNAs that appear to be shared between both compartments (9Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19208-19215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sixteen tRNA genes have been identified in T. brucei (11Campbell D.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two of these have been characterized as single copy genes and have been shown by hybridization studies to be present in both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic RNAs, suggesting that they are targeted to both compartments (14Mottram J.C. Bell S.D. Nelson R.G. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18313-18317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the tRNA genes identified have been selected with a heterologous population of labeled tRNAs. Due to the ability of closely related tRNAs to cross-hybridize it is difficult to determine whether the other identified genes encode tRNAs targeted to the mitochondrion. The identification of nuclear genes encoding tRNAs targeted to the mitochondrion is crucial in identifying the substrate requirements and mechanism of mitochondrial RNA import. Little is known about the mechanism by which a nuclear encoded RNA can be imported into the mitochondrion. It has been suggested that import of tRNAs may be in association with the cognate nuclear encoded aminoacyl tRNA synthetase of the tRNA (16Suyama Y. Hamada J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that a tRNALys is imported into yeast mitochondria associated with the cognate synthetase (17Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transfection studies with both Trypanosoma and Leishmania have demonstrated mitochondrial import of endogenous, mutated, and exogenous tRNAs. These results suggest that the substrate requirement for import is contained within the mature tRNA structure, independent of the genomic 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (18Chen D.H.T. Shi X. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Hauser R. Schneider A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Schneider A. McNally K.P. Agabian N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An in vitro import system has been described in Leishmania in which import was demonstrated by a ribonuclease protection assay (21Mahaptra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An antisense transcript from the 5′ upstream region of β-tubulin appears to be imported, suggesting that import of small RNAs may be nonspecific in this system. More recent studies have suggested the presence of mitochondrial membrane proteins that serve as receptors for Leishmania tRNAs and the antisense tubulin transcript (22Mahaptra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahaptra S. J. Biol.

This genomic arrangement may play a role in distinguishing between tRNAs targeted to the mitochondrion or targeted to the cytoplasm. We have shown that the tRNA1Ser and tRNALeu genes are transcribed to give a dicistronic precursor transcript. Normally RNA polymerase III initiates tRNA transcription 10–20 nucleotides upstream of the mature 5′ tRNA sequence (reviewed in (29Sharp S.J. Schaack J. Cooley L. Burke D.J. Soll D. CRC Crit. Rev.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). tRNA1Ser and tRNALeu are closely linked, separated by only 59 nucleotides. This genomic arrangement may play a role in distinguishing between tRNAs targeted to the mitochondrion or targeted to the cytoplasm. We have shown that the tRNA1Ser and tRNALeu genes are transcribed to give a dicistronic precursor transcript. Normally RNA polymerase III initiates tRNA transcription 10–20 nucleotides upstream of the mature 5′ tRNA sequence (reviewed in (29Sharp S.J. Schaack J. Cooley L. Burke D.J. Soll D. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 19: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). The 5′ terminus of the dicistronic precursor tRNA was determined to be 14 nucleotides upstream of the tRNA1Ser. This suggests that the precursor tRNA1Ser/tRNALeu is formed by the inability of polymerase III to efficiently terminate the transcription of the upstream tRNA1Ser. The presence of the tRNA1Ser/tRNALeu dicistronic molecule within the mitochondrion implies that these precursor tRNAs must somehow escape the tRNA processing events that normally occur within the nucleus. A tRNA precursor consisting of two linked tRNAs may fold into an unusual structure (30Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which could allow the precursor to escape nuclear processing. Alternatively, the precursor molecule may be recognized by specific RNA binding proteins that participate in the export of the unprocessed RNA from the nucleus and its subsequent import into the mitochondrion. In mammalian cells it has recently been demonstrated that processing of precursor tRNAs by RNase P is modulated by the La antigen phosphoprotein (31Fan H. Goodier J.L. Chamberlain J.R. Englke D.R. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3201-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A similar pathway for protein-mediated protection of precursor tRNALeu may allow it to be exported from the nucleus in an unprocessed form. Some processing events may occur prior to, during, or shortly after mitochondrial import. Processing or modifications of the precursor tRNASer/tRNALeu once inside the mitochondria may allow these transcripts to be recognized and processed into mature functional tRNAs by the mitochondrial RNase P and nucleotidyl transferase (24Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this, a mitochondrial specific modification at position 32 of tRNALeu was identified as 2′-O-methylcytidine and occurs following mitochondrial tRNA import (20Schneider A. McNally K.P. Agabian N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).2 Import of tRNAs does not appear to be dependent on this modification, and the importance of this modification in forming functional mitochondrial tRNAs is not known (20Schneider A. McNally K.P. Agabian N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating modifications of imported tRNAs and the roles these modifications may play in correctly processing precursor tRNAs and forming functional mature tRNAs. In previous studies (22Mahaptra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), oligonucleotides complementary to conserved sequences in tRNAs (D-loop and stem) were used in both Northern hybridization and primer extension reactions to identify putative precursor tRNAs. When similar experiments were performed using an oligonucleotide complementary to specific sequences immediately upstream of the mature tRNALeu 5′ terminus, no products were observed in the mitochondrial or the cytosolic fractions.2 This is consistent with a recent study indicating that precursor molecules with 5′ extended sequences were not detected either by primer extension analysis or Northern blot hybridization (25Aphasizhe R. Karmarkar U. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this report we have used a highly sensitive RT-PCR assay to identify precursor tRNALeu molecules within the mitochondrion and cytosol, suggesting that precursor tRNASer/tRNALeu is present at very low abundance in T. brucei. We now believe that the majority of higher molecular weight RNAs observed to incorporate radiolabeled CTP in a metabolic labeling experiment (Fig. 1 A) are actually artificial ligation products that are formed during our mitochondrial isolation procedure. We have observed during metabolic labeling experiments with isolated mitochondria that over time there is an increase in both CTP incorporation and intensity of ethidium staining in precursor size RNA molecules with a corresponding decrease in mature tRNA molecules.2 This would explain why only a small percentage of the metabolically labeled precursor tRNAs are cleaved in our RNase P assay (Ref. 24Hancock K. LeBlanc A.J. Donze D. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23963-23971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 2). Transfection studies have been used to investigate the determinants of tRNA import into trypanosome mitochondria (18Chen D.H.T. Shi X. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Hauser R. Schneider A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Mahaptra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The results from these studies suggest that the mature tRNA structure alone can direct import of several tRNAs into the mitochondria, irrespective of their genomic context or genetic origin. These findings are an apparent contradiction to our findings. Although we do not have an explanation for these differences, it is possible that the high levels of tRNAs expressed from the episomal vectors used in the transfection studies may have influenced the distribution of tRNAs. The studies reported here do not directly address whether the dicistronic precursor or mature tRNAs are preferentially imported into trypanosome mitochondria. However, the data demonstrate the presence of a nuclear encoded, dicistronic, tRNA1Ser/tRNALeu precursor within the mitochondria. Recently, we have investigated the import of RNAs into the mitochondria of T. brucei. The dicistronic tRNA1Ser/tRNALeu molecules are efficiently imported in this in vitro system, whereas mature tRNA1Ser and tRNALeuare poor import substrates. 3A. E. Yermovsky-Kammerer and S. L.

In most cell types the Man 6-P signal is rapidly removed after targeting of the precursor proteins from the Golgi to lysosomes via interactions with Man 6-phosphate receptors. However, in brain, the steady state proportion of lysosomal enzymes containing Man 6-P is considerably higher than in other tissues. As a first step toward understanding the mechanism and biological significance of this observation, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the rat brain Man 6-P glycoproteins by combining biochemical and morphological approaches. The brain Man 6-P glycoproteins are predominantly localized in neuronal lysosomes with no evidence for a steady state localization in nonlysosomal or prelysosomal compartments. This contrasts with the clear endosome-like localization of the low steady state proportion of mannose-6-phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes in liver. It therefore seems likely that the observed high percentage of phosphorylated species in brain is a consequence of the accumulation of lysosomal enzymes in a neuronal lysosome that does not fully dephosphorylate the Man 6-P moieties.

It therefore seems likely that the observed high percentage of phosphorylated species in brain is a consequence of the accumulation of lysosomal enzymes in a neuronal lysosome that does not fully dephosphorylate the Man 6-P moieties. Transport of soluble lysosomal precursor proteins to lysosomes relies on the addition of mannose 6-phosphate (Man 6-P) 1The abbreviations used are: Man 6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; MPR, Man 6-P receptors; CI, cation-independent; P, microsomal fraction; M, mitochondrial fraction; L, light mitochondrial fraction; LAP, lysosomal acid phosphatase residues. The nascent polypeptide chain follows the first steps of the secretory pathway, involving the co-translational addition of preformed oligosaccharide chains onto select asparagine residues. A sorting event in the Golgi apparatus allows diversion of the precursor lysosomal proteins from the secretory pathway. This process entails the two-step generation of Man 6-P on N-linked oligosaccharide chains and subsequent binding to Man 6-P receptors (MPRs). The MPR-lysosomal protein complexes exit the Golgi in transport vesicles, which then fuse with an acidic prelysosomal compartment (endosome), where the low pH triggers dissociation of the complexes. The free receptors recycle back to the Golgi, whereas the lysosomal proteins accumulate in lysosomes. In most cell types, the Man 6-P recognition marker is rapidly removed shortly after endosomal/lysosomal targeting. This explains why typically the bulk of the lysosomal proteins are found in their dephosphorylated state (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kornfeld S. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 2von Figura K. Hasilik A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 3Kornfeld S. Mellman I.

Mechanisms of Intracellular Trafficking and Processing of Proproteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 103-130Google Scholar). However, studies using immortalized cells have shown that the extent of dephosphorylation can vary considerably depending on the cell line and culture conditions (6Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,7Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To investigate the fate of lysosomal enzymes in vivo, Sleatet al. (8Sleat D.E Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) analyzed the level of Man 6-P-containing glycoproteins in a series of rat tissues. This study revealed that brain had significantly higher levels of Man 6-P glycoproteins than other tissues analyzed (e.g. 8-fold higher than liver). Importantly, the phosphorylation state of individual brain lysosomal enzymes was greatly elevated (e.g. on average, the amount of total activity for a given lysosomal enzyme represented by the phosphorylated form was 37% in brain compared with 0.7% in liver). This suggests that brain cells are somehow unable to efficiently process lysosomal enzymes to remove the Man 6-P modification. There are at least three possible hypotheses regarding the mechanism for the limited dephosphorylation of brain lysosomal enzymes. First, this could be the consequence of transport of some of the lysosomal precursor proteins to a specialized, metabolically inactive compartment where they are stored for later use. Second, there could be delayed transfer of lysosomal precursor proteins from endosomes to lysosomes. Finally, the lysosomal enzymes could retain the Man 6-P modification after delivery to “classical,” metabolically active lysosomes. Comparing the steady state localization of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated lysosomal enzymes potentially could distinguish among these three models. The first two would result in distinct subcellular locations, whereas the third would result in identical subcellular locations for the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated species. In this report, we have investigated the subcellular localization of Man 6-P glycoproteins in rat brain using two complementary approaches. In a biochemical approach, we used a wide range of subcellular fractionation methods to compare the relative distributions of Man 6-P glycoproteins and lysosomal marker enzyme activities. In a morphological approach, we used double-label fluorescence and scanning confocal microscopy to compare the relative localization of Man 6-P glycoproteins and representative lysosomal enzymes. Taken together, our results indicate that the bulk of the brain Man 6-P glycoproteins reside in classical neuronal lysosomes, suggesting that these organelles are not able to fully process the Man 6-P signals. Brain and liver were obtained from adult male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g. After dissection, brain tissue was immersed immediately in ice-cold 0.25 msucrose and homogenized by one passage through a motor-driven Potter apparatus (1500 rpm). Fractionation of subcellular organelles by differential centrifugation was as described by de Duve et al. (9de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar). Isopycnic centrifugations were carried out according to Beaufay et al. (10Beaufay H. Jacques P. Sellinger O.Z. Berthet J. de Duve C. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 184-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) using a Spinco model L7–65 Ultracentrifuge and VTi65 rotor. Enzyme measurements were performed using 4-methylumbelliferyl substrates in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated at 37 °C, and terminated by the addition of 2 volumes of 0.5 m glycine, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 10.5. Reaction conditions were as follows (enzyme, substrate/buffer): β-galactosidase, 1 mm4-methylumbelliferyl-β-galactoside, 80 mm acetate pH 4.0; α-fucosidase, 0.2 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-fucoside, 80 mm citrate, pH 5.0; β-glucosidase, 5 mm4-methylumbelliferyl-β-glucoside, 80 mm citrate, pH 4.5, 6 mm taurocholate. Samples from individual fractions (representing equivalent portions of tissue homogenate) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% reducing gels. Blotting and detection of the Man 6-P glycoproteins using iodinated soluble cation-independent (CI) MPR were as described (11Valenzano K.J. Kallay L.M. Lobel P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,12Sleat D.E. Chen T.-L. Raska K. Lobel P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3424-3430PubMed Google Scholar). Total Man 6-P glycoproteins were estimated using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 3.3 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) by integrating the total machine counts present in each lane after correcting for background binding to nitrocellulose. Equivalent samples (representing material present in 0.5 mg of tissue homogenate) were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% non reducing gels. After semi-dry transfer of proteins to PVDF (Immobilon-P Millipore), membranes were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antisera against the CI-MPR kindly provided by Dr. Kurt von Figura (Gottingen, Germany) and the signal revealed using a chemiluminescence system (Boehringer-Mannheim). Sucrose density gradient fractions were analyzed to determine the percentage of total lysosomal enzymes activities represented by phosphorylated forms as described in (8Sleat D.E Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Samples (1 ml) were diluted into column buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) and loaded onto a 1-cm3 bed volume of Affi-Gel 10-immobilized soluble CI-MPR. The column was washed with 6 ml of column buffer, mock-eluted with 2 ml of column buffer containing 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and eluted with 4 ml of column buffer containing 10 mm Man 6-P. The starting material, Man 6-P eluate, and the unbound material (pooled run-through, wash, and mock-eluted fractions) were adjusted to the same concentration of glucose 6-phosphate and mannose 6-phosphate before measuring lysosomal enzyme activities as described above. Biotinylated CI-MPR probe was synthesized as described previously (12Sleat D.E. Chen T.-L. Raska K. Lobel P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3424-3430PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera raised against bovine liver cathepsin D recognizes rodent cathepsin D and has been described previously (13Chen H.J. Remmler J. Delaney J.C. Messner D.J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22338-22346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti rat β-galactosidase and goat anti-rat lysosomal acid phosphatase antisera were generous gifts from Dr. N. F. LaRusso (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and Dr. M. Himeno (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan), respectively. Sections (10 μm) of Bouin's-fixed paraffin-embedded rat brain were mounted on glass slides and deparaffinized. All incubation and washing steps were conducted in a humidified atmosphere at 4 °C. Specimens were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.76 mmKH2PO4) for 15 min, incubated with blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3) for 2 h and incubated with biotinylated CI-MPR (10 μg/ml in blocking buffer) overnight. Specimens were washed 30 min with wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20) and then incubated for 2 h with blocking buffer containing Cy5-avidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1:500 dilution) and primary antisera against lysosomal marker enzymes (1:100 dilution for all). The specimens were washed for 30 min and incubated for 1 h with appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted into blocking buffer (Life Technologies, Inc., goat anti-rabbit, 1:100 dilution; Sigma rabbit anti-goat, 1:400 dilution). After washing for 30 min, sections were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratory Inc.). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-410 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a 40 × planapochromate objective. We initially used a scheme of differential centrifugation to investigate the subcellular localization of the Man 6-P-containing glycoproteins in rat brain and liver. Equivalent samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted on nitrocellulose, and Man 6-P glycoproteins were visualized using iodinated soluble CI-MPR probe as described in Valenzano et al. (11Valenzano K.J. Kallay L.M. Lobel P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows representative blots obtained from such an experiment. The total amount of specifically bound 125I-CI-MPR probe is 9-fold higher in brain than in liver, consistent with previous results (8Sleat D.E Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Total Man 6-P-containing glycoproteins were quantified and compared with lysosomal marker enzymes (Fig. 1 B). In liver, the Man 6-P glycoproteins have a distribution consistent with their being in prelysosomal compartments in transit to lysosomes. In this well characterized tissue, Golgi, plasma membrane, the bulk of endosomes, and fragmented endoplasmic reticulum sediment in the microsomal fraction P (14Amar-Costesec A. Beaufay H. Wibo M. Thinès-Sempoux D. Feytmans E. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Limet J.N. Quintart J. Schneider Y.-J. Courtoy P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Classical lysosomes sediment in both the mitochondrial fraction M and the light mitochondrial fraction L (14Amar-Costesec A. Beaufay H. Wibo M. Thinès-Sempoux D. Feytmans E. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). As expected, the lysosomal markers β-galactosidase, α-fucosidase, and β-glucosidase are predominantly found in M + L (92, 90, and 78%, respectively, of the total activity in M + L + P), whereas most of the Man 6-P-containing glycoproteins are found in P (59% of M + L + P) (Fig. 1 B, right panels). Importantly, this different distribution clearly demonstrates that most of the liver Man 6-P glycoproteins are not in classical lysosomes. In brain, the lysosomal markers β-galactosidase, α-fucosidase, and β-glucosidase are to a large extent found in M + L (76, 68, and 61%, respectively, of the total activity in M + L + P), although the P fraction contains considerably higher activity than in liver. In contrast to liver, the Man 6-P glycoproteins have a distribution very similar to that of the lysosomal marker enzymes (31% of the M + L + P Man 6-P-containing glycoproteins are found in P), consistent with the phosphorylated forms being present in classical lysosomes. Results presented in Fig. 1raise the possibility that the brain Man 6-P glycoproteins are present in lysosomes or in nonlysosomal structures that also sediment in the M + L fraction. To help discriminate between these two possibilities, we analyzed the behavior of the Man 6-P glycoprotein-containing organelles by isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose density gradients (Fig.2). This analysis shows that the distribution of the Man 6-P-containing organelles and the distribution of the lysosomes are very similar. This is true regardless of the source of the organelles (ML, Fig. 2, left panel;P, Fig. 2, right panel) or if the lysosomal marker enzymes are known to be targeted by the Man 6-P-dependent pathway (β-galactosidase, α-fucosidase) or by a Man 6-P-independent mechanism (β-glucosidase). In M + L, the shoulder in the distribution of β-galactosidase and α-fucosidase (fractions 8–9) and the slight shift of β-glucosidase from β-galactosidase and α-fucosidase suggests some heterogeneity in the lysosome population, whereas the Man 6-P glycoproteins seem to be present throughout these organelles. Note that in Fig. 2, left panel, the dip in the Man 6-P glycoprotein profile at fraction 10 is most likely an artifact due to poor electrotransfer. For comparison, liver was also analyzed in parallel (Fig.3). Most of the Man 6-P glycoproteins, found in the microsomal fraction P (see Fig. 1), are present in structures showing an equilibrium density distinct from that observed for lysosomes (Fig. 3, right panel). These organelles most likely represent light endosomes (16Wattiaux R. Jadot M. Misquith S. Dubois F. Wattiaux-De Coninck S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The prelysosomal nature of these structures is further supported by the finding that Man 6-P glycoproteins in these lighter fractions have aM r higher than those in the dense fractions, suggesting they are lysosomal enzyme precursors in transit to the lysosome that have not yet been proteolytically processed. One potentially complicating factor in our analysis would be if in brain, lysosomal, and prelysosomal/endosomal compartments have similar physical properties. To test this possibility, we used two different centrifugation-based cell fractionation procedures to compare the distribution of organelles containing the CI-MPR, a marker of prelysosomal compartments (17Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), with that of the lysosomal marker β-galactosidase. Following differential centrifugation of brain homogenate, Western blotting revealed that the CI-MPR was present mainly in the P fraction, whereas β-galactosidase was mostly in M + L (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, analysis of the pooled M + L + P fractions by isopycnic centrifugation (Fig.4 B) shows that membranes associated with the CI-MPR have a lower equilibrium density than those containing β-galactosidase activity. Taken together with our previous results (Figs. 1 and 2), this indicates that most of the brain Man 6-P glycoproteins are not located in a prelysosomal/endosomal compartment. These results suggest that the brain Man 6-P glycoproteins are contained in lysosomes. As an additional test of this hypothesis, we used other separation methods in an attempt to separate the Man 6-P glycoprotein-containing organelles and classical lysosomes. One method entailed fractionation of brain M + L and P fractions by isopycnic centrifugation in NycodenzTM media (18Wattiaux R. Wattiaux-De Coninck S. Rickwood D. Iodinated Density Gradient Media, a Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1983: 119-137Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results, the distribution of Man 6-P glycoproteins and lysosomal marker enzymes were quite similar (Fig.5). The same conclusion was reached from free flow electrophoresis experiments (data not shown). Finally, we also measured additional lysosomal marker enzymes (α-glucosidase, β-mannosidase, β-glucuronidase, β-hexosaminidase, α-iduronidase, acid phosphatase, sulfatase, and cathepsin B) and obtained essentially the same distributions as those markers reported in Figs. 2, 3, and 5 (data not shown). Taken together, the distributions of Man 6-P glycoproteins and lysosomal marker enzymes reported in Figs. 1, 2, 4, and 5 would be best explained by a steady state co-localization of these molecules in brain lysosomes. A classical approach to assess if a molecule is located in a particular organelle is to compare the effect of membrane-disrupting treatments on the release of the molecule of interest and on known marker proteins. In particular, the osmotic properties of endocytic organelles differ between endosomes and lysosomes. We analyzed the effect of treatments known to damage the lysosomal membrane (suspension in hypotonic media (9de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar), 37 °C incubation in isotonic glucose (19Jadot M. Wattiaux-De Coninck S. Wattiaux R. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 981-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and repeated cycles of freezing and thawing (9de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar)) on the release of Man 6-P glycoproteins from vesicles present in brain M + L fractions. These treatments were performed in the presence of excess Man 6-P to avoid possible binding of released lysosomal enzymes to MPRs present in other membranes. After sedimentation of membranes by centrifugation, pellets and supernatants were recovered and analyzed for release of Man 6-P glycoproteins and the lysosome marker enzymes α-fucosidase and β-galactosidase. Fig. 6 shows that in all three membrane-disrupting treatments, soluble lysosomal marker enzymes and Man 6-P glycoproteins exhibit very similar release curves, indicating that they are likely to reside within the same organelle. If, as suggested by our previous experiments, the bulk of the brain Man 6-P glycoproteins are located in lysosomes, then the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated forms of the lysosomal enzymes would have identical distributions. To test this, detergent-solubilized fractions from a brain M + L sucrose density gradient (similar to the one shown in Fig. 2, left panel) were applied to a column of immobilized CI-MPR. Enzyme activities (α-fucosidase and β-galactosidase) were determined on samples of each fraction (total activity), on pooled flow-through and washes, and on Man 6-P eluates. The bound and unbound activities were expressed as the percentage of the total activity present in the gradient. Fig.7 shows that a large proportion of the active α-fucosidase and β-galactosidase are retained on the column (39 and 65% respectively), in accordance with data reported previously (8Sleat D.E Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Importantly, the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of each enzyme have similar equilibrium densities, consistent with both forms being located in the same organelle. In addition to subcellular fractionation, we used laser-scanning confocal microscopy to investigate the cellular location of Man 6-P glycoproteins in rat brain. This was compared with the distribution of cathepsin D and β-galactosidase, two lysosomal enzymes targeted by the Man 6-P pathway, and to lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP), which is synthesized as a membrane protein and is targeted to the lysosome by a Man 6-P-independent pathway. The micrographs shown in Fig. 8 represent 1-μm-thick optical sections of rat cerebral cortex layer 5, an area rich in pyramidal neurons. The Man 6-P glycoproteins (red) are predominantly found in compartments in neuronal cell bodies and some processes. Comparison of the Man 6-P glycoprotein and lysosomal enzyme-labeling (green) indicates that there is some variability both in the relative staining intensity of different neurons and in the pattern of staining. For instance, the β-galactosidase antisera stains neuronal cell bodies, but in addition, there is strong staining of long apical dendritic processes that project toward the surface of the brain (Fig. 8, bottom panels). Also, within a given cell body, there appeared to be minor differences in the relative staining of individual vesicles containing Man 6-P glycoproteins and the different lysosomal markers (most prominent with LAP). Nonetheless, the overall staining patterns showed extensive colocalization (Fig. 8,merged panels). Similar findings were obtained on neurons in numerous areas of the brain, indicating that the majority of neuronal lysosomes contain Man 6-P glycoproteins. In this report, we have investigated the subcellular localization of Man 6-P glycoproteins in rat brain using a number of complementary approaches. The biochemical experiments consistently demonstrate co-migration of Man 6-P glycoproteins and lysosomal marker enzymes in brain subcellular compartments. However, it is possible that even using the wide range fractionation methods employed in this study, distinct compartments with similar physical properties might not be distinguishable. The morphological experiments provide relatively high resolution information but are nonquantitative, and results may be dependent on antigen accessibility considerations. The convergence of these approaches strengthen our conclusion that the bulk of brain Man 6-P glycoproteins reside within neuronal lysosomes. It is reasonable to assume that the low phosphorylation state of lysosomal enzymes in most other tissues is due the short half-life of the Man 6-P marker (1.4 h in mouse BW5147 cells (20Gabel C.A. Goldberg D.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) compared with the long half-lives of lysosomal enzymes (generally days, see Refs.21Skudlarek M.D. Swank R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10137-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Smith K. Ganschow R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5437-5442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Warburton M.J. Wynn C.H. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Conversely, the high phosphorylation state of lysosomal enzymes in neurons could either be because of a relatively long half-life of the Man 6-P marker or, less likely, to a short half-life of the enzyme itself. A prolonged Man 6-P half-life could result from either the presence of some unusual neuron-specific carbohydrate modification that hinders the action of the dephosphorylating enzyme or from low levels of this enzyme. Further insight into this question will require identification of the endogenous enzyme responsible for removing the Man 6-P modification. This is unlikely to be the classical lysosomal acid phosphatase, as indicated by overexpression studies of LAP in cultured cells (24Bresciani R. Peters C. von Figura K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar) or by our findings that Man 6-P glycoproteins and LAP coexist in the same neuronal compartments.In vitro studies indicate that the Man 6-P modification can be removed by purple acid phosphatase (25Bresciani R. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). If this observation is physiologically relevant, it will be of interest to determine the cellular and intracellular distribution of this enzyme in brain. When considering the biological mechanisms and consequences of dephosphorylation of lysosomal enzymes, it is important to note that different cell lines exhibit marked differences in rates of dephosphorylation of lysosomal enzymes. For instance, Gabel et al. (26Gabel C.A. Goldberg D.E. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) find that some CI-MPR-deficient cell lines do not rapidly remove the Man 6-P marker (26Gabel C.A. Goldberg D.E. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This may not be a direct consequence of loss of the CI-MPR, as knock out mice that lack either the CI-MPR or the CD-MPR (27Sohar I. Sleat D. Liu C.-G. Ludwig T. Lobel P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) exhibit little change in overall levels of Man 6-P glycoproteins in various solid tissues (brain, liver, spleen, kidney, and lung) compared with mice that contain both MPRs. 2D.E Sleat, I. Sohar, and P. Lobel, unpublished data. Also, in some CI-MPR-containing cell lines, dephosphorylation is dependent on cell culture conditions such as cell density, serum starvation, and the presence of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor II (6Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,7Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Changes in dephosphorylation of lysosomal enzymes may also occurin vivo under certain pathological conditions. For instance, approximately one-third of all human breast carcinomas exhibit elevated levels of Man 6-P glycoproteins compared with normal breast epithelia (12Sleat D.E. Chen T.-L. Raska K. Lobel P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3424-3430PubMed Google Scholar), although the underlying mechanism of this is not known. Our studies on normal brain tissue avoid nonphysiological situations that can occur in cultured cell systems and thus are biologically relevant. However, it is important to note that brain contains ∼10–50-fold more glial cells than neurons, and there are a wide variety of neuronal cell types. This cellular heterogeneity complicates interpretation of the biochemical analysis in two areas. First, we have found that the phosphorylation state of different brain lysosomal enzymes varies considerably (this study and Ref. 8Sleat D.E Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is possible that this reflects heterogeneity within a given cell type. However, given that the relative abundance of different lysosomal enzymes varies in neurons and glia (28Petanceska S. Burke S. Watson S.J. Devi L. Neuroscience. 1994; 59: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), this would also be consistent with a situation where most of the glial-derived hydrolases lacked Man 6-P and the neuron-derived hydrolases contained Man 6-P. Second, the multiple peaks or shoulders in the profiles of the sucrose and Nycodenz density gradients (this study)and in free flow electrophoresis experiments 3M. Jadot, L. Lin, D. E. Sleat, I. Sohar, M.-S. Hsu, J. Pintar, F. Dubois, S. Wattiaux-De Coninck, R. Wattiaux, and P. Lobel, unpublished data. indicate that the brain Man 6-P glycoprotein-containing lysosomes are heterogeneous. This is also consistent with other studies on brain lysosomes (29Fiorilli A. Siniscalco C. Chiarini A. Di Francesco L. Venerando B. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 30Sellinger O.Z. Hiatt R.A. Brain Res. 1968; 7: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity may occur within a given cell type (possibly reflecting either changes in endogenous proteins and lipids as lysosomes mature or degradative intermediates during digestion of different substrates), or it may be because of the presence of lysosomes derived from different cell types. Thus, it will be important to develop biologically relevant in vitro model systems to clarify these and other mechanistic questions. The increased level of mannose 6-phosphate-containing lysosomal enzymes is not unique to rat. Elevated levels of Man 6-P glycoproteins have been observed in neurons compared with other cell types in humans and mice using biotinylated receptor and histochemistry, and similar results have been observed in bovine and mouse brain by blotting (31O'Brien D.A. Magyar P.L. Sleat D.E. Lobel P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 221Google Scholar). 4D. E. Sleat, J. Pintar, and P. Lobel, unpublished data. Retention of the Man 6-P modification on neuronal lysosomal enzymes could have important functional consequences. One possibility is that retention of the Man 6-P marker serves a protective function, allowing efficient reuptake of inadvertently secreted hydrolases. This would be particularly important in brain, given that there is extensive vesicular trafficking and exocytosis in neurons, and even a small amount of missorting could result in release of lysosomal enzymes and damage to surrounding tissue. Another intriguing possibility is that the Man 6-P modification is used to tether lysosomal enzymes to surface MPRs, greatly increasing their local concentration and allowing efficient degradation of extracellular material (32Roff C.F. Wozniak R.W. Blenis J. Wang J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 144: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Brauker J.H. Roff C.F. Wang J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 164: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this manner, the lysosomal enzymes may participate in important processes such as neuronal migration, outgrowth, and synaptic remodeling. We thank Dr. M. Pypaert, for critical reading of the manuscript and M. Savels for the artwork."

In test tube assays, PAM is phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser937. The roles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser937 in the biosynthetic and endocytic trafficking of integral membrane PAM were examined using an antiserum specific for the phosphorylation of Ser937 and using AtT-20 cells expressing membrane PAM in which Ser937 was mutated to Ala or Asp. Although phosphorylation at Ser937 can occur while PAM is in the endoplasmic reticulum, early steps in the biosynthetic trafficking of membrane PAM were not affected by Ser937 phosphorylation. The inability to phosphorylate PAM/S937A increased its intracellular degradation and decreased secretion of the soluble monooxygenase portion of PAM. In contrast, the biosynthetic trafficking of PAM/S937D was indistinguishable from wild-type PAM. Despite the fact that Ser937 is adjacent to the only Tyr-based internalization motif in PAM, internalization and trafficking through early endosomes were unaffected by phosphorylation. However, PAM antibody internalized by wild-type PAM acquired a perinuclear localization, while antibody internalized by PAM/S937A was routed to lysosomes, and antibody bound to PAM/S937D maintained a dispersed, punctate pattern. In cells stimulated with phorbol ester, phosphorylation of Ser937increased and phosphorylated PAM accumulated in large vesicular structures. Therefore, phosphorylation of PAM-1 at Ser937directs newly synthesized and internalized protein away from lysosomes, while dephosphorylation is needed for a different step in the late endocytic pathway.

The bifunctional enzyme, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), post-translationally modifies approximately half of all mammalian neuropeptides by converting a COOH-terminal glycine into an essential α-amide moiety (4Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A.

In PAM-1, a type I integral membrane protein (Fig. 1), the monooxygenase or PHM domain is separated from the lyase or PAL domain by a noncatalytic segment, exon A (19Eipper B.A. Milgram S.L. Husten E.J. Yun H.Y. Mains R.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Both catalytic domains are intragranular and are followed by a single transmembrane domain and a short, cytosolic COOH-terminal domain (CD) (2Shields D. Fricker L. Peptide Biosynthesis and Processing. CRC Press, Inc., Boston, MA1991: 37-70Google Scholar). In AtT-20 cells, soluble PAM predominantly enters the regulated secretory pathway, where it is endoproteolytically processed and stored with peptide hormones in secretory granules (20Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Integral membrane PAM-1 undergoes endoproteolysis, generating soluble PHM, which is either stored in secretory granules or secreted in a constitutive-like manner, while PAL remains attached to the membrane (20Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both membrane PAM and PAL are largely localized to a distal compartment of the TGN at steady-state (21Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on antibody internalization studies (22Tausk F.A. Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the small amount of membrane PAM located on the plasma membrane at steady-state is rapidly internalized and accumulates in perinuclear endosomes before re-entering the TGN. Routing signals, including dileucine motifs and tyrosine internalization motifs, are located in the cytosolic domains of many integral membrane proteins (24Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F.

Although the CD of PAM has a tyrosine-based internalization motif (Fig.1), elimination of this motif does not compromise the ability of membrane PAM to have access to secretory granule enzymes (29Milgram S.L.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Using purified recombinant PAM COOH-terminal domain, it was established that protein kinase A phosphorylates Ser921 and protein kinase C phosphorylates Ser932 and Ser937 (35Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); Ser937 is adjacent to the tyrosine internalization motif (Fig. 1). By expressing PAM-1 with Ser937 mutated to Ala937(PAM-1/S937A) to prevent phosphorylation, we were able to demonstrate altered endocytic trafficking (35Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Antibody internalized by cells expressing PAM-1/S937A is dispersed to lysosomes, while antibody internalized by cells expressing PAM-1 is concentrated in the TGN region; the effects of this mutation on biosynthetic trafficking were not explored (35Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This study focuses on the role of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser937 in both the biosynthetic and endocytic routing of PAM using AtT-20 cells stably transfected with PAM-1 in which Ser937 was mutated to Ala937 or Asp937 (35Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To further our understanding of the biosynthesis and localization of PAM phosphorylated at Ser937, a Ser(P)937-specific antibody was raised (Fig. 1). Although phosphorylation at Ser937 occurs in the ER, the early steps in the trafficking of newly synthesized PAM are not affected by phosphorylation at this site. The inability to phosphorylate Ser937 limits secretion of soluble PHM and increases the turnover rate of newly synthesized PAM-1. Upon stimulation with phorbol ester, the amount of PAM-1 phosphorylated at Ser937 increases rapidly, accumulating in the TGN region as well as in large vesicular structures distributed throughout the cytosol. Phosphorylation of PAM-1 at Ser937 appears to direct both the newly synthesized protein and the internalized protein away from lysosomes, while dephosphorylation at this site is needed for a separate step in late endocytic trafficking. A pBluescript plasmid encoding PAM-1 with Ser937 mutated to Asp937 (pBS.KrPAM-1/S937D) was created using SOEing polymerase chain reaction (36Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification involved an upstream sense primer (rPAM-1-(2791–2809)) and a mutagenic antisense primer with a codon (underlined) for Asp937 (5′-CCT TTTCTG TCG TAG CCT TT-3′) or a mutagenic sense primer (5′-AAA GGC TAC GAC AGA AAA GG-3′) and the T7 antisense primer. To create pBS.KrPAM-1/S937D, the final amplified fragment was inserted into pBS.KrPAM-1 using the restriction enzymes MscI andXbaI. The DNA region derived from polymerase chain reaction was verified by sequencing. The pBS.KrPAM-1/S937D construct was then inserted into the pCIS expression vector by ligation usingBsp106 and XbaI sites (35Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

AtT-20 cells were transfected with either pCI.neo.KrPAM-1/S937A or pCIS.KrPAM-1/S937D using Lipofectin (Sigma) (35Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

Stably transfected AtT-20 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal clone serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA), and antibiotics. The medium also contained 0.5 mg/ml G418 when used to select transfected cells and 0.1 mg/ml G418 for maintenance of clonal cell lines. For the following studies, 3–4 clones were used from each cell line with the relative levels of PAM expression in the clones not varying more than 2-fold. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000 for immunostaining and Western blot analyses and included the following: PHM antibody, JH1764, to PAM-1-(37–382); PAL antibody, JH471, to PAM-1-(463–864); CD antibody, JH571, to PAM-1-(898–976); and TGN38 antibody, JH1479, to TGN38-(155–249) (21Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies used included the following: CD antibody, 6E6, to PAM-1-(898–976); 1D4B (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), directed against lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) (38Hughes E.N. August J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 664-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and antibody to the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (kindly provided by Dr. Suzanne Pfeffer, Stanford University School of Medicine) (39Dintzis S.M. Velculescu V.E. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12159-12166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antisera were used at a dilution of 1:1000 for immunostaining and Western blot analyses. The CD antibody, 6E6, and the LAMP-1 antibody were used at a dilution of 1:50, while the CI-MPR antibody was diluted 1:20. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (23Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope and a Princeton Instruments Micromax digital camera. Where indicated, a Noran confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope was used. The simultaneous collection of two fluorescent signals, fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) and Cy3 (red), allowed cells in optical sections of 1 μm to be visualized. Cells labeled with only a single fluorescent tag were used as controls (21Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Cell Biology Core Facility at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine provided support for and use of the confocal microscope. A peptide from the cytosolic domain of PAM was synthesized using monobenzyl-protected Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-Ser(P), with and without a COOH-terminal Cys residue, and purified as a monomer or disulfide-linked dimer, respectively: Arg933-Lys-Gly-Tyr936-Ser(P)937-Arg-Lys-Gly-Phe-Asp942. The peptide monomer was blocked with citraconic anhydride, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride, and deblocked with sodium acetate (pH 4.2). Three rabbits were immunized by Covance (Denver, PA) using a pool of the nonconjugated disulfide-linked dimer and the hemocyanin-peptide conjugate. The titer and specificity of the Ser(P)937 antibody were determined with a solid phase assay using the following synthetic peptides: PAM-1-(933–948); PAM-1-(933–942)Ser(P)937; PAM-1-(933–942)Asp937. Antibody JH1922 produced a positive response to the synthetic phosphopeptide and no response to the nonphosphorylated peptide. JH1922 was affinity-purified using PAM-1-(933–942)Ser(P)937 linked to Affi-Gel 10. Affinity-purified antibody was used at a dilution of 1:200. To test the specificity and reliability of the Ser(P)937antibody for immunoprecipitation, AtT-20 PAM-1/S937A cells labeled with [35S]Met for 15 min were immunoprecipitated with either the PHM or the Ser(P)937 antiserum. A single band of 117-kDa PAM-1/S937A was precipitated with the PHM antibody. No PAM-1/S937A protein was immunoprecipitated by the Ser(P)937antibody; PAM-1/S937A protein was not detected even when the film was exposed for 3 times longer than the time needed to yield a dark band with the PHM antibody. Thus, the Ser(P)937 antibody has the required specificity to be used for immunoprecipitation. Cells were incubated in PAL antiserum (JH471, diluted 1:50) in complete serum-free air medium for 10 min at 37 °C and either prepared immediately for immunofluorescence staining or chased in antibody-free medium for 10, 30, or 60 min at 37 °C (23Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 40Maltese J.Y. Sharma H.W. Vassilev L. Narayanan R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To distinguish the role of phosphorylation in the internalization of PAM protein during the early and late stages of internalization, a paradigm involving a 20 °C temperature block was used to trap PAM-related proteins in earlyversus late endosomal compartments (41Futter C.E. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, cells were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with the PAL antiserum to bind the PAM protein on the surface of the cell and to prevent internalization (41Futter C.E. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 685-694PubMed Google Scholar). A subsequent 10-min antibody-free chase at 20 °C allowed internalization of PAM/PAL antibody into early endosomal compartments. To sequester PAM/PAL antibody in late endosomal compartments, the cells were incubated with PAL antibody for 90 min at 20 °C. The cells then were warmed to 37 °C for 10 and 60 min to assess the subcellular localization of the internalized PAM protein. Pulse-chase experiments were performed as described (23Milgram S.L.

Cells were extracted into ice-cold 20 mm NaTES, 10 mmmannitol, and 1% Triton X-100 (TMT, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors (300 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml α2-macroglobulin, 16 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor) and protein phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 mm NaF). Immunoprecipitates were prepared as described. A BioQuant phosphor imager was used for quantitation. Cell extracts were fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide, 0.25%N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide/SDS gels (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207084) Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) (16Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17004-17010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Visualization of the proteins was done using the PAL antibody (JH471) or the Ser(P)937-specific antiserum (JH1922) and the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit. To establish the steady-state localization of the mutant PAM-1 proteins, AtT-20 cell lines expressing PAM-1, PAM-1/S937A, or PAM-1/S937D were fixed and visualized with a PAM-CD monoclonal antibody. As previously shown, immunostaining was observed in a compact perinuclear region of the AtT-20 PAM-1 and PAM-1/S937A cells identified as the TGN (Fig. 2, A and B) (21Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, immunostaining was present at the tips of the processes of the PAM-1 and PAM-1/S937A cells. The same pattern of immunostaining was seen in the AtT-20 PAM-1/S937D cells (Fig. 2 C); staining was detected at the tips of the cellular processes as well as in a compact perinuclear region that overlapped with staining for TGN38. The AtT-20 PAM-1 and mutant PAM-1 cells were also immunostained with a polyclonal PHM antibody that produced a similar localization pattern (data not shown). Based on these results, the steady-state localization of PAM-1/S937D is not dramatically different from that of wild-type PAM-1 or PAM-1/S937A. A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for phosphorylated Ser937 of the PAM cytosolic domain was raised by immunization with a phosphorylated decapeptide (Fig.1). In a solid phase assay, the antibody did not cross-react with the nonphosphorylated peptide. However, it did detect a decapeptide in which Asp937 had been substituted for Ser937(R933KGYD937RKGFD942), suggesting specificity for a conformation associated with the presence of a negative charge at position 937 rather than for Ser(P)937itself. Finally, binding of the Ser(P)937 antibody to the Ser(P)937 peptide was not competed by 10 μmAsp, Ser(P) or Thr(P). To further test its specificity, AtT-20 PAM-1/S937A cells were immunostained with the Ser(P)937antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 E, no immunostaining was detected. Since the antibody could not detect a PAM-1 protein that could not be phosphorylated at Ser937, cross-reactivity with the Ser(P)937 antibody should be a reliable indication of phosphorylation at this site. The fact that immunostaining AtT-20 PAM-1 cells with the Ser(P)937 antibody yields a specific signal demonstrates that some PAM-1 is phosphorylated on Ser937 in AtT-20 cells (Fig. 2 D). The Ser(P)937 antibody immunostained a more diffuse perinuclear region of the cell than did the CD monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, the Ser(P)937 antibody immunostained the tips of the cellular processes with a greater intensity than the CD monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 D,inset). As expected, based on its cross-reactivity with synthetic peptides, the Ser(P)937 antibody immunostained AtT-20 PAM-1/S937D cells in the same manner as the CD monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 F). To further establish the specificity and reliability of the Ser(P)937 antibody, membrane extracts prepared from AtT-20 PAM-1, PAM-1/S937A, and PAM-1/S937D cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using antisera specific for PAL and Ser(P)937. As previously established (21Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the PAL antibody recognized full-length PAM-1 (120 kDa) as well as membrane PAL (70 kDa) (Fig. 3 A). The PAL antiserum also detected 120- and 70-kDa proteins in AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/S937A and PAM-1/S937D. No cross-reactivity was detected in the AtT-20 PAM-1/S937A cells with the Ser(P)937 antibody, providing further evidence that the Ser(P)937 antibody cannot detect PAM protein that does not have a negative charge at position 937 (Fig. 3 A). Importantly, the Ser(P)937 antibody did detect 120- and 70-kDa proteins in the AtT-20 PAM-1 cell extract. As predicted based on cross-reactivity with synthetic peptides, the Ser(P)937 antibody had high cross-reactivity with 120- and 70-kDa PAM-1/S937D. To investigate further the phosphorylation of membrane PAM, PAM-1 and PAM-1/S937D cells were labeled with medium containing [32P]PO43− or [35S]Met for 4 h. Cell extracts were analyzed with the polyclonal CD antibody or the Ser(P)937 antibody (Fig.3 B). Phosphorylation of both full-length PAM (120 kDa) and membrane PAL (70 kDa) was observed using [32P]PO43−. Importantly, the S937D mutation did not eliminate phosphorylation of PAM, indicating that Ser937 is not the only site of phosphorylation. While 70-kDa membrane PAL was readily detectable when labeled with [32P]PO43−, [35S]Met-labeled 70-kDa PAL was difficult to detect using either the CD antibody or the Ser(P)937-specific antibody. This lack of sensitivity reflects the presence of 24 methionine residues in PAM-1 with only 6 methionines in membrane PAL. The ease with which 70-kDa membrane PAL is detected by Western blotversus metabolic labeling (Fig. 3, A versus B) also suggests that 120-kDa PAM-1 and 70-kDa membrane PAL turn over at different rates. To assess their metabolism, AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/S937A or PAM-1/S937D were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]Met. Following a 15-min pulse labeling, the cells were either immediately extracted or chased for 1, 2, or 4 h before extraction. Aliquots of cell extracts and chase media were analyzed by quantitative immunoprecipitation using an antibody specific for PHM. AtT-20 cells expressing wild-type PAM-1 were analyzed for comparison. Immunoprecipitation of PHM proteins from all three cell extracts showed that only a 117-kDa PAM protein was present after the 15-min pulse (Fig. 4 A). In all three cell lines, the size of the newly synthes"

The proposed mechanism was that, unlike mammalian cells, P. carinii is unable to regulate polyamine catabolism when synthesis is blocked. To test this, the responses of the polyamine catabolic enzymes spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT) and polyamine oxidase (PAO) were determined using a new high-performance liquid chromatography assay to measure the products of these enzymes. The specific activities in untreated Pneumocystis carinii were 1.78 ± 0.5 pmol min−1 mg protein−1 for SSAT, similar to mammalian cells, and 6.42 ± 0.8 pmol min−1 mg protein−1 for PAO, 19% of that of mammalian cells. DFMO treatment for 12 h caused reductions of only 11 and 4% in SSAT and PAO, respectively, despite polyamine reductions of 94, 96, and 90% for putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, respectively. The P. carinii SSATK m value of 25 μm spermidine is 20% of that of mammalian cells, and the PAO K m value of 14 nm N 1-acetylspermidine is 0.01% of that of mammalian cells. Acetylated polyamines continue to be lost from P. carinii even when exposed to DFMO.

Acetylated polyamines continue to be lost from P. carinii even when exposed to DFMO. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that P. carinii is unable to regulate polyamine catabolism. Polyamines are small molecular weight, positively charged compounds that are ubiquitous in all living cells. The most important polyamines are putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Although much of the evidence is indirect, it is clear that polyamines play many important roles in cell growth and differentiation (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar, 2Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wallace H.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 569-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of polyamine synthesis, as well as other means of manipulating polyamine concentrations, has been used as therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. The most commonly used compound for manipulating polyamine metabolism is difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, 1The abbreviations used are: DFMO, dl-α-difluoromethylornithine; PCP, P. cariniipneumonia; SSAT, spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography1The abbreviations used are: DFMO, dl-α-difluoromethylornithine; PCP, P. cariniipneumonia; SSAT, spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography eflornithine, Ornidyl®). DFMO is an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in polyamine synthesis and is rate-limiting. Thus DFMO can completely block de novo polyamine synthesis. This drug is currently approved for treatment of human African sleeping sickness (4Van Nieuwenhove S. Ann. Soc. Belg. Med. Trop. 1992; 72 Suppl. 1: 39-51PubMed Google Scholar) and has been used as an investigational drug for cancer chemotherapy and for treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), the most common opportunistic infection associated with AIDS. DFMO is effective against PCP, in an animal model (5Clarkson Jr., A.B. Williams D.E. Rosenberg C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and in patients (6Paulson Y.J. Gilman T.M. Heseltine P.N.R. Sharma O.P. Boylen C.T. Chest. 1992; 101: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although clinical trials showed this drug to be less effective than drugs already approved, it was also less toxic (7Smith D.E. Davies S. Smithson J. Harding I. Gazzard B.G. AIDS. 1992; 6: 1489-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Animal studies, however, demonstrated that continuous infusion of DFMO greatly enhances the anti-PCP activity as compared with the intermittent dosage obtained by inclusion of the drug in the drinking water (8Chin K. Merali S. Saric M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2318-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of DFMO against PCP demonstrates that polyamine metabolism is a valid therapeutic target for this disease. A better understanding of P. carinii polyamine metabolism will improve the ability to exploit of anti-polyamine therapy PCP. In most cells the metabolism of polyamines begins with parallel decarboxylations of ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine to produce putrescine and decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, respectively. Spermidine synthase produces spermidine from putrescine via transfer of an aminopropyl group from decarboxylatedS-adenosylmethionine. Spermine synthase similarly produces spermine from spermidine by transfer of a second aminopropyl group. All four biosynthetic steps are highly exothermic are therefore essentially irreversible. However, catabolism results in back-conversion of spermine to spermidine and spermidine to putrescine. The initial and rate-limiting step in back conversion is the acetylation of spermine and spermidine by spermidine/spermine-N 1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). SSAT is a cytosolic enzyme that utilizes acetyl-CoA to acetylate a terminal amino group of spermidine or spermine, thus converting them into N 1-acetyl derivatives. The final step is removal of the acetylated aminopropyl group by polyamine oxidase (PAO), a FAD-dependent enzyme which produces 3-acetoamidopropanal and either spermidine or putrescine from N-acetylated spermine or spermidine, respectively. The catabolic intermediates (the acetylated polyamines) are less charged at physiologic pH than the parent compounds and, therefore, are easily lost from the cell. Consequently, SSAT activity can result in a net loss of polyamines from the cell as well as back-conversion to smaller polyamines. Because SSAT is critical for the maintenance of intracellular polyamine concentrations, it is usually highly regulated. SSAT can be induced by a number of factors, including environmental stress, exogenous polyamines, polyamine analogues, growth hormones, and various toxic agents (9Woster P.M. Casero R. Polyamine: Regulation and Molecular Interaction. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995: 171-205Google Scholar). Tight control of this enzyme is reflected by the rapid turnover rate (t 12 = l5 min) observed in rats treated with thioacetamide to induce SSAT (10Person L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12364-12367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of SSAT prevents polyamine depletion in mammalian cells when polyamine synthesis is blocked by DFMO (11Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). When P. carinii isolated from infected rat lungs are exposed to DFMO in vitro, intracellular polyamine concentrations decline much more rapidly than in other cell types. A 3-h exposure ofP. carinii to DFMO in vitro reduced the putrescine, spermidine, and spermine concentrations by 88, 71, and 84%, respectively (12Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, 3–4 days were required to deplete mammalian cells of putrescine and spermidine and, even then, spermine concentration was either not reduced or reduced by only 50% depending on the cell types (13Arundel C.M. Kishioka K. Tofilon P.J. Radiat. Res. 1988; 114: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Nakaike S. Kashiwagi K. Terao K. Iio K. Igarashi K. Jpn. J.

Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 29: 189-201Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since de novopolyamine synthesis in both P. carinii and mammalian cells is blocked by DFMO, these data led to the hypothesis that polyamine catabolism is not regulated in P. carinii, which would cause this pathogen to be particularly vulnerable to compounds that interfere with polyamine synthesis (8Chin K. Merali S. Saric M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2318-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The work reported here supports that hypothesis by demonstrating that SSAT and PAO activities are not reduced when cellular polyamine concentrations decrease due to inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase by DFMO. In addition, as internal polyamine concentrations decrease as a result of polyamine catabolism, excretion from the cell further reduces the polyamine pool. Spermidine, putrescine,N 1-acetylspermidine, 1,7-diaminoheptane, and acetyl-CoA were purchased from Sigma; AccQ.Fluor reagent kit was from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA); N 1,N 12-diethylspermine was obtained from Tocris Cookson (St. Louis, MO); DFMO was from Ilex Oncology (San Antonio, TX). P. carinii cells freshly isolated from rat lungs (12Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for development of theN 1-acetylspermidine HPLC method. All other experiments were performed with cells grown in a newly developed continuous axenic culture system for P. carinii (17Merali S. Frevert U. Williams J.H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared by suspending P. carinii in NKPD buffer (2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, 51.1 mmNa2HPO4, 7.43 mmNaH2PO4, 62 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol), sonicating for 20 min at 40 watts and 70% duty cycle (Heat System, Ultrasonics Inc., Plainview, NY), clarifying by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min, and dialyzing the supernatant against two changes of 1000 ml of NKPD buffer. An aliquot of each extract was retained for protein assay (dotMetric assay, Geno Technology, Inc., St. Louis, MO), and the balance was used immediately for various experiments. The in vitro axenic culture of P. carinii was as described previously (17Merali S. Frevert U. Williams J.H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cultured P. carinii cells were centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 10 min, suspended in RPMI 1640 tissue culture (Life Technologies, Inc.) with no serum, and divided into four aliquots. One aliquot was extracted for polyamine analysis immediately. DFMO (1 mm) was added to the other three aliquots, and they were incubated at 37 °C. One aliquot was extracted for polyamine analysis after a 3-h incubation with DFMO and another after a 12-h incubation. The fourth aliquot was incubated with DFMO for 3 h. The DFMO was removed by centrifuging the cells at 5000 × g for 10 min and resuspending them in fresh RPMI 1640; after an additional 1-h incubation at 37 °C to allow polyamine content to recover, this aliquot was extracted for polyamine analysis. The assay for SSAT activity was adapted from Wallace and Evans (18Wallace H.M. Evans D.M. Morgan D. Methods in Molecular Biology. 79. Human Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 59-68Google Scholar). Each reaction had a final volume of 50 μl; 40 μl of the dialysate and 10 μl of NKPD buffer containing 3 mm spermidine and 250 μm acetyl-CoA. The mixture was incubated for the indicated time at 31 °C, and the reaction was stopped by heating in a boiling water bath for 2 min. Prior to precolumn derivatization, the sample was clarified by microfugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g; 30 μl of the supernatant was used for derivatization and HPLC analysis. PAO activity was assayed in a total volume of 50 μl; 40 μl of the dialysate and 10 μl of 5 mm N 1-acetylspermidine. The mixture was incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C and the reaction stopped by heating in a boiling water bath. After microcentrifuging for 10 min at 14,000 × g, 30 μl of the supernatant was used for precolumn derivatization and HPLC. Precolumn derivatization was performed as described previously (19Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Chromatogr. B: Biomed. Appl. 1996; 675: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An internal standard (5 μl of 5 μg ml−1 1,7-diaminoheptane) and 45 μl of borate buffer (0.2 m sodium borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.8) were added to 30 μl of either P. carinii extract or a mixture of standards (putrescine orN 1-acetylspermidine). After mixing, 20 μl of AccQ.Fluor reagent was added. A Waters HPLC system was used including a quaternary pump (model 625), a system controller (model 600E), an autosampler (model 715), and a fluorescence detector (model 470). Waters Millennium32software (Version 3.05) was used to control the system and collect the data. A 5-μm silica particle C8 Microsorb™-MV column (150 × 4.6 mm inner diameter) with a 100-Å pore size (Rainin Instrument Co. Inc., Woburn, MA) was used for SSAT assays, and a Zobax CN column (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter) (DuPont) was used for PAO assays. Fluorescence excitation was at 250 nm, and emission was collected at 395 nm for both assays. For SSAT assay the mobile phase gradient was as described previously for polyamine analysis (19Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Chromatogr. B: Biomed. Appl. 1996; 675: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For PAO assay the mobile phase consisted of eluent A (140 mmsodium acetate and 17 mm triethanolamine, pH 5.05) and acetonitrile. Elution was at 1.0 ml min−1 and began with a linear gradient starting with 83% eluent A, 17% acetonitrile extending to 60% eluent A, 40% acetonitrile over 20 min. This was followed by a second linear gradient ending with 40% eluent A, 60% acetonitrile over the next 10 min. The mobile phase was held at 40% eluent A, 60% acetonitrile for 5 min before regenerating the starting conditions using linear gradient over 10 min. All analyses were performed at room temperature. Most of the work reported here was done with cells grown in a new culture system for P. carinii (17Merali S. Frevert U. Williams J.H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One critical experiment that had been done previously with cells isolated from infected animals was repeated with cultured cells for comparison and for validation of other results obtained with cultured cells; i.e. a study was made of the rate of polyamine depletion in cultured cells in which polyamine synthesis was blocked by DFMO. The results presented in TableI show that exposure to DFMO causes cultured cells to become rapidly depleted of polyamines in a manner similar to cells P. carinii isolated from infected animal lungs (12Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IEffect on the polyamine content after exposure of cultured P. carinii cells to 1 mm DFMO and recovery after removal of DFMOExposure to 1 mm DFMOPolyaminePutrescineSpermidineSperminepmol mg protein−10 h6985824323 h84877612 h4223433.0 h plus 1-h recoveryPlus 1-h recovery447338225 Open table in a new tab For measurement of SSAT activity in P. carinii, the previously reported polyamine analytical method (19Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Chromatogr. B: Biomed. Appl. 1996; 675: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was adapted for detection of N 1-acetylspermidine, the key product of this enzyme. This method was calibrated and validated by demonstrating linearity (r > 0.99) and sensitivity in the subpicomole range using purchased authentic compounds. Fig.1 presents two chromatograms of P. carinii lysate; chromatogram (A) was spiked with authentic N 1-acetylspermidine to identify the peak. SSAT activity in dialyzed cell lysates was measured by following the accumulation of N 1-acetylspermidine. To ensure that the enzyme was adequately stable during the incubation period, accumulation of product was measured over 30 min as shown in Fig. 2. Stability was judged to be good, since the plot is linear with time. The specific SSAT activity of cultured cells was 1.78 ± 0.5 pmol−1min−1 mg protein−1 (n = 3). At a constant acetyl-CoA concentration of 250 μm, aK m value of 25 μm for spermidine was calculated from the slope shown in Fig.3.Figure 2Production of SSAT product, N1-acetylspermidine (N 1 -acetylspd) at different time points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Lineweaver-Burk plot showing the effect of spermidine concentration on SSAT activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PAO activity was measured by following the production of putrescine in a dialyzed cell lysate to which 125 μm N 1-acetylspermidine had been added. Fig.4 presents two chromatograms of P. carinii lysate, with one chromatogram spiked with authentic putrescine to identify the peak. The stability of enzyme activity during 45 min of incubation is demonstrated by the linear rate of product accumulation with time as shown in Fig.5. PAO specific activity was 6.42 ± 0.8 pmol−1 min−1 mg protein−1(n = 3). A K m value of 14 nm was calculated from the slope shown in Fig.6.Figure 5Production of PAO product, putrescine, at different time points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Lineweaver-Burk plot showing the effect of putrescine concentration on PAO activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Measurements were made of the response of SSAT and PAO activities to polyamine depletion. Cultured cells were incubated with 1 mm DFMO for 12 h to deplete polyamines (conditions as in Table I). Although SSAT and PAO activities were reduced by 11% (1.59 ± 0.4 pmol−1 min−1 mg protein−1; n = 3), and 4% (6.14 ± 2.6 pmol−1 min−1 mg protein−1;n = 3), respectively, compared with untreated cells, these changes are not considered significant. N 1, N 12-Diethylspermine is a polyamine analogue that induces SSAT activity and causes depletion of polyamines in some cells (11Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). P. carinii cells were exposed to this compound to test the possibility that SSAT could be induced, even if it is not down-regulated by polyamine depletion. Cells were incubated with 100 μm N 1,N 12-diethylspermine for 24 h at 31 °C. At the end of the incubations (n = 3), SSAT activity was 1.86 ± 0.5 pmol−1 min−1 mg protein−1, a 12% increase in activity compared with the control 1.66 ± 0.4 pmol−1 min−1 mg protein−1. This increase is not considered significant. Excretion of acetylated polyamines was studied by following the increase in N 1-acetylspermine andN 1-acetylspermidine concentrations in the growth medium of a P. carinii culture. To enhance sensitivity, 2.5 ml of medium were deproteinized by boiling, clarified by centrifugation, lyophilized and redissolved in 100 μl of HPLC running buffer. N 1-Acetylspermine andN 1-acetylspermidine accumulated in the medium to concentrations of 124 ± 28 (n = 3) and 216 ± 37 (n = 3) pmol mg protein−1 during the 48 h of the assay. To assure that the measured acetylated polyamines were exclusively from P. carinii, a control incubation was done without P. carinii. No acetylated polyamines were detected in the control. When polyamine synthesis was blocked by incubation of cells with 1 mm DFMO for 12 h, accumulation of N 1-acetylspermine andN 1-acetylspermidine was somewhat lower (21 and 34 pmol mg protein−1, respectively) than for the controls without DFMO (30 and 48 pmol mg protein−1, respectively). The experiments reported here have the advantage of using cells grown in tissue culture so that they could be performed under conditions fully supporting P. carinii growth. After a 3-h exposure to DFMO, cells isolated from infected rat lungs were 88, 71, and 84% depleted of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, respectively (12Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After similar treatment, the cultured cells used here were 88, 85, and 82% depleted, respectively. The similarity of the responses indicates that cells isolated from animals and cells grown in vitro are equivalent in response to DFMO and likely most other aspects of polyamine metabolism. For future work, however, cultured cells offer possibilities for experiments beyond what can be done with cells isolated from animals. P. carinii has both of the conventional polyamine catalytic enzymes, SSAT and PAO. The specific activity of SSAT inP. carinii, 1.78 ± 0.5 pmol min−1 mg protein−1, is similar to that reported in mammalian cells, 1.27 pmol min−1 mg protein−1. However, the K m for spermidine, 25 μm, is significantly lower than for mammalian cells, 130 μm (20Della Ragione F. Pegg A. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The specific activity of PAO in P. carinii, 6.42 ± 0.8 pmol min−1mg protein−1, is lower than that reported in mammalian cells, 34 pmol min−1 mg protein−1. TheK m for N 1-acetylspermidine, 14.25 nm, is significantly lower than that reported for mammalian cells, 14 μm (21Holtta E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) The unusual feature of P. carinii polyamine catabolism is the lack of modulation of SSAT and PAO activities when the cellular content of polyamines is sharply reduced by exposure to DFMO. In mammalian cells the effect of DFMO on polyamine content is attenuated by down-regulation of SSAT which slows polyamine catabolism thus helping the cells to maintain the polyamines already synthesized. For example, exposure of mammalian CHO cells to 1 mm DFMO resulted in 60% reduction in SSAT activity by 24 h; putrescine and spermidine were substantially depleted after 3 days but even then spermine was only slightly reduced (22Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This contrasts to the data presented here which show that a 3-h exposure of P. cariniito 1 mm DFMO causes only minimally reduced SSAT and PAO activities (11 and 4%, respectively), while causing severe reductions in the content of all three polyamines. Even though P. carinii does not repress SSAT when polyamines decline, the possibility of induction was examined, since a drug-induced increase in SSAT activity could enhance the therapeutic activity of compounds that block ornithine decarboxylase. However,N 1, N 12-diethylspermine, which is known to induce SSAT in L1210 cells (11Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar), was without effect in P. carinii. These results suggest that P. carinii SSAT is a nonregulated, constitutively expressed enzyme, a situation that has not been reported for any other cell type. An expected consequence of polyamine acetylation is loss of acetylated polyamines from the cell due to the reduction in positive charge caused by the acetylation. Excretion of acetylated polyamines by P. carinii was examined by measuring the accumulation of acetylated polyamines in culture medium. On a picomole milligram protein−1 basis, the total acetylated polyamine accumulation in the medium over 48 h was 20% of the total normal polyamine content of the P. carinii cells. This excretion is similar to that reported in HT115 cells; 25% of the polyamine content was lost after 96 h (23Wallace H.M. Mackarel A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The addition of 1 mm DFMO for 12 h reduced excretion by 29%, compared with untreated controls; this reduction was most likely due to the declining gradient across the cell membrane caused by the inability to make new polyamines as acetylated polyamines were lost. The data presented here provide biochemical confirmation for the hypothesis that the selective action of anti-polyamine therapy againstP. carinii is based on inability of this fungus to compensate for inhibition of polyamine anabolism by down-regulating polyamine catabolism. These results also confirm the usefulness of cultured P. carinii for biochemical investigations."

Mutations affecting amino acids 309–325 gave slightly elevated nuclease activity. In region 367–376, two mutations gave 12–15-fold increased nuclease activity. Our results do not support the catalytic role in nuclease activity proposed for the conserved DDRD motif in this region (Shirai, T., and Go, M. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 9056–9060). Mutations centered on a basic region from amino acids 480 to 490, which aligns with Escherichia coli β-subunit sequences between Rifr clusters I and II, produce changes in the relative yields of A- and G-containing dinucleotides. Four such mutant polymerases pause during elongation at GPy sequences and, in addition, have a reduced frequency of termination at T5 terminator sequences. We propose that the side chains of these mutationally altered amino acids are in direct contact with bases in the RNA-DNA hybrid very near the growing 3′-end. Two mutations in domain I near the C terminus produced very large increases in exonuclease activity and strongly increased termination, suggesting that this region also contacts the nascent RNA in the hybrid region.

Two mutations in domain I near the C terminus produced very large increases in exonuclease activity and strongly increased termination, suggesting that this region also contacts the nascent RNA in the hybrid region. The elongation phase of transcription by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases has long been viewed as a repetitive sequence of choices between two alternative outcomes: addition of another nucleotide to the growing RNA or dissociation of enzyme and RNA from the DNA template, resulting in termination (2von Hippel P.H. Yager T.D. Science. 1992; 255: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). More recently, this interplay was seen to involve the additional options of pausing induced by certain template sequences and resection of transcript 3′ termini, an exonuclease reaction triggered by both spontaneous pausing and artificially arrested elongation (3Surrat C.K. Milan S.C. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7983-7987Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 4Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A common element in pausing, termination, and 3′-exonuclease action is their tendency to occur preferentially when the elongating polymerase has just incorporated several uridylate residues into RNA. Eukaryotic RNA polymerases II and III undergo spontaneous arrest and long pausing, respectively, at U2 or longer tracts (5Izban M.J. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Matsuzaki H. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1173-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas the sites for pol III 1The abbreviations used are: pol III, polymerase IIItranscription termination and Escherichia coli(Rho-independent) transcription termination both occur following long U tracts (7Rosenberg M. Court D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1979; 13: 319-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar, 8Allison D.S. Hall B.D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In earlier studies of in vivo termination by yeast RNA polymerase III, we found that genetic alteration of the second largest subunit can change this enzyme's ability to continue transcription downstream of a U5 tract. Mutant polymerases with increased read-through of an intronic U5 sequence in theSUP4 UIV allele can efficiently produce biologically active suppressor tRNATyr (9James P. Hall B.D. Genetics. 1990; 125: 293-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shaaban S.A. Krupp B.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutant polymerases also read through the U5 tract in SUP4Δ94 that is placed at the location of the normal U7GU6terminator, producing abnormally long pre-tRNAs that are not matured to functional tRNATyr. By in vivo mutant screening with these same two SUP4 alleles, a large number of second-largest subunit mutations having the opposite phenotype were also obtained. These have been designated increased termination mutations (10Shaaban S.A. Krupp B.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA polymerase III preparations isolated from several yeast strains bearing increased or decreased termination mutations have an altered response to several U-rich pause sites within the SUP4template (11Shaaban S.A. Bobkova E.V. Chudzik D.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6468-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because of our previous observation (12Bobkova E.V. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22832-22839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that the amounts of mono- and dinucleotide exonuclease products released concurrently with the transcription reaction are directly proportional to the content of oligo(U) tracts in the transcript, we have characterized the set of ret1 mutations in the second largest pol III subunit for the specific activity and substrate preference of the 3′-exonuclease of each mutant pol III. We made analytical measurements of the dinucleotide products released during transcription by the mutant yeast enzymes. As templates, we employed the SUP4-o yeast tRNATyr gene, which contains three internal pause sites and a U7GU6terminator, as well as a synthetically constructed chimeric tRNATyr/tRNALeu tRNA gene. The latter template contained a U6 terminator between the A and B block internal control regions as well as the normal U7terminator at the end of the tRNA3Leugene. For each mutant RNA polymerase III transcribing these two DNA templates, we measured both the total amount of dinucleotide released per transcript completed and the ratio between released pUpU and released pGpU. Of the 25 ret1 alleles studied, 11 had near normal rates of dinucleotide release, one had significantly slower cleavage, and the remainder had rates of RNA cleavage ranging from 2 to 60 times that of the wild type. The largest effects were produced by mutations in two conserved motifs: DDRDYVGNKR, between amino acids 367 and 376, and GEMERDCYIA, between amino acid 1063 and 1072 (10Shaaban S.A. Krupp B.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Qualitative effects upon the release of pGpU relative to pUpU were observed for mutations in the region from amino acids 476 to 485 (analogous to Rifr cluster II of E. coli rpoB (13Jin D.J. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar)). [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]UTP, fast protein liquid chromatography-purified ribo- and deoxy-NTPs, and the SculptorTM in vitro mutagenesis system were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ribo-ApU and UpA were obtained from Sigma, and other ribo-oligonucleotides were from Oligos Etc. Inc. M-280 streptavidin-Dynabeads were purchased from Dynal, Inc. DNase- and RNase-free bovine serum albumin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Vent DNA polymerase, T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis Kit was purchased from Stratagene. RNase-free solutions, glassware, and plasticware used in all experiments were prepared as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Linear double-stranded DNA fragments ∼400–500 base pairs in length containing SUP4 tRNATyr were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the M13mp18 plasmid carrying the 256-base pair BamHI–BamHISUP4 tRNATyr fragment (15Baker R.E. Gabrielsen O. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5275-5282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. To obtain a pol III template lacking oligo(A) sequences prior to the terminator, a chimeric gene was constructed by placing an artificial terminator between the synthetic A and B blocks of the yeast tRNA3Leu gene with SUP4tRNATyr sequences preceding the A block. The ∼1300-base pair EcoRI–PstI fragment was subcloned into plasmid pUC119, and the resulting plasmid was used as a template in polymerase chain reaction amplification to produce biotinylated DNA fragments containing a chimeric gene as described (12Bobkova E.V. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22832-22839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These linear double-stranded DNA templates, immobilized on magnetic beads through streptavidin-biotin interactions, were used in all transcription experiments. The average concentration of template was ∼ 300 pmol/ml of magnetic beads. Yeast P-11 extract, prepared as described (11Shaaban S.A. Bobkova E.V. Chudzik D.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6468-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but substituting Sephadex G-10 for Sephadex G-50 chromatography, was used as a source of RNA polymerase III and its transcription factors. Ternary complexes of wild-type RNA polymerase III stalled at position +17 were formed in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μl of P-11 extract, 3 pm linear double-stranded SUP4 template attached to the magnetic beads, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, and 0.5 mm UTP in transcription buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 6% glycerol). Since the specific activities of some of the mutants were considerably lower than that of wild-type enzyme, transcription reactions for those mutants were proportionally scaled up to obtain an intensity of the full-length product signal approximately equal to that of the wild type. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, ternary complexes were magnetically concentrated and washed three times with an excess volume of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol). Transcription was then restarted by the addition of 0.2 mm CTP, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 15 μm [α-32P]UTP, and 0.5 mg/ml heparin to prevent reinitiation. The total volume of each post-initiation reaction was 6 μl. After transcription was allowed to proceed for 3 h to ensure that the slowest mutants had finished traversing theSUP4 gene, the reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm and 1:3 (v/v) 98% formamide. After heating at 95 °C for 30 min and magnetic separation, samples were separated on 20% gels as described (12Bobkova E.V. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22832-22839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To avoid possible distortions of the front bands and to verify that the original [α-32P]UTP reagent contained no overlapping contaminants, we loaded buffer containing all components except the ternary complex in between sample lanes. Dried gels were then subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. The formation and purification of 17-mer ternary complexes on a chimeric template were performed under the conditions described above. Transcription was restarted by the addition of 0.2 mm CTP, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.4 mm GTP, 2 μm [α-32P]UTP, and 0.5 mg/ml heparin to prevent reinitiation. The total reaction volume was 6 μl. After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the reactions were stopped and treated as described above. Wild-type 17-mer ternary complexes were formed in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μl of P-11 extract, 3 pm linear double-stranded SUP4 template attached to the magnetic beads, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, and 0.3 μm [α-32P]UTP in transcription buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 6% glycerol). For mutant polymerases with lower specific activities, transcription reactions were proportionally scaled up. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, ternary complexes were purified as described above. After resuspension in 60 μl of washing buffer, magnetic beads with the attached ternary complexes were distributed to reaction tubes at 10 μl/aliquot. Transcription was then restarted by the addition of 0.1 mmCTP, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.2 mmUTP, and 0.5 mg/ml heparin to prevent reinitiation. The total volume of each post-initiation reaction was 40 μl. After transcription was allowed to proceed for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 s, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 μl of stop mixture (1 mg/ml proteinase K, 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mg/ml carrier RNA) and incubated at 65 °C for 30 min. After magnetic separation and ethanol precipitation, samples were resuspended in loading buffer (100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 8 m urea, and 0.025% xylene cyanol dye) and separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mutant R376A was produced according to the procedure of the Amersham SculptorTM kit. Mutations D370E and D370A were created by the polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis procedure described in the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit. Phagemid pSA-70 containing theBamHI–PstI fragment of RET1 (10Shaaban S.A. Krupp B.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a template in all mutagenesis reactions. The 440-base pairMluI–PstI fragment was then used to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment in expression vector pSA-71. The mutations were rechecked by sequencing the final plasmids. In vivo termination phenotypes of the resulting mutant polymerases were checked as described (10Shaaban S.A. Krupp B.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled markers were obtained as described (16Izban M.J. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12864-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by phosphorylation of appropriate 5′-nonphosphorylated ribo-oligonucleotides with T4 polynucleotide kinase. To provide a quantitative measurement of 3′-exonuclease action concurrent with transcription, we carried out single-round transcription with yeast RNA polymerase III from each of theret1 mutant alleles. For this purpose, the DNA template was immobilized on magnetic beads, and the magnetically purified transcription complexes were washed free of unbound proteins and nucleic acids as described previously (12Bobkova E.V. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22832-22839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transcription was started in the presence of ATP, CTP, and UTP, and then the resulting 17-mer complexes were purified by extensive washing of Dynabeads with the attached ternary complexes. Elongation was restarted in the presence of all four NTPs with [α-32P]UTP as the radioactive label. After elongation was completed, reactions were stopped and denatured in the presence of formamide. The samples were then loaded onto 20% polyacrylamide gels to detect both the RNA and oligonucleotides made during the transcription reaction. Cleavage by mutant polymerases during elongation on the SUP4tRNATyr gene is shown in Fig.1. Under the conditions used, the intensities of cleavage products were ∼100 times higher than those of full-length RNA. For autoradiographic display of both long and short products separated on the same gel, the bottom part of gel was exposed against the film for only 2 h in comparison with 12 h for the upper part that contains completed RNA molecules. As shown Fig. 1, many of the mutants investigated have marked differences in their hydrolytic properties compared with that of wild-type RNA polymerase. For example, mutants K310T, V309E, E325K, M312T, and T311K produced considerably more of the pyrimidine dinucleotide (pPypPy) product than did the wild type (Fig. 1,A and B). This increase was even more obvious in the case of mutants D370E and R376A (Fig. 1 D) and mutants I1071S and A1075V (Fig. 1 E). For quantitation, the gels were analyzed by a PhosphorImager, permitting a comparison of the amounts of full-length transcript and short cleavage products produced per round of transcription. For every mutant, at least three replicate experiments were done. The results are summarized in Table I. The three parameters we chose typify different aspects of the cleavage reaction. The first of these (Table I, second column), frequency of nucleolytic events per round of transcription, is defined as the ratio between the amounts of pPypPy product and full-length RNA for each mutant. The other parameters were the ratios between pGpU or pApU and the major cleavage product pPypPy. The values in the second and sixth columns were normalized to those for wild-type pol III, set at 100%, whereas the values for dinucleotide ratios were normalized to a wild-type value of 1.0.Table IHydrolytic properties of RNA polymerase III mutantsMutationSUP4ratiosTaT, termination phenotype as determined in Ref. 11; R, strong reduced termination phenotype; I, strong increased termination phenotype; r, moderately reduced termination phenotype; i, moderately increased termination phenotype; frequency, ratio of pPypPy to full-length product; relative production of pGpU; ratio of pGpU to pPypPy; relative production of pApU, ratio of pApU to pPypPy.tRNATyr/tRNALeuFrequencypGpU: pUpUpApU:pUpUT1-aT, termination phenotype as determined in Ref. 11; R, strong reduced termination phenotype; I, strong increased termination phenotype; r, moderately reduced termination phenotype; i, moderately increased termination phenotype; frequency, ratio of pPypPy to full-length product; relative production of pGpU; ratio of pGpU to pPypPy; relative production of pApU, ratio of pApU to pPypPy.FrequencypGpU: pUpU%%V309E231 ± 331.18 ± 0.150.84 ± 0.03R168 ± 401.02 ± 0.25K310T373 ± 271.23 ± 0.390.95 ± 0.24I358 ± 240.60 ± 0.04T311K194 ± 101.25 ± 0.221.00 ± 0.07R335 ± 450.81 ± 0.09M312I329 ± 221.15 ± 0.222.08 ± 0.01I714 ± 390.58 ± 0.09E325K142 ± 311.09 ± 0.200.69 ± 0.17R227 ± 190.76 ± 0.08K310T/I324K51 ± 431.06 ± 0.210.78 ± 0.08I37 ± 31.03 ± 0.08D370E1500 ± 340.60 ± 0.061.04 ± 0.08r1422 ± 140.69 ± 0.01D370A142 ± 150.60 ± 0.050.53 ± 0.06R148 ± 580.76 ± 0.12R376A1267 ± 310.72 ± 0.090.78 ± 0.08i748 ± 411.03 ± 0.01T455I560 ± 460.89 ± 0.221.05 ± 0.17R4251 ± 330.77 ± 0.11L458H98 ± 101.04 ± 0.181.20 ± 0.19I154 ± 261.14 ± 0.31Q476R149 ± 120.88 ± 0.050.99 ± 0.06R225 ± 261.64 ± 0.67E478K238 ± 440.80 ± 0.040.73 ± 0.08I245 ± 290.94 ± 0.11T455I/E478K115 ± 370.60 ± 0.070.66 ± 0.07R201 ± 271.64 ± 0.67V483D131 ± 50.58 ± 0.040.89 ± 0.10R295 ± 251.14 ± 0.22G485N119 ± 260.45 ± 0.010.34 ± 0.01R133 ± 172.63 ± 0.55K512N155 ± 470.66 ± 0.070.75 ± 0.15R243 ± 291.39 ± 0.08N513Y109 ± 271.03 ± 0.231.20 ± 0.33I217 ± 171.18 ± 0.26M517I94 ± 310.82 ± 0.180.95 ± 0.15I104 ± 241.27 ± 0.29V511E/L516S129 ± 331.04 ± 0.171.16 ± 0.27I174 ± 61.06 ± 0.14R1061S92 ± 160.96 ± 0.060.41 ± 0.05I82 ± 51.54 ± 0.12M1065L128 ± 341.20 ± 0.131.10 ± 0.10I288 ± 181.04 ± 0.15I1071S6029 ± 280.99 ± 0.101.85 ± 0.51I2890 ± 50.93 ± 0.23A1075V1538 ± 360.63 ± 0.021.03 ± 0.13I1278 ± 21.03 ± 0.14R1061K/E1081D120 ± 440.93 ± 0.091.08 ± 0.29I378 ± 501.05 ± 0.151-a T, termination phenotype as determined in Ref. 11Shaaban S.A.

Open table in a new tab pol III enzymes with ret1 mutations between amino acids 300 and 325 performed cleavage several times more frequently than does the wild-type enzyme (Table I). For these, the relative amounts of different dinucleotide products remained about the same as for the wild-type polymerase. The only exception is mutant M312I, which showed a 2-fold increase in the relative production of pApU product. Mutations in the conserved regions 370–376 and 1061–1075 caused drastic qualitative and/or quantitative changes in the cleavage reaction. Mutant polymerases from these regions performed cleavage 12–60 times more frequently than did the wild-type enzyme. Amino acid substitutions at the invariant residue Asp-370 led to a reduction in the relative yield of G-containing dinucleotide. Substitution of alanine for aspartate also caused a decrease in the relative production of pApU. Mutant I1071S cleaved 60 times more frequently than did the wild type and produced twice as high an amount of pApU, with no effect on pGpU production. In contrast, mutant A1075V demonstrated a considerably lower relative yield of pGpU product, but did not alter pApU production. Mutant R1061S demonstrated behavior that was similar to that of mutants in region 455–512. While cutting with the same frequency as the wild-type enzyme, it showed a 2-fold increase in the relative production of pApU. Mutations in region 455–512 exhibited a very specific effect on hydrolytic activity. Mutant polymerases V483D, G485N, and K512N and the double mutant T455I/E478K produced less G-containing products than did the wild-type enzyme. In addition, mutant G485N and double mutant T455I/E478K showed a reduced production of pApU product. The frequency of cleavage events per round of transcription was unchanged for all these mutants. It is interesting that altered termination mutations in the adjoining region 512–517 showed no changes whatsoever in hydrolytic properties. To further simplify the analysis of short cleavage products of varying composition, we analyzed 3′-exonuclease products and transcripts made on the chimeric tRNATyr/tRNALeu pol III template (12Bobkova E.V. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22832-22839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that lacks natural arrest sites. In transcribing this template, wild-type ternary complexes elongate synchronously up to the terminator without pausing. Since the artificially constructed terminator (T7) of the chimeric template is not as efficient as the double terminator (T7GT6) of the SUP4 tRNATyr gene, to prevent substantial “leakage” through the terminator, we performed elongation at a reduced UTP concentration (2 μm). Products formed during a single round of elongation on this chimeric template are shown in Fig. 2. Mutants in the region between amino acids 300 and 325 exhibited the expected severalfold increase in cleavage frequency per round of transcription. Interestingly, mutants from region 455–512, which produced less of the G-containing cleavage products during transcription of the SUP4tRNATyr gene, showed considerably higher amounts of pGpU product formed on the chimeric template than did the wild-type RNA polymerase. The sizes of the full-length products made by these mutants were also quite different from those made by the wild type. Mutants G485N, K512N, and V483D and double mutant T455I/E478K displayed pausing at sites through which wild-type polymerase and all other mutants elongated smoothly. To determine the positions on the template at which these mutants pause, we performed electrophoretic separation of the products on a long 10% polyacrylamide gel (Fig.3 A). The results show that these mutant polymerases are arrested at or near positions where the RNA transcript has a G residue at its 3′ terminus. To check if there are any other positions on chimeric template through which these “G mutants” elongate differently from the wild-type enzyme, we carried out elongation kinetics with time intervals as short as 1 s. The results (Fig. 3 B) demonstrate that this pausing at G-associated positions happens throughout the gene, not only near the terminator. The pausing occurs preferentially at G residues that precede a pyrimidine.Figure 3Arrest sites during transcription of the chimeric RNA pol III gene by mutants with G-dependent pausing.

Because of the shared dependence of these two processes upon U residues, we have examined a collection of altered termination mutants in yeast pol III for possible qualitative or quantitative changes in their pol III exonuclease activity. Many of these mutant enzymes have either an enhanced or reduced tendency to pause at short clusters of T residues in the non-template strand (11Shaaban S.A. Bobkova E.V. Chudzik D.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6468-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Different mutant alleles vary in the time they require to complete transcription of a tDNA template; the number and length of pauses during transcription are by far the most important determinants of the time required for transcription of a tRNA gene (11Shaaban S.A. Bobkova E.V. Chudzik D.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6468-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There is a distinctive range of mutant nuclease phenotypes within each of the four gene regions from which we have chosen alleles for study (Fig.4). In the Arg-Lys-rich region 309–325, all the mutant polymerases except one have elevated nuclease activity; generally, the mutant cleavage frequency is higher than wild type by a factor of 2–3. The relative composition of cleavage products remains the same as for wild-type pol III. Continuing studies on mutants in this region show that they have large effects upon the kinetics of transcript release independently of any change in pol III exonuclease activity. Within the conserved domain 367DDRDYVGNKR376(Fig. 4), changes in invariant residues Asp-370 and Arg-376 in two cases act to strongly influence the cleavage process, yet these conserved residues are not essential for cleavage itself. Mutagenesis at these positions produced a >10-fold increase in the number of cleavage events as well as a considerable decrease in the proportion of pGpU and pApU cleavage products. The presence of enhanced nuclease activity following such drastic changes in amino acid sequence (Arg or Asp for Ala) argues against participation of this region in the nuclease active site (1Shirai T. Go M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9056-9060Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), yet it may be located very near to it. Similar but even stronger effects were shown by two mutants from the conserved C-terminal region 1061–1081 (Fig. 4). The drastic changes exhibited by mutants I1071S and A1075V both in the frequency of cleavage events and in the production of pGpU and pApU can be explained by specific interactions of these residues with sequences at or near the RNA 3′ terminus. In addition, previous studies (11Shaaban S.A. Bobkova E.V. Chudzik D.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6468-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19.Shaaban, S. A., Mutant Analysis of Termination and Elongation by RNA Polymerase III.Ph.D. thesis, 1993, University of Washington.Google Scholar) on elongation by RNA polymerase III containing the mutant subunit R1061K/E1081D showed drastically slowed transcription due to pausing of very long duration at the normal (U-rich) pause sites. All of these effects seem entirely consistent with a role of this region, corresponding both in sequence and in placement to region I of theE. coli RpoB protein, in processive elongation. We examined 11 different mutant pol III preparations with substitution mutations between amino acids 455 and 517 (Fig. 4), a region that corresponds in position and sequence to Rifrclusters I and II in the E. coli rpoB gene (13Jin D.J. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Approximately half of these mutant polymerases, including all with changes in the region from amino acids 476 to 485, gave altered ratios of pGpU and/or pApU to pUpU hydrolytic release. This effect was particularly strong for mutants T455I/E478K and G485N. Most of the mutant RNA polymerases with alterations in region 476–485 showed RNA sequence specificity in their dinucleotide release preference. For the chimeric tRNATyr/tRNALeutRNA transcript, there was heightened pGpU production by these mutants, whereas with the SUP4 transcript, there was diminished release of pGpU for many of the mutant pol III enzymes with amino acid changes between residues 476 and 512. Between these two DNA templates, there are substantial differences in sequence context for all but one of the GU dinucleotides (Table II). ForSUP4, the relative release of pApU was substantially reduced in mutant polymerases T455I/E478K and G485N, but not in V483D or K512N.Table IIRNA polymerase III transcription templatesSUP4 tRNATyr template+1 +17 +31 +47 +52AACAATTAAATACTCTCGGTAGCCAAGTTGTTTAAGGCCGCAAGACTTTAATTTATCAChimeric tRNATyr/tRNALeu pol III template+1 +17 +40 +46AACAATTAAATACTCTCGGTAGCCAAGCGGAGGGCCCGGTTTTTTTGTTAACTG Open table in a new tab Both the differential responses of mutant polymerases with alterations in region 476–512 to the SUP4 and tRNATyr/tRNALeu templates and their sequence preferences for exonucleolytic dinucleotide production indicate the existence of base- and amino acid-specific interactions between the conserved protein domain D and sequences at the 3′-end of nascent RNA. Earlier elongation studies with the V483D and K512N mutant RNA polymerases and the T455I/E478K double mutant showed that these enzymes had a tendency to pause at novel sites (11Shaaban S.A. Bobkova E.V. Chudzik D.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6468-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19.Shaaban, S. A., Mutant Analysis of Termination and Elongation by RNA Polymerase III.Ph.D. thesis, 1993, University of Washington.Google Scholar). When tested on the chimeric tRNATyr/tRNALeu tDNA template, these three mutant RNA polymerases and the G485N polymerase all underwent a prolonged arrest at positions corresponding to an incorporated G residue (Fig. 3 A). The further observation (Fig.3 B) that transient arrest of these mutant polymerases happens mainly at positions where G is followed by a pyrimidine may be explained by an inability of the RNA-binding region in these polymerases to accommodate consecutive RNA bases that differ in size. Finally, all four of the mutant polymerases studied in Fig. 3(A and B) exhibit a reduced frequency of termination as compared with the wild type. This may well be an independent consequence of the RNA-binding region alteration that directly affects the termination process (19.Shaaban, S. A., Mutant Analysis of Termination and Elongation by RNA Polymerase III.Ph.D. thesis, 1993, University of Washington.Google Scholar). A third possible phenotype, one we have not observed for any of the ret1mutations, would be the total lack of nuclease activity. Recent experiments carried out by Chédin et al. (22Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) suggest that such a mutation in ret1 would likely be lethal. These authors characterized an altered form of yeast RNA polymerase III, devoid of subunit C11, that does not pause for extended periods at the U-rich pause sites, that exhibits no pol III exonuclease activity in a standard retraction assay (12Bobkova E.V. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22832-22839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that is partially impaired in transcription termination. From their results, they conclude that the C11 subunit allows pol III to switch between an elongation mode and an RNA cleavage mode. Disruption of the gene for pol III subunit C11 is lethal for yeast (22Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), suggesting that pol III exonuclease is an essential function. Because none of the mutant pol III enzymes we studied are devoid of nuclease activity and many have enhanced activity, it seems unlikely that any of the ret1 domains we studied encode the nuclease active site. However, the region encompassing amino acids 455–512 modulates the specificity of nuclease cutting, and the wild-type sequences in regions 367–376 and 1063–1072 appear to down-regulate the catalytic efficiency of pol III nuclease. Subunit C11, on the other hand, appears to activate an intrinsic nuclease activity that is embodied in the pol III core subunits. A number of very interesting questions regarding the relative roles in pol III nuclease of domains within ret1 and subunit C11 can now be approached by genetic means. We hope to find out, for example, whether the hypernuclease phenotypes of any of the mutants at positions 370, 376, 1071, and 1075 are phenotypically epistatic to the absence of subunit C11. Similarly, we might ask whether these mutations suppress the lethality of a C11 gene disruption or the slow growth of aSchizosaccharomyces pombe C11 replacement. In relation to the concept of kinetic coupling between transcription elongation and transcription termination (2von Hippel P.H. Yager T.D. Science. 1992; 255: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Richardson J.P. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), many ret1 mutations fall into one of two clear categories. There are a number of mutations, most corresponding in intragenic location to E. coli Rifr clusters I and II, that elongate slowly because of pausing at U-rich sites and that have increased termination and increased overall pol III exonuclease activity. Among these are the mutations E478K, V511E/L516S, N513Y, and R1061K/E1081D (11Shaaban S.A. Bobkova E.V. Chudzik D.M. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6468-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19.Shaaban, S. A., Mutant Analysis of Termination and Elongation by RNA Polymerase III.Ph.D. thesis, 1993, University of Washington.Google Scholar). These behave as expected according to the kinetic coupling model. They spend a longer time elongating across oligo(U) clusters, repeatedly transcribing and degrading RNA in those regions, thus increasing their cross-section for termination. Quite different behavior was observed for a group of fourret1 mutations centered on residues 483 and 485. These include T455I/E478K, V483D, G485N, and K512N (Table I). The RNA polymerase III from these mutant strains combines a reduced termination phenotype with slow elongation, pauses at G residues, and has a differential lowering of cleavage at G in one context (SUP4) and an increase of cleavage at G in the chimeric template. We attribute the effects of G upon pausing and cleavage in these mutants to the bulkiness of this purine base. The 10-amino acid region encompassing these mutations is conserved within each class of RNA polymerase and contains either 3 or 4 basic amino acid residues in all eukaryotic RNA polymerases and in E. coli RNA polymerase (Fig. 5). We propose that this region engages the nascent RNA-DNA template hybrid very close to its 3′ (RNA) terminus. These contacts play an important role both in transcription elongation and in the reverse exonucleolytic process. Mutational changes such as V483D and G485N may decrease the size or flexibility of this RNA-binding domain of the protein, resulting in G-dependent pausing and exonuclease changes. At the same time, the changed geometry of this region may cause the enzyme to grasp the RNA-DNA hybrid more firmly, decreasing its tendency to terminate at U5 sequences.

We have overexpressed several transmembrane proteins in stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells using an inducible promoter system. Overexpression of proteins containing tyrosine- or leucine-based sorting signals resulted in reduced internalization of the transferrin receptor, whereas recycling and polarized distribution was not influenced.

Most signals for endosomal targeting fit into two classes, the tyrosine- and the leucine-based sorting motifs. The tyrosine-based signals are generally present in a YXXØ or an NPXY conformation, whereas the leucine-based signal sequence is typically ZXXXLØ (single letter amino acid code,Z is negatively charged, Ø is hydrophobic, and Xis any amino acid, for reviews see Refs. 5Sandoval I.V.

Likewise, both tyrosine- and leucine-based signals have been found to bind to subunits of AP-1, AP-2 (for reviews, see Refs. 1Pearse B.M. Robinson M.S. Biochem.

Moreover, both signals have been implicated in endosomal and polarized targeting as well as internalization. Overexpression of proteins with endosomal sorting signals has been associated with inefficient receptor internalization (16Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that clustering into clathrin-coated pits is a saturable process. The transferrin receptor (TfR) has been an outstanding tool in the elucidation of the early events of endocytosis because its ligand, holotransferrin (Tf), can easily be labeled and detected in experimental setups. After internalization, the TfR releases its ligand and is transported from sorting endosomes to a special recycling compartment from where it is sent back to the plasma membrane (for reviews see Ref. 6Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, page 768, and Ref. 26Maxfield F.R. Yamashiro D.J. Steer J.A. Hanover J.A.

Whereas efficient internalization of the TfR depended on the tyrosine-based signal in its cytoplasmic tail (7Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In polarized MDCK cells the TfR is localized predominantly on the basolateral surface (31Fuller S.D. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1767-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The basolateral sorting information of the TfR is contained within its cytoplasmic tail (32Dargemont C. Le Bivic A. Rothenberger S. Iacopetta B. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Kundu A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but is independent of the tyrosine-based internalization motif (34Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this report we used an inducible expression system to study the effect of overexpressing proteins containing tyrosine- or leucine-based sorting signals on TfR traffic in stably transfected MDCK cells. The mouse monoclonal IgG2a antibody 66Ig10 recognizes the extracellular domain of the TfR (35van de Rijn M. Geurts van Kessel A.H. Kroezen V. van Agthoven A.J. Verstijnen K. Terhorst C. Hilgers J.

A rat polyclonal antibody directed against mouse IgG2A was purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. Other secondary antibodies used in the study were Alexa488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) and Texas Red (TR)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and IgG2b antibodies and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). TR-conjugated human Tf (TR-Tf) was obtained from Molecular Probes and BU45 was conjugated with Alexa594 from the same company. Ricin (40Sandvig K. Van Deurs B.

The Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) strain II cell line stably transfected with the human TfR has been described previously (41Hunziker W. Whitney J.A. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 67: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift from Dr. W. Hunziker, Switzerland. This cell line, here named TrC, was used for super-transfection experiments. The cells were grown in DMEM (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 9% fetal calf serum (Integro b.v, Holland), 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Saveen, Sweden), 2 mm glutamine (BioWhittaker), 25 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin in 6% CO2 in a 37 °C incubator. For polarized studies cells were plated at high density (1.5 × 106) onto 24-mm diameter Transwell polycarbonate filter units with a pore size of 0.4 μm (Costar). Cells were grown for 4 days to form tight monolayers prior to the experiments. A cDNA encoding the p33 form of human invariant chain (42Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the heavy metal-inducible expression vector pMEP4 (Invitrogen). An Ii construct where the two leucines in the cytoplasmic tail of Ii was replaced by alanines (Ii2LA) has been described previously (43Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type CD1d and a CD1d construct in which the tyrosine in the cytoplasmic tail was replaced by an alanine (CD1dYA) in the pMEP4 vector has been described previously (36Rodionov D.G. Nordeng T.W. Pedersen K. Balk S.P. Bakke O. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1488-1495PubMed Google Scholar). The pMEP4 vector with chimeric DNA constructs, in which the cytoplasmic tail of CD8 was replaced by the counterpart of HLA-DM (HLA-DM/CD8), or a mutated construct where the tyrosine in the cytoplasmic tail was replaced by an alanine (DMYA/CD8), 2M. Røe, K. Egdalen, A. Simonsen, A. Kelly, and O. Bakke, submitted for publication. was a gift from Målfrid Røe (Oslo, Norway). TrC cells were stably transfected by the DNA-calcium phosphate procedure as described elsewhere (44Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Resistant clones were selected in the presence of hygromycin B (300 μg/ml). Resistant clones were induced with 25 μm CdCl2 for about 16 h and assayed for expression by immunofluorescence microscopy. Stably transfected MDCK cells grown in 35-mm wells were incubated to ∼75% confluency in full medium supplemented with various concentrations of CdCl2 and then starved for 45 min in DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine. Cells were then labeled at 37 °C for 20 min in the same medium supplemented with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) per milliliter, placed on ice, washed three times in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (4 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 10,000 × g to remove cell nuclei and cellular debris and then incubated with BU45 for 1 h at 4 °C. Dynabeads® rat anti-mouse IgG1 (M-450, Dynal, Norway) were then added (0.5 mg of Dynabeads® per lysate from 1 × 106 cells) and incubated for an additional hour at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed three times in 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40 by use of a Dynal Magnetic Particle Concentrator (MPC®-M) to collect the beads after each step. The precipitates were resuspended in 25 μl of sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Protein released from the beads was analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The radioactive signal was amplified using AmplifyTM solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK), and the bands were detected with the Molecular Imaging Screen CS (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with a Bio-Rad GS-250 PhosphorImager. The intensity of each band was quantified by the Molecular Analyst 2.0.1 software (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the total labeled protein in the corresponding lysate that was quantified with a 1500 Tri-Carb® Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). BU45 and D5 antibodies were iodinated with chloramine T according to manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, antibodies (100 μg) were incubated with Na125I (1 mCi) and chloramine T for 15 min on ice. Human Tf and ricin were iodinated using IODO-BEADS® (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, 100 μg of protein was incubated with one bead for 10 min at room temperature. Iodinated proteins were separated from free Na125I and unincorporated125I2 on Sephadex G-25M columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The specific activity of the labeled proteins was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The amount of soluble radioactivity in the fractions used was generally less than 5% of total radioactivity. Stably transfected MDCK cells grown in 35-mm wells were incubated to ∼75% confluency in full medium supplemented with various concentrations of CdCl2 and then for 1 h with DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA. The cells were cooled on ice and incubated with iodinated BU45, Tf, or ricin for 1 h and then washed extensively with PBS/BSA (0.1%), supplemented with 0.1 m lactose in ricin experiments. The cells were subsequently transferred to a 37 °C water bath and incubated for various time intervals (0, 1, 5, 15, or 30 min in duplicates) in full medium, supplemented with 100 μg/ml cold ligand in Tf experiments. The cells were next cooled on ice and incubated twice with 0.5 m acetic acid in 0.15m NaCl, pH 2.5, for 7 min to remove the surface-bound labeling, and lysed with 1 m NaOH. The amount of radioactivity in the samples was quantified with a Cobra® Auto-Gamma counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Internalized radiolabeled protein was calculated as the ratio of radioactivity present in the lysate to the total activity of the lysate and acid washes. Nonspecific binding of125I-BU45, 125I-D5, and 125I-Tf was determined in non-transfected cells and was typically less than 1% of the specific activity bound to transfected cells. Cell-surface binding at increasing concentrations of iodinated antibodies was analyzed by the method of Scatchard. In order to quantify the number of surface molecules per cell, the values were corrected for both the immunoreactive fraction as described previously (45Lindmo T. Boven E. Cuttitta F. Fedorko J. Bunn Jr., P.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 46Lindmo T. Bunn Jr., P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 121: 678-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and the fraction of double positive cells, determined by fluorescence microscopy. The given values represent the mean ± 1 S.E., obtained from at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Stably transfected MDCK cells grown in 35-mm wells were incubated to ∼75% confluency in full medium supplemented with various concentrations of CdCl2 and then for 1 h with DMEM/BSA (0.1%). HRP (5 mg/ml) was added to the medium and allowed to be taken up by the cells for various amounts of time (0, 1, 5, 15, or 30 min, performed in duplicate). The cells were cooled on ice, washed extensively with PBS/BSA (0.1%), and lysed with 1 m NaOH. HRP uptake was quantified with the Immunopure® TMB Substrate Kit (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer, and the absorbance at 590 nm was detected by a Titertek Multiscan® Plus (Flow Laboratories, Switzerland). The given values represent the mean ± 1 S.E., obtained from at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Stably transfected MDCK cells grown on filter supports were induced to express the proteins of interest and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy essentially as described by Berod et al. (47Berod A. Hartman B.K. Pujol J.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 844-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and permeabilized by 0.05% Triton X-100. The total cellular protein distribution was visualized by labeling fixed and permeabilized cell monolayers with the appropriate antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. In Ii-expressing cells Ii was detected with HC20/goat anti-rabbit Alexa594 and TfR with 66Ig10/goat anti-mouse Alexa488, whereas in CD1d-expressing cells CD1d was detected with D5/goat anti-mouse IgG2b TR, and TfR was detected with 66Ig10/rat anti-mouse IgG2a/goat anti-rat fluorescein isothiocyanate. Images were acquired with a Leica TCS-NT digital scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 60/1.2 water immersion objective (Leica, Germany). The pinhole diameter was kept below 1 μm. The images were exported to Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.), processed for presentation, and printed on a Tektronix Phaser 450 dye sublimation printer (Tektronix Inc.). Stably transfected MDCK cells were grown on coverslips, induced with 25 μm CdCl2 overnight, and incubated with DMEM, 0.1 mg/ml BSA for 1 h. Cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml TR-Tf or BU45-Alexa594 for 3 min and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice, washed, and incubated for 30 min with the anti-clathrin antibody X22 diluted in PBS, 0.1% saponin, washed again, and finally incubated with Alexa488 goat anti-mouse diluted in PBS, 0.1% saponin. Images were acquired using a Leica TCS-NT digital scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 100/1.4 oil immersion objective (Leica). The motifs of plasma membrane domains were selected by a random procedure. The images were magnified 4 times using the zoom function, adjusted to saturation by the glow-over function, and averaged 8 times to reduce the background noise. The pinhole diameter was 0.5 μm. Images were exported as 1024 × 1024 pixels, 8-bit RGB TIFF files, giving a dynamic range of 256 intensities per channel. Co-localization analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer (Apple Computer) using the Density Slicing and Automation modules of the Improvision OpenLab 2.0.2 core suite (Improvision, UK). First, binary image files were made displaying all pixels in the 150–254 range of the green (clathrin) layer and of a superimposed image where both the red value (Tf) and the green value (clathrin) of the pixels had to be in the 150–254 range in order to be selected. The binary files were used to calculate the total area of all regions of interest (ROI) larger than 4 pixels not touching the edge of the images. 25 different images were analyzed per experiment. Images were processed for presentation as described above. Recycling of iodinated Tf was assayed as described by Jing et al. (27Jing S.Q. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected MDCK cells grown in 35-mm wells were first incubated for 1 h with DMEM/BSA (0.1%) and then incubated for 30 min with 1 μg/ml125I Tf in DMEM/BSA. The cells were then washed three times with PBS/BSA on ice and incubated for 15 min with Tf buffer 1 (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm NaAc, pH 5.0, 50 μm deferoxamine mesylate). Next, cells were washed once with PBS/BSA, incubated for an additional 20 min with Tf buffer 2 (PBS/BSA, 50 μm deferoxamine mesylate, 100 μg/ml Tf), and washed three times with PBS/BSA followed by a chase period at 37 °C. The medium was collected, the cells were lysed, and the amount of radioactivity in the samples was determined. The given values represent the mean ± 1 S.E., obtained from at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. The polarized surface distribution of the transfected proteins was analyzed by binding of iodinated ligands or antibodies to cells grown on Transwell units. Cells were induced with 25 μm CdCl2and cooled on ice and then 125I-BU45, 125I-D5, or 125I-Tf was added to either the apical or the basolateral side of the monolayer for 1 h. Cell monolayer tightness was assessed by measuring the radioactivity in the medium of both chambers, and generally less than 0.1% of the added radioactivity had diffused through the monolayer. Unbound activity was removed by extensive washing (5×) in PBS supplemented with 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and 2% fetal calf serum. The filters were then excised, and bound radioactivity was measured in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by labeling of non-transfected cells, and the values, which generally represented less than 1% of the total binding, were subtracted from the total bound radioactivity to give the specific binding. The given values represent the mean ± 1 S.E., obtained from at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. All materials, unless specified otherwise, were purchased from Sigma. To study the role of the Ii expression level in its sorting, the p33 form of Ii was put under control of the metallothionein promoter PhMTII. Expression was induced with Cd2+; cells were labeled with35S, and Ii was immunoprecipitated with BU45. The precipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A), and the bands corresponding to Ii monomers were quantified by a PhosphorImager (Fig. 1 B). No detectable amount of Ii could be immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with empty vector (data not shown). In cells incubated overnight with 0–40 μmCdCl2 Ii expression increased proportionally to the Cd2+ concentration in the medium. Cd2+ did not influence the expression of endogenous LAMP-1 or transfected TfR (data not shown). Previous studies have revealed that Ii molecules appearing at the cell surface are rapidly internalized (43Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 49Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Nordeng T.W. Bakke O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells incubated with various concentrations of Cd2+ were labeled with125I-BU45 on ice. 125I-BU45 accumulated on the plasma membrane upon increased expression level (Fig. 1 B), and the rate of internalization was reduced (Fig.2). High levels of Ii expression has previously been associated with delayed transport through the endocytic pathway (50Romagnoli P. Layet C. Yewdell J. Bakke O. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 51Gorvel J.-P. Escola J.-M. Stang E. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2741-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a mutant Ii construct unable to induce such a delay exhibited the same reduced rate of internalization as wild-type Ii (data not shown). These results indicated that the internalization process itself, rather than post-internalization events, was affected by the overexpression. We therefore decided to investigate whether overexpression of one membrane protein containing an internalization signal would affect the internalization of other proteins containing similar or different signals for endocytosis. An MDCK cell line stably transfected with the human TfR was super-transfected with a series of membrane proteins containing tyrosine- or leucine-based internalization signals (TableI and references therein). The TfR binds Tf and recycles rapidly and constitutively between the plasma membrane and early endosomes. We used iodinated Tf as a ligand for MDCK cells transfected with the human TfR. Untransfected MDCK cells bound less than 5% of the 125I-Tf compared with the TrC cell line (data not shown). Internalization of 125I-Tf was measured in a series of double transfected cell lines. As shown in Fig.3 A, 125I-Tf was internalized rapidly in control cells transfected with TfR alone; about 50% of the cell-bound Tf was endocytosed after 1 min. However, upon co-expression of proteins containing tyrosine-based (HLA-DM/CD8, CD1d) or leucine-based (Ii) sorting signals, the internalization of Tf was significantly reduced after short chase periods. Approximately 25% reduction in the Tf uptake was observed after 1 min in each case. In a set of control experiments, co-expression of mutant proteins in which the critical tyrosines (HLA-DMYA/CD8 and CD1dYA) or leucines (Ii2LA) were replaced by alanine, internalization of Tf was not reduced (Fig. 3 B). It must be noted that the surface expression levels of the mutant proteins were adjusted to at least match the expression of their wild-type counterparts.Table ICell lines used in the studyCell lineTransfected DNADescriptionRef.TrC1-aThe TrC cell line was super-transfected with different DNA constructs.

Several kinases, both of the serine-threonine kinase and the tyrosine kinase families, have been proposed as candidates for such a modulatory role in vivo. However, no GABAAreceptor-phosphorylating kinase physically associated with the receptor has been identified so far on a molecular level. In this study, we demonstrate a GABAA receptor-associated protein serine kinase phosphorylating specifically β3-subunits of native GABAA receptors. The characteristics of this novel kinase clearly distinguish it from enzymatic activities that have been shown so far to phosphorylate the GABAA receptor. We putatively identify this protein kinase as the previously described GTAP34 (GABAA receptor-tubulin complex-associated protein of molecular mass 34 kDa). Using expressed recombinant fusion proteins, we identify serine 408 as a major target of the phosphorylation reaction, whereas serine 407 is not phosphorylated. This demonstrates the high specificity of the kinase. Phosphorylation of serine 408 is known to result in a decreased receptor function. The direct association of this kinase with the receptor indicates an important physiological role.

Binding of GABA to the extracellular domain of the receptor leads to the opening of an intrinsic ion channel followed by chloride influx, counteracting depolarization of the neuronal resting potential. Also, excitatory actions of the receptor depending on an altered chloride equilibrium potential have been reported (4Michelson H.B. Wong R.K.S.

Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), GABAAreceptor function can be regulated by phosphorylation. This provides a mean for fine tuning inhibitory neuronal inputs.

These reports point to the intracellular loops of GABAA receptor β- and γ-subunits as major phosphorylation targets. The functional consequences of phosphorylation are either inhibition or enhancement of GABAA receptor-mediated chloride currents. The results obtained for the effect of a given kinase are sometimes conflicting, probably reflecting the complex nature of GABAA receptor regulation by phosphorylation in vivo. Kinase activities copurifying with native GABAA receptors have previously been reported (30Sweetnam P.M. Lloyd J. Gallombardo P. Malison R.T. Gallager D.W. Tallman J.F. Nestler E.J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1274-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Bureau M.H. Laschet J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26482-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A kinase physically associated with native GABAA receptors can be expected to be of major functional relevance in vivo, but the molecular identity of such a protein has not been described so far. This study was conducted to answer the question whether one of the recently identified GABAA receptor-associated proteins named GTAPs (32Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) is a receptor-associated kinase. Our results indeed imply the identity of GTAP34 with a serine kinase that phosphorylates GABAAreceptor β3-subunits. GABAA receptors were immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100- or Zwittergent 3-14-solubilized calf brain membranes as described previously (32Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For precipitation, the monoclonal antibody bd24 (33Häring P. Stähli C. Schoch P. Takacs B. Staehelin T. Möhler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Ewert M. Shivers B.D. Lüddens H. Möhler H. Seeburg P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2043-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose (bd24-beads) was used. With 10 μl of packed bd24-beads, GABAA receptor containing approximately 1 μg of α1-subunit was precipitated. This value was determined by comparing the staining intensity of the α1-subunit, migrating in SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) as a sharp 50-kDa band and identified by Western blotting, with known amounts of marker proteins in silver-stained gels. Since around 55 kDa several GABAA receptor β-subunits and also receptor-associated tubulin comigrated, the amount of β-subunits present could not be determined. For standard assays, 5 μl of bd24-beads obtained after immunoprecipitation were washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer 1 (25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na-EGTA, 1% (w/w) β-octyl glucoside). 35 μl of buffer 1 were added, and the reaction was started by adding radiolabeled ATP to concentrations ranging from 50 to 400 μm. The specific activity was between 1000 and 10,000 cpm/pmol using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). Incubation was done under gentle agitation at 24 °C in a water bath for 30 min unless indicated otherwise. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 10 min. After 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE,1 silver staining (36Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar), and drying of the gel, phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography using a Kodak BioMax HE enhancer screen. To quantify32P incorporation, phosphorylated protein bands were excised from gels and homogenized, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. To test for the presence of associated kinases already known to phosphorylate GABAA receptor subunits in vitro, the following assay conditions were employed: (a) protein kinase C: 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 50 mg/ml phosphatidylserine; (b) cAMP-dependent protein kinase: 40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 μm cAMP; (c) calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase: 35 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm calmodulin; (d) cGMP-dependent protein kinase: 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm cGMP. All buffers additionally contained 1% (w/w) β-octyl glucoside, and all assays were done with an ATP concentration of 100 μm. To deglycosylate phosphorylated GABAA receptor probes, 5 μl of bd24-beads obtained from immunoprecipitation were first subjected to a phosphorylation assay (as described above, 50 μm ATP, 60 min). The assay was terminated by washing the bd24-bead precipitate two times with 400 μl of buffer 2 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mmEDTA, 1% (w/w) β-octyl glucoside, pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin each at a concentration of 5 μg/ml, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). 25 μl of buffer 2 and 5 μl (1 unit) of PNGase F (N-glycosidase F; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, followed by 45 min of incubation at 37 °C. For controls, the enzyme was omitted. Deglycosylation was terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating the probe. After 8% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and immunodecorated in a manner similar to that described previously (32Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

After incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies, positive bands were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For consecutive decoration of the same blot strip with different antibodies, bound antibodies were stripped off from the blot strip according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The nomenclature of the fusion proteins was based on the published sequences for the GABAA receptor α1-subunit (8Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A. Seeburg P.H. Barnard E.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), β1–3-subunits (41Ymer S. Schofield P.R. Draguhn A. Werner P. Kohler M. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and γ2-subunit (42Shivers B.D. Killisch I. Sprengel R. Sontheimer H. Koehler M. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 327-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), beginning with the first amino acid (position 1) of the mature protein after removal of the signal peptide. The cDNAs coding for cytoplasmic loop regions of β1 (amino acid residues 350–417), β2 (amino acid residues 351–417), β3 (amino acid residues 345–408 or 345–415), or γ2 (amino acid residues 319–366) subunits were amplified from rat brain cDNA and cloned into a modified pMALc vector that additionally encoded a His7 tag on the C terminus of the fusion proteins (43Mossier B. Togel M. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant β3 constructs β3-(345–415; S381A), β3-(345–415; S395A), β3-(345–415; S407A), and β3-(345–415; S408A) were prepared from the β3-(345–415) construct by using the QuickChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting MBP-β-loop fusion proteins were expressed and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column under denaturing conditions according to the recommendations of Qiagen Inc. α1 (amino acid residues 328–382) was prepared in a similar way as a GST fusion protein. After immunoprecipitation of GABAA receptors, washing with buffer 1, and adding 35 μl of buffer 1 to 5 μl of washed bd24-beads as described above, 2 μg of intracellular loop fusion proteins or an equimolar amount of histone H1 (fraction III-S; Sigma) was added. Since most of the fusion proteins were stored in 8m urea stock solutions, their addition led to urea concentrations during the phosphorylation assay of 0.13–0.3m. No effect of these concentrations of urea on the kinase activity was apparent (data not shown). Reactions were started by adding radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP to a concentration of 50 μm, followed by incubation unter gentle agitation in a 24 °C water bath for 60 min. For determining the stoichiometry of phosphorylation in the course of a time dependence (see Fig. 2), modified conditions were employed, i.e. 5 μl of washed bd24-beads in a final volume of 20 μl with 1 μg of MBP-β3-(345–408) fusion protein and 400 μm ATP. Assays were terminated by pelleting the bd24-beads with the bound kinase activity by a brief centrifugation and removing the supernatants containing the intracellular loop fusion proteins. The supernatants were either analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or by spotting aliquots onto Whatman P82 filters, extensive washing of the filters with 0.85% ortho-phosphoric acid, and scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitates bound to bd24-beads were extracted with buffer 1 containing 0.6m NaCl (high salt extraction) essentially as described previously (32Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To maximally maintain kinase activity for phosphorylation assays, the primary incubation of the immunoprecipitate in high salt buffer was shortened to 1 min, and the extracts were diluted immediately after extraction 3-fold with buffer 1, resulting in a NaCl concentration of 0.2 m. Buffer 1 containing 0.2m NaCl was also used for the phosphorylation assays of the other probes to be compared with the high salt extract. The assay volume was 120 μl for each probe: the nonextracted bd24-beads, the extracted beads (both 5 μl of beads) and the high salt extract (extracted from 5 μl of beads). 5 μg of MBP-β3-(345–408) fusion protein or 0.78 μg of histone were used as kinase substrate. The probes were incubated for 120 min at 24 °C in the presence of 50 μm radiolabeled ATP. Analysis of the assay supernatants was performed as described above. Gel filtration of high salt-extracted proteins was done in buffer 1 containing 0.6 m NaCl with a fast protein liquid chromatography system on a Superose 12 HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Undiluted extract obtained from 140 μl of bd24-beads was separated at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Starting at the void volume, 0.3 ml of eluate fractions were collected. For phosphorylation assays, 25 μl of each fraction were diluted with 50 μl of buffer 1 containing 4 μg of the MBP-β3-(345–408) fusion protein. To monitor autophosphorylation of separated proteins, identical probes lacking the fusion protein were prepared. Assays were performed for 120 min in the presence of 50 μm ATP, followed by 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Calf brain membranes were solubilized in 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS at 95 °C for 10 min. The solution was diluted 10-fold with 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, resulting in a SDS concentration of 0.1%. After centrifugation at 165,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was precleared with protein A-beads for 90 min at 4 °C. 6 ml of the precleared solution containing 6 mg of protein were incubated with a 5 μg/ml concentration of either the rabbit antibody β2-(351–405) or antibody β3-(1–13) that recognizes β2- and β3-subunits (11Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C. The antibodies were recaptured with 15 μl of packed protein A-beads and washed five times with buffer 1. 30 μl of 1:1 slurry protein A-beads were mixed with 90 μl of high salt-extracted kinase (prepared in Zwittergent 3-14, extracted and diluted as described above) and incubated for 120 min at 24 °C in the presence of 50 μm radiolabeled ATP. Phosphorylated β2- and β3-subunits were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. One- and two-dimensional analysis of radiolabeled phosphoamino acids were performed essentially as described (44Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). In brief, GABAA receptor immunoprecipitate was incubated in buffer 1 with 50 μmATP for 60 min, either alone or in the presence of MBP-β3-(345–408) fusion protein. After SDS-PAGE of the whole immunoprecipitate or only the probe supernatant, silver staining, and autoradiography, protein was eluted from gel pieces containing labeled GABAAreceptor subunits or labeled MBP-β3-(345–408) fusion protein. Following acidic hydrolysis, amino acids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography and compared with phosphoamino acid standards. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated GABAA receptors and MBP-β3-(345–415) fusion proteins was done as described above. bd24-beads containing the bound phosphorylated receptor were washed with Lys-C digestion buffer (25 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA). The supernatant of the phosphorylation assays containing the loop fusion proteins was subjected to a chloroform-methanol precipitation (45Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 138: 141-143Crossref Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). Both the phosphorylated receptors and the loop constructs were digested in 200 μl of Lys-C digestion buffer containing 0.1 μg of Lys-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 19 h at 37 °C. Peptides were lyophilized twice in H2O and separated on cellulose thin layer plates in formic acid, glacial acetic acid, and H2O at a ratio of 50:156:1794, pH 1.9, 1.8 kV, for 15 min. and by ascending chromatography in isobutyric acid, pyridine, glacial acetic acid, 1-butanol, and H2O at a ratio of 65:5:3:2:29 in the second dimension (46Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors were immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100-solubilized calf brain membranes with bd24-beads. The immunoprecipitate was assessed for the presence of an associated kinase activity by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis. In order to allow different kinases to exert optimal activity during the assay, various buffer compositions were used. In the presence of Mg2+, a strong phosphorylation of a 55-kDa band was obtained (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3–5). Replacement of Mg2+ with Mn2+ largely abolished this activity (Fig. 1,lane 2). Under conditions designed to stimulate protein kinase C (Fig. 1, lane 3), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Fig. 1, lane 4), calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (Fig. 1,lane 5), or cGMP-dependent protein kinase (not shown), phosphorylation of the 55-kDa band was not stimulated, and no other phosphorylated band of comparable intensity was detected, although some additional bands became evident. This study focused on the phosphorylation of the 55-kDa band under conditions similar to those given for Fig. 1, lane 1. Analysis of the time dependence of specific incorporation of radioactivity under conditions promoting high enzymatic turnover showed that the phosphorylation was substantial with regard to the total amount of isolated receptors (Fig. 2). The addition of 100 μm sodium vanadate to the assay buffer had no effect, indicating the absence of a relevant phosphatase activity (not shown). No qualitative differences of the phosphorylation patterns were observed with concentrations of ATP ranging from 50 μm to 400 μm (results not shown). Following phosphorylation, GABAA receptor immunoprecipitates were enzymatically deglycosylated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, parallel to nondeglycosylated probes. Deglycosylation was done in order to unequivocally differentiate between receptor subunits and subunit isoforms and tubulin. It was indeed found that some proteins comigrating around 55 kDa (i.e. the GABAA receptor β2-subunit (Fig.3, lane 7), the GABAA receptor β3-subunit (Fig. 3, lane 11), and α-tubulin (Fig. 3, lane 27)) showed a differential migration after deglycosylation (Fig. 3, lanes 8, 12, and28). Radioactivity on the blot was detected by autoradiography, and the resulting pattern of labeled bands was compared with the signals obtained after immunodecoration with specific antibodies recognizing GABAA receptor α1-, β1-, β2-, β3-, β2/3-, and γ2-subunits and α-tubulin (Fig. 3). After deglycosylation, the number of radioactive bands increased. This might be due to incomplete deglycosylation or to a partial protein degradation during deglycosylation. The predominant radioactive signals at 55 kDa in the nontreated probe (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, 17,21, and 25, upper band) and at 52 kDa in the deglycosylated probe (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 6, 10, 14,18, 22, and 26, upper band) colocalized best with the signals obtained with an antibody specific for GABAA receptor β3-subunits (Fig. 3,lanes 9–12). Also, a weak radioactive band at 36 kDa, possibly representing a degradation product of β3-subunits generated during deglycosylation by contaminating proteases, comigrated with a β3-subunit positive signal (Fig. 3, lanes 14 and 16). Only one other antibody, recognizing GABAA receptor β2- and β3-subunits, also reacted with the dominant radioactive bands of glycosylated and deglycosylated probes (Fig. 3, lanes 13–16), confirming the result with the β3-subunit-specific antibody. The additional bands recognized by the β2/3-subunit-specific antibody were due to the detection of β2-subunits, as evident from the comparison with a β2-subunit-specific antibody (Fig. 3, lanes 7–8). With this antibody, as well as with the antibodies directed against GABAA receptor α1-, β1-, and γ2-subunits and for α-tubulin, a match with each of the two predominant radioactive bands of the receptor probes (55 kDa for the glycosylated receptor, 52 kDa for the deglycosylated probe) was not obtained. These results indicated a preferential phosphorylation of GABAA receptor β3-subunits by the GABAAreceptor-associated kinase activity. If it is assumed that β3-subunits are present in the receptor in a stoichiometry of 1:1 with α1-subunits, phosphorylation of β3-subunits almost occurs stoichiometrically (see Fig. 2). However, it should be pointed out that this probably represents an underestimate of the stoichiometry, since α1-subunits presumably assemble preferentially with β2- and not with β3-subunits (9McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In 8 of 19 experiments, in addition to the dominant 55-kDa band also a minor 50-kDa band was observed to be phosphorylated (see Fig. 3,lane 1). The minor radioactive bands at 50 kDa in the nondeglycosylated and at 45 kDa in the deglycosylated probe could be matched with immunopositive signals for GABAA receptor α1-subunits (Fig. 3, lanes 17–20), β1-subunits (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4), and also β3-subunits (Fig. 3, lanes 9–12). The immunostaining for the β1-subunit revealed a molecular mass of roughly 50 kDa for the glycosylated protein. This value is clearly lower than expected from the sequence similarity between the β1-subunit and the β2- and β3-subunits, both migrating at 55 kDa. Most likely, this discrepancy can be explained by partial degradation of the β1-subunit during receptor purification, resulting in the loss of a terminal portion of the protein. The GABAA receptor immunoprecipitate was incubated, under conditions promoting high enzymatic turnover, with a fusion protein consisting of amino acid residues 345–408 of the intracellular loop of the GABAA receptor β3-subunit fused to MBP (MBP-β3-(345–408)). A stoichiometry of phosphorylation of 0.79 mol of bound phosphate/mol of MBP-β3-(345–408) was obtained (Fig. 4). This result indicated the usefulness of fusion proteins of intracellular loops of GABAA receptor subunits for further experiments. In another experiment under comparable conditions, a similar enzymatic"
