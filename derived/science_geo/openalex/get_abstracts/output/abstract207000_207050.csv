https://openalex.org/W2062707127,"Only by the use of accurate and meaningful words pertaining to body temperatures and heat sources can our understanding of the ecological and physiological functioning of vertebrate organisms be clarified. Since the classical terms are inadequate, other terms that are already in use should be used."

https://openalex.org/W2089726905,The presence of immunologically competent cells in placenta has been investigated by use of the experimental model of runt disease in inbred strains of mice. The injection of placental cells from C57/B1 mice into newborn Balb/C mice resulted in death in the 2nd to 4th week. Evidence is presented that death was caused by immunologically competent fetal cells.
https://openalex.org/W2017449045,"PHARMACOLOGICAL studies on the depression of spinal reflexes produced by the topical application of comparatively strong solutions of 3-hydroxytyramine to the exposed spinal cord have led to the conclusion that this catecholamine could be an inhibitory transmitter acting on spinal motoneurones1. Recently, it has also been suggested that derivatives of tryptamine may be transmitters within the spinal cord2. When applied electrophoretically, adrenaline and nor-adrenaline have no action on spinal neurones3 although these catecholamines, 3-hydroxytyramine and many derivatives of tryptamine depress the synaptic excitation of lateral geniculate neurones4. These agents are not, however, inhibitory transmitters in this portion of the visual pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1973435341,Antibodies are detectable by an agglutination technique in the blood meals of hematophagous Diptera that are fed on laboratory and domestic animals infected with organisms of the Trypanosoma brucei subgroup. It is likely that both the antibody status and the identity of the animal fed on can be determined from the same blood meal from wild Diptera. The technique may be applicable to other infections for which sensitive serological tests are available.

https://openalex.org/W2064280663,"ALTHOUGH it has been known for some time that it was possible to preserve alive blood forms of the African trypanosomes at the temperature of sublimation of carbon dioxide (approximately −79° C.1,2), no reports have appeared on the preservation of the metacyclic forms. This report indicates that it is possible to preserve live metacyclic forms of the T. brucei sub-group at a similar temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1979889174,"WHEN the macular projection area—that part of the visual striate cortex to which the macular region of the retina projects—is removed in monkeys a characteristic symptom can be demonstrated. The animal frequently misreaches for small pieces of food when they are presented to him on a flat surface1,2. The error involved may be as much as three inches, and two inches is common. It is the direction of the object, rather than the distance, which is usually gauged incorrectly by the animal; that is, his fingers fall to the sides of the object rather than beyond or in front of it. The direction of the error appears to depend primarily on which hand is used, misreaching to the left tending to occur when the left hand is used and misreaching to the right when the right hand is used. The position of the food relative to the animal's body is also important. This type of behaviour is often called ‘past-pointing’; but since the error tends to be one of direction rather than distance, and also because past-pointing is also used to refer to vestibular or cerebellar derangement, we prefer to use the term ‘misreaching’."

https://openalex.org/W2027397275,"IN a recent study of the denervated dog heart1, we noted a marked increase in cardiac sensitivity to norepinephrine, a finding anticipated from previous investigations of denervated organs2. Catechol-O-methyl transferase activity was measured in these denervated hearts to determine whether this pharmacological supersensitivity might be accompanied by a decreased ability of the myocardium to O-methylate norepinephrine. The results showed that cardiac denervation produces a decrease in the catechol-O-methyl transferase activity of the myocardium; whether this decrease is related to the phenomenon of supersensitivity, however, is open to considerable doubt."

https://openalex.org/W1965533206,"THE aorta consists of elastin, collagen and a number of other proteins; it also contains about 2 per cent of carbohydrate1. Elastin is usually isolated from aorta or ligamentum nuchae by treatment with acids and alkalis at elevated temperatures; however, a small amount of ill-defined carbohydrate appears to be held strongly and cannot be easily removed2. It is possible that this sugar moiety is an integral part of elastin."
https://openalex.org/W1990110973,"ALTHOUGH the healing of a wound is an essentially local event, it must inevitably also involve wider metabolic processes in the whole organism. One metabolic excretory product of dietary tryptophan is 5-hydroxy indolyl-acetic acid (5-HIAA) derived via the intermediate metabolites 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Special interest has been devoted to this pathway because of its significance in carcinoid tumours. Certain of the metabolic and clinical changes produced by 5-HT may, however, also be important in tissue regeneration and the healing of wounds. As a method of investigating this, it was decided to study the excretion of 5-HIAA following wounding."

https://openalex.org/W2057078482,"IN the course of work on the microbial metabolism of glycine and glyoxylic acid we have had occasion to isolate formic acid as the p-bromophenacyl ester which is widely quoted1,2 as having m.p. 140°. It was observed that the derivative, m.p. 140–42°, isolated from authentic sodium 14C-formate (95,200 counts/min./µmol.) was inactive and showed no depression in melting point when mixed with p-bromophenacyl alcohol, m.p. 142°. A search of the literature revealed that Neish and Lemieux3 have made a similar observation and have described a preparation of authentic p-bromophenacylformate, m.p. 92°. In my hands the methods of Neish and Lemieux yields a derivative, m.p. 98° (92,200 counts/min./µmol.), when the above-labelled formate is used in the preparation (cf. Heilbron and Bunbury4, who quote m.p. 99°)."

https://openalex.org/W2091558952,IT has been established1 that inorganic and organic sulphurs are utilized by growing yeast. More recently2 the conditions for the absorption of sulphur-35 by S. cerevisiae cells were examined and the necessity of nitrogen and glucose for the utilization of sulphur was demonstrated.
