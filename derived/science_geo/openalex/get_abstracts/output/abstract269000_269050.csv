https://openalex.org/W1989750273,"When individual seedlings of Datura ferox and Sinapis alba were transferred to populations formed by plants of similar stature, they responded with an increase in the rate of stem elongation. The reaction was detected within 3 days after transplanting and occurred well before shading among neighbors became important. This rapid response, which may be crucial for success in the competition for light, was reduced or abolished when individual internodes were ""blinded"" to the far-red radiation scattered by the surrounding seedlings. These results show the operation of a localized, photomorphogenetic control of stem elongation that may play a central role in the plastic adjustment of plants during the early stages of canopy development."
https://openalex.org/W2052794190,"Certain C(30)-steranes have been used for identifying sedimentary rocks and crude oils derived from organic matter deposited in marine environments. Analysis of a C(30)-sterane from Prudhoe Bay oil indicates that these C(30)-steranes are 24-n-propylcholestanes that apparently are derived from precursor sterols 24-n-propylidene-cholesterols and 24-n-propylcholesterol. These widely occurring sterols are biochemically synthesized in modern oceans by members of an order (Sarcinochrysidales) of chrysophyte algae. These data thus imply that C(30)-sterane biomarkers in sedimentary rocks and crude oils have a marine origin. Screening of a few organic-rich sedimentary rocks and oils from throughout the Phanerozoic suggests that these C(30)-steranes first appeared and, therefore, their source algae evolved between Early Ordovician and Devonian."
https://openalex.org/W2039465227,"A comparative study of small temperate lakes (<20 square kilometers) indicates that the mixing depth or epilimnion is directly related to light penetration measured as Secchi depth. Clearer lakes have deeper mixing depths. This relation is the result of greater penetration of incident solar radiation in lakes and enclosures with high water clarity. Data show that light penetration is largely a function of size distribution and biomass of algae as indicated by a relation between the index of plankton size distribution (slope) and Secchi depth. Larger or steeper slopes (indicative of communities dominated by small plankton) are associated with shallower Secchi depth. In lakes with high abundances of planktivorous fish, water clarity or light penetration is reduced because large zooplankton, which feed on small algae, are reduced by fish predation. The net effect is a shallower mixing depth, lower metalimnetic temperature and lower heat content in the water column. Consequently, the biomass and size distribution of plankton can change the thermal structure and heat content of small lakes by modifying light penetration."

Severe damage occurred at distances of up to 100 kilometers from the epicenter in areas underlain by ground known to be hazardous in strong earthquakes. Stronger earthquakes will someday strike closer to urban centers in the United States, most of which also contain hazardous ground. The Loma Prieta earthquake demonstrated that meaningful predictions can be made of potential damage patterns and that, at least in well-studied areas, long-term forecasts can be made of future earthquake locations and magnitudes. Such forecasts can serve as a basis for action to reduce the threat major earthquakes pose to the United States."

https://openalex.org/W1978161164,"Radiocarbon dates for Vermetidae limestone from the edge of the Brazilian Shield at Cape San Agostinho, Brazil, indicate sea level stands of up to 2.60 meters above the present position, 3660, 2790, and 1190 years ago. Accurate determination of relative sea level is possible because of the well-defined habitat of the fossils dated."
https://openalex.org/W2093009524,"A number of metastable phases, germanides and tellurides of gold and silver, have been prepared, analyzed by x-ray diffraction, and investigated for superconductivity. The new superconductors and their transition temperatures are AgTe(3) (2.6 degrees K), Ag(4)Ge (0.85 degrees K), Au(3)Te(5) (1.62 degrees K), and Au(1-x)Ge(x) (0.99 degrees K-1.63 degrees K) where (0.27 </= x </= 0.60). Au-Ge compositions with other values of x do not superconduct above 0.32 degrees K."
https://openalex.org/W1990164020,"The relaxation of the shielding current-induced magnetic moment in YBa2Cu3O7 thin films, which were grown in situ, is studied as a function of temperature. Although typical relaxations cause a large amount of decay in the magnetic shielding current (on the order of 10 to 20 percent for the first 1000 seconds), it is shown that this is not necessarily a serious problem for applications such as magnets operating in persistent-current modes. This is because the decay of the magnetic shielding current depends sensitively on how far away the operating current density is from the critical current density Jc. By using a quenching process the shielding current is reduced slightly below Jc and the relaxation is dramatically reduced. A general relation between the relaxation rate at Jc and the reduction of the relaxation rate upon lowering of the operating current is obtained and is shown to be consistent with experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W2051719141,"Dysprosium has been studied at pressures up to about 160 kilobars, well above the transition reported near 50 kilobars by other workers. It shows no definite structural alteration from hexagonal close-packed structure throughout this range. It is suggested that the 50-kilobar transition is most likely electronic or magnetic in nature, or that the metal undergoes a hexagonal stacking rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W2040778585,"The electrical resistance of dysprosium was studied in the temperature-pressure range 77 degrees to 200 degrees K and 15 to 120 kb. The variations of the Néel transition with pressure was found to good accuracy, the value of dT(N)/dP being-0.62+/-0.4 deg/kb. From this result, second-order thermodynamic equations yield values of -64 x 10-6 ( degrees C)(-1) and 4.0 x 10(-14) cm(2)/dyne for the changes in the coefficient of linear expansion and the compressibility, respectively, at the 1-atm Néel point. The Néel transition disappears at 45 to 55 kb, and no magnetic transitions are seen at higher pressures in the temperature range indicated. The other boundaries in the region investigated have been determined but are very uncertain. The cause of the cusp in the isothermal compressions is not clear from the available data. Above the Néel boundary, the pressure dependence of the cusp with respect to temperature, dP/dT, is very small and may even be zero. Below the Néel temperature, dP/dT is uncertain. From isothermal measurements, the value is -1, while from the isobaric measurements a value of -0.25 is obtained."
