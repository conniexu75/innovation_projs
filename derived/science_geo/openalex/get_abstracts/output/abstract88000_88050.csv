https://openalex.org/W2088819006,"The effect of reduced temperature on synchronized transport of SFV membrane proteins from the ER via the Golgi complex to the surface of BHK-21 cells revealed two membrane compartments where transport could be arrested. At 15 degrees C the proteins could leave the ER but failed to enter the Golgi cisternae and accumulated in pre-Golgi vacuolar elements. At 20 degrees C the proteins passed through Golgi stacks but accumulated in trans-Golgi cisternae, vacuoles, and vesicular elements because of a block affecting a distal stage in transport. Both blocks were reversible, allowing study of the synchronous passage of viral membrane proteins through the Golgi complex at high resolution by immunolabeling in electron microscopy. We propose that membrane proteins enter the Golgi stack via tubular extensions of the pre-Golgi vacuolar elements which generate the Golgi cisternae. The proteins pass across the Golgi apparatus following cisternal progression and enter the post-Golgi vacuolar elements to be routed to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1550962157,"Two populations of A-I-containing lipoprotein particles: A-I-containing lipoprotein with A-II (Lp (A-I with A-II], and A-I-containing lipoprotein without A-II (Lp (A-I without A-II] have been isolated from plasma of 10 normolipidemic subjects by immunoaffinity chromatography and characterized. Both types of particles possess alpha-electrophoretic mobility and hydrated density in the range of plasma high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Lp (A-I without A-II) and Lp (A-I with A-II) are heterogeneous in size. Lp (A-I without A-II) comprised two distinct particle sizes with mean apparent molecular weight and Stokes diameter of 3.01 X 10(5), and 10.8 nm for Lp (A-I without A-II)1, and 1.64 X 10(5), and 8.5 nm for Lp (A-I without A-II)2. Lp (A-I with A-II) usually contained particles of at least three distinct molecular sizes with mean apparent molecular weight and Stokes diameter of 2.28 X 10(5) and 9.6 nm for Lp (A-I with A-II)1, 1.80 X 10(5) and 8.9 nm for Lp (A-I with A-II)2, and 1.25 X 10(5) and 8.0 nm for Lp (A-I with A-II)3. Apoproteins C, D, and E, and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) were detected in both Lp (A-I without A-II) and Lp (A-I with A-II) with most of the apoprotein D, and E, and LCAT (EC 2.3.1.43) in Lp (A-I with A-II) particles. Lp (A-I without A-II) had a slightly higher lipid/protein ratio than Lp (A-I with A-II). Lp (A-I with A-II) had an A-I/A-II molar ratio of approximately 2:1. The percentage of plasma A-I associated with Lp (A-I without A-II) was highly correlated with the A-I/A-II ratio of plasma (r = 0.96, n = 10). The variation in A-I/A-II ratio of HDL density subfractions therefore reflects different proportions of two discrete types of particles: particles containing A-I and A-II in a nearly constant ratio and particles containing A-II but no A-II. Each type of particle is heterogeneous in size and in apoprotein composition."

https://openalex.org/W1563717384,"1-O-[3H]Alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-GPC) incubated with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) for 30 min is metabolized to 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC containing greater than 80% arachidonate at the 2 position (Chilton, F. H., O'Flaherty, J. T., Ellis, J. M., Swendsen, C. L., and Wykle, R. L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7268-7271). PMN containing 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC incorporated into their cellular phospholipids in this manner were stimulated with Ca2+ ionophore (A23187). Within 5 min after stimulation, 14%, 7%, and 7% of the total 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC in the cells had been converted to 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC (platelet-activating factor), 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-GPC, and 3H-labeled neutral lipid, respectively. Stimulation by opsonized zymosan yielded similar results. In related studies, cells were labeled with 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC containing a [methyl-14C] choline moiety. The nature of the long-chain acyl residues in the sn-2 position of the labeled 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acyl-GPC remaining after stimulation with A23187 was examined. Analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography using synthetic 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acyl-GPC standards indicated there is a time-dependent loss of arachidonate from the 2 position of the labeled 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC followed by reacylation by other fatty acids (primarily linoleic and oleic). This shift in the acylation pattern exhibited after Ca2+ ionophore stimulation was further examined in PMN preincubated with A23187 and subsequently incubated with labeled 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC; the stimulated cells produced 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC (greater than 15% of total label) and 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC containing linoleic acid and oleic acid, rather than arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position. The findings demonstrate that upon stimulation of PMN, 1-O-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC can yield arachidonate and 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC; the 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC formed may be acetylated producing platelet-activating factor or reacylated with fatty acyl residues other than arachidonate."
https://openalex.org/W1568834538,"Abstract Sialylated fucosyl lactosaminoglycan was isolated from human neutrophilic granulocytes and its structure was elucidated. The lactosaminoglycan glycopeptides were digested by endo-beta-galactosidase and core portion and released oligosaccharides were analyzed by permethylation, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and exoglycosidases. In addition, lactosaminoglycan saccharides were obtained by hydrazinolysis and the structures of fractionated sialyl oligosaccharides were analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and permethylation coupled with exoglycosidase treatment. The structure of one of the major components was found to be: (Formula: see text). This structure is unique in that 1) four linear polylactosaminyl side chains are attached to the core portion, 2) the side chain arising from position 4 of 2,4-linked mannose contains one or more alpha 1----3 fucosyl residues, 3) the side chain arising from position 6 of 2,6-linked mannose is terminated with NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc, sialyl Lex, and 4) the side chain arising from position 2 of 2,4-linked mannose is terminated with sialic acid through alpha 2----6 linkage."
https://openalex.org/W2114622428,"Interruption of the connection between the mammillary bodies and the anterior nucleus of the thalamus in guinea pigs, by discrete bilateral electrolytic lesions of the mammillothalamic tract, resulted in essentially complete protection from the behavioral and electroencephalographic convulsant action and lethal effect of pentylenetetrazol. This result demonstrates that the mammillary bodies and their rostral efferent connections are important for the propagation and perhaps initiation of generalized seizures."
https://openalex.org/W1569539217,"Human lung tryptase, a mast cell-derived trypsin-like serine protease, has been isolated from whole human lung tissue obtained at autopsy. Increased yields from this purification process have allowed extensive characterization of the enzyme. One of the critical steps in the purification scheme is the use of a linear heparin gradient to elute active material from cellulose phosphate. Gel filtration studies in 1.0 M NaCl yielded an apparent Mr = 135,000, and subsequent electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels demonstrated the presence of two active species with apparent Mr = 30,900 and 31,600. Enzymatic activity was sensitive to NaCl concentrations above 0.05 M and was only 50% in 0.15 M NaCl, decreasing to 18% in 0.6 M NaCl. The effects of synthetic and natural inhibitors have also been studied, confirming the enzyme's trypsin-like characteristics and demonstrating that naturally occurring serum inhibitors are incapable of diminishing its activity. A complete amino acid analysis showed a high tryptophan content. Lastly, antisera to human lung tryptase have been generated, and the immunological identity of active fractions has been investigated as well as the localization of the enzyme to the mast cell granule by immunohistochemical staining."
https://openalex.org/W1575701171,"Three recombinant plasmids, pEC1, pEC2, and pEC3, each containing a unique Cellulomonas fimi chromosomal DNA insert, expressed Cm-cellulase activities in Escherichia coli C600 (Whittle, D. J., Kilburn, D. H., Warren, R. A. J., and Miller, R. C., Jr. (1982) Gene (Amst.) 17, 139-145; Gilkes, N. R., Kilburn, D. G., Langsford, M. L., Miller, R. C., Jr., Wakarchuk, W. W., Warren, R. A. J., Whittle, D. J., and Wong, W. K. R. (1984) J. Gen. Microbiol. 130, 1377-1384). Viscometric and chemical analyses showed that the enzymes encoded by pEC2 and pEC3 behaved as endoglucanases, whereas that encoded by pEC1 behaved as an exoglucanase. The activities of the exoglucanase and the pEC2-encoded endodglucanase were additive on Cm-cellulose as substrate. The pEC1-encoded enzyme also hydrolyzed xylan and p-nitrophenyl cellobioside. Two substrate-bound Cm-cellulases were isolated from the residual cellulose in a C. fimi culture by guanidine hydrochloride elution, affinity chromatography, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both were glycoproteins of apparent Mr = 58,000 and 56,000, respectively. The 56-kDa enzyme appeared to be identical with the pEC1-encoded product, suggesting that they arise from the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W2131501858,"Oxytricha macronuclear DNA exists as approximately 24 X 10(6) gene-sized molecules terminating with a C4A4 repeat. DNA-protein interactions at the ends of bulk macronuclear molecules were probed with micrococcal nuclease and methidiumpropyl-EDTA X Fe(II) (MPE X Fe[II]). The ends were indirectly labeled by hybridizing with (C4A4)2. Alternatively, a novel method using MPE X FE(II) as a probe and directly labeling the 3' ends with terminal transferase was implemented. A terminal complex involving approximately 100 bp with nucleosomes phased inward from the complex was found to be characteristic of most or all of the ends. Analysis of two specific genes confirmed the pattern and showed that the special structure was on both ends of each molecule. We conclude that a DNA-protein complex involving 100 bp and terminating with the C4A4 repeat can be sufficient to provide the fundamental functions of telomeres, allowing linear DNA replication and conferring stability of linear DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1592532691,"An account of x-ray crystallographic studies of monoclinic porcine pepsin crystals is presented. The chain fold specific for aspartyl proteases is described in detail. As the results of 2-A refinement have shown, the actual structure is that of ethanol-inhibited pepsin. The structure, although close to those of fungal aspartyl proteases, has some specific features: one of them is an insertion near the S'1 site which restricts the position of dipeptide substrates and makes their productive binding more probable than in the fungal enzymes. 3-A resolution data on the binding of the dipeptide phenylalanyl-diiodotyrosine methyl ester are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1506920432,"The effects of iron deficiency on the NADH- and succinate-oxidizing complexes of rat skeletal muscle mitochondria have been investigated. Both systems were similarly affected: activities were about 30% of normal in dehydrogenase, ubiquinone reductase, and oxidase assays, and similar reductions in the concentration of their respective flavin prosthetic groups were also evident in the iron-deficient membranes. Thus, the turnover numbers of the two enzymes were unchanged in iron deficiency. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed similarly reduced levels of those peptide components of Complexes I and II that could be unequivocally distinguished. Soluble beef heart succinate dehydrogenase added to alkaline-treated rat skeletal muscle mitochondrial membranes attached to binding sites exposed by the treatment, forming a hybrid complex indistinguishable from the original skeletal muscle complex, with restoration of succinoxidase and succinate-ubiquinone reductase activities to the levels observed in the original rat membranes. Iron-deficient particles behaved like the normal in these tests. No unfilled binding sites for the enzyme could be detected prior to alkaline treatment. The data are interpreted as indicating that the lower activities of these two respiratory complexes in iron deficiency are due to lower content of the enzymes rather than to the presence of impaired enzymes in the membrane, that only fully competent complexes are present in these membranes, and that iron-deficient complexes are either not assembled or are lost after assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1580211147,"An apolipoprotein (apo) A-I variant that has a relative charge of -1 compared to normal apo-A-I on isoelectric focusing gels has been identified in five unrelated families as a result of screening a large number of individuals. The cause of the electrophoretic abnormality has been examined by analyzing the variant apo-A-I structure. The evidence suggests that a single amino acid, lysine 107, has been deleted in the variant apo-A-I of all affected individuals studied from these families, with the remainder of the variant apo-A-I sequence being unaffected. The deletion of this single basic amino acid residue is sufficient to account for the charge difference between the variant and normal apo-A-I as seen on isoelectric focusing gels. This variant, previously referred to as A-I-Marburg or A-I-Munster-2, can now be designated by the structural abnormality apo-A-I(Lys107—-0). The evidence from extensive pedigree analysis suggests the likelihood that the deletion mutant gene is allelic to the normal apo-A-I gene. At the same time, the kindred analyses have failed to yield a lipid abnormality that can be unequivocally related to the presence of this deletion mutant of apo-A-I. However, all subjects expressing apo-A-I(Lys107—-0) also express normal apo-A-I, so that any abnormality caused by the variant apo-A-I might be adequately compensated for by the normal apo-A-I. To examine directly the functional consequence of the lysine deletion, the isolated variant was tested in vitro for its ability to activate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, the principal cholesterol-esterifying enzyme in plasma. It was found that apo-A-I(Lys107—-0) is deficient in its ability to activate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, having only 40-60% of the cofactor activity of normal apo-A-I. The cofactor activity of the pro-apo-A-I component of the variant was also reduced to about 60% of either normal A-I or normal pro-apo-A-I. The functional defect is probably related to a disruption in the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the protein caused by the deletion of lysine 107 in the primary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1596788321,"Modification of the three carboxyl groups on adrenodoxin using a water-soluble carbodiimide (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) caused a weakening of the binding of this iron-sulfur protein to both its electron donor protein, adrenodoxin reductase, and its electron acceptor protein, cytochrome P-450scc. Based upon the proximity of the modified groups, the site on adrenodoxin for interaction with the other two proteins is likely to be either identical or highly overlapping, and formation of a ternary complex among the proteins is precluded. Upon incubation of adrenodoxin and either adrenodoxin reductase or cytochrome P-450 plus the carbodiimide (1:1), covalently cross-linked species were formed. When all three proteins were incubated with the cross-linker, only the binary complexes were formed, and no higher order (e.g. 1:1:1 or 1:2:1) complexes were seen. These studies indicate that adrenodoxin forms exclusive binary complexes with its electron transfer partner proteins, and thus provide a physical explanation for the proposed role of adrenodoxin as a mobile electron shuttle between NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase and cytochrome P-450scc."
https://openalex.org/W1527954678,"Asialo-oligosaccharides obtained by sialidase digestion of asparagine-linked acidic sugar chains of promyelocytic leukemic cells (HL-60) differed in size distribution from those of cells induced to undergo myeloid or monocytoid differentiation. High-molecular-weight oligosaccharides which are predominant in HL-60 cells, decreased slightly during myeloid differentiation and markedly during monocytoid differentiation with concomitant increase of biantennary oligosaccharides. Structural analyses revealed that the induced monocytoid cells contain a series of complex-type oligosaccharides with bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary structures and high-molecular-weight oligosaccharides with N-acetyllactosamine repeating units, which show diversity in the presence or absence of the fucose residue linked to the reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine, of the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue, and of the X-antigenic determinant in their outer chain moieties. Methylation analysis of each class of oligosaccharides of HL-60 cells and of their differentiated counterparts revealed the presence of similar heterogeneity in their structures, indicating that the difference is only quantitative. The results show that the shifts in size of the oligosaccharides found in the differentiated cells are derived from changes in outer chain formation and elongation of N-acetyllactosamine repeating units, and thus suggests that the decreased expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases may be involved especially in the monocytoid differentiation program."
https://openalex.org/W1532097123,"Familial hyperlysinemias are autosomal recessive disorders in the oxidative degradation of lysine. Hyperlysinemia type I is associated with a combined deficiency in lysine-ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase activities, the first two sequential steps in the lysine degradative pathway. In familial hyperlysinemia type II, only saccharopine dehydrogenase activity is deficient. We report here that these reductase and dehydrogenase activities occur on a single protein based on the following findings. (i) The activity ratio of reductase/dehydrogenase remained constant (close to unity) throughout a 500-fold purification of both enzyme activities from mitochondrial extracts of baboon and bovine livers. The activity profiles of the reductase and the dehydrogenase superimpose on each other as the enzyme was eluted from DEAE-cellulose and Sephacryl S-300 columns. (ii) Activity-staining of the native polyacrylamide gel showed that both activities migrated the same distance toward the anode. (iii) The highly purified enzyme with the reductase and dehydrogenase activities showed a single polypeptide band of Mr = 115,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The native enzyme from baboon and bovine livers has an apparent Mr of 468,000 (Stokes radius = 69.5 A) as determined by gel filtration, which suggests a tetrameric structure of identical subunits. The presence in mammalian tissues of a single protein catalyzing both the reductase and dehydrogenase reactions explains the combined enzyme deficiency observed in hyperlysinemia type I. We propose that the bifunctional enzyme be called aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1498347766,"A membrane-associated b-type cytochrome (a proposed component in the neutrophil microbicidal superoxide generating system) has been partially purified from nonactivated beef granulocytes to a specific heme content of 20 nmol of heme/mg of protein, a value about 10-fold higher than those previously reported. The hemoprotein was solubilized at low temperature (4 degrees C) from mixed granule (30,000 X g) cell fractions using Triton X-114 detergent. Warming the extract to 25 degrees C allowed separation into detergent and aqueous phases; cytochrome b558 partitioned exclusively into the detergent phase, allowing separation from other visible-absorbing species (e.g. myeloperoxidase) and indicated an intrinsic membrane localization (Bordier, C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1604-1607). The partitioned cytochrome was chromatographed on hydroxylapatite and a hydrophobic affinity matrix, allowing a 185-fold (heme content) purification from the granule extract. The cytochrome preparation revealed three equal-staining protein bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; apparent molecular weights were 14,000, 12,000, and 11,000. The question of heterogeneity of the preparation versus subunit structure is not resolved at present. The hemoprotein binds carbon monoxide, consistent with a proposed role as a terminal oxidase, and has an unusually negative oxidation-reduction potential (-225 mV) similar to that observed in granulocyte membranes. The preparation is devoid of NAD(P)H-diaphorase and cytochrome c reductase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1954978369,"The ninth component of complement (C9) polymerizes to tubules either spontaneously at a very slow rate (3 days at 37 degrees C) or within minutes if induced by C5b-8 as part of the membrane attack assembly (Tschopp, J., Podack, E. R., and Muller-Eberhard, H. J. (1984) J. Immunol., in press). The spontaneous formation of tubular sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant C9 polymers was completely inhibited in the presence of 1 mM EDTA. In contrast, the presence of Cu2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ accelerated C9 polymerization. Zn2+ was the most efficient metal ion. At a molar ratio of one Zn2+ per monomeric C9, all C9 polymerized within 2 h. At Zn2+ concentrations above 10(-3) M, tubular C9 formation was inhibited due to nonspecific aggregation of C9. It is concluded that the presence of metal ions is required for the formation of tubular poly C9 and that Zn2+ in particular catalyzes C9 polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1516853316,"The production of carnitine from peptide-bound 6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine (Lys(Me3)) or 4-N-trimethyl-aminobutyrate(gamma-butyrobetaine) perfused through isolated guinea pig livers was investigated. [Methyl-3H] Lys(Me3)-labeled agalacto-orosomucoid (AGOR) and asialofetuin were rapidly taken up and degraded by the perfused liver. Most of the free Lys(Me3) derived from Lys(Me3)-AGOR was released unmodified into the perfusion medium. However, Lys(Me3), arising from Lys(Me3)-asialofetuin was converted mostly to gamma-butyrobetaine and carnitine. gamma-Butyrobetaine added to the perfusion medium was hydroxylated to carnitine by the liver at a rate of 2.3 mumol/h. Guinea pigs maintained on an ascorbate-free diet for 17-60 days showed lowered ascorbate contents in all tissues measured and, coincidentally, a sharp reduction in carnitine levels in kidney, liver, and cardiac, and skeletal muscle. Carnitine production from [1,2,3,4-14C]gamma-butyrobetaine and [methyl-3H]Lys(Me3)-asialofetuin was reduced in perfused livers obtained from ascorbate-deficient guinea pigs. Although hydroxylation of gamma-butyrobetaine to carnitine was effectively depressed in the perfused isolated livers from ascorbate-deficient animals, hydroxylation of [methyl-3H]Lys(Me3) (derived from asialofetuin) to [methyl-3H]3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine was unaffected. Prior administration of ascorbate to the medium perfusing the isolated livers caused carnitine biosynthesis from all precursors examined to return to control values."
https://openalex.org/W1546044265,"Human placental triosephosphate isomerase was isolated by an improved procedure and recovered with the highest specific activity ever reported. Employing this purification procedure, sufficient amounts of the enzyme were obtained for detailed primary structural studies. For sequences analysis, the enzyme was reduced and carboxymethylated and subjected to tryptic and chymotryptic digestions. The peptide mixtures were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography using octyl or alkylphenyl reverse-phase columns and trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient elution systems. Sequence analyses of the intact enzyme, tryptic, chymotryptic, and cyanogen bromide peptides were accomplished using high-sensitivity solid-phase sequencing procedures with either 4-N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate or phenylisothiocyanate. The primary structure of human triosephosphate isomerase is constructed from the alignment of the tryptic peptides with the analysis of the overlapping chymotryptic peptides. The enzyme is a dimeric molecule consisting of two identical polypeptide chains with 248 amino acid residues and a calculated subunit molecular mass of 26,750 daltons. A comparison of the amino acid sequences from the human placental enzyme and from other species such as rabbit, chicken, and coelacanth muscles showed relatively high sequence homology, indicating that the evolution of the enzyme is very conservative. The amino acids of the active-site pocket and the subunit-subunit contact sites exhibit few changes."
https://openalex.org/W1508610451,"Microsomal testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylase (cytochrome P-450(16) alpha) was purified from the livers of male 129/J mice based on enzyme activity in the eluates from columns of DEAE Bio-Gel A, hydroxylapatite, and isobutyl-Sepharose 4B. The specific cytochrome P-450 content of the purified P-450(16) alpha fraction was 9.5 nmol/mg of protein. The specific testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylation activity of the purified P-450(16) alpha fraction was 80 nmol/min/nmol of cytochrome P-450 or 764 nmol/min/mg of protein, and these values were about 40- and 400-fold higher, respectively, than the activity of solubilized microsomes. The purified P-450(16) alpha showed extremely high regioselectivity and stereospecificity for testosterone hydroxylation; more than 90% of the testosterone metabolites formed by the purified P-450(16) alpha fraction was 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone. The purified anti-P-450(16) alpha antibody exhibited absolute specificity for inhibition of testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone was inhibited by the anti-P-450(16) alpha. Anti-P-450(16) alpha inhibited the 16 alpha-hydroxylation activity of intact microsomes prepared from livers of male or female 129/J mice more than 90%, indicating that P-450(16) alpha is the major cytochrome P-450 isozyme catalyzing 16 alpha-hydroxylation activity of testosterone in these microsomal preparations. The purified P-450(16) alpha fraction also possessed high benzphetamine N-demethylation activity relative to the rates found with other xenobiotic substrates tested in this report."
https://openalex.org/W2046425132,"A complementary DNA probe corresponding to the β-chain gene of Ti, the human T lymphocyte receptor, has been molecularly cloned. The chromosomal origin of the Tiβ gene was determined with the complementary DNA by screening a series of 12 cell hybrid (mouse × human) DNA's containing overlapping subsets of human chromosomes. DNA hybridization (Southern) experiments showed that the human Tiβ gene resides on chromosome 7 and is thus not linked to the immunoglobulin loci or to the major histocompatibility locus in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1531997785,"In order to increase our understanding of the mode of action of insulin in rat fat cells, we investigated the effect of insulin on protein concentrations in purified fat cell fractions using two-dimensional electrophoresis in combination with an ultrasensitive color silver stain technique. Incubation of fat cells with insulin caused a 90% decrease in the plasma membrane concentration of a major plasma membrane protein with a molecular mass of 90 kDa. The insulin effect was dose-dependent with a half-maximal effect at 9.5 microunits/ml, and time-dependent with a t 1/2 of less than 20 s. Insulin-like growth factor I, orthovanadate, and lanthanum mimicked the effect of insulin. Likewise, fractionation of adipocytes in the presence of divalent cation chelating agents caused a similar reduction in the concentration of the 90 kDa protein, and it was possible to overcome the effects of the chelating agents by adding equivalent amounts of calcium. This suggests the involvement of calcium. The 90 kDa protein was also found in low and high density microsomes, but it was not affected in those fractions by either insulin or chelators. It is suggested from the study that the movement of a 90 kDa protein in fat cell plasma membranes probably represents part of the transmission system in the mechanism of insulin action in rat adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1516224401,"The ratio of alkali-labile lesions to total DNA adducts for DNA modified by an active metabolite of benzo(a)pyrene was investigated using DNA sequencing methodology. About 40% of the adducts formed result in alkali-labile sites. About 25% of the lesions were alkali-labile at positions of guanine, 10% at adenine, and 5% at cytosine. This study highlights the potential role of adducts other than the N2-substituted guanine in mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of benzo(a)pyrene."
https://openalex.org/W2079783260,In Drosophila melanogaster a temperature-induced change in immune competence accompanies cell surface alterations that cause its blood cells to adhere and to encapsulate a parasite. At 29 degrees C the blood cells of the tumorous-lethal (Tuml) mutant show a high degree of immune competence and encapsulate the eggs of the parasitic wasp Leptopilina heterotoma. At 21 degrees C the blood cells are essentially immune incompetent. High percentages of lectin binding cells were found under conditions which potentiated cellular encapsulation responses. Some immune reactive blood cells did not bind lectin. The low percentages of lectin binding cells in susceptible hosts suggest that developing parasites alter the cell surface of the blood cells of immune reactive hosts.
https://openalex.org/W1547172120,"The unusual amino acid hypusine is produced in a single protein of mammalian cells by a novel posttranslational event in which a lysine residue is conjugated with the four-carbon moiety from the polyamine spermidine to form an intermediate deoxyhypusine, and in which this intermediate is subsequently hydroxylated. Specifically isotopically labeled precursors of hypusine were used to identify the biosynthetic origin of some of the atoms of hypusine and thus to provide further insight into the mechanism of this in vivo chemical modification reaction. Radiolabel from [1,4-3H] putrescine, [1,8-3H]spermidine, and [5-3H]spermidine entered hypusine during growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The occurrence of this label at positions 1 and 4, at position 4, and at position 1, respectively, in the 4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl portion of hypusine revealed an alignment of atoms identical to that in the butylamine segment of spermidine. Growth of cells with [epsilon-15N]lysine as the source of lysine yielded hypusine enriched in 15N, whereas only isotope-free hypusine during growth by [4-15N]spermidine. These was found in cells whose spermidine was replaced during growth by [4-15N]spermidine. These findings are in accordance with a proposal that the first phase of hypusine biosynthesis, the production of intermediate deoxyhypusine, occurs through transfer of the butylamine moiety from spermidine to the epsilon-amino nitrogen of protein-bound lysine. The technique of thermospray high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry provided positive identification of 15N in hypusine through final separation and on-column direct analysis of this amino acid.

https://openalex.org/W1519091999,"Human plasma fibronectin undergoes thermal denaturation with a midpoint between 62 and 64 degrees C. The irreversible transition is characterized by an increase in the intensity and wavelength of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, by an increase in the ability to enhance the fluorescence of 1,8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate, and by an increase in the fluorescence polarization of covalently attached fluorescein. Addition of molecules which bind to fibronectin with high affinity, e.g. gelatin or heparin, had no stabilizing effect. This was attributed to the presence of multiple domains, all of which must be stabilized to prevent denaturation and aggregation. Further support for this interpretation came from studies of six different proteolytic fragments of fibronectin which collectively span almost the entire molecule. Cell-binding fragments derived from the central regions of the chain were least stable, exhibiting behavior similar to that of the whole protein. Fragments derived from the C-terminal regions were more stable by 7-8 degrees C, and those derived from the N-terminal region showed no thermal transition by any of the fluorescence parameters up to 85 degrees C in some experiments. A fluorescein-labeled 60-kilodalton gelatin-binding fragment which had been heated to 70 degrees C produced an increase in polarization upon addition of gelatin with Kd = 1.3 X 10(-7) M, similar to that of an unheated control. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the fragments had maxima which decreased progressively from 335 nm at the N terminus to 313 nm at the C terminus. These observations further elaborate the multidomain structure of human plasma fibronectin and reveal significant differences between the tertiary structure and stabilities of the various domains."
https://openalex.org/W1517509759,"[3H]Guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA), a potent inhibitor of enkephalin convertase, binds to membrane and soluble fractions of tissue homogenates saturably and reversibly with a KD of 6 nM. Specific binding accounts for greater than 95% of total binding. The highest levels of [3H]GEMSA binding occur in the pituitary gland and the brain, with much lower levels in peripheral tissues. GEMSA, guanidinopropylsuccinic acid, 2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinothiopropionic acid, aminopropylmercaptosuccinic acid, [Leu] enkephalin-Arg, and [Met]enkephalin-Arg inhibit [3H] GEMSA binding to crude rat brain homogenates, to crude bovine pituitary homogenates, and to pure enkephalin convertase with equal potencies. Their Ki values against [3H]GEMSA binding are similar to their Ki values against enkephalin convertase activity. EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline markedly inhibit both binding and enzymatic activity. The ratio of the Vmax for 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-Phe-Leu-Arg to the Bmax (maximal number of binding sites) for [3H]GEMSA is about 2,000 min-1 in both pure enzyme preparations and crude tissue homogenates. [3H] GEMSA binding activity is found only in fractions containing enkephalin convertase during enzyme purification from bovine pituitary by L-arginine affinity chromatography. These data confirm that [3H]GEMSA binds only to enkephalin convertase in crude homogenates under our assay conditions. CoCl2 activates enzyme activity without altering the Ki of GEMSA against enzymatic hydrolysis and weakly inhibits [3H] GEMSA binding by increasing the KD."
https://openalex.org/W1526333172,"The Bacillus subtilis RNase M5 activity, responsible for the endonucleolytic maturation of 5 S rRNA, requires two proteins, alpha and beta. The beta component has been purified to homogeneity and shown to correspond to ribosomal protein BL16. The BL16 protein evidently corresponds functionally to Escherichia coli ribosomal protein EL18, as that latter protein also will complement the B. subtilis alpha protein in the RNase M5 reaction. A filter binding assay for the formation of B. subtilis 5 S rRNA-protein complexes was characterized and used to evaluate the association of BL16 protein with some RNAs. A native precursor of 5 S rRNA, containing extra sequences at both termini of the mature domain, binds the ribosomal protein no better than the mature 5 S rRNA; the precursor sequences do not facilitate that interaction. A model is considered in which the precursor segments facilitate, by refolding, the dissociation of processing products prior to the RNase M5 step. Electrostatic versus nonelectrostatic contributions to the BL16-5 S rRNA complex formation were inspected by analyzing variation in apparent association constants as a function of ionic strength. Electrostatic interactions were seen to contribute approximately 65% to the overall binding energy."
https://openalex.org/W1575239370,"The extracellular matrix of cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts undergoes a number of modifications during the early stages of oncogenic transformation. One alteration is increased production of a small protein (Mr approximately 21,000) which is transiently deposited in the matrix by transforming cells infected with LA24, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (Blenis, J., and Hawkes, S.P. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 770-774). This protein is a major component of substratum-associated material (material which remains attached to culture dishes after removal of cells with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid). Its synthesis is stimulated by transformation of cells with NY68, another ts mutant of RSV, and also by treatment of normal, uninfected cells with the tumor promoter, phorbol myristate acetate. Accessibility of the 21-kDa protein to lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination indicates an exposed location within the matrix. The protein binds strongly to the culture dish and/or other matrix components. This interaction can be disrupted by sodium dodecyl sulfate but not by several nonionic detergents, unless beta-mercaptoethanol or KCl (0.5 M) are also present. High concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride also remove the protein from the matrix. The 21-kDa protein is resistant to trypsin, collagenase, and the hydrolytic enzymes associated with cells transformed by the wild-type Prague A RSV but not to Pronase or chymotrypsin. A 21-kDa protein with properties similar to those described above is also detected in the medium and binds to the matrix, suggesting that a potential route of deposition of the 21-kDa protein in the matrix may be via shedding and subsequent interaction with other matrix components."

Previous studies showed that this RNA is not capped, contains no modified nucleotides, is conserved through evolution, is synthesized by RNA polymerase III, and, in part, is associated by polyribosomes. In this study, the complete nucleotide sequence of 7-3 RNA was determined by RNA-sequencing methods, and the sequence is compared with several small RNAs and repetitive DNA sequences for homology. This 330-nucleotide-long RNA contained pppGp as its 5' terminus and exhibited heterogeneity with respect to the 3'-terminal AoH.

https://openalex.org/W1501711189,"Diffusion in multicomponent solutions containing proteoglycan is shown to result in the formation of coherent, fluid structures (known as dissipative structures) and induction of rapid polymer transport. These phenomena occur over a wide range of conditions (i.e. varying solute distribution, concentration, size, and chemical composition) which are envisaged to occur in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues. A concentration gradient of chondroitin sulfate in a proteoglycan matrix of uniform concentration yields dissipative structures which transport the proteoglycan up to 300-fold faster than its transport in the absence of the gradient component. Similar behavior was observed with other polysaccharide and monosaccharide concentration gradient components. Amplification of structure formation and rapid transport was achieved by 1) increasing the concentration of proteoglycan matrix, 2) increasing the magnitude of the concentration gradient, 3) decreasing the molecular weight of the gradient-forming component, and 4) decreasing the concentration gradient of proteoglycan in the matrix. Dissipative structure morphology exhibits a marked dependence on the initial component distribution. Non-specific, excluded volume interactions between the proteoglycan and the gradient component are believed to induce coupled diffusive transport of the proteoglycan. This leads to microscopic density inversions which nucleate and develop into macroscopic convective flows. These results are similar to those previously observed in ternary solutions of uncharged polymers (i.e. dextran/polyvinylpyrrolidone). We have demonstrated that dissipative structures may transport Micrococcus luteus cells as well as various solutes. Flows were also observed in proteoglycan solutions after localized addition of small amounts of either a proteolytic enzyme or hyaluronic acid. It is likely that the prerequisites for this spontaneous macroscopic self-organization, as manifested by the flow phenomenon, are present in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1538375669,"Kynureninase from Pseudomonas marginalis has been shown to catalyze the elimination of beta-functionalities of beta-substituted amino acids such as beta-chloro-L-alanine, resulting in the formation of aminoacrylate-pyridoxal phosphate-enzyme complex. This intermediate can be processed further to produce either pyruvate, ammonia, and active enzyme or an inactive enzyme complex. Approximately 1 in 500 turnovers leads to inactivation of the enzyme. The mechanism of inactivation appears to involve nucleophilic addition of a carboxylate group at the active site to the beta-carbon of the aminoacrylate complex. Both subunits of kynureninase have been shown to be catalytically competent although the native enzyme contains only one pyridoxal phosphate per dimer. Since both aspartate beta-decarboxylase and kynureninase catalyze mechanistically similar reactions, these results further support the notion that the two active sites may have several common features."
https://openalex.org/W1593674005,"Metabolism of trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydro-6-fluorobenzo(a)pyrene by liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats and by a highly purified monooxygenase system, reconstituted with cytochrome P-450c, has been examined. Although both the fluorinated and unfluorinated 7,8-dihydrodiol formed from benzo(a)pyrene by liver microsomes share (R,R)-absolute configuration, the fluorinated dihydrodiol prefers the conformation in which the hydroxyl groups are pseudodiaxial due to the proximate fluorine. The fluorinated 4,5- and 9,10-dihydrodiols are also greater than 97% the (R,R)-enantiomers. For benzo(a)pyrene, metabolism of the (7R,8R)-dihydrodiol to a bay-region 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide in which the benzylic hydroxyl group and epoxide oxygen are trans constitutes the only known pathway to an ultimate carcinogen. With the microsomal and the purified monooxygenase system, this pathway accounts for 76-82% of the total metabolites from the 7,8-dihydrodiol. In contrast, only 32-49% of the corresponding diol epoxide is obtained from the fluorinated dihydrodiol and this fluorinated diol epoxide has altered conformation in that its hydroxyl groups prefer to be pseudodiaxial. Much smaller amounts of the diastereomeric 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxides in which the benzylic hydroxyl groups and the epoxide oxygen are cis are formed from both dihydrodiols. As the fluorinated diol epoxides are weaker mutagens toward bacteria and mammalian cells relative to the unfluorinated diol epoxides, conformation appears to be an important determinant in modulating the biological activity of diol epoxides. One of the more interesting metabolites of 6-fluorinated 7,8-dihydrodiol was a relatively stable arene oxide, probably the 4,5-oxide, which is resistant to the action of epoxide hydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1518150166,"Fluoraocetate-specific defluorinase, an enzyme which catalyzes the release of fluoride ion from the rodenticide fluoroacetate, has been purified 347-fold from mouse liver cytosol and shown to be distinct from multiple cationic and anionic glutathione S-transferase isozymes. Fluoroacetate-specific defluorinase was obtained at a final specific activity of 659 nmol of F-/min/mg of protein and was prepared in an overall yield of 12%. The isoelectric point of this hepatic enzyme was acidic, at pH 6.4, as determined by column chromatofocusing. The molecular weight of the active species was estimated at 41,000, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of the purified defluorinase demonstrated a predominant subunit, Mr = 27,000. Chromatofocusing completely partitioned the fluoroacetate-specific defluorinase from two separate peaks of murine anionic glutathione S-transferase activity. Rabbit antibodies prepared against the purified hepatic defluorinase quantitatively precipitated native defluorinase from mouse and rat liver, but were unable to immunoprecipitate cationic or anionic glutathione S-transferase enzymes from the same preparation. The evidence presented suggests that fluoroacetate-specific defluorinase and glutathione S-transferase activities are catalyzed by separate proteins present in the cytosol of mouse liver."
https://openalex.org/W1574913947,"Levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in C3H/10T1/2 cells were selectively altered to determine what quantitative role GSH transferase-catalyzed conjugation plays in regulating the cytotoxic effects of benzo(a)pyrene anti-7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide (r-7,t-8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo(a)pyrene, anti-diol epoxide). A 65% decrease in 10T1/2 cell GSH content from 0.16 mM (control cell GSH concentration) to 0.06 mM was accompanied by a 46% decrease in the anti-diol epoxide LD80; a 98% increase in GSH content resulted in a 44% increase in anti-diol epoxide LD80. This nonlinear relationship between changes in cellular GSH concentration and anti-diol epoxide LD80 was directly relatable to the nonlinear change in the rate of anti-diol epoxide conjugation which was catalyzed by 10T1/2 cell GSH transferases. Purified 10T1/2 cell cytosol catalyzed the GSH conjugation of anti-diol epoxide to yield a GSH conjugation product with a distinct UV absorbance spectrum; the apparent GSH Km for this cell cytosol-catalyzed reaction was 0.20 mM. Variations in the cellular GSH concentration around the GSH Km resulted in a nonlinear change in the amount of anti-diol epoxide-GSH conjugate formed, and a reciprocal change in the amount of free anti-diol epoxide available for cytotoxic alkylation events. These results clarify in quantitative, biochemical terms how GSH transferase-catalyzed conjugation can regulate the level of an electrophilic carcinogen metabolite in a biological system."
https://openalex.org/W1602845192,"The Bacillus subtilis RNase M5 complex, responsible for the terminal maturation of 5 S rRNA, includes two proteins. One of these proteins is ribosomal protein BL16 (equivalent to Escherichia coli EL18); the other, the alpha component, is required for catalysis. The RNase M5 alpha component has been purified in bulk extensively, and the active polypeptide (Mr approximately 24,000) identified following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Reaction conditions (20-30% dimethyl sulfoxide) are reported which render RNase M5 activity independent of ribosomal protein BL16. This proves that alpha indeed is the catalytic element, the actual RNase M5, which normally attacks a ribonucleoprotein substrate consisting of protein BL16 in complex with the 5 S rRNA precursor. Kinetic analyses of the BL16-dependent and independent reactions suggest that any alpha-BL16 association contributes little to the energetics of the alpha-ribonucleoprotein substrate interaction. It is postulated that the BL16 protein serves as a scaffold, to lock the precursor mRNA into a conformation recognizable by the nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1552927822,"We have observed increased phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the polyoma virus middle tumor antigen (MTAg) in in vitro kinase assays of the immune complexes immunoprecipitated from lysates of polyoma virus-infected mouse embryo cells to which increasing amounts of uninfected mouse embryo cell lysate had been added. The components from uninfected mouse cells responsible for increased MTAg phosphorylation were localized by subcellular fractionation to the plasma membrane and found to be sensitive to protease digestion, N-ethylmaleimide, and 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine inactivation. The majority of the membrane-associated activity responsible for the increased MTAg phosphorylation in these assays could be cleared from lysates of uninfected mouse cell lysates by centrifugation after reaction with Sepharose-bound monoclonal antibodies which recognize pp60c-src. These results suggest that MTAg can associate with cellular tyrosyl kinases in vitro and be phosphorylated by these enzymes in immune-complex kinase assays. The identity of at least one of these cellular tryosyl kinases which can associate with MTAg in vitro is likely to be pp60c-src."

The enzyme was activated prior to crystallization and is presumed to be in the CO2-activated state in the crystal. The method of hydrophobicity correlation has been used to compare the amino acid sequence of this molecule (466 residues) to that of the large subunit of a higher plant ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (477 residues in Nicotiana tabacum). The pattern of residue hydrophobicities is similar along the two polypeptides. This suggests that the three-dimensional folding of the large polypeptide chains may be similar in plant and bacterial enzymes. If this is so, knowing the structure of either the plant or bacterial ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase should aid in learning the structure of the other."
https://openalex.org/W1514816685,"Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified from a trimethoprim-resistant strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The enzyme showed a single component on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr = 18,000) and on isoelectric focusing in 5 M urea (pI = 6.8). Although gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions resolved the preparation into two enzymatically active proteins (called form 1 and form 2), they were not genetically determined isozymes. Both had a similar dihydrofolate Km (2 microM), NADPH Km (10 microM), and trimethoprim Ki (20 nM), and form 2 (the slower migrating species) was shown to be generated from form 1 by the electrophoresis conditions. The complete covalent structure of the enzyme has also been determined. It is a single polypeptide composed of 162 residues and containing 4 cysteines. The gonococcal dihydrofolate reductase shares a 35% homology with the chicken liver enzyme and a 40% homology with the Escherichia coli enzyme. Most of these identities are residues that have been implicated in the binding of NADPH and methotrexate to the E. coli and Lactobacillus casei reductases."
https://openalex.org/W160752234,"Abstract The most abundant lipid and protein components of human plasma high density lipoproteins are phosphatidylcholine and apolipoprotein A-I (A-I). Under appropriate conditions, A-I spontaneously associates with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) to quantitatively form a lipid-protein complex with a DMPC/A-I molar ratio of 100:1. Differential scanning calorimetry of this complex reveals two broad thermal transitions centered at approximately 27 and 72 degrees C. 13C NMR spectra of the complex have been obtained above, at, and below the lower transition temperature. The 13C resonance arising from the 3' carbon of the fatty acyl chains is a doublet, split by approximately 0.2 ppm, suggesting that the 3' carbon nuclei occupy two magnetically inequivalent sites. By replacing the sn-2 fatty acyl chain with myristate selectively 13C-enriched at carbon 3', we have shown that the splitting is, in fact, a result of magnetic inequivalence of the two sites and have assigned the lower field resonance to the 3' carbon nucleus of the sn-2 chain. The temperature dependence of the NMR relaxation rates indicates that the endothermic transition at 27 degrees C is associated with increased motional freedom for the phospholipids within this complex. The temperature dependence of the fatty acyl chain methylene 13C chemical shifts suggests that the population of gauche conformers increases above the transition temperature. These dynamic and conformational changes are characteristic of gel----liquid crystalline phase transitions observed in pure phospholipid systems. For the DMPC-A-I complex at 37 degrees C, the chemical shifts of the fatty acyl C 4'- 11' methylene envelope and of the C 7' and C 13' resonances occur significantly downfield from the corresponding chemical shifts for the DMPC vesicle. These results suggest that the apoprotein rigidifies the acyl chains by increasing their number of trans conformers."

The kinetics of inactivation are consistent with the reversible formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex followed by covalent binding to the enzyme. The reversible component is competitive with dihydrofolate and has an inhibitor binding constant of 10 nM. Irreversible inactivation proceeds as a pseudo first-order process with a minimum inactivation half-time of 20 min and a Ki of 28 nM. Using radiolabeled inhibitor, it was shown that approximately 1 mol of ligand was covalently bound to the enzyme/mol of methotrexate binding site when the enzyme was completely inhibited. Radiolabeled inhibitor remained associated with the enzyme following denaturation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the 14C-labeled enzyme-inhibitor complex yielded only one radioactive polypeptide, and sequence determinations showed that His-25 was modified by covalent attachment of the inhibitor. When dihydrofolate reductases from Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, SR-1 rodent lymphoma, and chicken liver were tested with the affinity label, only the L. casei enzyme showed a time-dependent increase in inhibition. These data, along with comparisons of known amino acid sequences and x-ray crystal structures, were used to make predictions concerning the three-dimensional conformation of the gonococcal enzyme."
