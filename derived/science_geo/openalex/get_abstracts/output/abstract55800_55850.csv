https://openalex.org/W2039769832,"Studies in ctltured fibroblasts indicate that the primary genetic abnormality in familial hypercholesterolemia involves a deficiency in a cell surface receptor for low density lipoproteins (LDL). In normal cells, binding of LDL to this receptor regulates cholesterol metabolism by suppressing cholesterol synthesis and increasing LDL degradation. In cells from heterozygotes, a 60 percent reduction in LDL receptors leads to a concentration-dependent defect in regulation, so that attainment of equal rates of cholesterol synthesis and LDL degradation in normal and heterozygous cells requires a two- to threefold higher concentration of LDL in the heterozygote. The identification of this genetic regulatory defect in fibroblasts of heterozygotes makes available an in vitro system for studying the effects of a dominant mutation on gene expression in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2042191344,"NATURALLY occurring and synthetic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are interferon inducers1. They inhibit protein synthesis in animal cells2 and cell-free systems3–5. It is intriguing, therefore, that interferon treatment renders cells more sensitive to the toxic effects of dsRNA6, particularly as viral dsRNA may be involved in the replication of RNA viruses and has been isolated from DNA virus-infected cells7. Accordingly, the production of viral dsRNA in response to infection could bring about a general inhibition of protein synthesis in the interferon-treated cell, as is indeed observed in interferon-treated, vaccinia virus-infected mouse fibroblast L cells8,9. The cell dies but little virus is produced: an effective way of limiting a natural infection."

https://openalex.org/W1571192847,"Abstract Preparations of peritoneal macrophages were obtained by selecting from a peritoneal exudate of guinea pigs those cells which adhere to glass. By preincubating the macrophages in a hypotonic pH 8.0 buffer, homogenization was achieved under gentle conditions. The adenylate cyclase activity of homogenates was stimulated by catecholamines and by the prostaglandins E1 and E2 (PGE1 and PGE2). Using inhibitors and other criteria the catecholamine receptor was classified as a β-adrenergic receptor. Since propranolol inhibits the catecholamine stimulation but not the prostaglandin stimulation of adenylate cyclase, it was concluded that these two classes of hormones interact with separate receptor sites. It is still unclear whether they affect the same or different catalytic sites. Two types of experiments yielded information about the effects on adenylate cyclase activity of exposure of intact cells to hormones. Intact macrophages were incubated as monolayers with epinephrine or PGE2 for 2 hours, after which the hormone was removed and the cells homogenized. Preincubation of macrophages with PGE2 greatly reduced the subsequent response of adenylate cyclase to PGE2. The basal, epinephrine-stimulated, and NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were unaffected. Similarly, treatment of cells with epinephrine left the basal, PGE2-stimulated and NaF-stimulated activities unaffected but markedly reduced the epinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. This desensitization, i.e. loss of response to hormone due to treatment with hormone, was found to be dose-dependent over the range of 10-7 to 10-4 m PGE2. Incubation of macrophage monolayers in a serum-containing medium leads to an increase in adenylate cyclase activity (basal) after 24 hours. Inclusion of PGE2 in these cultures caused the basal adenylate cyclase activity to be markedly decreased relative to control cultures incubated without PGE2. This decrease was dose-dependent over the range of 10-7 to 10-4 m PGE2 and was not observed with prostaglandin F1α."
https://openalex.org/W2118407768,"Abstract An antimicrobial system has been previously described in the polymorphonuclear leukocyte which consists of myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and a halide. In the present study, H2O2 is replaced by xanthine and xanthine oxidase in the isolated myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial system and the contribution of the superoxide anion (O2-) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH) to the antimicrobial effect investigated. Xanthine, xanthine oxidase, chloride, and myeloperoxidase have a marked microbicidal effect on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida tropicalis. The requirement for H2O2 is indicated by the inhibitory effect of catalase. Superoxide dismutase, which catalyzes the conversion of (O2-) to O2 and H2O2, inhibits microbicidal activity at high concentration (g88 µg per ml); however, this is probably due, in large part, to the nonspecific inhibitory effect of protein. Cytochrome c is reduced by (O2-) and thus inhibits the conversion of (O2-) to H2O2. The microbicidal activity of the xanthine-xanthine oxidase-chloride-myeloperoxidase system is inhibited by cytochrome c and superoxide dismutase, at low concentration (4.4 µg per ml), largely reverses this inhibition. Microbicidal activity in the presence of cytochrome c and superoxide dismutase is inhibited by catalase. The hydroxyl radical scavengers, benzoate and ethanol, also have an inhibitory effect on the microbicidal system which is partially reversed by superoxide dismutase. Again, catalase abolishes the microbicidal activity of the reconstituted system. These studies suggest that superoxide dismutase and scavengers of the (O2-) and ·OH radicals influence microbicidal activity through their effect on H2O2 formation. Their interaction offers a possible means of control of the myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial system in the intact cell."

https://openalex.org/W1541505582,"Abstract A study of the interaction of the ATP analog, adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), with mitochondrial ATPase revealed that the analog was a strong competitive inhibitor of both the soluble, purified enzyme, Ki = 0.33 µm, and of the membrane-bound enzyme, Ki = 0.16 µm. AMP-PNP also was a strong inhibitor of the partial reactions of oxidative phosphorylation catalyzed by phosphorylating submitochondrial particles. Thus, the ATP-dependent reduction of NAD by succinate was inhibited competitively with Ki = 13 µm and the ATP-dependent enhancement of fluorescence of 1,8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate and the exchange between 32Pi and ATP also were inhibited. However, AMP-PNP did not affect the forward reactions of oxidative phosphorylation, that is, the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi linked to the oxidation of succinate. It is proposed that the failure of AMP-PNP to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation may be traceable to a high affinity for ADP of the phosphorylating sites on F1 or may reflect two catalytic sites on the enzyme which are specialized, respectively, for ATP synthesis and ATP utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1984841015,Neuroretinal cells from 7-day-old chick embryos are transformed and induced to proliferate after infection with Rous sarcoma virus in vitro. Susceptibility of neuroretinal cells to the virus is also dependent on the stage of development since infection of cells from 10-day-old embryos is uneffective.
https://openalex.org/W1503037740,"Abstract A casein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of dephosphorylated αs1-casein by ATP has been found in the Golgi apparatus of lactating rat mammary gland. Dephosphorylated β- and κ-caseins are also phosphorylated by this enzyme, while other milk proteins (β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, native αs1-, β-, and κ-casein, and proteins of the fat globule membrane) are phosphorylated to a limited extent. Histones, phosvitin, and lysozyme are not appreciably phosphorylated. The optimum pH for phosphate incorporation into dephosphorylated casein is 7.6. The Km for dephosphorylated αs1-casein is 12 µm (.27 mg per ml), whereas the Km for ATP is 80 µm. The casein kinase requires a divalent cation for maximum activity; both Ca2+ and Mg2+ can satisfy this requirement. Adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) has no effect on casein kinase activity. The protein inhibitor from rabbit skeletal muscle, which inhibits adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinases, is also without effect. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of casein, a food protein, is quite different from the phosphorylation of cellular enzymes, which requires cyclic AMP, is inhibited by Ca2+ and is involved in control mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1537442027,"Abstract The glucose-6-P-dependent form of glycogen synthetase has been purified about 5,000-fold from yeast extracts. The enzyme was separated from the glucose-6-P-independent form by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and from other proteins by a two-step agarose chromatography, using complex formation with glycogen to change the elution properties of the synthetase. The purified material shows a single band on disc gel electrophoresis and possesses a molecular weight of 300,000, as measured by sedimentation equilibrium. Acrylamide electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate yields a major band, molecular weight about 77,000, and a minor band of variable intensity, with molecular weight about 71,000. The faster band is believed to be a proteolysis degradation product of the slow band. Thus, the native enzyme would consist of four subunits of equal molecular weight. The enzyme was labeled with radioactive phosphate by conversion into the glucose-6-P-independent form followed by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP. The amount of radioactivity incorporated corresponds to 1.4 phosphate groups per subunit. Incubation with a muscle protein phosphatase led to a liberation of radioactivity and a parallel increase in glucose-6-P-independent synthetase activity. Lineweaver-Burk plots with the purified enzyme, using either UDP-glucose or glycogen as the variable substrate, showed a biphasic curve, as previously observed with cruder enzymes. Increasing concentrations of glucose-6-P led to a gradual elimination of the line corresponding to a higher Km value."
https://openalex.org/W2131364553,"Abstract Cloned cell lines derived from the murine C1300 neuroblastoma may be grown in suspension (Spinner) culture. Upon transfer to monolayer culture, morphological differentiation (appearance of long processes) may be induced under a variety of conditions. A method for the isolation of surface membranes from both undifferentiated and differentiated cultures has been developed. The yield (60 to 70 %) is very high and few contaminants were observed. The polypeptide composition of the surface membrane fraction from both types of cultures was very similar as determined by discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in buffers containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. Following incorporation of radioactive leucine into the cultures for 60 hours, the distribution of radioactivity among surface membrane proteins was similar in preparations from differentiated and undifferentiated cells. When radioactive glucosamine was used in a similar experiment there was a preferential incorporation of radioactivity into a protein from differentiated cells with an apparent molecular weight of 105,000. Glucosamine was also preferentially incorporated into a soluble protein of the same molecular weight in differentiated cells. The appearance of this protein on the surface membrane was not due to contamination by the soluble protein, since in differentiated cells radioactive fucose was preferentially incorporated into this membrane protein, but not into the corresponding soluble protein. Synthesis of the glycoprotein of molecular weight 105,000 could also be induced by N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic 3' : 5'-adenosine monophosphate (Bt2cAMP) under conditions where morphological differentiation was prevented (Spinner culture). Iodination of proteins exposed on the cell surface was catalyzed by lactoperoxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. A protein of molecular weight 78,000 was preferentially exposed on the surface of differentiated cells. This effect always accompanied morphological differentiation and could not be duplicated by Bt2cAMP treatment of suspension culture cells."

Intermediate coumarin hydroxylase activity in F(1) hybrids of mating between DBA/2J and the other three strains indicates an additive mode of inheritance."

https://openalex.org/W1504468632,"Abstract Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulate magnesium accumulation in plasma membrane vesicles derived from fat cells. A new method was developed to demonstrate this magnesium uptake utilizing the ligand, 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid, whose magnesium complex fluoresces distinctively. An increase in total magnesium content in whole fat cells following hormone stimulation was documented. These findings were confirmed with 28Mg2+ in intact adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1504553607,"Abstract The anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate interacts with three to four binding sites on the surface of each of the individual polypeptide components (AI and AII) of human serum high density lipoprotein. The association constants for this process are the same for both AI and the disulfidebonded dimer of AII, namely 2 x 104 liters per mole. AI and AII are relatively compact, ordered structures over this range of detergent binding, and cooperative interaction occurs only at much higher free concentrations of ligand ( g 1.5 x 10-4 m). The detergent binding sites are probably exposed rather than clefts in the protein surface, since these same sites are involved in protein-protein interactions between the polypeptide components of high density lipoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1496648325,"Abstract Myosin has been identified in three independently derived cell lines of fibroblasts: normal rat kidney cells, mouse 3T3 cells, and mouse L cells. A quantitative two-step procedure for its extraction from as little as 200 mg of cultured fibroblasts (wet weight) has been developed. Myosin constitutes from 0.5 % to over 3 % of the total fibroblast protein. Cell fractionation suggests that the myosin principally resides in the cytoplasm. One virus-transformed, normal rat kidney cell line contained one-half of the myosin of its NRK parent. Treatment of L cells during culture with N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and theophylline had no effect on their myosin content. Actin and tubulin were identified in L cells."
https://openalex.org/W1594505663,Abstract Guinea pig peritoneal macrophages showed increased adenylate cyclase activity when incubated with mediators of cellular immunity. Such mediators are released by sensitized and stimulated lymphocytes and are known to cause morphological and functional changes in macrophages in vitro after 72 hours. The presence of lymphocyte mediators in macrophage monolayer cultures was found to increase adenylate cyclase activity (basal) at 24 and 48 hours. It was shown that lymphocyte mediators do not stimulate adenylate cyclase when added to broken cell macrophage preparations but act only in long term cultures containing serum. The effect of lymphocyte mediators was not observed when fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase was measured. Indomethacin was also found to increase adenylate cyclase when included in macrophage cultures and to largely obliterate the stimulation of that activity by lymphocyte mediators which suggests that prostaglandins are involved. These findings indicate a role for adenylate cyclase in the increase in functional specialization of the macrophage caused by lymphocyte mediators.

https://openalex.org/W1606013307,"Abstract Purified preparations of yeast glycogen synthetase in the glucose-6-P-dependent form yield two bands upon acrylamide electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Treatment of the enzyme with either trypsin or subtilisin converted all the material into the faster band. Concomitantly, the activity measured in the absence of glucose-6-P increased rapidly, whereas the total activity determined in the presence of the phosphoric ester showed little change. Thus, the enzyme was converted into an apparent glucose-6-P-independent form. The protease-treated enzyme yielded a biphasic Lineweaver-Burk plot, as was previously observed with the native synthetase. As indicated by experiments with 32P-labeled enzyme, the protease specifically excises the portion of the molecule which contains the bound phosphate. The binding sites for the allosteric effectors ATP and glucose-6-P remain with the enzyme since inhibition by the former and reactivation by the latter can still be shown in the protease-degraded synthetase. Since the molecular weight of the enzyme decreased by less than 10% after proteolysis, it is concluded that the phosphate group which determines dependence of the enzyme on glucose-6-P must be located near one end of the polypeptide chain."

Rate constants for the reagent transformation have been combined with rate data for loss of staphylococcal nuclease activity to provide the mechanism for the protein modification. The reactive species for derivatization of the enzyme is the intermediate ketoketenimine. The pH dependence of the rate of the second order reaction between this intermediate and the nuclease yielded a pKapp of 5.22, which is attributed to a carboxyl group or groups of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1508284993,"Abstract A novel nucleotide was formed during incubations of fat cell ghosts or particles with ATP and glycerol. The reaction was followed by measuring the incorporation of radioactivity from [α-32P]ATP into the product, which was isolated by the method for separating cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) (Krishna, G., Weiss, B., and Brodie, B. B. (1968) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 163, 379–385). Under the conditions of this assay, a similar reaction occurred when glycerol was replaced by either methanol or ethylene glycol. The product was demonstrated not to be cyclic AMP via paper chromatography and by its behavior following incubation with phosphodiesterase. Both the adenosine and α-phosphate moieties of ATP, but not the γ-phosphate, were incorporated into the unknown product. Preliminary experiments suggested that the β-phosphate was not incorporated. Glycerol, methanol, and ethylene glycol each yielded products which separated from one another when chromatographed on paper, indicating that the alcohol was also incorporated. Thus, the product formed from ATP and glycerol appears to be a novel nucleotide containing AMP and glycerol in unknown linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1601179661,"Abstract The rate and equilibrium constants for addition of cyanide ions to β-nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (βNAD+), αNAD+ and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) were studied in the presence and absence of polyelectrolytes and surfactants. The polymers examined were poly(4-vinyl-N-butylpyridinium bromide) (C4PVP), poly(4-vinyl-N-benzylpyridinium chloride) (BzPVP), copolymer of 4-vinyl-N-benzylchloride and 4-vinyl-N-n-cetylbromide (C16BzPVP),copolymer of diethyldiallylammonium chloride and sulfurdioxide (DECS), DNA, poly(A), poly(I), poly(C), and poly(U). The surfactant was cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr). All of the electrolytes investigated, except anionic polyelectrolytes, increased the second order rate constant of the forward process ((→)/k) of the cyanide addition reaction in the order, αNAD+ g βNAD+ g NMN+. The order was explained by the difference in the effective local charges of the substrates. The increase was in the order, KC1 l CaCl2 l DECS l C4PVP l BzPVP l C16BzPVP, suggesting the simultaneous contribution of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between βNAD+ (αNAD+ or NMN) and the polyelectrolytes. On the contrary, the backward reaction was decelerated by the polyelectrolytes. The thermodynamic quantities of the cyanide addition reaction, i.e. the free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of activation, and the free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of reaction, were derived. The acceleration by polyelectrolyte was due to entropic gain, in contrast with many of the previously studied systems."

https://openalex.org/W1586102955,"Abstract To elucidate further how cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and the cyclic AMP receptor are able to stimulate gal mRNA synthesis we have utilized an antiserum specific for cyclic AMP receptor and also cyclic GMP as inhibitors of cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP receptor action. When cyclic AMP, cyclic AMP receptor, DNA, and RNA polymerase are incubated together a rifampicin-resistant preinitiation complex is formed and, upon the addition of missing ribonucleoside triphosphates or Mg2+, gal mRNA synthesis occurs. If the preinitiation complex is formed in the absence of nucleoside triphosphates the antiserum is able to dissociate the complex. If the complex is formed in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates (no Mg2+), it is converted to a more stable form which is not reversed by the addition of antiserum. Cyclic GMP can prevent the formation of the preinitiation complex. However, we find that once the preinitiation complex has been formed cyclic GMP does not inhibit cyclic AMP receptor-cyclic AMP-dependent transcription, suggesting that RNA polymerase stabilizes cyclic AMP receptor-cyclic AMP binding to the gal promoter region."
