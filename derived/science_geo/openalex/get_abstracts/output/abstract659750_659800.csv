https://openalex.org/W3024382408,"Background The COVID-19 virus pandemic has caused a significant number of deaths worldwide. If the prevalence of the infection continues to grow, this could impact life expectancy. This paper provides first estimates of the potential direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on period life expectancy. Methods From the estimates of bias-adjusted age-specific infection fatality rates in Hubei (China) and a range of six prevalence rate assumptions ranging from 1% to 70%, we built a discrete-time microsimulation model that simulates the number of people infected by COVID-19, the number dying from it, and the number of deaths from all causes week by week for a period of one year. We applied our simulation to four broad regions: North America and Europe; Latin America and the Caribbean; Southeastern Asia; and sub-Saharan African. For each region, 100,000 individuals per each 5-year age group are simulated. Results At a 10% COVID-19 prevalence rate, the loss in life expectancy at birth is likely above 1 year in North America and Europe and in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Southeastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, one year lost in life expectancy corresponds to an infection prevalence of about 15% and 25%, respectively. Given the uncertainty in fatality rates, with a 50% prevalence of COVID-19 infections under 95% prediction intervals, life expectancy would drop by 3 to 9 years in North America and Europe, by 3 to 8 years in Latin America and the Caribbean, by 2 to 7 years in Southeastern Asia, and by 1 to 4 years in sub-Saharan Africa. In all prevalence scenarios, as long as the COVID-19 infection prevalence rate remains below 1 or 2%, COVID-19 would not affect life expectancy in a substantial manner. Interpretation In regions with relatively high life expectancy, if the infection prevalence threshold exceeds 1 or 2%, the COVID-19 pandemic will break the secular trend of increasing life expectancy, resulting in a decline in period life expectancy. With life expectancy being a key indicator of human development, mortality increase, especially among the vulnerable subgroups of populations, would set a country back on its path of human development."
https://openalex.org/W3087228052,"Social anxiety is a fast-growing phenomenon which is thought to disproportionately affect young people. In this study, we explore the prevalence of social anxiety around the world using a self-report survey of 6,825 individuals (male = 3,342, female = 3,428, other = 55), aged 16-29 years (M = 22.84, SD = 3.97), from seven countries selected for their cultural and economic diversity: Brazil, China, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand, US, and Vietnam. The respondents completed the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). The global prevalence of social anxiety was found to be significantly higher than previously reported, with more than 1 in 3 (36%) respondents meeting the threshold criteria for having Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Prevalence and severity of social anxiety symptoms did not differ between sexes but varied as a function of age, country, work status, level of education, and whether an individual lived in an urban or rural location. Additionally, 1 in 6 (18%) perceived themselves as not having social anxiety, yet still met or exceeded the threshold for SAD. The data indicate that social anxiety is a concern for young adults around the world, many of whom do not recognise the difficulties they may experience. A large number of young people may be experiencing substantial disruptions in functioning and well-being which may be ameliorable with appropriate education and intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3087591316,"Purpose Female mice have been found to be resistant to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, and pre-clinical research related to diabetic complications commonly omits females. The purpose of this study was to develop a method to induce diabetes in female mice, and to determine if retinas of diabetic female mice develop molecular changes and histopathological abnormalities comparable to those which develop in male diabetic mice. Methods To induce diabetes, animals of both sexes received daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of STZ for 5 consecutive days at 55 mg/kg BW (a dose that is known to induce diabetes in male mice) or for females, 75 mg/kg BW of STZ. Retinal abnormalities that have been implicated in the development of the retinopathy (superoxide generation and expression of inflammatory proteins, iNOS and ICAM-1) were evaluated at 2 months of diabetes, and retinal capillary degeneration was evaluated at 8 months of diabetes. Results Daily i.p. injection of STZ for 5 consecutive days at a concentration of 55 mg/kg BW was sufficient to induce diabetes in 100% of male mice, but only 33% of female mice. However, females did become hyperglycemic when the dose of STZ administered was increased to 75 mg/kg BW. The resulting STZ-induced hyperglycemia in female and male mice was sustained for at least 8 months. After induction of the diabetes, both sexes responded similarly with respect to the oxidative stress, expression of iNOS, and degeneration of retinal capillaries, but differed in the limited population evaluated with respect to expression of ICAM-1. Conclusions The resistance of female mice to STZ-induced diabetes can be overcome by increasing the dose of STZ used. Female mice can, and should, be included in pre-clinical studies of diabetes and its complications."
https://openalex.org/W3084843673,"The appearance of a new coronavirus (Covid-19) and its rapid expansion throughout the world has forced all countries to establish regulations based on social confinement. In the early days of a pandemic, the adherence to regulations is crucial to be able to block its spread. This research aims to analyse the relationship between motivational variables associated with physical distancing and self-interested consumption behaviours in the first 10 days of confinement in Spain. A total of 1,324 people participated throughout the country (mean age 28.92 years). Participants answered an online survey about socio-demographic, motivational variables, which included a) risk information seeking, b) confidence in self- and collective efficacy in coping with the pandemic, and c) the four higher-order personal values ‒conservation (security, conformity, and tradition), self-transcendence (universalism and benevolence), openness (self-direction actions and stimulation), and self-improvement (hedonism and power) ‒ and the aforementioned behaviours in coping with Covid-19. Results showed a positive association between self- and collective efficacy and both coping behaviours analysed: a protective role of conservation values on normative behaviours; and a negative relationship between self-transcendence values and self-interested consumption. Additionally, risk information seeking was positively associated with the development of physical distancing behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3087432191,"Pregnancy offers a unique period for initiating preventive parenting interventions. Disturbances in maternal-fetal bonding may indicate suboptimal parenting and a need for intervention. However, more knowledge is needed on the development of maternal-fetal bonding among at-risk groups. The study aim was to examine psychosocial correlates of maternal-fetal bonding among pregnant women identified to be at risk socially and regarding their mental health. The sample consisted of 78 at-risk pregnant women participating in a perinatal intervention study: Godt på Vej Sammen [A Good Start to Life-an Early Cross-sectorial Intervention]. This study was cross-sectional reporting on the baseline characteristics of the participants. In the beginning of the second trimester, participants completed questionnaires assessing maternal-fetal bonding (the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale [MAAS]), prenatal parental reflective functioning, adult attachment style, and depressive symptoms. We compared the distribution of MAAS styles with norms from a recent Dutch community sample. In addition, we tested associations between psychosocial variables and the quality and intensity of MAAS scores in regression models and performed Chi-square analyses to assess the association of MAAS styles with psychosocial variables. First, compared to women from a community sample, approximately half of the women in our sample presented lower and suboptimal MAAS scores. Second, insecure avoidant adult attachment style was negatively associated with MAAS intensity, and depressive symptoms were negatively associated with MAAS quality. Third, prenatal parental reflective functioning positively correlated with both quality and intensity of MAAS. Fourth, we found no association between insecure anxious adult attachment style and MAAS scores. Fifth, women with a negative disinterested MAAS style demonstrated the highest avoidant attachment scores, while women with a positively preoccupied MAAS style demonstrated the highest prenatal parental reflective functioning scores. The results suggest that there is a need to differentiate among at-risk pregnant woman and that prenatal screening using the MAAS may help identify those who need preventive parenting interventions and what those interventions should focus on. A main limitation of the study is the lack of a representative group of at-risk pregnant women which limits the generalizability of the study results to all risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W3087513280,"In five experiments (N = 3,828), we investigate whether people prefer investment decisions to be made by human investment managers rather than by algorithms (""robos""). In all of the studies we investigate morally controversial companies, as it is plausible that a preference for humans as investment managers becomes exacerbated in areas where machines are less competent, such as morality. In Study 1, participants rated the permissibility of an algorithm to autonomously exclude morally controversial stocks from investment portfolios as lower than if a human fund manager did the same; this finding was not different if participants were informed that such exclusions might be financially disadvantageous for them. In Study 2, we show that this robo-investment aversion manifests itself both when considering investment in controversial and non-controversial industries. In Study 3, our findings show that robo-investment aversion is also present when algorithms are given the autonomy to increase investment in controversial stocks. In Studies 4 and 5, we investigate choices between actual humans and an algorithm. In Study 4 -which was incentivized-participants show no robo-investment aversion, but are significantly less likely to choose machines as investment managers for controversial stocks. In contrast, in Study 5 robo-investment aversion is present, but it is not different across controversial and non-controversial stocks. Overall, our findings show a considerable mean effect size for robo-investment aversion (d = -0.39 [-0.45, -0.32]). This suggests that algorithm aversion extends to the financial realm, supporting the existence of a barrier for the adoption of innovative financial technologies (FinTech)."
https://openalex.org/W3087195019,"Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task. However, for different data series, the performance of these models varies. Hepatitis E, as an acute liver disease, has been a major public health problem. Which model is more appropriate for predicting the incidence of hepatitis E? In this paper, three different methods are used and the performance of the three methods is compared.Autoregressive integrated moving average(ARIMA), support vector machine(SVM) and long short-term memory(LSTM) recurrent neural network were adopted and compared. ARIMA was implemented by python with the help of statsmodels. SVM was accomplished by matlab with libSVM library. LSTM was designed by ourselves with Keras, a deep learning library. To tackle the problem of overfitting caused by limited training samples, we adopted dropout and regularization strategies in our LSTM model. Experimental data were obtained from the monthly incidence and cases number of hepatitis E from January 2005 to December 2017 in Shandong province, China. We selected data from July 2015 to December 2017 to validate the models, and the rest was taken as training set. Three metrics were applied to compare the performance of models, including root mean square error(RMSE), mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) and mean absolute error(MAE).By analyzing data, we took ARIMA(1, 1, 1), ARIMA(3, 1, 2) as monthly incidence prediction model and cases number prediction model, respectively. Cross-validation and grid search were used to optimize parameters of SVM. Penalty coefficient C and kernel function parameter g were set 8, 0.125 for incidence prediction, and 22, 0.01 for cases number prediction. LSTM has 4 nodes. Dropout and L2 regularization parameters were set 0.15, 0.001, respectively. By the metrics of RMSE, we obtained 0.022, 0.0204, 0.01 for incidence prediction, using ARIMA, SVM and LSTM. And we obtained 22.25, 20.0368, 11.75 for cases number prediction, using three models. For MAPE metrics, the results were 23.5%, 21.7%, 15.08%, and 23.6%, 21.44%, 13.6%, for incidence prediction and cases number prediction, respectively. For MAE metrics, the results were 0.018, 0.0167, 0.011 and 18.003, 16.5815, 9.984, for incidence prediction and cases number prediction, respectively.Comparing ARIMA, SVM and LSTM, we found that nonlinear models(SVM, LSTM) outperform linear models(ARIMA). LSTM obtained the best performance in all three metrics of RSME, MAPE, MAE. Hence, LSTM is the most suitable for predicting hepatitis E monthly incidence and cases number."
https://openalex.org/W3085466981,"The COVID-19 outbreak has forced most of the global population to lock-down and has put in check the health services all over the world. Current predictive models are complex, region-dependent, and might not be generalized to other countries. However, a 150-year old epidemics law promulgated by William Farr might be useful as a simple arithmetical model (percent increase [R1] and acceleration [R2] of new cases and deaths) to provide a first sight of the epidemic behavior and to detect regions with high predicted dynamics. Thus, this study tested Farr’s Law assumptions by modeling COVID-19 data of new cases and deaths. COVID-19 data until April 10, 2020, was extracted from available countries, including income, urban index, and population characteristics. Farr’s law first (R1) and second ratio (R2) were calculated. We constructed epidemic curves and predictive models for the available countries and performed ecological correlation analysis between R1 and R2 with demographic data. We extracted data from 210 countries, and it was possible to estimate the ratios of 170 of them. Around 42·94% of the countries were in an initial acceleration phase, while 23·5% already crossed the peak. We predicted a reduction close to zero with wide confidence intervals for 56 countries until June 10 (high-income countries from Asia and Oceania, with strict political actions). There was a significant association between high R1 of deaths and high urban index. Farr’s law seems to be a useful model to give an overview of COVID-19 pandemic dynamics. The countries with high dynamics are from Africa and Latin America. Thus, this is a call to urgently prioritize actions in those countries to intensify surveillance, to re-allocate resources, and to build healthcare capacities based on multi-nation collaboration to limit onward transmission and to reduce the future impact on these regions in an eventual second wave."
https://openalex.org/W3087680880,"Background Education on exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) practices is usually given in the form of health talks by health workers (HWs). The need for HWs to be well-informed about cultural practices and misconceptions that act as barriers to EBF has been documented in literature. This information can guide HWs in developing interventions such as health talks which are culturally sensitive. However, this has not been explored from the perspectives of HWs in Ghana. In this paper, we report mothers’ and grandmothers’ misconceptions and cultural practices that are barriers to EBF in two rural districts in Ghana from the perspectives of Community Health Workers and Community Health Volunteers. Methods We used qualitative data collected in the Kwahu Afram Plains South and North Districts of Ghana through nine focus group discussions (FGDs) among HWs and followed the data saturation principle. All FGDs were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and translated from local dialects to English. The emerging themes were used in writing a narrative account, guided by the principles of the thematic analysis. Results Our main findings included mothers’ and grandmothers’ perceptions that HWs themselves do not practice EBF. Mothers had the perception that grandmothers did not practice EBF but their children grew well, and gestures of babies suggested their readiness to start eating. Misconceptions revealed included beliefs that breastmilk is watery in nature and does not satisfy infants. Another misconception was that babies gain weight faster when not exclusively breastfed but fed on infant formulas. A custom of giving corn flour mixed with water or light porridge during the first few days after birth to welcome newborns was also reported. Conclusions The reports of the HWs revealed that several socio-cultural factors and misconceptions of mothers and grandmothers negatively influence EBF practices of mothers. Findings from this study highlight the need for HWs to provide culturally appropriate counselling services on breastfeeding not only to mothers but also to grandmothers and fathers in order to promote EBF and reap its benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3087409649,"The Rho GTPase RAC1 is an important regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics, but the role of macrophage-specific RAC1 has not been explored during atherogenesis. We analyzed RAC1 expression in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques using immunofluorescence and found higher macrophage RAC1 expression in advanced plaques compared with intermediate human atherosclerotic plaques. We then produced mice with Rac1-deficient macrophages by breeding conditional floxed Rac1 mice (Rac1fl/fl) with mice expressing Cre from the macrophage-specific lysosome M promoter (LC). Atherosclerosis was studied in vivo by infecting Rac1fl/fl and Rac1fl/fl/LC mice with AdPCSK9 (adenoviral vector overexpressing proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). Rac1fl/fl/LC macrophages secreted lower levels of IL-6 and TNF-α and exhibited reduced foam cell formation and lipid uptake. The deficiency of Rac1 in macrophages reduced the size of aortic atherosclerotic plaques in AdPCSK9-infected Rac1fl/fl/LC mice. Compare with controls, intima/media ratios, the size of necrotic cores, and numbers of CD68-positive macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques were reduced in Rac1-deficient mice. Moreover, we found that RAC1 interacts with actin-binding filamin A. Macrophages expressed increased RAC1 levels in advanced human atherosclerosis. Genetic inactivation of RAC1 impaired macrophage function and reduced atherosclerosis in mice, suggesting that drugs targeting RAC1 may be useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis."

In order to identify stable reference genes to understand the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in winter rapeseed, internal reference genes of winter rapeseed under four abiotic stresses were analyzed using GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder software. The most stable combinations of internal reference genes were β-actin and SAND in cold-stressed leaves, β-actin and EF1a in cold-stressed roots, F-box and SAND in high temperature-stressed leaves, and PP2A and RPL in high temperature-stressed roots, SAND and PP2A in NaCl-stressed leaves, RPL and UBC in NaCl-stressed roots, RPL and PP2A in PEG-stressed leaves, and PP2A and RPL in PEG-stressed roots. Expression profiles of PXG3 were used to verify these results. The stable reference genes identified in this study are useful tools for identifying stress-responsive genes to understand the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in winter rapeseed."

ABET offers accreditation in the United States and other regions in the world that lack such entities such as Gulf Cooperative Counties (GCC). Though ABET accreditation is voluntary, graduates of the ABET-accredited programs are considered equivalent in knowledge, behaviors, and attitude with global standards. The process of ABET accreditation takes months or years depending upon the gap with readiness and resources. The objective of this study is to compile and prioritize the list of critical success factors (CSFs) to commit resources optimally for sustained academic quality assurance and ABET accreditation. The triangulation research designed has been employed. Firstly, the observation of the ABET accreditation process of multiple programs at King Khalid University (KKU) helped in identifying 11 CSFs in three categories namely Program design and execution, Quality culture and excellence, and Institutional infrastructure and support. Further, these CSFs have been explored in the literature in the area of ABET accreditation. Finally, the research employs a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (Fuzzy AHP) and full consistency method (FUCOM) to rank the relative importance of these CSFs and their dimensions for sustained academic quality assurance and ABET accreditation. The incorporation of these CSFs will help institutions in the GCC and other regions to get their academic programs ABET-accredited in an optimal manner."
https://openalex.org/W3087159320,"Background Adherence to the best standards of nursing practice is the fundamental principle to improve patient outcome and prevent nursing procedure related-infections. A peripheral venous catheter (PVC) is the most common invasive procedure performed in nursing care. Its poor performance could expose patients to bloodstream-related infections. The present study aimed to assess post-basic nursing students’ knowledge of evidence-based guidelines on the management of peripheral venous catheters. Methods A cross-sectional study design was conducted on May 01–03, 2019, using a convenient sample 239 among post-basic nursing students in Wollega University. Results The study result showed that nursing students’ had a low mean (4.1±1.52) of knowledge about PVC procedure management. Only 41% of the respondents have adhered to recommendations of CDC guidelines. Among the provided options of the items, none achieved 100% correct answers. The majority of nursing students (77%) responded that antiseptic handwashing is always performed before insertion of PVCs. Meanwhile, few students (5%) correctly answered that the infusion set is recommended to be removed after 96 hours when neither lipids nor blood products are administered. In multivariable regression analysis, nursing students who had received training (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI (1.6, 5.1)) and who were younger (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI (1.3, 4.3)) significantly associated with a higher score of knowledge. Conclusions This study finding shows that an overall level of knowledge of post-basic nursing students is inadequate. Measurements such as an increase in the provision of adequate training by nurses educators based on evidence-based guidelines could improve the post-basic nursing students’ knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3087652147,"Actigraphs are wrist-worn devices that record tri-axial accelerometry data used clinically and in research studies. The expense of research-grade actigraphs, however, limit their widespread adoption, especially in clinical settings. Tri-axial accelerometer-based consumer wearable devices have gained worldwide popularity and hold potential for a cost-effective alternative. The lack of independent validation of minute-to-minute accelerometer data with polysomnographic data or even research-grade actigraphs, as well as access to raw data has hindered the utility and acceptance of consumer-grade actigraphs.Sleep clinic patients wore a consumer-grade wearable (Huami Arc) on their non-dominant wrist while undergoing an overnight polysomnography (PSG) study. The sample was split into two, 20 in a training group and 21 in a testing group. In addition to the Arc, the testing group also wore a research-grade actigraph (Philips Actiwatch Spectrum). Sleep was scored for each 60-s epoch on both devices using the Cole-Kripke algorithm.Based on analysis of our training group, Arc and PSG data were aligned best when a threshold of 10 units was used to examine the Arc data. Using this threshold value in our testing group, the Arc has an accuracy of 90.3%±4.3%, sleep sensitivity (or wake specificity) of 95.5%±3.5%, and sleep specificity (wake sensitivity) of 55.6%±22.7%. Compared to PSG, Actiwatch has an accuracy of 88.7%±4.5%, sleep sensitivity of 92.6%±5.2%, and sleep specificity of 60.5%±20.2%, comparable to that observed in the Arc.An optimized sleep/wake threshold value was identified for a consumer-grade wearable Arc trained by PSG data. By applying this sleep/wake threshold value for Arc generated accelerometer data, when compared to PSG, sleep and wake estimates were adequate and comparable to those generated by a clinical-grade actigraph. As with other actigraphs, sleep specificity plateaus due to limitations in distinguishing wake without movement from sleep. Further studies are needed to evaluate the Arc's ability to differentiate between sleep and wake using other sources of data available from the Arc, such as high resolution accelerometry and photoplethysmography."
https://openalex.org/W3087264731,"The objective of this study is to provide thermal conductivity data for CPA-based nanofluids for the benefit of the analyses of cryopreservation by vitrification. Thermal conductivity measurements were conducted using a hot-wire technique on an experimentation platform of the cryomacroscope, to correlate measurements with observed physical effects such as crystallization and fracturing. Tested materials in this study include the CPA cocktails M22, VS55, DP6, and DP6+sucrose. Nanofluids in this study include the above CPA cocktails as base solutions, when mixed with either iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONP) or silica-coated iron-oxide nanoparticles (sIONP). Results of this study demonstrated the addition of sIONP to any of the CPA cocktails tested did not significantly affect its thermal conductivity, its tendency to vitrify or, conversely, its tendency to form rewarming phase crystallization (RPC). Fractures were observed with cryomacroscopy at the onset of rewarming for DP6+sIONP under carefully controlled rewarming conditions without RF activation, despite the inherent opacity of the sIONP solutions. It is likely that using RF heating in order to accelerate rewarming while unifying the temperature distribution would prevent fracture and RPC. However, sIONP were not activated in this study, as the RF heating mechanism would interfere with thermal conductivity measurements. The addition of IONP to DP6 appears to hinder the tendency of the CPA to vitrify, which is a detrimental effect. But it is unlikely that uncoated nanoparticle solutions will be used in practical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3087698673,"To better understand the occurrence of major changes in people´s lives like job changes or relocations, we test a model of motivational consequences of life and domain satisfaction using data of the German socio-economic panel study (SOEP) (waves 2005–2015; Ns between 2,201 and 28,720). We examined job and location changes as outcomes that people may actively initiate as a result of dissatisfaction with these domains. One of our results indicates that for similar levels of job satisfaction, individuals with higher levels of life satisfaction were more likely to report a subsequent job change, presumably because they possess necessary resources to actively initiate such a major life change. The patterns were similar for relocation satisfaction and subsequent relocation, but not all effects were significant. Generally, the effects of life satisfaction and domain satisfaction on life events were independent of affective well-being. Contrary to what we expected based on life-span theories, perceived control did not significantly moderate the tested mechanisms. These findings furthermore show that examining life satisfaction and domain satisfaction in isolation can lead to theoretically and empirically false conclusions. Contrary to previous research, high life satisfaction appears to not be a general driver for stability but rather should be seen as an indicator of resourcefulness that allows people to strive for changes in specific life domains."

Ninety-eight molars with occlusal caries were used. In the control group the specimens were kept in distilled water. In the GSE group, the specimens were immersed in 6.5% grape seed extract solution for 30 minutes. In the SDF group, the specimens were immersed in 30% SDF solution for 4 minutes. In the GSE+SDF group, the specimens were immersed in 6.5% grape seed extract solution for 30 minutes and then exposed to 30% SDF solution for 4 minutes. All the groups underwent pH cycling model for 8 days. Microhardness measurements were taken at the baseline before surface treatments and after pH cycling. Elastic modulus was measured, after pH cycling. In the control group, the final hardness was significantly lower than the initial hardness (P = 0.001). In the SDF group, the final hardness was significantly higher than the initial hardness (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the initial and final hardness values in the GSE and GSE + SDF groups (p = 0.92, p = 0.07). The H1-H0 in the SDF group was significantly higher than the other groups (P<0.05). Moreover, elastic modulus of the experimental groups except GSE+SDF group was significantly higher than control. The highest mean elastic modulus was detected in the SDF group (P<0.001). The use of SDF and GSE prior to the acid challenge improved mechanical properties. Microstructural investigation, using scanning electron microscope showed dentin structure protection against acid challenges with SDF treatment and collagen matrix stabilization with GSE treatment. However combined use of these agents was not beneficious."
https://openalex.org/W3087403220,"Objective Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker for cerebral small vessel disease. Existing CMBs and those that newly develop are associated with the risks of stroke incidence and recurrence. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of oral anticoagulant (OAC) use and the development of new CMBs in cardioembolic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. Subjects and methods We prospectively followed cardioembolic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation who had been hospitalized in the stroke center of our hospital, had been prescribed anticoagulants at discharge, and underwent repeated brain MRI with an interval of at least one year from the baseline MRI. Assessing the presence, number and location of CMBs using T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo MRI, we used logistic regression models to investigate the associations between OAC use and the incidence of new CMBs. We also examined associations of subsequent stroke with OACs and CMBs during the follow-up. Results A total of 81 patients, consisting of 45 patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and 36 patients receiving warfarin (WF), were analyzed in the present study. Baseline CMBs were observed in 19/81 patients (23.5%) and new CMBs in 18/81 patients (22.2%) on follow-up MRI (median interval, 34 months). Of the 31 new CMBs, 25 (80.6%) developed in the lobar location and 6 (19.4%) in the deep or infratentorial location. New CMBs occurred in 4 patients (10.0%) taking DOACs alone, in 10 patients (35.7%) taking WF alone, in 3 patients (37.5%) taking WF plus antiplatelet agents and in 1 patient (20.0%) taking DOAC plus antiplatelet agent. Regarding location, the new CMBs were the lobar type in 7 of the 10 patients taking WF alone, as well as in 3 of the 4 patients taking DOACs alone. In multivariate analysis, the presence of CMBs at baseline and WF use (vs. DOAC use) were associated with new CMBs (CMB presence at baseline: OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.19–14.44; WF use: OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.02–11.42). The presence of ≥ 2 CMBs at baseline was related to a higher risk of subsequent stroke (OR 7.25, 95% CI 1.01–52.35, P = 0.048). Conclusion Our findings suggest that DOAC compared with WF use at discharge is associated with a lower incidence of new CMBs in cardioembolic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. Further prospective studies in the clinical setting are needed to confirm our exploratory data."
https://openalex.org/W3087638563,"Iron (Fe) deficiency is a common challenge in crop production. Screening and research of Fe-efficient cultivars could alleviate plant stress and increase crop yields in Fe-deficient soils. In the present study, we conducted two hydroponic culture experiments with a control (100 μmol/L Fe3+-EDTA) and low Fe treatment (10 μmol/L Fe3+-EDTA) to study the morphological and physiological mechanisms of response to low Fe stress in maize hybrids seedlings. In the first experiment, we investigated 32 major maize hybrids in Southwest China. We found that six of them, including Zhenghong 2 (ZH 2), were Fe-efficient. Fifteen other cultivars, such as Chuandan 418 (CD 418), were Fe-inefficient. In the second experiment, we investigated the Fe-efficient ZH 2 and Fe-inefficient CD 418 cultivars and found that low Fe stress resulted in significant decreases in root volume, root length, number of root tips, root surface area, and root dry weight, and increased root to shoot ratio, average root diameter, and Fe-dissolution ability per mass of roots in both maize cultivars. However, the increase in Fe-dissolution ability per mass of roots in ZH 2 was higher than that in CD 418, whereas for the other measurements, the low Fe stress-induced changes in ZH 2 were less pronounced than in CD 418. Therefore, under low Fe stress, the above-mentioned growth factors in ZH 2 were higher by 54.84%, 121.46%, 107.67%, 83.96%, 140.00%, and 18.16%, respectively, than those in CD 418. In addition, leaf area, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, soluble protein content, and Catalase (CAT) and Peroxidase (POD) activities in ZH 2 were higher by 274.95%, 113.95%, 223.60%, 56.04%, 17.01% and 21.13% than those in CD 418. Therefore, compared with the Fe-inefficient cultivar (CD 418), the Fe-efficient cultivar (ZH 2) had a more developed root system and greater Fe absorption capacity per mass of roots under low iron stress, promoted the efficient absorption of Fe, maintained a higher photosynthetic area and photosynthetic rate, thereby facilitating the accumulation of photosynthetic products. Moreover, higher soluble protein content and activities of CAT and POD permitted high osmotic regulation and scavenging ability, which is an important physiological mechanism for ZH 2 adaptation to low Fe stress."
https://openalex.org/W3087640253,"The melanosome is a specialized membrane-bound organelle that is involved in melanin synthesis, storage, and transportation. In contrast to melanosome biogenesis, the processes underlying melanosome degradation remain largely unknown. Autophagy is a process that promotes degradation of intracellular components' cooperative process between autophagosomes and lysosomes, and its role for process of melanosome degradation remains unclear. Here, we assessed the regulation of autophagy and its contributions to depigmentation associated with Melasolv (3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamate thymol ester). B16F1 cells-treated with Melasolv suppressed the α-MSH-stimulated increase of melanin content and resulted in the activation of autophagy. However, introduction of bafilomycin A1 strongly suppressed melanosome degradation in Melasolv-treated cells. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by ATG5 resulted in significant suppression of Melasolv-mediated depigmentation in α-MSH-treated cells. Taken together, our results suggest that treatment with Melasolv inhibits skin pigmentation by promoting melanosome degradation via autophagy activation."
https://openalex.org/W3087749938,"Even if shared mobility services are encouraged by transportation policies, they remain underused and inefficient transportation modes because they struggle to find their customer base. This paper aims to estimate the potential demand for such services by focusing on individual trips and determining the number of passengers who perform similar trips. Contrary to existing papers, this study focuses on the demand without assuming any specific shared mobility system. The experiment performed on data coming from New York City conducts to cluster more than 85% of the trips. Consequently, shared mobility services such as ride-sharing can find their customer base and, at a long time, to a significantly reduce the number of cars flowing in the city. After a detailed analysis, commonalities in the clusters are identified: regular patterns from one day to the next exist in shared mobility demand. This regularity makes it possible to anticipate the potential shared mobility demand to help transportation suppliers to optimize their operations."
https://openalex.org/W3087244149,"Background Combined pulmonary fibrosis with emphysema (CPFE) is a clinically meaningful syndrome characterized by coexisting upper-lobe emphysema and lower-lobe interstitial fibrosis. However, ambiguous diagnostic criteria and, particularly, the absence of objective methods to quantify emphysematous/fibrotic lesions in patients with CPFE confound the interpretation of the pathophysiology of this syndrome. We analyzed the relationship between objectively quantified computed tomography (CT) measurements and the results of pulmonary function testing (PFT) and clinical events in CPFE patients. Materials and methods We enrolled 46 CPFE patients who underwent CT and PFT. The extent of emphysematous lesions was obtained by calculating the percent of low attenuation area (%LAA). The extent of fibrotic lesions was calculated as the percent of high attenuation area (%HAA). %LAA and %HAA values were combined to yield the percent of abnormal area (%AA). We assessed the relationships between CT parameters and other clinical indices, including PFT results. Multivariate analysis was performed to examine the association between the CT parameters and clinical events. Results A greater negative correlation with percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO %predicted) existed for %AA (r = -0.73, p < 0.001) than for %LAA or %HAA alone. The %HAA value was inversely correlated with percent predicted forced vital capacity (r = -0.48, p < 0.001), percent predicted total lung capacity (r = -0.48, p < 0.01), and DLCO %predicted (r = -0.47, p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that %AA showed the strongest association with hospitalization events (odds ratio = 1.20, 95% confidence interval = 1.01–1.54, p = 0.029). Conclusion Quantitative CT measurements reflected deterioration in pulmonary function and were associated with hospitalization in patients with CPFE. This approach could serve as a useful method to determine the extent of lung morphology, pathophysiology, and the clinical course of patients with CPFE."
https://openalex.org/W3087593285,"To meet increasing demands to train neuroendovascular techniques, we developed a dedicated simulator applying individualized three-dimensional intracranial aneurysm models ('HANNES'; Hamburg Anatomic Neurointerventional Endovascular Simulator). We hypothesized that HANNES provides a realistic and reproducible training environment to practice coil embolization and to exemplify disparities between neurointerventionalists, thus objectively benchmarking operators at different levels of experience.Six physicians with different degrees of neurointerventional procedural experience were recruited into a standardized training protocol comprising catheterization of two internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms and one basilar tip aneurysm, followed by introduction of one framing coil into each aneurysm and finally complete coil embolization of one determined ICA aneurysm. The level of difficulty increased with every aneurysm. Fluoroscopy was recorded and assessed for procedural characteristics and adverse events.Physicians were divided into inexperienced and experienced operators, depending on their experience with microcatheter handling. Mean overall catheterization times increased with difficulty of the aneurysm model. Inexperienced operators showed longer catheterization times (median; IQR: 47; 30-84s) than experienced operators (21; 13-58s, p = 0.011) and became significantly faster during the course of the attempts (rho = -0.493, p = 0.009) than the experienced physicians (rho = -0.318, p = 0.106). Number of dangerous maneuvers throughout all attempts was significantly higher for inexperienced operators (median; IQR: 1.0; 0.0-1.5) as compared to experienced operators (0.0; 0.0-1.0, p = 0.014).HANNES represents a modular neurointerventional training environment for practicing aneurysm coil embolization in vitro. Objective procedural metrics correlate with operator experience, suggesting that the system could be useful for assessing operator proficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3086183550,"It has been shown that readers spend a great deal of time skim reading on the Web and that this type of reading can affect lexical processing of words. Across two experiments, we utilised eye tracking methodology to explore how hyperlinks and navigating webpages affect reading behaviour. In Experiment 1, participants read static Webpages either for comprehension or whilst skim reading, while in Experiment 2, participants additionally read through a navigable Web environment. Embedded target words were either hyperlinks or not and were either high-frequency or low-frequency words. Results from Experiment 1 show that while readers lexically process both linked and unlinked words when reading for comprehension, readers only fully lexically process linked words when skim reading, as was evidenced by a frequency effect that was absent for the unlinked words. They did fully lexically process both linked and unlinked words when reading for comprehension. In Experiment 2, which allowed for navigating, readers only fully lexically processed linked words compared to unlinked words, regardless of whether they were skim reading or reading for comprehension. We suggest that readers engage in an efficient reading strategy where they attempt to minimise comprehension loss while maintaining a high reading speed. Readers use hyperlinks as markers to suggest important information and use them to navigate through the text in an efficient and effective way. The task of reading on the Web causes readers to lexically process words in a markedly different way from typical reading experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3087022455,"The purpose of this study was to examine how different threshold ranges of online-bandwidth visual feedback influence unilateral force control capabilities in healthy young women.Twenty-five right-handed young women (mean±standard deviation age = 23.6±1.5 years) participated in this study. Participants unilaterally executed hand-grip force control tasks with their dominant and non-dominant hands, respectively. Each participant completed four experimental blocks in a different order of block presentation for each hand condition: (a) 10% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) with ±5% bandwidth threshold range (BTR), (b) 10% of MVC with ±10% BTR, (c) 40% of MVC with ±5% BTR, and (d) 40% of MVC with ±10% BTR. Outcome measures on force control capabilities included: (a) force accuracy, (b) force variability, (c) force regularity, and (d) the number of times and duration out of BTR.The non-dominant hand showed significant improvements in force control capabilities, as indicated by higher force accuracy, less force variability, and decreased force regularity from ±10% BTR to ±5% BTR during higher targeted force level task. For both hands, the number of times and duration out of BTR increased from ±10% BTR to ±5% BTR.The current findings suggested that the narrow threshold range of online-bandwidth visual feedback effectively revealed transient improvements in unilateral isometric force control capabilities during higher targeted force level tasks."
https://openalex.org/W3087454941,"Turn-on fluorescent probes show enhanced emission upon DNA binding, advocating their importance in imaging cellular DNA. We have probed the DNA binding mode of thiazole-coumarin (TC) conjugate, a recently reported hemicyanine-based turn-on red fluorescent probe, using a number of biophysical techniques and a series of short oligonucleotides. TC exhibited increased fluorescence anisotropy and decreased absorbance (~50%) at low [DNA]/[TC] ratio. Although the observed hypochromicity and the saturating value of [DNA base pair]:[TC] ratio is consistent with a previous study that suggested intercalation to be the DNA binding mode of TC, a distinctly different and previously unreported binding mode was observed at higher ratios of [DNA]:[TC]. With further addition of DNA, only oligonucleotides containing AnTn or (AT)n stretches showed further change-decreased hypochromicity, red shifted absorption peaks and concomitant fluorescence enhancement, saturating at about 1:1 [DNA]: [TC]. 1H-NMR chemical shift perturbation patterns and H1'-H6/H8 NOE cross-peaks of the 1:1 complex indicated minor groove binding by TC. ITC showed the 1:1 DNA binding event to be endothermic (ΔH° ~ 2 kcal/mol) and entropy driven (ΔS° ~ 32 cal/mol/K). Taken together, the experimental data suggest a dual DNA binding mode by TC. At low [DNA]/[TC] ratio, the dominant mode is intercalation. This switches to minor groove binding at higher [DNA]/[TC], only for sequences containing AnTn or (AT)n stretches. Turn-on fluorescence results only in the previously unreported minor groove bound state. Our results allow a better understanding of DNA-ligand interaction for the newly reported turn-on probe TC."

The study was carried out in two phases: (1) adaptation of the questionnaire into Spanish. (2) Cross-sectional study in a sample of 626 nursing students. Psychometric properties were analyzed in terms of reliability and construct validity by confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the one-dimensional model is acceptable for both scales (presence and importance). The results show that the participants' scores can be calculated and interpreted for the general factor and also for the four subscales. Cronbach's alpha and the Omega Index were also suitable for all the scales and for each of the dimensions. The Educational Practices Questionnaire is a simple and easy-to-administer tool to measure how nursing degree students perceive the presence and importance of best educational practices."
https://openalex.org/W3087178122,"Background Recent studies have found hypomagnesemia is linked to a heightened risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients; however, the level of serum magnesium (s-Mg) necessary for promoting overall health in these patients and the effects of s-Mg in diabetes HD patients remains to be clarified. Methods HD outpatients (n = 148 under, age ≤ 70 y) were followed over a 6-y period. They were divided into four groups according to their average s-Mg during the first year (L; low level, H; high level) and if they had DM or not (non-DM). The endpoint was mortality and hospitalization for decline of Activities of Daily Living (death/hospitalization). A receiver operating characteristics curve was used in diagnostic tests to identify s-Mg associated with this endpoint. Kaplan–Meier, log-rank test, and a Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate prognoses. Fisher's exact test and multiple regressions examined the causes of the endpoints between the four groups and the factors predictive of s-Mg. Results s-Mg at 2.7 mg/dL was associated with death/hospitalization. The 5-y survival rate was 38.1%, 86.7%, 73.2% and 87.5%, in the DM/Mg(L), DM/Mg(H), non-DM/Mg(L) and non-DM/Mg(H) groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazards model showed significantly lower risk in other groups compared with that in the DM/Mg(L) group [DM/Mg(H); hazard ratio (HR): 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05–0.97, P = 0.046, non-DM/Mg(L); HR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.15–0.68, P = 0.003, non-DM/Mg(H); HR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.06–0.44, P < 0.001]. The frequency of the different causes of the endpoints for each group was not significant; s-Mg only associated with age in the DM group. Conclusions s-Mg greater than 2.7 mg/dL associated with a favorable prognosis in HD patients with DM, suggesting that s-Mg is a factor independent of diabetes."

Food consumption was assessed from regular consumption (five or more times a week) of healthy eating markers (beans; vegetables; fruit) and unhealthy eating markers (sweets; soft drinks; fried salty snacks). For sociodemographic variables, we considered macro regions; age; race/ skin color; gender; school administrative status. We assessed these markers trends for the population and, additionally, the analyses were stratified by gender, race/ skin color, and school administrative status. Statistical significance of the temporal trends was assessed by linear regression model.Over six years, three types of change in Brazilian adolescents' diet were observed: decreasing regular consumption of beans, sweets and soft drinks, increasing regular consumption of vegetables, and stable consumption of fruit and fried salty snacks.Brazilian adolescents' diet composition has changed in a short period, and therefore it is necessary to monitor it to propose actions aimed at this public."

Cases and controls were followed up until 12 months of age to assess anthropometry, hearing and neurodevelopmental outcomes.Thirty-four (73.9%) cCMV cases and 74 (88.1%) controls, completed all assessments at 12 months age. At 12 months, one cCMV case had died, none of the children in either group had SNHL and neurodevelopmental delay was present in a similar percentage of cCMV cases (n = 2; 6%) and controls (n = 1, 4%; OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.04-27.84, p = 0.958). Anthropometry did not differ between cases and controls overall throughout the follow up period. HIV-exposed cases had smaller head circumference for age at 6 and 12 months when compared with HIV-exposed controls.By 12 months of age, there was no evidence of a difference in neurological sequelae between cCMV infected South African children and cCMV uninfected children in this study.

https://openalex.org/W3087550825,"In biomedical science and clinical practice, an estimation of the stable frozen zone volume and distribution of concentration fields of injected diagnostic and healing solutions in the tissues of living organisms is of great importance and does not currently have any mathematical solution aimed at its precise evaluation.The aim of this research is the estimation of the stable frozen zone volume at ultra-low temperatures as well as the distribution of temperature areas and concentration fields of injected diagnostic and healing substances in vitro. The results can improve our understanding of the stable frozen zone volume and the extent of contrast for a therapeutic substance.A cryogenic zone (ice ball) was generated at -180°C using liquid nitrogen without any difficulties in vitro. The effects of freeze-thaw processes using ultra-low temperature and the cryogenic response of a 1.5% gelatin solution in water (%g/v) kept at a constant temperature of 20°C and continuously stirred were mathematically analyzed. The stable frozen zone volume was illustrated in vitro and measured in terms of its length, depth and cryogenic margin using a standard medical ruler and Vernier caliper after a freezing period at -180°C, using liquid nitrogen to provide cooling and freezing of a small portion of this solution in the vessel at room temperature (20°C). Round-shaped cryoprobes with diameters of 15 mm and 50 mm were applied to create a frozen zone volume in vitro. A single cryoprobe was used per procedure. The sample exposure time was 3 min. After this time, the volume of the frozen region remains unchanged, which indicates that the equilibrium stationary state has been reached. The experimental design, cryogenic procedure and freeze-thaw processes of the hemisphere were described and illustrated in vitro item by item. The statistical analysis manifested significant differences that were found between the 50 mm and 15 mm cryoprobes with regards to the freezing diameter, depth, and cryogenic margin (P < 0.001).An illustrated analytical mathematical solution of equations determined the stable frozen zone volume and the radius of the sphere of the frozen medium in the equilibrium stationary state. The resulting assessment provided the basis for the creation of mini- and micro-cryoprobes as well as cryoneedles for local tissue freezing in living biological structures. A solution to the equations was obtained under the boundary conditions with a set stable temperature value on the boundary surface of the cryoprobe as well as at the surface well-away from it, where the temperature is equal to the stable temperature of the environment. For example, this solution gives that in the case of a hemispherical cryoprobe radius of 1 mm, the frozen zone volume was more than three orders of magnitude greater than the volume of the cryoprobe itself and was equal to approximately 4 cm3. The determination of the fractal dimension can consider the individual characteristics of the spread of the contrast medium or therapeutic substance(s) in living tissue. Based on fractal theory, our innovative mathematical formulas allow for the assessment of the effective distribution of contrast medium in living biological structures, specifically for tissues assessed for diagnostic purposes, and they enable the selection of an optimal treatment strategy in medical practice.A simple mathematical approach to solving the problems of assessing the stable frozen zone volume and distribution of temperature areas and concentration fields of injected diagnostic and healing substances in living biological structures, particularly living tissue in vitro, is presented in this study. The expressed quantitative mathematical formulas determine the stable stationary frozen zone volume and provide the basis for the creation of mini- and micro-cryoprobes. The application of fractal theory is proposed for assessing the distribution efficiency of contrast medium and therapeutic substance(s) in living biological structures for diagnostic purposes and for selecting a compassionate treatment strategy in medical professional practice."
https://openalex.org/W3087633992,"The role of smoking as a risk factor for group B streptococcal (GBS) colonization in women during pregnancy has not been previously adequately explored. We hypothesized that women of term or near term neonates who smoked during pregnancy were more likely to have GBS colonization than their non-smoking counterparts.The electronic health records (EHRs) of a convenience sample of women delivering in an inner-city university tertiary care center were reviewed. The outcome variable of interest was maternal GBS colonization during pregnancy. The primary independent variable of interest was tobacco smoking during pregnancy, determined from the EHRs by the number of cigarettes smoked during gestation. Descriptive statistics were conducted and categorical data were compared by the Fischer's exact test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was further conducted to determine the independent impact of tobacco smoke exposure on GBS colonization.The prevalence of maternal GBS colonization was 35% among the study population. In the univariate analyses, factors associated with maternal GBS colonization were tobacco smoking during pregnancy (P of trend <0.001), Race (P<0.001), maternal age <20 years (P = 0.006), low birthweight <2500 gm (P = 0.020), maternal drug use (P = 004), and gestational age <37 (P = 0.041). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, tobacco smoking during pregnancy remained the most significant predictor of GBS colonization. Women who smoked during pregnancy were more than twice more likely to be colonized than their non-smoking counterparts (OR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.5-4.6; p<0.001). Maternal age was the only other significant predictor with younger mothers more than one and a half time more likely to be colonized than their older counterparts (OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.02-2.68; P = 0.04).The prevalence of GBS colonization in this institution was consistent with recent national rates. Smoking and maternal age were identified as two independent risk factors for GBS colonization during pregnancy. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3087707520,"The frequent contact people have with liquids containing pathogenic microorganisms provides opportunities for disease transmission. In this work, we quantified the transfer of bacteria—using E. coli as a model- from liquid to skin, estimated liquid retention on the skin after different contact activities (hand immersion, wet-cloth and wet-surface contact), and estimated liquid transfer following hand-to-mouth contacts. The results of our study show that the number of E. coli transferred to the skin per surface area (n [E. coli/cm2]) can be modeled using n = C (10−3.38+h), where C [E. coli/cm3] is the concentration of E. coli in the liquid, and h [cm] is the film thickness of the liquid retained on the skin. Findings from the E. coli transfer experiments reveal a significant difference between the transfer of E. coli from liquid to the skin and the previously reported transfer of viruses to the skin. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the time elapsed since the interaction significantly influences liquid retention, therefore modulating the risks associated with human interaction with contaminated liquids. The findings enhance our understanding of liquid-mediated disease transmission processes and provide quantitative estimates as inputs for microbial risk assessments."
https://openalex.org/W3087762130,"Peperomia pellucida (PP) belongs to the Peperomia genus, which has a pantropic distribution. PP is used to treat a wide range of symptoms and diseases, such as pain, inflammation, and hypertension. Intriguingly, PP extract is used by different tropical countries for its anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects. In fact, these outcomes have been shown in animal models, though the exact bioactive products of PP that exert such results are yet to be discovered. To determine and elucidate the mechanism of action of one of these compounds, we evaluated the antinociceptive effect of the novel dimeric ArC2 compound, Pellucidin A by using in vivo and in silico models. Animals were then subjected to chemical, biphasic and thermal models of pain. Pellucidin A induced an antinociceptive effect against chemical-induced pain in mice, demonstrated by the decrease of the number of writhes, reaching a reduction of 43% and 65% in animals treated with 1 and 5 mg/kg of Pellucidin A, respectively. In the biphasic response (central and peripheral), animals treated with Pellucidin A showed a significant reduction of the licking time exclusively during the second phase (inflammatory phase). In the hot-plate test, Pellucidin A did not have any impact on the latency time of the treated animals. Moreover, in vivo and in silico results show that Pellucidin A's mechanism of action in the inflammatory pain occurs most likely through interaction with the nitric oxide (NO) pathway. Our results demonstrate that the antinociceptive activities of Pellucidin A operate under mechanism(s) of peripheral action, involving inflammatory mediators. This work provides insightful novel evidence of the biological properties of Pellucidin A, and leads to a better understanding of its mechanism of action, pointing to potential pharmacological use."
https://openalex.org/W3087113781,"Attractor neural networks such as the Hopfield model can be used to model associative memory. An efficient associative memory should be able to store a large number of patterns which must all be stable. We study in detail the meaning and definition of stability of network states. We reexamine the meanings of retrieval, recognition and recall and assign precise mathematical meanings to each of these terms. We also examine the relation between them and how they relate to memory capacity of the network. We have shown earlier in this journal that orthogonalization scheme provides an effective way of overcoming catastrophic interference that limits the memory capacity of the Hopfield model. It is not immediately apparent whether the improvement made by orthgonalization affects the processes of retrieval, recognition and recall equally. We show that this influence occurs to different degrees and hence affects the relations between them. We then show that the conditions for pattern stability can be split into a necessary condition (recognition) and a sufficient one (recall). We interpret in cognitive terms the information being stored in the Hopfield model and also after it is orthogonalized. We also study the alterations in the network dynamics of the Hopfield network upon the introduction of orthogonalization, and their effects on the efficiency of the network as an associative memory."
https://openalex.org/W3087295223,"Despite evidence of possible patient harm and substantial costs, medication overuse is persistent. Patient reaction is one potential barrier to deprescribing, but little research has assessed this in specific instances of medication discontinuation. We sought to understand Veteran and provider experience when de-implementing guideline-discordant use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in those with mild-to-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).We conducted a mixed-methods analysis in a provider-randomized quality improvement project testing a proactive electronic-consultation from pulmonologists recommending ICS discontinuation when appropriate. PCPs at two Veterans Health Administration healthcare systems were included. We completed interviews with 16 unexposed providers and 6 intervention-exposed providers. We interviewed 9 patients within 3 months after their PCP proposed ICS discontinuation. We conducted inductive and deductive content analysis of qualitative data to explore an emergent theme of patient reaction. Forty-eight PCPs returned surveys (24 exposed and 24 unexposed, response rate: 35%).The unexposed providers anticipated their patients might resist ICS discontinuation because it seems counterintuitive to stop something that is working, patient's fear of worsening symptoms, or if the prescription was initiated by another provider. Intervention-exposed providers reported similar experiences in post-intervention interviews. Unexposed providers anticipated that patients may accept ICS discontinuation, citing tactical use of patient-centered care strategies. This was echoed by intervention-exposed providers who had successfully discontinued an ICS. Veterans reported acceding to their providers out of trust or deference to their advanced training, even after describing an ICS as a 'security blanket'. Our survey findings supported the subthemes from our interviews. Among providers who proposed discontinuation of an ICS, 76% reported that they were able to discontinue it or switch to another more appropriate medication.While PCPs anticipated that patients would resist discontinuing an ICS, interviews with patient and intervention-exposed PCPs along with surveys suggest that patients were receptive to this change."
https://openalex.org/W3087636983,"Desvenlafaxine (DES) and Alprazolam (ALP) are the drugs commonly prescribed together for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorders (MDD). A literature survey revealed, there is no method for the simultaneous determination of these two drugs. The purpose of this research was to develop and validate a simple, accurate, precise, robust, and isocratic RP-HPLC method for simultaneous determination of DES and ALP in human spiked plasma using UV-detector in short analysis time. The method utilized Hypersil BDS C18 (250 mm×4.6 mm, 5 μm) through an isocratic mode of elution using HPLC grade acetonitrile and 0.02M KH2PO4 buffer (65:35) and 0.1% Tri Fluoro Acetic acid (TFA) with pH 4.00 adjusted with 1M KOH. The flow rate was 1.00 mLmin-1 and elution of the drugs was monitored at 230nm. The elution time of DES and ALP was 4.011 and 5.182 minutes respectively. The method was linear for the concentration range 10-150 μgmL-1 for DES and 5.0-75.0 μgmL-1 for ALP. According to the validation results, the method is sensitive with Limit of Detection (LOD) 4.740 μgmL-1 and Limit of Quantification (LOQ) of 14.365 μgmL-1 for DES and LOD 1.891 μgmL-1 & LOQ 5.730 μgmL-1 for ALP. The reproducibility of results with minute deliberate variations in method parameters has proven that the method is robust. The data from stability studies show a non-significant change in drugs solutions for 2 months. The optimized method was validated as per International Conference for Harmonisation (ICH) Q2(R1) guidelines. This method can be used for the estimation of DES and ALP in plasma and can evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters of both drugs simultaneously."

In this paper, a method for the construction of a 3D model of a potato tuber-root system is proposed, based on determining the characterization parameters of the potato tuber-root model. Three early maturing potato varieties, widely planted in Northeast China, were selected as the research objects. Their topological and geometric structures were analyzed to determine the model parameters. By actually digging potatoes in the field, field data measurement and statistical analysis of the parameters were performed, and a model parameter database was established. Based on the measured data, the root trajectory points were obtained by simulating the growth of the root tips. Then MATLAB was used to develop a system that would complete the construction of the potato tuber-root 3D visualization model. Finally, the accuracy of the model was verified experimentally. Case studies for the three different types indicated an acceptable performance of the proposed model, with a relative root mean square error of 6.81% and 15.32%, for the minimum and maximum values, respectively. The research results can be used to explore the interaction between the soil-tuber-root aggregates and the digging components, and provide a reference for the construction of root models of other tuber crops."

However, little is known about the effect of individual field margin components such as ditches, grass strips, shrubs and trees, and the overall margin's complexity, on the vegetation composition and its functional effect and response traits.This paper reports on the effects of field margin component typology (ditches, grass strips, shrubs, trees, and vehicle tracks) and complexity (the number of components), on the herbaceous vegetation of field margins. Forty field margins were sampled in 2016 in a 200 ha. organic mixed arable livestock farm.The factor which was identified as having the most effect on vegetation composition was adjacent land-use type, which reflected the margins' management regime. However, field margin components were found to affect vegetation response and effect traits. Tree components had less grassweeds than vehicle tracks while more complex field margins also had less grassweeds than simple field margins near cropped fields, most likely due to the lower availability in light and less disturbance from vehicles. Simple grassy margins produced a high proportion of hymenoptera flowers.These results highlight the importance of field margin components in maintaining a high diversity of vegetation typologies differing in effect traits that are relevant for the provisioning of ecosystem services, such as supporting pollen and nectar requirements of beneficial insects, as well as their importance in determining the presence of weed species that could potentially invade the cropped fields."
https://openalex.org/W3087065026,"Feed efficiency (FE) is a key trait in pig production, as improvement in FE has positive economic and environmental impact. FE is a complex phenotype and testing animals for FE is costly. Therefore, there has been a desire to find functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as biomarkers, to improve our biological understanding of FE as well as accuracy of genomic prediction for FE. We have performed a cis- and trans- eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) analysis, in a population of Danbred Durocs (N = 11) and Danbred Landrace (N = 27) using both a linear and ANOVA model based on muscle tissue RNA-seq. We analyzed a total of 1425x19179 or 2.7x107 Gene-SNP combinations in eQTL detection models for FE. The 1425 genes were from RNA-Seq based differential gene expression analyses using 25880 genes related to FE and additionally combined with mitochondrial genes. The 19179 SNPs were from applying stringent quality control and linkage disequilibrium filtering on genotype data using a GGP Porcine HD 70k SNP array. We applied 1000 fold bootstrapping and enrichment analysis to further validate and analyze our detected eQTLs. We identified 13 eQTLs with FDR < 0.1, affecting several genes found in previous studies of commercial pig breeds. Examples include MYO19, CPT1B, ACSL1, IER5L, CPT1A, SUCLA2, CSRNP1, PARK7 and MFF. The bootstrapping results showed statistically significant enrichment (p-value<2.2x10-16) of eQTLs with p-value < 0.01 in both cis and trans-eQTLs. Enrichment analysis of top trans-eQTLs revealed high enrichment for gene categories and gene ontologies associated with genomic context and expression regulation. This included transcription factors (p-value = 1.0x10-13), DNA-binding (GO:0003677, p-value = 8.9x10-14), DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700,) nucleus gene (GO:0005634, p-value<2.2x10-16), negative regulation of expression (GO:0010629, p-value<2.2x10-16). These results would be useful for future genome assisted breeding of pigs to improve FE, and in the improved understanding of the functional mechanism of trans eQTLs."
https://openalex.org/W3087532277,"The deep multiple kernel Learning (DMKL) method has attracted wide attention due to its better classification performance than shallow multiple kernel learning. However, the existing DMKL methods are hard to find suitable global model parameters to improve classification accuracy in numerous datasets and do not take into account inter-class correlation and intra-class diversity. In this paper, we present a group-based local adaptive deep multiple kernel learning (GLDMKL) method with lp norm. Our GLDMKL method can divide samples into multiple groups according to the multiple kernel k-means clustering algorithm. The learning process in each well-grouped local space is exactly adaptive deep multiple kernel learning. And our structure is adaptive, so there is no fixed number of layers. The learning model in each group is trained independently, so the number of layers of the learning model maybe different. In each local space, adapting the model by optimizing the SVM model parameter α and the local kernel weight β in turn and changing the proportion of the base kernel of the combined kernel in each layer by the local kernel weight, and the local kernel weight is constrained by the lp norm to avoid the sparsity of basic kernel. The hyperparameters of the kernel are optimized by the grid search method. Experiments on UCI and Caltech 256 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more accurate in classification accuracy than other deep multiple kernel learning methods, especially for datasets with relatively complex data."
https://openalex.org/W3087631272,"Muscle aging is accompanied by blunted muscle regeneration in response to injury and disuse. Oxidative stress likely underlies this diminished response, but muscle redox sensors that act in regeneration have not yet been characterized. Calmodulin contains multiple redox sensitive methionines whose oxidation alters the regulation of numerous cellular targets. We have used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce a single amino acid substitution M109Q that mimics oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide in one or both alleles of the CALM1 gene, one of three genes encoding the muscle regulatory protein calmodulin, in C2C12 mouse myoblasts. When signaled to undergo myogenesis, mutated myoblasts failed to differentiate into myotubes. Although early myogenic regulatory factors were present, cells with the CALM1 M109Q mutation in one or both alleles were unable to withdraw from the cell cycle and failed to express late myogenic factors. We have shown that a single oxidative modification to a redox-sensitive muscle regulatory protein can halt myogenesis, suggesting a molecular target for mitigating the impact of oxidative stress in age-related muscle degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3087698151,"Various patient safety interventions have been implemented since the late 1990s, but their evaluation has been lacking. To obtain basic information for prioritizing patient safety interventions, this study aimed to extract high-priority interventions in Japan and to identify the factors that influence the setting of priority. Six perspectives (contribution, dissemination, impact, cost, urgency, and priority) on 42 patient safety interventions classified into 3 levels (system, organizational, and clinical) were evaluated by Japanese experts using the Delphi technique. We examined the relationships of the levels and the perspectives on interventions with the transition of the consensus state in rounds 1 and 3. After extracting the high-priority interventions, a chi-squared test was used to examine the relationship of the levels and the impact/cost ratio with high priority. Regression models were used to examine the influence of each perspective on priority. There was a significant relationship between the level of interventions and the transition of the consensus state (p = 0.033). System-level interventions had a low probability of achieving consensus. ""Human resources interventions,"" ""professional education and training,"" ""medication management/reconciliation protocols,"" ""pay-for performance (P4P) schemes and financing for safety,"" ""digital technology solutions to improve safety,"" and ""hand hygiene initiatives"" were extracted as high-priority interventions. The level and the impact/cost ratio of interventions had no significant relationships with high priority. In the regression model, dissemination and impact had an influence on priority (β = -0.628 and 0.941, respectively; adjusted R-squared = 0.646). The influence of impact and dissemination on the priority of interventions suggests that it is important to examine the dissemination degree and impact of interventions in each country for prioritizing interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3087736101,"Optimization of antiretroviral therapy and anti-inflammatory treatments, such as statins, are among the strategies aimed at reducing metabolic disorders, inflammation and immune activation in people living with HIV (PLWH). We evaluated the potential benefit of combining both strategies.Forty-two PLWH aged ≥40 years receiving a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen were randomized (1:1) to switch from PI to Raltegravir (n = 20), or to remain on PI (n = 22). After 24 weeks, all patients received atorvastatin 20mg/day for 48 weeks.We analyzed plasma inflammatory as well as T-cell maturation, activation, exhaustion and senescence markers at baseline, 24 and 72 weeks.Plasma inflammatory markers remained unchanged. Furthermore, no major changes on T-cell maturation subsets, immunoactivation, exhaustion or immunosenescence markers in both CD4 and CD8 T cell compartments were observed. Only a modest decrease in the frequency of CD38+ CD8 T cells and an increase in the frequency of CD28-CD57+ in both CD4 and CD8 T-cell compartments were noticed in the Raltegravir-switched group.The study combined antiretroviral switch to Raltegravir and Statin-based anti-inflammatory strategies to reduce inflammation and chronic immune activation in PLWH. Although this combination was safe and well tolerated, it had minimal impact on inflammatory and immunological markers.NCT02577042."
https://openalex.org/W3087083003,"Monitoring the ecological impacts of environmental pollution and the effectiveness of remediation efforts requires identifying relationships between contaminants and the disruption of biological processes in populations, communities, or ecosystems. Wildlife are useful bioindicators, but traditional comparative experimental approaches rely on a staunch and typically unverifiable assumption that, in the absence of contaminants, reference and contaminated sites would support the same densities of bioindicators, thereby inferring direct causation from indirect data. We demonstrate the utility of spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models for overcoming these issues, testing if community density of common small mammal bioindicators was directly influenced by soil chemical concentrations. By modeling density as an inhomogeneous Poisson point process, we found evidence for an inverse spatial relationship between Peromyscus density and soil mercury concentrations, but not other chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, at a site formerly occupied by a nuclear reactor. Although the coefficient point estimate supported Peromyscus density being lower where mercury concentrations were higher (β = -0.44), the 95% confidence interval overlapped zero, suggesting no effect was also compatible with our data. Estimated density from the most parsimonious model (2.88 mice/ha; 95% CI = 1.63-5.08), which did not support a density-chemical relationship, was within the range of reported densities for Peromyscus that did not inhabit contaminated sites elsewhere. Environmental pollution remains a global threat to biodiversity and ecosystem and human health, and our study provides an illustrative example of the utility of SCR models for investigating the effects that chemicals may have on wildlife bioindicator populations and communities."
https://openalex.org/W3087293570,"Previous evidence has suggested a relationship between male self-reported body size and the risk of developing prostate cancer. In this UK-wide case-control study, we have explored the possible association of prostate cancer risk with male self-reported body size. We also investigated body shape as a surrogate marker for fat deposition around the body. As obesity and excessive adiposity have been linked with increased risk for developing a number of different cancers, further investigation of self-reported body size and shape and their potential relationship with prostate cancer was considered to be appropriate.The study objective was to investigate whether underlying associations exist between prostate cancer risk and male self-reported body size and shape.Data were collected from a large case-control study of men (1928 cases and 2043 controls) using self-administered questionnaires. Data from self-reported pictograms of perceived body size relating to three decades of life (20's, 30's and 40's) were recorded and analysed, including the pattern of change. The associations of self-identified body shape with prostate cancer risk were also explored.Self-reported body size for men in their 20's, 30's and 40's did not appear to be associated with prostate cancer risk. More than half of the subjects reported an increase in self-reported body size throughout these three decades of life. Furthermore, no association was observed between self-reported body size changes and prostate cancer risk. Using 'symmetrical' body shape as a reference group, subjects with an 'apple' shape showed a significant 27% reduction in risk (Odds ratio = 0.73, 95% C.I. 0.57-0.92).Change in self-reported body size throughout early to mid-adulthood in males is not a significant risk factor for the development of prostate cancer. Body shape indicative of body fat distribution suggested that an 'apple' body shape was protective and inversely associated with prostate cancer risk when compared with 'symmetrical' shape. Further studies which investigate prostate cancer risk and possible relationships with genetic factors known to influence body shape may shed further light on any underlying associations."
https://openalex.org/W3087460528,"Background There are currently no tools for assessing claimants’ perceived fairness in work disability evaluations. In our study, we describe the development and validation of a questionnaire for this purpose. Method In cooperation with subject-matter experts of Swiss insurance medicine, we developed the 30-item Basel Fairness Questionnaire (BFQ). Claimants anonymously answered the questionnaire immediately after their disability evaluation, still unaware about its outcome. For each item, there were four response options, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. The construct validity of the BFQ was assessed by running a principal component analysis (PCA). Results In 4% of the questionnaires, the claimants’ perception on the disability evaluation was negative (below the median of the scale). The PCA of the items responses followed by an orthogonal rotation revealed four factors, namely (1) Interviewing Skills, (2) Rapport, (3) Transparency, and (4) Case Familiarity, explaining 63.5% of the total variance. Discussion The ratings presumably have some positive bias by sample selection and response bias. The PCA factors corresponded to dimensions that subject-matter experts had beforehand identified as relevant. However, all item ratings were highly intercorrelated, which suggests that the presumed underlying dimensions are not independent. Conclusion The BFQ represents the first self-administered instrument for measuring claimants’ perceived fairness of work disability evaluations, allowing the assessment of informational, procedural, and interactive justice from the perspective of claimants. In cooperation with Swiss assessment centres, we plan to implement a refined version of the BFQ as feedback instrument in work disability evaluations."
