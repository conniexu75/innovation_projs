https://openalex.org/W1535587662,"Using three different trans dominant mutants of bovine ARF1 affecting GDP exchange or GTP hydrolysis we demonstrate the central role of ARF1 in controlling vesicular traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus and between successive Golgi compartments. Overexpression of ARF1(Q71L), a mutant likely to be restricted to the GTP-bound form, resulted in the accumulation of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein in pre-Golgi intermediates, inhibited transport between successive Golgi compartments, and led to a striking association of beta-COP with pre-Golgi intermediates and the Golgi stack. In contrast, ARF1(T31N), a mutant which is likely to have a preferential affinity for GDP compared to the wild-type protein, inhibited export from the ER and triggered a brefeldin A-like phenotype, resulting in the redistribution of beta-COP from Golgi membranes to the cytosol and the collapse of the Golgi into the ER. This mutant, which may efficiently sequester an ARF-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (ARF-GEF), suggests that ARF and ARF-GEF are essential for export from the ER. These results are discussed in the context of the GDP and GTP-bound forms of ARF in controlling both membrane structure and vesicular traffic through the early secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1614601899,"8E5 is a chronically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected human T cell line, which we have previously shown to be extremely susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis due to a HIV-associated catalase deficiency. Here we report that HIV gene expression additionally renders 8E5 cells 10-fold more sensitive than either uninfected A3.01 cells or HIV-infected but nonexpressing 8E5L cells to killing by 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), as well as several other hydroperoxy fatty acids. Whereas the viability of A3.01 and 8E5L cells was relatively unaffected by exposure to 10 microM 15-HPETE, similarly treated 8E5 cells underwent apoptosis, as demonstrated by morphological changes and the presence of fragmented DNA. The unique susceptibility of 8E5 cells was attributable to their inability to convert 15-HPETE to 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) owing to a marked reduction in glutathione peroxidase activity. Since oxidized lipids have been reported to accumulate in oxidatively stressed, HIV-infected individuals, a HIV-associated glutathione peroxidase deficiency may contribute to the depletion of CD4 T cells that occurs in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
https://openalex.org/W1595861603,"In a previous study, we showed that heparitinase releases a 14-saccharide sequence (Oligo-H) from heparan sulfate (HS) with the structure delta GlcUA beta 1,4GlcNSO3-alpha 1,4[IdceA(2S)alpha 1,4GlcNSO3]5 alpha 1,4IdceA alpha 1,4GlcNAc (where IdceA(2S) represents iduronic acid 2-sulfate), which binds to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) with high affinity (Turnbull, J. E., Fernig, D., Ke, Y., Wilkinson, M. C. & Gallagher, J. T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10337-10341). This paper describes further work on the binding properties of HS saccharides and their capacity to mediate bFGF activity in a mitogenesis assay in which responsiveness is dependent on the addition of HS or heparin. Saccharides prepared by heparinase or nitrous acid digestion and heparitinase-resistant fragments five disaccharide units (degree of polymerization (dp) = 10) or less in size were unable to activate bFGF. However, heparitinase-resistant saccharides of dp12-16 were active in the assay; the dp14 and dp16 fractions were equivalent in activity to heparin and more active than the parent HS. Saccharides of the same size and basic structure as the active fractions (> or = dp12) bound to bFGF with high relative affinity. Active saccharides were composed mainly of N-sulfated disaccharides, the predominant unit being IdceA(2S)-GlcNSO3. This was enriched at least 5-fold in the active saccharides by comparison with the original HS. In addition, the dp12 and dp14 active fractions had a notably low content of trisulfated disaccharides (IdceA(2S)-GlcNSO3(6S)) (where GlcNSO3(6S) represents N-sulfated glucosamine 6-sulfate), which are the major repeat units of heparin. The data show that sequences similar in size and basic structure to Oligo-H can mediate the mitogenic activity of bFGF. Overall, the results provide further evidence that specific HS sequences are generated biosynthetically in order to fulfill particular biological functions such as activation of bFGF."
https://openalex.org/W1500148089,"Western blot analysis of Balb/c 3T3 cell lysates by an antibody specific to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) showed that several proteins exist in a PIP2-bound form. Among them, two proteins, 100 and 115 kDa in molecular mass, were detected as PIP2 abundant proteins. These were identified as alpha-actinin and vinculin by their antibodies. In Balb/c 3T3 cells, alpha-actinin in the cytoskeleton contains PIP2, while alpha-actinin in cytosol does not. The levels of PIP2 bound to alpha-actinin decrease in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Similarly, PIP2 bound to vinculin is decreased upon stimulation with PDGF. By immunofluorescent staining, PIP2 was found to be present densely in the central areas around nuclei, microfilament bundles, and focal contacts, where alpha-actinin and vinculin are distributed. PDGF stimulation decreases the intensity of PIP2 staining in these areas. In this paper we suggest that tyrosine kinase-activated phospholipase C hydrolyzes PIP2 bound to alpha-actinin and vinculin, leading to the simultaneous generation of second messengers and reorganization of the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1522112651,"Membrane surfaces accelerate the proteolytic inactivation of factor Va by activated protein C. In most coagulation complexes, the most active membrane phospholipid is believed to be phosphatidylserine. In this study, we demonstrate that with phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles, incorporation of phosphatidylethanolamine increased the rate of factor Va inactivation approximately 10-fold at all concentrations of factor Va studied and at all vesicle concentrations at or below the optimum for prothrombin activation. In contrast, phosphatidylethanolamine had very little influence on prothrombin activation. Phosphatidylethanolamine was a critical component of vesicles for the vesicles to support activated protein C anticoagulant activity optimally in plasma. These results demonstrate that the membrane requirements for the different coagulation/anticoagulation complexes differ much more than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W1856257340,"The beta A4-amyloid protein precursor (APP), the source of the beta A4-amyloid deposits found in Alzheimer brains, constitutes a family of transmembrane glycoproteins generated by alternative splicing. While exon 7 and exon 8 are well known to be alternatively spliced, APP mRNA isoforms without exon 15 were only recently identified in leukocytes and rat brain microglial cells and therefore denoted as L-APP mRNAs. In order to perform a detailed analysis of individual L-APP mRNA isoforms in perfused rat tissues, we developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay from reverse transcribed RNA allowing us to analyze the alternatively spliced region in between exon 6 and 16. In all peripheral tissues examined, L-APP mRNA isoforms were detected comprising between 25% (skeletal muscle) and about 70% (aorta, pancreas) of total APP transcripts. All four possible APP mRNA isoforms without exon 15 were shown to exist, i.e. L-APP752, L-APP733, L-APP696, and L-APP677. L-APP expression in the central nervous system (approximately 4% of total APP mRNA) was then studied in more detail by analyzing different brain regions and tissues and primary cultured brain cells. The only cell type which was shown not to express L-APP mRNA to a detectable level is the neuronal cell. Ubiquitous expression of APP mRNAs lacking exon 15 except for neurons indicates an important function in non-neuronal cells and is especially remarkable since neurons are the primarily affected cells in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1844691600,"Lead (Pb2+) has been reported to activate calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) at subnanomolar concentrations (Markovac, J., and Goldstein, G. W. (1988) Nature 334, 732-734); however, others have failed to find any Pb(2+)-induced activation of PKC (Murakami, K., Feng, G., and Chen, S. G. (1993) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 264, 757-761). In neither of these studies was the actual free Pb2+ or Ca2+ concentration measured. In this study, 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (5F-BAPTA) was used to buffer Pb2+ and Ca2+ concentrations in the PKC reaction mixture. The specific free ion concentrations of Pb2+ and Ca2+, as well as Zn2+ and other divalent cations contained in the PKC reaction mixtures, were determined by 19F NMR spectroscopy. Using this approach to set and confirm the free Pb2+ and Ca2+ concentrations, we measured the Pb(2+)-dependent and the Ca(2+)-dependent activation of phosphotydylserine/diolein-dependent incorporation of 32P from ATP into histone and endogenous acid precipitable proteins in the 100,000 x g supernatant from homogenized rat brain cortex. We found that free Pb2+ activates PKC in the range from 10(-11) to 10(-8) M, Kact = 5.5 x 10(-11) M, while Ca2+ activates PKC in the range from 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, Kact = 2.56 x 10(-7) M. These findings clearly resolve the activation of PKC by subnanomolar concentrations of free Pb2+ from activation induced by Ca2+ or other divalent cations. Furthermore, it documents the utility of 5F-BAPTA as buffer and indicator when resolving the contributions of multiple divalent cations in biochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W1583023495,"To examine subunit assembly and biochemical properties of two members of the kainate family of glutamate receptors (GluR), antibodies were made to synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl termini of GluR6 and KA2. Immunoblot analysis of membranes from human embryonic kidney cells transfected with glutamate receptor cDNAs showed that these antibodies are selective for their respective receptor subunit except that the antibody to GluR6 also recognizes GluR7, which is expected due to the sequence homology between the two subunits at the carboxyl terminus. In transfected cell membranes, immunoblot analysis with the antibody to GluR6 showed a major immunoreactive band at 118 kDa and minor bands at 103 and 28 kDa. The 103-kDa band appears to be a deglycosylated form of GluR6 since deglycosylation eliminates staining at 118 kDa and increases staining of the 103-kDa band. Immunoblot analysis of KA2 transfected cell membranes shows a major band at 123 kDa and minor bands at 109 and 37 kDa. Deglycosylation converts the 123-kDa band into a 109-kDa band. Analysis of brain tissues shows that both antibodies label single major bands which migrate at the same molecular masses as those from transfected cell membranes, 118 and 123 kDa for GluR6 and KA2, respectively. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that antibodies to GluR6 and KA2 selectively immunoprecipitated [3H]kainate binding activity, but not 3H-labeled alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid (AMPA) binding activity, from Triton X-100-solubilized rat brain membranes. Furthermore, each antibody coimmunoprecipitated GluR6 and KA2 from cells co-transfected with GluR6 and KA2 cDNAs and from detergent-solubilized rat brain membranes, indicating that these two subunits can coassemble into a molecular complex. Interestingly, GluR1 and GluR2, subunits of the AMPA receptor, also co-immunoprecipitated with GluR6 in cells co-transfected with GluR6 and GluR1 or GluR2 cD-NAs. Such complexes appear to be present to a limited extent in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2095807979,"Sea urchin kinesin is a plus end-directed microtubule-based motor consisting of two heavy chains and two light chains and is proposed to be responsible (a) for the transport of membranous organelles along microtubules in sea urchin mitotic spindles (Wright, B. D., Henson, J. H., Wedaman, K. P., Willy, P. J., Morand, J. N., and Scholey, J. M. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 113, 817-833) and (b) for the radial dispersion of endoplasmic reticulum and endosomal membranes in non-mitotic cultured coelomocytes (Henson, J. H., Nesbitt, D., Wright, B. D., and Scholey, J. M. (1992) J. Cell Sci. 103, 309-320). We report here that sea urchin kinesin is indeed able to bind in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner to microsomal membranes isolated from sea urchin eggs in the presence of MgATP. The kinesin light chains may not be essential for membrane binding since kinesin containing negligible amounts of light chains binds as well as kinesin containing stoichiometric amounts of light chains. Finally, we propose that kinesin binds to membranes with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the heavy chain (amino acid residues 858-1031) since the bacterially expressed and then isolated stalk-tail fragment of kinesin heavy chain, in contrast to the stalk fragment, is able (a) to bind membranes in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner and (b) to compete with native kinesin for membrane binding. Our results support the hypothesis that the carboxyl-terminal domains of the heavy chains attach kinesin molecules to their membranous cargo in mitotic and interphase sea urchin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1499927580,"We recently showed that human and rat platelets express two types of SERCAs (Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ATPases): a 100-kDa SERCA2b isoform and a 97-kDa SERCA isoform. Here, we explored the possibility that the rat 97-kDa isoform is identical to the SERCA3 protein. For this purpose, we first attempted to detect SERCA3 mRNA in rat platelet total RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using SERCA3-specific primers, and demonstrated the presence of this mRNA species by sequencing the amplification product. We then searched for a relationship between the expression of the SERCA3 mRNA and of the 97-kDa protein using either rat aortic smooth muscle cells, previously found not to express the 97-kDa SERCA isoform (negative model), or platelets of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which overexpress this isoform (overexpression model) but express the 100-kDa SERCA2b isoform normally. No expression of SERCA3 mRNA was detectable by analysis of smooth muscle cell RNA, but comparison by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the SERCA2b and SERCA3 mRNAs from the platelets of normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto, WKY) rats and SHR clearly demonstrated a 238 +/- 43% increase in the expression of the SERCA3 mRNA in SHR platelets only. Last, by comparative Western blotting of WKY rat and SHR platelet membranes using a recently developed polyclonal anti-SERCA3 antibody, we established that the 97-kDa SERCA and the SERCA3 protein are identical, as immunostaining of the 97-kDa protein revealed a 230 +/- 25% increase in the expression of this protein in SHR versus WKY rat platelets. It is concluded that the 97-kDa platelet SERCA isoform, which is up-regulated in SHR, is the SERCA3 protein. As far as we know, this constitutes the first demonstration of the actual presence of this Ca2+ATPase isoform in normal cells, in addition to the artificial transfection systems."
https://openalex.org/W1572021741,"Treatment of human myeloid leukemia cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), is associated with induction of monocytic differentiation. Since PKC can act immediately upstream to the cytoplasmic Raf-1 serine/threonine protein kinase, we studied activation of Raf-1 during induction of the differentiated monocytic phenotype. The results demonstrate that Raf-1 is activated during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. In contrast, there was little effect of TPA on this kinase in an HL-60 variant, designated HL-525, which is resistant to TPA-induced differentiation. Treatment of both HL-60 and HL-525 cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, was associated with Raf-1 activation and induction of the monocytic phenotype. Since Raf-1 can activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, we also studied the relationship between MAP kinase activation and monocytic differentiation. Treatment of HL-60, but not HL-525, cells with TPA was associated with increased MAP kinase activity as determined by phosphorylation of myelin basic protein and the c-Jun Y peptide. Okadaic acid-induced differentiation of both HL-60 and HL-525 cells was similarly accompanied by increases in MAP kinase activity. These findings indicated that activation of Raf-1/MAP kinase signaling is associated with induction of a differentiated monocytic phenotype and that okadaic acid bypasses a defect in this cascade in TPA-treated HL-525 cells. While recent studies have shown that HL-525 cells are deficient in PKC beta, the present results demonstrate that PKC beta expression is up-regulated in the HL-525 variant by treatment with retinoic acid. The results also demonstrate that retinoic acid-treated HL-525 cells respond to TPA with activation of Raf-1 and MAP kinase, as well as induction of monocytic differentiation. Taken together, the results indicate that activation of Raf-1/MAP kinase signaling is associated with monocytic differentiation and that stimulation of serine/threonine protein phosphorylation by TPA or okadaic acid is sufficient for reversal of the leukemic HL-60 phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1485996519,"To determine if an altered expression of the Na,K-ATPase alpha isoform genes is responsible for an observed increase in cardiac glycoside sensitivity in compensatory hypertrophy, we performed Northern and slot blot analyses of RNA and specific immunological detection of Na,K-ATPase isoforms in rat hearts from normal and pressure overload-treated animals induced by abdominal aortic constriction. During the early phase of hypertrophy, the only alteration is a decrease in the alpha 2 mRNA isoform. In the compensated hypertrophied heart, the levels of the predominant alpha 1 isoform (mRNA and protein) and the beta 1 subunit mRNA are unchanged. In contrast, the alpha 2 isoform (mRNA and protein) is decreased by 35% and up to 61-64% in mild ( 55%) hypertrophy, respectively. The alpha 3 isoform (mRNA and protein), which is extremely low in adult heart, is increased up to 2-fold during hypertrophy but accounts for only approximately equal to 5% of the total alpha isoform mRNA. These findings demonstrate that, in cardiac hypertrophy, the three alpha isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase are independently regulated and that regulation occurs at a pretranslational level. The pattern of expression in hypertrophied adult heart is similar to that of the neonatal heart where the inverse regulation between the alpha 2 and alpha 3 ouabain high affinity isoforms has been reported. This suggests that distinct regulatory mechanisms controlling Na,K-ATPase isoform expression may, at least in part, be involved in the sensitivity to cardiac glycosides."
https://openalex.org/W1505618476,"Sixty-four kinds of cell lines were examined for their ability to produce megakaryocyte potentiating activity by means of conditioned media obtained from a protein-free culture system. Six human tumor cell lines were shown to produce this activity, and the cell line HPC-Y5, established from human pancreatic cancer, was shown to have the highest level of activity. The megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF) was purified from an HPC-Y5 conditioned medium by a combination of ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. The purified MPF showed a megakaryocyte potentiating activity almost equal to human interleukin-6 in the presence of murine interleukin-3 in a colony formation assay with mouse bone marrow cells. The apparent molecular weight of MPF is 32,000 when determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Glycopeptidase F digestion, and amino sugar analysis of the factor demonstrated that MPF is a glycoprotein carrying at least one N-linked sugar chain. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of MPF was determined to be Leu-Ala-Gly-Glu-Thr-Gly-Gln-Glu-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu- Asp-Gly-Val-Leu-Ala-Asn. The same or homologous amino acid sequence has not been found in known proteins, demonstrating that MPF is a novel cytokine that has megakaryocyte potentiating activity in the murine assay system."
https://openalex.org/W1505067240,"The core promoters of the rat platelet factor 4 (PF4), mouse erythropoietin and chicken beta globin genes contain a GATA motif in place of the consensus TATAAA site. In the case of the PF4 gene, this site has been shown to play a critical role in restricting transcription to the megakaryocyte lineage. In order to understand the mechanism of tissue specificity, we investigated the function of the GATA box-containing promoters in vitro. Our studies show that the TATA-binding protein of TFIID is required for initiation of transcription from the GATA box-containing promoters. GATA-1 interacts with the core promoter GATA motif and inhibits generation of preinitiation complexes. The functional significance of the inhibition of preinitiation complexes is supported by in vitro transcription assays in which transcription from the PF4 and erythropoietin core promoters is suppressed by GATA-1. We also demonstrate that GATA-2 inhibits initiation of transcription from the PF4 core promoter. Based on these results, we propose a model in which repression of PF4 expression in nonmegakaryocytes is mediated, in part, by competition between GATA-binding proteins and basal factors for the core promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1535914029,"The enhancer of the rat ornithine transcarbamylase gene is located 11 kilobases upstream from the transcription start site and has been shown to be hepatoma cell-specific. Using transgenic mice, we showed that this enhancer is capable of activating transcription in a liver-specific manner, inverting the tissue specificity of the homologous promoter that is by itself more active in the small intestine than in the liver. Transient transfection analysis with cultured hepatoma cells indicated that the enhancer activity resides in the approximately 110-base pair region containing four protein-binding sites, two for hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) and two for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), both of which are liver-selective transcription factors. Concatemerization of a region containing one HNF-4 and one C/EBP site led to reconstitution of the hepatoma cell-specific enhancer, and intactness of these two sites was strictly required for the enhancer activity. Furthermore, cotransfection experiments showed that both HNF-4 and C/EBP beta are necessary, and neither alone sufficient, for activation of the reconstituted enhancer in nonhepatic cells. Requirement of combinatorial operation of at least two liver-enriched transcription factors for transcriptional activation successfully explains why these liver-selective but not strictly liver-specific factors can confer more restricted liver specificity on transcription of their target genes."
https://openalex.org/W1570796523,"Inhibitor-2 (I-2) is the regulatory subunit of the ATP-Mg-dependent phosphatase, a cytosolic form of type 1 protein phosphatase. Phosphorylation of I-2 at Thr-72 by the protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) leads to activation of the enzyme. Casein kinase II action was shown to synergistically enhance phosphorylation and activation by GSK-3 (DePaoli-Roach, A.A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12144-12152). Rabbit skeletal muscle and liver I-2 cDNA clones have been isolated. Rabbit skeletal muscle cDNAs could be placed in two subtypes, differing in the length of the 3'-untranslated region. The coding sequence of 612 nucleotides was identical in the two skeletal muscle and the liver cDNAs and predicted a protein of 204 amino acids, consistent with analysis of the purified protein. Northern hybridization analysis indicated that the two mRNAs of 1.7 and 2.7 kilobase pairs were present in all rabbit tissues examined, except in liver, where only the larger transcript was detected, and in testis, where additional transcripts were present. Expression in Escherichia coli of wild-type and phosphorylation site mutants resulted in the production of I-2 polypeptides with apparent M(r) values of approximately 31,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The inhibitory activity of the recombinant proteins was similar to that of native rabbit skeletal muscle I-2 and was unaffected by the substitution of alanine for the GSK-3 site (Thr-72) and for the casein kinase II sites (Ser-86 and Ser-120/121) or by substitution of glutamic acid and aspartic acid for Thr-72 and Ser-86. Recombinant wild-type I-2 and the Ala-120/121 mutant were phosphorylated synergistically by GSK-3 and casein kinase II. The Thr-72 and Ser-86 mutants, however, did not undergo this synergistic phosphorylation. Our studies indicate that Thr-72 is the only GSK-3 site and that Ser-86 is the casein kinase II site required for the potentiation of GSK-3 action. Furthermore, acidic residues cannot substitute for the phosphate group either in enhancing GSK-3 phosphorylation or in activating the phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1518079028,"Seven-membrane span receptors transduce a wide range of signals across the plasma membrane. One member of this family, the cAMP receptor, cAR1, of Dictyostelium, mediates some responses (e.g. adenylyl cyclase activation, multicellular aggregation) which require G-proteins and others (e.g. Ca2+ influx, loss of ligand binding, cAR1 phosphorylation) which appear to be G-protein-independent. In this study, we randomly mutagenized the NH2-terminal eight amino acids of the third intracellular loop of cAR1 and examined the ability of these mutants to exhibit the three G-protein-independent responses listed above. Most mutants (classes I, II) exhibited wild-type or midly defective responses. Several mutants (class III), however, were severely impaired in all three processes but not in cAMP binding. Furthermore, these mutants failed to couple productively with G-proteins and could not replace cAR1 in a car1- cell. For these reasons, we propose that class III mutations interfere with the formation of an active conformation of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1524935719,"Ca(2+)-dependent and protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms of phospholipase D (PLD) activation were studied in rat hepatocytes by measuring phosphatidylethanol (Peth) formation in the presence of ethanol. Stimulation of Peth formation by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), vasopressin, or A23187 was inhibited by multiple protein kinase C inhibitors or by protein kinase C down-regulation, indicating that this enzyme is involved in the action of all these agents. A controlled elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) over the range of 0.1-2.0 microM activated Peth formation in the absence of other agonists. Staurosporin potentiated Ca(2+)-induced Peth formation by shifting the [Ca2+]cyt dose-response curve to the left. Other protein kinase C inhibitors (calphostin C, bisindolylmaleimide) inhibited Ca(2+)-mediated Peth formation, but this inhibition was reduced in staurosporin-treated cells. Okadaic acid potentiated PLD activation by TPA, but suppressed PLD activation by elevated [Ca2+]cyt. Desensitization of TPA-induced PLD activity did not affect PLD activation by Ca2+. These data indicate that [Ca2+]cyt and protein kinase C control distinct pathways of PLD activation, but the Ca(2+)-mediated pathway is suppressed by a staurosporin-sensitive protein kinase. Both mechanisms contribute to vasopressin-induced Peth formation in intact hepatocytes. Activation of protein kinase A enhanced vasopressin-induced Peth formation, but not TPA-stimulated or Ca(2+)-stimulated stimulated Peth formation. Protein kinase A acted by enhancing hormonal Ca2+ mobilization, rather than by directly activating PLD, and thereby shifted the balance of Ca(2+)-dependent and protein kinase C-dependent activation mechanisms of PLD in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1601422892,"The previously cloned hem Y gene of Bacillus subtilis (Hansson, M., and Hederstedt, L. (1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 8081-8093) has been expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein has been shown to be the penultimate enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, protoporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4) and, thus, the gene designation should be hem G. This represents the first report of the expression of a cloned protoporphyrinogen oxidase from any source. The enzyme is present in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction and is, thus, unlike all previously reported eukaryotic or prokaryotic protoporphyrinogen oxidases, which are membrane-bound. It utilizes molecular oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, and protoporphyrinogen IX, mesoporphyrinogen IX, and coproporphyrinogen III serve as substrates. The diphenyl ether herbicide acifluorfen, which is a strong inhibitor of the eukaryotic enzyme, is only weakly inhibitory. The enzyme has a predicted molecular weight of 51,200, which corresponds well with molecular weight determination via high performance liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition the enzyme contains a putative dinucleotide binding region at the amino terminus, which is consistent with the previously demonstrated presence of a flavin moiety in the characterized mammalian enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1557621377,"Signal transduction in human neutrophils requires prenylcysteine-directed carboxyl methylation of ras-related low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins. We now report the subcellular localization and characterization of a neutrophil prenylcysteine alpha carboxyl methyltransferase. The highest carboxyl methyltransferase activity copurified with biotinylated neutrophil surface membranes, supporting a plasma membrane localization of the enzyme. Neutrophil nuclear fractions contained little or no methyltransferase activity. Methyltransferase activity was detergent-sensitive but could be reconstituted by removal of detergent in the presence of phosphatidyl choline and an anionic phospholipid. N-Acetyl-S-trans,trans-farnesyl-L-cysteine (AFC) and N-acetyl-S-all-trans-geranylgeranyl-L-cysteine (AGGC) were effective substrates for neutrophil prenylcysteine-directed methyltransferase; Vmax values for AFC and AGGC (16.4 and 22.1 pmol of methylated/mg protein/min, respectively) are among the highest yet reported. Although both GTP gamma S and the chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe stimulated methylation of ras-related proteins, neither affected methylation of AFC. These data suggest that neutrophil plasma membranes contain a phospholipid-dependent, prenylcysteine-directed carboxyl methyltransferase of relatively high specific activity that modifies ras-related protein substrates in the GTP-bound, activated state."
https://openalex.org/W1559686163,"The liver is the major organ responsible for the uptake of oxidized low density lipoproteins (Ox-LDL) from the blood circulation with Kupffer cells as major cellular uptake site. Candidate binding proteins for Ox-LDL on membranes from Kupffer and endothelial liver cells were identified with ligand blots. Under nonreducing conditions, a major binding protein with an estimated molecular mass of 95 kDa and a minor stained protein of 220 kDa were detected on Kupffer cell membranes, while endothelial cell membranes expressed only a 220-kDa binding protein. Both the 95-kDa protein of Kupffer cell membranes and the 220-kDa protein of endothelial membranes displayed saturable binding of 125I-Ox-LDL with a Kd of 15 and 5 micrograms/ml, respectively. LDL was a weak competitor for the binding of 125I-Ox-LDL to the 95-kDa protein, while the degree of competition appeared to be dependent on the oxidation grade of LDL with a complete competition with LDL oxidized for 20 h with 10 microM Cu2+. We conclude that the 95-kDa binding protein, highly concentrated on rat Kupffer cells, forms the most likely candidate for mediating the in vivo uptake of Ox-LDL from the blood circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2125933627,"Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is a member of the neurotrophin gene family and is highly expressed in the developing rat cerebellum. Here we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increased by approximately 10-fold the NT-3 mRNA levels in cultured cerebellar granule neurons isolated from postnatal rats, whereas nerve growth factor (NGF) and NT-3 itself had no effect. The effect of BDNF was additive to that of triiodothyronine (T3), which also increased NT-3 mRNA in these neurons. The drug K252a inhibited the BDNF-mediated stimulation of NT-3 expression, suggesting an involvement of trkB receptors. Nuclear run-on experiments showed that BDNF enhanced NT-3 transcription, whereas the stability of NT-3 mRNA remained unchanged. The data presented are the first demonstration that one neurotrophin regulates the expression of another and provide evidence that NT-3 production in granule neurons is regulated by both BDNF and T3."
https://openalex.org/W1646585585,"To characterize the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene biochemically, a recombinant human protein was produced in an Escherichia coli expression system. The full-length protein, p110RB, and an amino-terminal truncated form, p56RB, were expressed and purified to near homogeneity by conventional chromatographic procedures. To probe the structural organization of the retinoblastoma protein the purified proteins were subjected to partial proteolysis by trypsin, chymotrypsin, and subtilisin. Four discrete structural domains were revealed in p110RB by this method. Two of these structural domains, found in both p56RB and p110RB, were mapped to the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein and corresponded to the SV40 large T binding domains defined previously by genetic methods. In addition two distinct domains in the amino-terminal half of the protein were also defined. A potential role for these newly defined amino-terminal domains was uncovered upon analysis of the purified proteins by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. p110RB revealed multiple bands by this method, suggesting the formation of oligomeric structures by the protein, while this property was not observed for p56RB. Electron microscopy of p110RB revealed linearly extended, macromolecular structures, further supporting the formation of homologous higher order structures by the full-length retinoblastoma protein. Analysis of the interactions between retinoblastoma protein molecules using the yeast two-hybrid system confirmed that the retinoblastoma protein could self-associate and that this association was mediated by interactions between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the protein. These observations suggest that the retinoblastoma protein contains multiple structural domains with the amino-terminal domains being required for oligomerization of the full-length protein."
https://openalex.org/W1536681115,"Two species of L-histidine decarboxylase (HDC) mRNA were found in the KU-812-F basophilic cell line, but only the 2.4-kilobase (kb) one encodes the functional HDC (Mamune-Sato, R., Yamauchi, K., Tanno, Y., Ohkawara, Y., Ohtsu, H., Katayose, D., Maeyama, K., Watanabe, T., Shibahara, S., and Takishima, T. (1992) Eur. J. Biochem. 209, 533-539). The 3.4-kb one encodes a truncated HDC protein and is also found in human leukemia-derived cell lines HEL and KCL-22. To clarify the mechanisms that regulate transcription of the HDC gene and generate the two species of mRNA, we have isolated genomic DNA clones coding for the HDC from human genomic libraries. Structural analysis of the isolated clones revealed that the human HDC gene is composed of 12 exons spanning approximately 24 kb. Genomic DNA blot analysis suggested that HDC is encoded by a single copy gene. The structural analysis also demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the HDC mRNA is caused by an insertion of the seventh intron sequence and alternative use of the splicing acceptor site at the 12th exon. The transcription start site of the HDC gene and the nucleotide sequences of the promoter and first exon regions were determined. We found a TATA-like sequence, a GC box, four CACC boxes, four GATA consensus sequences, and six leader-binding protein-1 binding motifs in the promoter region of the HDC gene."
https://openalex.org/W1577314112,"Two lectins (HOL-I and HOL-II) were isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai by affinity chromatography on a bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM)-Toyopearl and an acid-treated Sepharose 4B columns, respectively. In hemagglutination inhibition assays, GlcNAc, GalNAc, and their methyl glycosides were the most potent inhibitors among the monosaccharides tested against the HOL-I-mediated hemagglutination, suggesting that HOL-I can especially recognize the N-acetyl groups of the sugars. This N-acetyl specificity was supported by 1H NMR analyses; the highest field-shifts of the signal of the N-acetyl group among all the signals in Me beta GlcNAc were observed in 1H NMR spectra of mixtures of HOL-I and the sugar. Among the oligosaccharides tested, GlcNAc beta 1-->4(GlcNAc beta 1-->2)Man alpha 1-O(CH2)2 CH3 was the most potent inhibitor, and the inhibitory potency of the oligosaccharide was 2(4) times greater than those of GlcNAc and GalNAc. On the other hand, N-acetyllactosamine (Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc) and its analogs were the strongest inhibitors toward HOL-II-induced hemagglutination. The agglutination was completely inert to Gal beta 1-->3GlcNAc, Gal beta 1-->6GlcNAc, Gal beta 1-->3GalNAc, Gal beta 1-->4GalNAc, and Gal beta 1-->6GalNAc. Furthermore, HOL-II exhibited no binding ability to BSM, asialo-BSM, fetuin, asialofetuin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and human transferrin. These results indicate that HOL-II strictly recognizes simple Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc unit."

Chem. 267, 13200-13204), which binds directly to RNA polymerase II and stimulates read-through of intrinsic blocks to elongation. To elucidate functional features of this protein:protein interaction, we tested the ability of several forms of RNA polymerase II to respond to either full-length or an amino-terminal truncation of TFIIS. The variants of the polymerase differed in the structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit or lacked two of the smaller subunits. No differences in ability to recognize intrinsic blocks to elongation or to read through them in response to either form of TFIIS were detected among these variants. Furthermore, ternary complexes containing each variant form of RNA polymerase cleave the 3' end of the nascent transcripts in response to TFIIS, a reaction previously reported for mammalian and Drosophila TFIIS (Kassavetis, G. A., and Geiduschek, E. P. (1993) Science 259, 944-945) and likely to be important in TFIIS function. Thus the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit and subunits four and seven of the polymerase, required in vivo, are not required in vitro for recognition of intrinsic blocks to elongation, read-through in response to TFIIS, or TFIIS-stimulated cleavage of the nascent transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1488618676,"A new nuclease digestion assay was developed to elucidate the human excision-repair system operating on cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts. We analyzed lesions that accumulated in excised oligonucleotide fragments during incubation of UV-treated cultured fibroblasts. (6-4) photoproducts were removed intact, whereas excised cyclobutyl dimers often contained ruptured interpyrimidine phosphodiester bonds, raising the possibility that the intradimer backbone-cleavage reaction may help promote the bypass of unexcised dimers by the DNA replication or RNA transcription machinery. Cell strains representing eight different inherited forms of the cancer-prone skin disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) were generally found to exhibit characteristic abilities to excise the two classes of photolesions, ranging from total deficiency in groups A and G to normal proficiency in the variant. The capacity of any given XP group to act on one class of photoproducts in no way predicted its ability to act on the other. Finally, in those XP strains displaying significant levels of dimer removal, the ratio of intact-versus-modified dimers was normal, implying that rupture of the intradimer backbone linkage occurs independently of subsequent excision-repair reactions. Our data indicate that cyclobutyl dimers and (6-4) photoproducts are processed by distinct nucleotide-excision-repair pathways in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1563037009,"Abstract The impermeant SH-cleavable reagent, 125I-labeled 3,3'-dithiopropionyl 1-sulfosuccinimidyl 1'-glycyltyrosine (DPSgt) and specific immunoprecipitation were used to quantitate gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor polypeptides with domains exposed on the surface of chick cortical neurons. The 125I label incorporated into 50- and 53-kDa receptor subunits was completely removed by washing the cells with glutathione (GSH) buffer. A single dose of 100 microns GABA or GABA agonist was added to the neurons, and after 5 days in culture the cells were washed and labeled with 125I-DPSgt. This treatment with GABA or isoguvacine reduced the level of the receptor 125I-labeled subunits by 50-60%, while the reduction by 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol was less than 17%. The subunit down-regulation by agonist was prevented by the GABAA antagonist 3 alpha-hydroxy-16-imino-5 beta-17-aza-androstan-11-one (R5135). Direct iodination of membranes isolated from treated cells revealed a similar loss of subunits, indicating that the down-regulated polypeptides are not retained intracellularly. Furthermore, the level of intracellular [3H]flunitrazepam binding (per mg of protein) did not change significantly during chronic GABA treatment, while the fraction of intracellular binding rose from 7% to 15% of the total, owing to a decline in surface binding. The fate of the surface subunits during acute agonist exposure was examined by labeling intact neurons with 125I-DPSgt at 0 degrees C, incubating with GABA for 2-4 h at 37 degrees C and then washing with GSH buffer. Of the 50-53-kDa receptor peptides originally on the surface, 16 +/- 2% became protected from GSH during the 2-h GABA treatment. This sequestration was not found in cells incubated without GABA, with GABA + R5135, or with GABA at 0 degree C. A consistently lower level of sequestered subunits was recovered after a 4- versus 2-h GABA treatment at 37 degrees C, suggesting polypeptide degradation. Overall, the results indicate that GABAA receptor sequestration and subsequent degradation play an important role in agonist-dependent down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1533118349,"Activation of phospholipase D (PLD) by receptor-coupled stimuli (vasopressin, ATP), phorbol esters, and Ca2+ ionophores was studied in isolated rat hepatocytes, double labeled with [3H]arachidonate and [14C]stearate. Phosphatidylethanol (Peth) was formed when cells were stimulated in the presence of ethanol. The effect of combinations of agonists was not additive, indicating that the same PLD isozyme(s) were activated. With all agonists, the 3H- and 14C-specific radioactivity in Peth was higher than in any of the main phospholipid classes. The 3H/14C ratios of Peth and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were identical and differed from other phospholipid classes, indicating that the predominant PLD substrate was a PC pool labeled preferentially with radioactive fatty acids. Ethanol (50-300 mM) decreased the initial rate of phosphatidic acid (PA) formation, but did not affect total PLD activity. Agonist-induced changes in steady state accumulation of PA or 1,2-diacylglycerol were also unaffected. A slow degradation of Peth (apparent t1/2 > 60 min) occurred after ethanol removal from cells prestimulated with vasopressin. The rate of degradation was unaffected by agonists that stimulate PLD. Thus, Peth formation is a suitable cumulative indicator for PLD activation in intact hepatocytes. Peth accumulation declined over a period of 5-20 min, depending on the agonist. The decline was not due to increased Peth degradation, or limitations in substrate supply to PLD, or enzyme inhibition by accumulated Peth. Instead, a homologous desensitization of PLD occurs with all agonists. This desensitization may involve the action of selective protein kinase C isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1534461206,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain is found in two different splice variants; the long A-chain variant differs from the short one in that it contains a stretch of basic amino acid residues in the C-terminal part that mediates retention of the growth factor inside the producer cell and to the cell matrix. By analyzing mutants in which different amino acid residues in the retention motif had been changed to alanine residues, we found that the total positive charge of the sequence is of importance for the function of the retention motif. Moreover, we showed that retention also occurs if only one of the polypeptides in the PDGF dimer carries the retention motif. Surface iodination and competition with a peptide having the sequence of the retention motif revealed that the long A-chain variant, in contrast to the short A-chain variant, is localized on the outside of the cells and is also associated to the cell matrix. The association is likely to be mediated partially through heparan sulfate proteoglycans since treatment of matrix with heparitinase released the long A-chain variant."
https://openalex.org/W1485543948,"The involvement of phosphatidylglycerol in the SecA-independent translocation of M13 procoat in Escherichia coli was demonstrated. Processing of procoat to mature coat protein was retarded when the level of phosphatidylglycerol was reduced. In vitro translocation experiments using inner membrane vesicles isolated from a strain with inducible synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, showed that translocation of procoat and of a SecA-dependent procoat analog was proportional to the content of phosphatidylglycerol. Moreover, introduction of phosphatidylglycerol by means of a lipid transfer method into phosphatidylglycerol-depleted inner membrane vesicles, efficiently restored procoat translocation. The phosphatidylglycerol dependence in both the SecA-dependent and -independent translocation pathway indicates that phosphatidylglycerol plays a dual role in translocation. We suggest that besides membrane binding of SecA this lipid has a direct interaction with the M13 procoat in translocation across the inner membrane."

The S. kluyveri alpha-factor receptor has an approximately 2-fold higher affinity for k-alpha-f than for c-alpha-f. The S. kluyveri receptor gene (k-STE2) is incompletely regulated by S. cerevisiae mating type and poorly expressed on the surface of an S. cerevisiae mating type a strain. A chimeric receptor (c/k1) with amino acid residues 1-45 derived from S. cerevisiae and amino acid residues 46-427 from S. kluyveri exhibits the binding specificity of the S. kluyveri receptor. However, chimeric receptors containing residues 1-168 (c/k2) or 1-250 (c/k3) from S. cerevisiae and the remainder from the S. kluyveri receptor exhibit specificities similar to one another, but intermediate between the parent S. cerevisiae and S. kluyveri receptors. The relative ability of c-alpha-f and k-alpha-f to induce growth arrest in strains expressing chimeric receptors parallels relative affinity. Thus, two noncontiguous domains that include putative extracellular loops 1 and 3 and associated transmembrane segments, but exclude the extracellular NH2 terminus and loop 2, appear to contribute to alpha-factor receptor ligand specificity. COOH-terminal regions of the S. kluyveri receptor appear to confer a desensitization defect when expressed in S. cerevisiae. The S. cerevisiae receptor truncated at residue 296 retains ligand specificity for growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1561324970,"beta-Adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) is a regulatory enzyme involved in the modulation of beta-adrenergic and other G protein-coupled receptors. It has been described that beta ARK is a cytosolic protein that transiently translocates to the plasma membrane in order to specifically phosphorylate agonist-occupied receptors. In this report, we used beta ARK-specific antibodies to demonstrate that a significant amount of this kinase is present in rat liver microsomal membranes. beta ARK seems to be peripherally associated with the cytosolic side of microsomal membranes since it can be stripped from the membranes by mild salt treatment. Cell-free association experiments indicate that the interaction of beta ARK is reversible, saturable, and strongly inhibited by protease or heat treatment of the microsomes, thus suggesting that beta ARK interacts with a protein component of the microsomal membrane. Gradient fractionation studies indicate that the highest beta ARK-specific activity co-migrates with endoplasmic reticulum enzymatic markers. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy experiments performed in cultured cells using affinity-purified anti-beta ARK antibodies are consistent with this subcellular localization pattern. Taken together, our data suggest that several beta ARK pools (i.e. microsome-bound, plasma membrane-bound, and cytosolic) may exist inside the cell. Such results are in line with recent reports showing that proteins involved in plasma membrane signal transduction, such as heterotrimeric G proteins, are also associated with membranes of different intracellular organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1502970737,"Tissue factor, the cellular receptor for factor VII/VIIa, activates both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. In this analysis we have used DNase I footprinting to map the sites of protein-DNA interaction along the promoter (-383 to +8) using nuclear extracts prepared from uninduced and lipopolysaccharide-induced THP-1 cells. We have identified six regions that interact with nuclear factors in both uninduced and induced extracts. Four footprints are contained within a region reported to confer base-line high level expression and lipopolysaccharide and serum induction. Two additional footprints map to a region reported to reduce basal transcription by 50%. The only qualitative change in the footprint pattern with uninduced and induced extracts is the appearance of two hypersensitive sites with uninduced extracts. In addition, changes in the level of protein- DNA binding are detected with only one probe by DNA mobility shift analysis. A combination of well characterized transcription factors (AP1), primarily lymphoid cell specific regulatory proteins (NF-kappa B- and/or Ets-1-related proteins), as well as additional, uncharacterized proteins appear to interact with these sequences. Our data suggest that post-translational modification of existing transcription factors, and not induction of new DNA-binding activity, mediates the lipopolysaccharide induction of tissue factor synthesis in THP-1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1587460121,"Polypeptide neurotoxins from sea anemones have been useful biological probes for sodium channel function. Cationic residues, specifically Arg-14, which is conserved in essentially all known sea anemone toxins, have been generally thought to be important determinants of their binding affinity and/or efficacy. In the present study, we have constructed site-directed mutants of the Anthopleura xanthogrammica toxin anthopleurin B (ApB) at Arg-14 and Lys-48 to characterize the roles played by these cationic residues in the biological activity of the toxin. Using a bacterial expression system developed in this laboratory, we have produced recombinant proteins having three substitutions at each of these positions. The proteins produced have been purified to homogeneity and have structures and conformational stabilities identical to wild-type ApB. We have assayed the mutants by determining their ability to enhance the veratridine-dependent uptake of sodium by both N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells and RT4-B cells, which express the cardiac/denervated skeletal muscle sodium channel. All mutants showed activities only slightly reduced from that of wild-type ApB, with the greatest reductions (4- and 6-fold) being observed for the mutants R14A and K48A, respectively. We conclude that contrary to results from chemical modification studies, Arg-14 is not essential for the biological activity of the toxin. Our data also indicate that Lys-48 plays a small but discernible role in the toxin-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1597156601,"Lys15 in Escherichia coli glycogen synthase, which is specifically labeled by adenosine diphosphopyridoxal, is mainly involved in binding of the substrate ADP-glucose (Furukawa, K., Tagaya, M., Tanizawa, K., and Fukui, T. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23837-23842). We have found that the mutant glycogen synthase in which Lys15 is replaced by Gln via site-directed mutagenesis is inactivated by adenosine diphosphopyridoxal at concentrations higher than those required for the inactivation of the wild-type enzyme. ADP and ADP-glucose offered protective effects on inactivation, suggesting that the label binds to the ADP-glucose-binding site in the mutant enzyme. Sequence analysis of the labeled peptide revealed that the labeled residue is Lys277. This lysyl residue is conserved in maize starch synthase, which shows about 30% amino acid identity to E. coli glycogen synthase. Substitution of Gln for Lys277 by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a 140-fold decrease in the kcat value with little changes in the Km values for ADP-glucose and glycogen. These results suggest that Lys277 at the active site participates in the catalytic reaction rather than binding of substrate. The present study shows the usefulness of the combined application of affinity labeling and site-directed mutagenesis."

Antisense mRNA for Go and Gi2 alpha-chains suppressed by over 80% the level of the respective G protein. Go-deficient HL-60 cells had depressed functional and intracellular calcium responses to LTB4 and fMLP, but no alterations in the responses of cyclic adenosine 3‘,5‘-monophosphate (cAMP). In contrast, HL-60 cells deficient in Gi2 lost only responses of the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Antisense mRNA suppression of distinct G proteins thus may delineate some transductional requirements for cellular responses."

U.S.A. 89, 11769-11773) were used as templates in coupled replication-translation reactions. These amplifiable mRNAs contained a preselected messenger sequence embedded within the sequence of MDV-1 RNA, which is a small, naturally occurring template for Q beta replicase. When these recombinant mRNAs were incubated in vitro in reactions that contained both an Escherichia coli cell-free translation system and Q beta replicase, the encoded protein was synthesized more efficiently than in corresponding reactions that did not contain Q beta replicase. Moreover, when coupled replication-translation reactions were carried out in a continuous-flow format (Spirin, A. S., Baranov, V. I., Ryabova, L. A., Ovodov, S. Yu., and Alakhov, Yu. B. (1988) Science 242, 1162-1164), the synthesis of biologically active protein continued for a prolonged period. The results suggest that the mechanism of replication and translation in coupled reactions is similar to the mechanism by which Q beta phage genomic RNA is simultaneously replicated and translated in Q beta-infected E. coli: protein synthesis occurs on nascent RNA strands; many more sense strands are synthesized than antisense strands; and the integrity of the messenger sequence is preserved because a relatively small number of antisense strands serve as master templates for the synthesis of new messenger strands."
https://openalex.org/W1583591924,"Expression of mouse mammary tumor virus in T lymphocytes appears to be required for accession of horizontally transmitted virus to the mammary gland. Further, deletions in the long terminal repeat which relax constraints on viral transcription promote T cell lymphoma. We have identified a polypurine transcriptional repressor element (NRE1) that is deleted from viruses that induce T cell lymphoma. NRE1 binding activity in nuclear extracts proved to be related to a growth inhibitory activity that represses c-myc expression in mature B cells. Mobility shift, DNA footprinting, and UV cross-linking identified three factors that interacted preferentially with double-stranded NRE1 or the separated single strands. NRE1 binding factor (NBF) (80 kDa) bound double and upper strand NRE1, apparently in concert with NRE1 associated factor (NAF) (95 kDa), which interacted directly with DNA only on the upper strand. NRE1 lower strand binding factor (NLF) (50 kDa) cross-linked specifically to lower strand NRE1. On sucrose gradients NBF, NAF, and NLF binding activities cosedimented at 8 S, implying an in vitro association of the 50-, 80-, and 95-kDa factors which precedes DNA binding. Therefore, NRE1 appears to be the site of action of a complex transcriptional repressor comprised of at least three factors that interact differentially with each DNA strand to repress steroid hormone-induced transcription of mouse mammary tumor virus in T cells."

To begin to analyze the mechanisms regulating the sorting of this protein and the regulation during development of the expression of the encoding gene, we have cloned and sequenced a 2.6-kilobase (kb) cDNA which contains a complete 2463-nucleotide open reading frame coding for beta-glucosidase. Conceptual translation of this open reading frame predicts a polypeptide similar in molecular mass to the primary translation product of 94 kDa that also contains the same amino acid sequences of two V8 protease derived-peptides generated from the purified beta-glucosidase enzyme. The D. discoideum enzyme contained regions highly homologous at the amino acid sequence level to both bacterial and fungal beta-glucosidases, although these regions did not overlap. A potential cleavable signal sequence was also found in the first 21 amino acids followed by a highly polar stretch of 49 amino acids which (based on amino acid sequencing of the mature beta-glucosidase) represents a pro region for this protein. This region is similar in location, size, and charge to the D. discoideum alpha-mannosidase pro-I region (Schatzle, J., Bush, J., and Cardelli, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4000-4007). Several small hydrophobic stretches of amino acids were also distributed throughout the protein; however, no obvious transmembrane region(s) were identified which might explain the observed membrane association of the precursor protein. Finally, Northern blot analysis indicated that the gene encoding this enzyme was under developmental regulation. The steady state level of a 2.7-kb beta-glucosidase mRNA decreased significantly during the aggregation stage of development, from high levels during growth, and then increased in the form of a larger size 2.8-kb mRNA during the final stages of development."
https://openalex.org/W1710551139,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the role of ions other than Ca2+ in hepatic responses to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation. We report that the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor activation of hepatic functions is accompanied by extracellular acidification and an increase in intracellular pH. These effects are dependent on extracellular Na+ concentration and are inhibited by the Na+/H+ antiporter blocker 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride under conditions that preclude antagonistic effects on agonist binding. Thus, the activation of plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange is an essential feature of the hepatic alpha-adrenoreceptor-coupled signaling pathway. The following observations indicate that the sustained hepatic alpha 1-adrenergic actions rely on a functional coupling between the plasma membrane Na+/H+ and Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, resulting in the stimulation of Ca2+ influx. 1) Inhibition of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase does not prevent the alpha 1-adrenergic effects. However, alpha 1-adrenoreceptor stimulation fails to induce intracellular alkalinization and to acidify the extracellular medium in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. 2) A non-receptor-induced increase in intracellular Na+ concentration, caused by the ionophore monensin, stimulates Ca2+ influx and increases vascular resistance. 3) Inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange prevents, in a concentration-dependent manner, most of the alpha 1-agonist-induced responses. 4) The actions of Ca(2+)-mobilizing vasoactive peptide receptors or alpha 2-adrenoreceptors, which produce neither sustained extracellular acidification nor release of Ca2+, are insensitive to Na+/H+ exchange blockers."
