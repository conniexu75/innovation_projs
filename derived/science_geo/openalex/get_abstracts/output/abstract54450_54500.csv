https://openalex.org/W1558093451,"Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthetase I has been purified and obtained essentially free of phosphorylase, phosphorylase kinase, and glycogen synthetase kinase. Using the purified glycogen synthetase as substrate, it was determined that two separable adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase fractions from skeletal muscle each catalyze the conversion of glycogen synthetase I to glycogen synthetase D; activity changes during the reaction correlate closely with the uptake of phosphate by glycogen synthetase. These same protein kinase fractions also catalyze the cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation and activation of phosphorylase kinase. The specific activities of the two protein kinase fractions towards phosphorylation of glycogen synthetase and phosphorylase kinase were enriched equally during purification. Further evidence that phosphorylase kinase phosphorylation and glycogen synthetase phosphorylation are common activities of the same enzyme was obtained by studying heat inactivation of the protein kinase, destabilization by cyclic AMP, inhibition by a protein inhibitor, and the cyclic nucleotide specificity. Evidence is presented that the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase acts directly on glycogen synthetase I and not through a second kinase as occurs in the phosphorylase activation system. Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthetase I sediments as a single peak with an s20, w of 14.3. Preliminary studies indicate that the enzyme probably exists as a tetramer composed of subunits having a molecular weight between 90,000 and 100,000. On conversion of the I form to the D form, the enzyme incorporates 1 mole of phosphate per 91,000 g of protein."

https://openalex.org/W1567637403,"Abstract The regulation of enzymatic activity of several enzymes involved in glycogen breakdown has been investigated in a skeletal muscle fraction containing a protein-glycogen complex and elements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In this fraction, phosphorylase is entirely in its inactive b form since phosphorylase kinase itself is totally inactive while phosphorylase phosphatase is fully active. Addition of Mg-ATP and Ca2+ triggers an immediate of phosphorylase (b to a conversion) resulting from kinase activation; no occurs with Mg-ATP alone. As soon as all the ATP has been consumed, phosphorylase a is rapidly reconverted to the b form by the phosphatase, and the over-all process can be repeated many times by successive readditions of ATP; this reaction cycle is referred to as flash activation of phosphorylase. The Ca2+ of kinase is reversed by chelation of the metal ion and, therefore, not the result of proteolytic attack by the calcium-dependent kinase-activating factor. Half-maximum of kinase in this system requires 2 x 10-6 m free Ca2+ (in contrast to approximately 10-7 m calcium for purified kinase solutions), i.e. the same Ca2+ concentration needed to trigger muscle contraction. Activation by Ca2+ resulted in a 13-fold increase in affinity of phosphorylase kinase for phosphorylase b. No evidence was obtained that it was mediated or accompanied by a phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase. Only slight (20%) and delayed of endogenous phosphorylase b was produced by Mg-ATP and 10-5 m cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the absence of added Ca2+, although a 6-fold increase in kinase activity was measured in the usual assay system (at high dilution of phosphorylase kinase and in the presence of purified phosphorylase b). Disruption of the protein-glycogen complex by α-amylase digestion increased the affinity of phosphorylase kinase for Ca2+ 10-fold to the same level observed with the purified enzyme. Readdition of glycogen reversed this effect. Addition of 1 mm glucose-6-P suppressed the flash activation of phosphorylase both by a direct inhibition of the phosphorylase kinase reaction and, indirectly, by increasing the utilization of ATP. Furthermore, activated phosphorylase produced during the reaction was itself partially inhibited by glucose-6-P indicating that phospho-dephospho hybrids (rather than fully phosphorylated phosphorylase a) had been produced. Such hybrids were generated only in the intact (not in the disrupted) protein-glycogen complex."

https://openalex.org/W1972742800,"A major polar metabolite of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) obtained from chick intestines is over four times as effective as cholecalciferol and over two times as effective as 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in stimulating intestinal calcium transport 24 hours after administration. Following a considerable lag, cholecalciferol and its 25-hydroxy derivative produce a maximum stimulation of the transport response at 24 to 48 hours. The polar intestinal metabolite greatly shortens this lag, stimulating maximum calcium transport by 9 hours. At 9 hours this metabolite is at least 13 times as active as the parent cholecalciferol and as such is a likely candidate for the biologically active form of cholecalciferol in the intestine."

https://openalex.org/W1593185101,"The stoichiometry and dissociation constant of the binary rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase-manganese(II) complex have been investigated in the temperature range 5–37° by monitoring the amount of Mn(II) free in solution utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry. The results have been interpreted in terms of an equilibrium mixture of two conformational forms of the enzyme, one which has four binding sites for Mn(II) (active) and another which does not bind Mn(II) (inactive). The equilibrium is affected by monovalent ions; potassium, an activator of the pyruvate kinase reaction, stabilizes the active form as compared to the enzymatically inert tetramethylammonium ion. Longitudinal proton relaxation rates of water in solutions of pyruvate kinase and Mn(II) have been measured by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry as a function of temperature (5–37°) and frequency (8 to 60.0 MHz) in order to gain some insight into the mechanism of relaxation and to determine the number of protein ligands to the metal. The proton relaxation rates due to bound Mn(II), highly enhanced relative to the Mn(II) aquo-ion, have been analyzed according to the Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan scheme. The rationale and method of analysis are presented in detail. Unlike the Mn(II) aquo-ion for which the relevant correlation time for the interaction between Mn(II) and the water protons is the rotational time and consequently frequency-independent, it has been found that the relevant correlation time for proton relaxation of water in the vicinity of bound Mn(II) is, at least in part, frequency-dependent. The frequency-dependent component is identified with the longitudinal electron spin relaxation time of the bound Mn(II) and the other component with the mean residence time of a water molecule in the first hydration sphere, i.e. the reciprocal of the water ligand exchange rate. From the results the number of water molecules coordinated to Mn(II) bound to pyruvate kinase has been estimated to be 3. It may be concluded that the enzyme probably provides three ligands for Mn(II) and thus the conformational changes previously detected by protein difference spectroscopy due to the binding of a divalent metal ion may be rationalized. Although the binding constant of the binary Mn(II)-enzyme complex varies upon substitution of tetramethylammonium for potassium ion, the enhancement of the proton relaxation rate of water for the binary complex is invariant with monovalent ion."

This inhibition is much stronger than the previously described inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase by ATP. The α,β-methylenephosphonate analogue of ADP is an exceptionally powerful inhibitor of the enzyme. The enzyme possesses three pH optima. The lowest of these optima is observed only when the enzyme is not inhibited by buffer anions; the highest is observed only in the presence of magnesium ions."

https://openalex.org/W1861862210,"Abstract This study describes a new type of inhibition of phosphorylase phosphatase that strongly suggests that the activity of this enzyme is modulated during regulation of the phosphorylase system. Phosphorylase phosphatase included in a muscle protein-glycogen complex along with phosphorylase, phosphorylase kinase, and other enzymes of glycogen metabolism undergoes a reversible inhibition when phosphorylase is activated. This inhibition requires free Ca2+ in addition to Mg-ATP, i.e. the same conditions that trigger phosphorylase activation; it is observed only in the intact protein-glycogen complex. It is not caused by AMP or IMP generated from the rapid breakdown of ATP, two nucleotides known to inhibit the phosphorylase phosphatase reaction by binding to the substrate phosphorylase a. (a) Addition of AMP or IMP to the particulate system is without effect; (b) phosphatase activity returns to normal at the end of an activation cycle of phosphorylase when concentration of IMP is maximum; and (c) the same inhibition pattern is observed when a phosphopeptide derived from phosphorylase a is used as substrate, a reaction not affected by AMP or IMP. Digestion of glycogen in the complex by α-amylase abolishes the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of phosphorylase phosphatase, but the activity of this enzyme is still predominantly unaffected by nucleotides. On the other hand, dissociation of the protein-glycogen complex by dilution brings about both a loss of the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the phosphatase and the reappearance of its sensitivity to AMP or IMP. Phosphorylase phosphatase included in the complex acts on phosphorylase a endogenously produced by addition of Ca2+, Mg2+, and ATP 16-fold faster than on soluble phosphorylase a added to the system. Nevertheless, the phosphatase reaction on the exogenous substrate still remains unaffected by high concentrations of AMP or IMP. No evidence was obtained that during inhibition the enzyme was covalently modified, e.g. by phosphorylation; rather, it is proposed that this inhibition results from the interaction of phosphorylase phosphatase with some of the other components of the phosphorylase system."
https://openalex.org/W1484806845,"Abstract A method for isolating brush borders from rat kidney homogenates has been developed. Minced tissue, 27 g, is gently homogenized in 20 mm sodium or potassium bicarbonate, pH 8.1. The diluted homogenate, containing large fragments of brush borders, is filtered and then fractionated with the use of combined differential, isopycnic, and rate-zonal centrifugations. The purity of the final brush border fraction is documented with both morphological and enzymatic studies. Electron micrographs of the final brush border fraction show microvilli profiles with few cytoplasmic contaminants. Alkaline phosphatase assays show a 15-fold increase in specific activity of the brush border fraction relative to the starting homogenate. Acid phosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase, and succinate cytochrome c reductase studies are consistent with contamination rates of 0.04% for lysosomes, 0.2% for microsomes, and 7% for mitochondria. Calculations based on recovery of total alkaline phosphatase activity indicate that the procedure recovers 21% of the alkaline phosphatase present in the starting homogenate. The final brush border pellet obtained from 27 g of whole kidney has a wet weight of 0.27 g and a protein content of 20 mg."

https://openalex.org/W1563395660,"Abstract When polymorphonuclear leukocytes were incubated in medium without glucose for 1 hour, glycogen content declined at an essentially constant rate, whereas with 10 mm glucose there was no net change in glycogen during this period. Intracellular glucose 6-phosphate rose during the first 10 min of incubation in both media, but the rate was more than doubled in the presence of glucose. At the same time, ATP levels tended to be higher and those of AMP and orthophosphate lower when glucose was present in the medium than in its absence. The concentration of cyclic AMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) decreased by about 45% in 5 min whether or not glucose was present. The percentage of glycogen synthetase in the glucose-6-P-independent form was slightly but significantly higher in cells incubated for 10 min with glucose, whereas the total activity was not influenced by the presence of glucose in the medium. Glucose caused a rapid (5 min) decrease in phosphorylase activity which remained depressed for about 30 min and then rose gradually reaching the control level in 60 min. 2-Deoxyglucose procuced a greater depression which was maintained for 60 min. When cells were incubated with latex particles (in the absence of glucose), the rate of glycogen breakdown was accelerated during the first 15 min, but afterward (when phagocytosis was completed), approximated that of the resting cells. During phagocytosis, there was a delay in the accumulation of glucose-6-P, but levels of ATP, ADP, AMP, Pi, cyclic AMP, phosphorylase, and glycogen synthetase (glucose-6-P independent and total) were not significantly different from those in resting cells during the first 15 min. Theophylline, 1 mm, decreased leukocyte phosphorylase activity by 36% in 5 min without altering levels of cyclic AMP or the activation state of glycogen synthetase. Prostaglandin E1 in the presence of theophylline increased phosphorylase activity and cyclic AMP levels and decreased the percentage of glucose-6-P-independent glycogen synthetase. The effect of prostaglandin E1 on phosphorylase activity was observed whether or not either glucose or theophylline, or both, was present in the medium. In cells incubated with 20 mm NaF plus theophylline, levels of phosphorylase and cyclic AMP were increased. In the absence of theophylline, NaF decreased the percentage of glucose-6-P-independent glycogen synthetase and had no measurable effect on cyclic AMP levels. Neither NaF nor prostaglandin E1 significantly increased net glycogen breakdown in 1 hour of incubation. Although the leukocyte phosphorylase and glycogen synthetase activities can be influenced by agents acting through the cyclic AMP system, exogenous glucose modifies the activity of these enzymes without changing cyclic AMP levels. The marked acceleration in glycogen breakdown associated with phagocytosis is probably secondary to increased utilization of glucose-6-P and is not accompanied by changes in these enzymes or in cyclic AMP concentrations. Some data on the effects of glucose-6-P, Mg++, ATP, and orthophosphate on leukocyte glycogen synthetase activity are reported."

https://openalex.org/W1544859671,"Abstract Activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pyruvate + DPN+ + HSCoA → acetyl-SCoA + DPNH + CO2 + H+) of Escherichia coli is stimulated by glycolytic intermediates. Fructose-di-P is the most effective modifier, and activity is enhanced also by fructose-6-P, glyceraldehyde-3-P, phosphoenolpyruvate, dihydroxyacetone-P, and glucose-6-P. These effects are exerted on the pyruvate decarboxylase component of the complex. Fructose-di-P overcomes the inhibition resulting from a high value of the adenylate energy charge. The activity of the complex is modulated also by the oxidation level of the DPN+-DPNH pool, increasing steeply with increase in the DPN+ mole fraction in the physiological range around 0.8. The responses to the adenylate energy charge, the DPN+ mole fraction, and the acetyl coenzyme A concentration are in the right direction, and the interactions are of the right type, to suggest that modulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity contributes to the stabilization of these parameters in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1514206625,"Dibutyryl 3',5'-AMP, an analogue of 3',5'-AMP, mimics some of the actions of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) on the thyroid. Both substances increase glucose-1-14C oxidation to 14CO2 in the dog. Dibutyryl 3',5'-AMP is active over the range of 10 to 250 µg per ml. Dibutyryl 3',5'-AMP, like low concentrations of TSH, decreases glucose-1-14C oxidation in bovine thyroid, and both substances increase 32Pi incorporation into phospholipid in bovine thyroid, although the dibutyryl 3',5'-AMP effect can only be detected in 50% of the experiments. However, unlike TSH, dibutyryl 3',5'-AMP fails to increase the incorporation of 32Pi or inositol-3H into phospholipid in dog thyroid slices. It also fails to increase glucose-1-14C oxidation to 14CO2 in rat thyroids. The significance of these findings in relation to the proposed role of 3',5'-AMP as the intracellular mediator of TSH action is discussed. The increase in glucose oxidation produced by TSH and dibutyryl 3',5'-AMP in normal dog thyroid slices fails to occur in lecithinase C-treated slices. Thus the site of lecithinase C action is probably distal to the site of action of TSH and dibutyryl 3',5'-AMP. TSH also fails to increase phospholipid turnover in lecithinase C-treated slices."
https://openalex.org/W1581656862,"Abstract Cytochrome oxidase, as prepared by the Yonetani method, is shown to have a molecular weight of 200,000 (±5%). At alkaline pH (from pH 9.5 to 11, 0.01 m phosphate, 0.1% nonionic detergent) the enzyme dissociates to a monomer species with a molecular weight of 100,000 (±5%). Qualitative results are presented to show that the rate of conversion of dimer to monomer is slow but strongly pH dependent. Between pH 9.5 and 10.5 a mixture of monomer and dimer is obtained when incubation at 4° is relatively short (≤10 hours), but the conversion is essentially complete upon standing at pH 10.5 for 24 hours. Although monomer preparations can be obtained which appear to be mono-disperse from Archibald studies, the dimer isolated at neutral pH contains a small and probably variable amount of the monomer."

https://openalex.org/W1488811017,"Abstract When a mixture of coenzyme B12 (5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin) and ethanolamine ammonia-lyase is denatured with hot propanol after a 30-sec incubation, 1.5% of the coenzyme is released in a form in which the carbon-cobalt bond is dissociated. The fraction of dissociated coenzyme rises to 3.6% when substrate or product is present in the incubation. In the absence of enzyme, the coenzyme remains intact. Reversibility of dissociation is suggested by the observation that dissociation of the coenzyme is decreased by two-thirds when the enzyme is denatured with tetrahydrofuran. If the process were irreversible, the same amount of dissociated cofactor would be released regardless of the method of denaturation, while with a reversible reaction the amount of dissociated cofactor released on denaturation could vary depending on the relative susceptibility to denaturation of the (enzyme-intact coenzyme) and (enzyme-dissociated coenzyme) complexes. The adenosyl fragment derived from coenzyme dissociated in the presence of substrate is chromatographically identical with 5'-deoxyadenosine. In the absence of substrate, a number of products are observed, including adenosine 5'-aldehyde and a compound which behaves like 5',8-cycloadenosine. These results suggest that (a) rupture of the carbon-cobalt bond is an integral part of the reaction mechanism; (b) carbon-cobalt bond rupture and hydrogen transfer are homolytic processes; and (c) enzyme-bound 5'-deoxyadenosine is an intermediate in the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1606640152,"Abstract A carbamyl phosphate synthetase has been detected and partially characterized in hepatopancreas tissue of the land snail Strophocheilus oblongus. The enzyme is localized in mitochondria, utilizes l-glutamine, and shows an absolute requirement for N-acetyl-l-glutamate. This unique combination of properties distinguishes the snail enzyme from either of the previously described animal carbamyl phosphate synthetases, carbamyl phosphate synthetase I and carbamyl phosphate synthetase II. The snail enzyme was measured as the fixation of 14C-bicarbonate into citrulline in the presence of excess l-ornithine and ornithine transcarbamylase. ATP and Mg2+ are also required in the reaction; optimal activity is obtained when the Mg2+:ATP ratio is 2. When this ratio is maintained, saturation with ATP occurs at approximately 5 mm. The Km of the enzyme for l-glutamine is estimated to be 2.5 mm and for N-acetylglutamate, 0.3 mm. The major portion of carbamyl phosphate synthetase activity is localized in the mitochondrial fraction of the snail tissue and, since this is also the fraction in which ornithine transcarbamylase occurs, the enzyme is presumed to function in arginine biosynthesis. Aspartate transcarbamylase occurs in the cytosol of the tissue but the amount of carbamyl phosphate synthetase that can be measured in this fraction is negligible. The snail carbamyl phosphate synthetase may thus also function in pyrimidine biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1524017588,"Bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase has been accepted as a metalloprotein containing an essential zinc atom, based on inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline and the detection of zinc by emission spectroscopy. In contrast, the present study shows by the more sensitive method of atomic absorption spectrophotometry that the enzyme contains only 0.02 g atom of zinc per mole of peptide chain (mol wt 50,000) after gel filtration in Tris acetate buffer. A further reduction in the zinc content to 0.002 g atom per mole of peptide is accomplished without decrease in enzymatic activity or the ability to undergo reversible association, by gel filtration in the same buffer with added EDTA or phosphate. The low, nonstoichiometric content of zinc and the lack of proportionality between metal content and enzymatic activity show that zinc is not an integral part of this enzyme. The zinc-free enzyme is inhibited 50% by 4.7 x 10-3 m 1, 10-phenanthroline, indicating that this effect is not attributable to chelation. Glutamate dehydrogenase is inhibited by extrinsic zinc (K i = 3 x 10-7 m ) and under similar conditions binds 1 g atom of zinc per peptide chain. The affinity of the enzyme for zinc is enhanced by the presence of DPNH. Apparent cooperative interaction is observed between zinc binding sites in the presence, but not the absence, of coenzyme. Although not an essential constituent of the enzyme, zinc may function as an allosteric modifier."
https://openalex.org/W1485368150,"Abstract The deoxythymidine diphosphate d-glucose oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli is a protein of molecular weight 78,000, containing 1 mole of firmly bound DPN per mole of enzyme. Treatment of the enzyme with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate followed by removal of the mercurial with dithiothreitol releases bound DPN, and dissociates the protein into subunits of molecular weight 40,000, as determined by gel chromatography. This process is fully reversible. Inactive dimeric protein (mole wt 78,000) can also be formed by allowing the apoenzyme to react with the DPN analogue adenosine diphosphate ribose. The kinetics of reactivation of the apoenzyme with DPN suggests that the apoenzyme binds DPN with a dissociation constant of approximately 5 x 10-6 at 16° and 5 x 10-4 at 37°, followed by a slow conformational change (measured in minutes) to yield active enzyme. The apoenzyme appears to retain the substrate-binding site. Deoxythymidine diphosphate (a substrate analogue) specifically inhibits the rate of apoenzyme reactivation, and this inhibition can be reversed by the substrate deoxythymidine diphosphate glucose. The substrate analogue deoxythymidine diphosphate 6-deoxy-d-glucose reacts with enzyme to yield enzyme-DPNH and deoxythymidine diphosphate 4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, the normal product of the reaction. The release of this product from enzyme-DPNH is, however, slower by at least three orders of magnitude, depending on temperature, pH, and ionic strength, than the release of the same product from enzyme-DPN in the normal catalytic reaction. The role of DPN and DPNH in the structure of the enzyme is discussed in the light of these observations."
https://openalex.org/W1989120005,Cells cultured from young (6-day) chicken embryos differ from those of older (13-day) embryos in having a greater susceptibility to infection by certain viruses and a considerably lesser sensitivity to the action of interferon. These circumstances parallel those observed in the intact embryo. The addition of a small percentage of cells from young embryos alters the response of cells cultured from older embryos by increasing viral susceptibility sevenfold and decreasing sensitivity to interferon 25-fold. We postulate that a repressor which inhibits the expression of interferon in older embryonic cells is elaborated by cells from young embryos.

https://openalex.org/W1552367612,"Abstract The spectroscopic and enzymatic properties of a monomeric form of cytochrome oxidase are described and compared with those of the enzyme dimer. The dimer form of the enzyme, isolated by the Yonetani method, is dissociated into a monomer at alkaline pH (pH 9.5 to 11.0) in a medium containing a nonionic detergent such as Emasol. The data show that with several preparations of the enzyme the monomeric form retains 83 to 97% of the catalytic activity of the dimer. Ultrafiltration experiments with the use of a membrane that is able to discriminate between monomer and dimer demonstrate that reassociation to the dimeric form, under conditions closely approaching those used in the assay, is too slow to account for the observed activity. Therefore, in buffers containing nonionic detergents, exposure of cytochrome oxidase to alkaline pH in the range of 9.5 to 11.0 does not lead to denaturation. The absorption spectra of the monomer form show that the γ-Fe2+ maximum is at 441 nm and the α-Fe2+ maximum at 604 to 605 nm. The maxima for the γ-Fe2+-CO and α-Fe2+-CO bands are at 430 to 431 nm and 604 to 605 nm, respectively. The α-band of the Fe2+-CO monomer is completely symmetrical, with no shoulder at 593 nm. The γ-Fe2+-CO band of the monomer is only slightly asymmetric and lacks the 444 nm shoulder present in the typical cytochrome aa3 (i.e. dimer) spectrum. A solution of the monomer was found to react with approximately twice as much carbon monoxide as a solution of the monomer of equal heme A content. Thus, in present terminology, the monomer appears to have many of the properties attributed to cytochrome a3 in the typical cytochrome aa3 preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1554836767,"Abstract The fluorescence emission of the hydrophobic probe, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate, was markedly increased in the presence of rabbit liver fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. Substrate produced a specific and reversible decrease in the fluorescence yield, which was linearly related to the amount of bound fructose-1,6-di-P. The fluorophore was very weakly bound to the phosphatase (Kdiss = 1.5 x 10-4 m). Addition of substrate did not change this binding constant but lowered the maximum emission yield. A very close agreement was found among the following constants for enzyme-substrate interaction: Km, Kdiss, and the substrate concentrations needed for half-maximal binding of AMP and for half-maximal fluorescence quenching. The fluorescence quenching of the enzyme-dye complex is further evidence for a substrate-induced change in protein conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1608728783,"Abstract Bakers' yeast cytochrome c was spin labeled with N-(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolidinyl)-bromoacetamide at the cysteine residue. The optical properties of the spin-labeled cytochrome c were similar to those of the native protein. The electron-transfer activity of the modified cytochrome c in the mitochondrial NADH oxidase system was 100%. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of either ferri- or ferrocytochrome c indicated weak immobilization of the spin label. Upon mixing with cytochrome c peroxidase, the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the labeled cytochrome c was only slightly broadened. The incorporation of the spin-labeled cytochrome c into electron transport particles resulted in a greater immobilization of the label. The latter interaction was quite sensitive to the ionic strength of the suspending medium when the cytochrome c was bound to the outside of the particles. On the other hand, the spin-labeled cytochrome c either in solution or loaded to the inside of the particles was insensitive to the ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1529852090,"Abstract A culture medium, which contains biotin l-sulfoxide as the sole substrate, does not support the growth of a soil pseudomonad that is known to utilize biotin as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Both the relative rate and extent of transport of 14C-biotin and 14C-biotin analogues by 0.9% NaCl solution-washed cells grown in medium containing biotin as the only substrate are indicated by the following series: biotin sulfone ≥ biotin l-sulfoxide g biotin d-sulfoxide g biotin g dethiobiotin. These results indicate that transport of l-sulfoxide into the cell is not the process that limits the rate of growth of the pseudomonad. A culture medium containing 60% of carbonyl-labeled biotin l-sulfoxide and 40% of unlabeled biotin supports the growth of the bacteria until all of the biotin in the medium is utilized. On depletion of biotin, radioactivity loss ceases and a new 14C-metabolite appears. On the 16th day of incubation, approximately 25% of the remaining material, which is sensitive to the color-producing p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde, is the metabolite.

https://openalex.org/W1592810308,"Abstract Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) is required for the synthesis of lac mRNA and β-galactosidase in Escherichia coli and cell-free extracts. Competition hybridization experiments, described in this report, show that the concentrations of lac mRNA in E. coli are controlled by AMP, as well as by inducer. Both transient and permanent repression by glucose affect lac mRNA production and are reversed by AMP. In an adenyl cyclase-deficient mutant strain, lac mRNA is not synthesized until the cells are supplied with AMP. A mutant strain lacking a recently described cyclic AMP receptor protein does not make lac mRNA despite exogenous AMP. We conclude that AMP, AMP receptor protein, an intact promoter locus, and other unidentified factor or factors are necessary for efficient transcription of the lac operon."
https://openalex.org/W2044639904,"MEASUREMENTS of the extent of shrinkage of membranes which results from hydrolysis of phospholipid components by phospholipase C provide a direct indication of the area occupied by lipid in cell membranes. Maximum treatment of erythrocyte ghosts with phospholipase C (Clostridium welchii) liberates approximately 70% of the membrane phospholipid phosphorus and the surface area of the ghosts is decreased by 45–55% as calculated from diameter measurements made on spherical ghosts observed by phase contrast microscopy1 and more recently from ghost volume measurements by an exclusion technique involving the use of 14C labelled sucrose. There is strong evidence that the phospholipid molecule as a whole is displaced from the membrane but the fate of the other membrane lipids is not established although it has been demonstrated that a residual lipoprotein structure persists. To indicate the quantitative significance of the observations, however, we have assumed that all lipids are removed in the same proportions as for the phospholipid. The observed shrinkage of the membrane by 50% would then be attributed to the loss of 70% of the membrane lipid. This would indicate that lipid occupies an area corresponding to 100 × 50/70 = 70% of the overall membrane area. Should any lipid be displaced to a lesser extent, then the figure for the area occupied by lipid would be increased to more than 70%."
https://openalex.org/W1561789462,"Abstract Adenosine 5'-triphosphate-glucose and phosphoenolpyruvate-glucose phosphotransferase activities of rat liver microsomes have been studied. Evidence for the common identity of these activities with classical d-glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.9) is presented. All activities were equally susceptible to mild heating. Both phosphate compounds inhibited the hydrolysis of glucose 6-phosphate competitively, and Ki values thus assessed agreed closely with Km values for these relatively abundant high energy phosphate compounds functioning as phosphoryl donors in their respective synthetic reactions. The pH optima for both phosphotransferase activities, approximately 4.5 in the absence of detergent, were significantly shifted towards neutrality by the cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (cetrimide) and by palmityl coenzyme A. Kinetic studies at pH 5.5 revealed that Km (and Ki) values for phosphate substrates (but not glucose) were quite markedly altered by variations in ionic strength or cetrimide concentrations. In contrast, Vmax values were little affected. Responses of levels of ATP-glucose phosphotransferase activity to experimental diabetes, insulin or cortisone therapy, adrenalectomy, and acute fasting were studied with fresh microsomal suspensions and with such preparations to which deoxycholate had been added. The patterns of response observed were in all instances fully comparable with those previously noted with inorganic pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase activity. Relative levels of the subject activities were compared with other hydrolytic and synthetic activities of the enzyme. It is concluded that physiologically significant roles for these activities are feasible, but because of the comparatively low levels of activities with ATP and phosphopyruvate and their acid pH optima, such roles, if manifest, are likely to be highly specialized."
https://openalex.org/W1535206553,"Abstract The nonheme iron containing dioxygenase, cysteamine oxygenase, has been studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The EPR spectrum of the native enzyme shows a signal at g = 4.3, typical of high spin Fe(III) in a ligand field of rhombic symmetry. The intensity of this signal indicates that nearly all of the iron in the enzyme is in the ferric state. The g = 4.3 signal is modified, but not reduced, by addition of the substrate cysteamine in the absence of oxygen; in the presence of activator sulfide ion a new signal appears at g = 7.25. These results indicate changes of the environment of the iron. These changes are specific and fully reversible. It is proposed that the nonheme iron is involved in the catalytic action of cysteamine oxygenase."

https://openalex.org/W1542635335,"Abstract In studying the control of thyroidal phosphatide metabolism it was found that osmotic shock could stimulate the 32P incorporation into lipids of surviving thyroid slices. The nature of this effect and its relation to thyrotropin stimulation of phosphatide turnover was examined by first incubating calf thyroid slices in hypotonic or isotonic medium for 15 min and then transferring the slices to isotonic medium containing 32PO4. After 1 hour the specific activities of the lipid-32P and of the ATP-γ-32P were measured. Hypotonic preliminary incubation increases the specific activity of the ATP-γ-32P, presumably by increasing the entry of 32PO4 into the cell. However, when the specific activities of the phosphatides are corrected for these changes in their precursor, an additional stimulatory effect on lipid-32P can be demonstrated. Examination of individual phosphatides shows that the most prominent effect is an increase in the specific activities of phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl ethanolamine. The specific activity of phosphoinositide is decreased. This pattern of response to osmotic shock is different from the pattern of thyrotropin stimulation in which phosphoinositide specific activity is primarily increased. Furthermore, osmotic shock inhibits the response to thyrotropin. The effect of osmotic shock bears some similarity to the effects of sphingomyelinase on thyroid slices and may represent a membrane repair reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1548834727,"Abstract An analysis of the conformational states of fructose 1,6diphosphatase by the circular dichroism technique has been performed. It has been shown that the enzyme presents a strong rigidity of its over-all conformation. The addition of either the substrate or the allosteric inhibitor, AMP, or changes in the pH of the medium, do not produce significant modifications of the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. The same situation holds even in 0.05 m sodium dodecyl sulfate, a condition in which the quaternary structure of the enzyme undergoes a profound modification. Small conformational changes have been detected, however, after the addition of the substrate and of AMP. These changes appear to be restricted to a limited number of tyrosyl and, at maximum, to a few vicinal residues. It is concluded that the catalytic and regulatory functioning of the enzyme do not require substantial alterations in the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein, but are related to changes in the ionization of amino acid residues and to subtle variations of the quaternary structure."
