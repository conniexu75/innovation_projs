https://openalex.org/W2007473771,"Polycrystalline samples of the chalcopyrites CulnS(2), CulnSe(2), and CulnSSe were Prepared from stoichiometric mixtures of the pure elements by microwave irradiation. The reactions were performed in sealed quartz tubes in as few as 3 minutes. The products were analyzed by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface morphology and shape of the particles produced by this method suggest that the products are formed from liquid melts. This method could be applied to the production of bulk chalcopyrite as sources for thin film growth."

https://openalex.org/W2091471804,"IN No. 277 of SCIENCE, I stated that the MgCl2 solution used in my experiments
 on artificial parthenogenesis was a 20/8n solution. I have since found that the assistant
 who made the Mg-solution used and who has left the laboratory must have made a mistake as
 the solution contained only about 120 g. of MgCl2 in a liter. This does not
 affect my results, but might be an obstacle to the successful repetition of my experiments
 by others."
