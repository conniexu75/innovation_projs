https://openalex.org/W1987329700,"Evidence is presented that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is regulated by the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR). Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that have a central role in innate immunity. Here Geun-Shik Lee et al. present evidence that activation of inflammasomes containing the Nod-like receptor NLRP3 is regulated by the calcium-sensing receptor CASR, mediated by increased intracellular Ca2+ and decreased cellular cyclic AMP. Mutations in the gene coding for NLRP3 cause cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), a group of rare, inherited, autoinflammatory diseases, and these findings point to the involvement of Ca2+ and cyclic AMP in the pathogenesis of CAPS. This suggests a range of potential new targets for CAPS therapy, and perhaps for other inflammatory conditions in which NLRP3 inflammasomes have been implicated, including gout, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Mutations in the gene encoding NLRP3 cause a spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases known as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS)1. NLRP3 is a key component of one of several distinct cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes (inflammasomes) that mediate the maturation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by activating caspase-1. Although several models for inflammasome activation, such as K+ efflux2, generation of reactive oxygen species3 and lysosomal destabilization4, have been proposed, the precise molecular mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as well as the mechanism by which CAPS-associated mutations activate NLRP3, remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the murine calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, mediated by increased intracellular Ca2+ and decreased cellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). Ca2+ or other CASR agonists activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in the absence of exogenous ATP, whereas knockdown of CASR reduces inflammasome activation in response to known NLRP3 activators. CASR activates the NLRP3 inflammasome through phospholipase C, which catalyses inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate production and thereby induces release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores. The increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ promotes the assembly of inflammasome components, and intracellular Ca2+ is required for spontaneous inflammasome activity in cells from patients with CAPS. CASR stimulation also results in reduced intracellular cAMP, which independently activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. cAMP binds to NLRP3 directly to inhibit inflammasome assembly, and downregulation of cAMP relieves this inhibition. The binding affinity of cAMP for CAPS-associated mutant NLRP3 is substantially lower than for wild-type NLRP3, and the uncontrolled mature IL-1β production from CAPS patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells is attenuated by increasing cAMP. Taken together, these findings indicate that Ca2+ and cAMP are two key molecular regulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome that have critical roles in the molecular pathogenesis of CAPS."

Although these hold promise as potential biomarkers of therapeutic response, their identification and quantification remain challenging. Here, we describe a highly sensitive and rapid analytical technique for profiling circulating microvesicles directly from blood samples of patients with glioblastoma. Microvesicles, introduced onto a dedicated microfluidic chip, are labeled with target-specific magnetic nanoparticles and detected by a miniaturized nuclear magnetic resonance system. Compared with current methods, this integrated system has a much higher detection sensitivity and can differentiate glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) microvesicles from nontumor host cell-derived microvesicles. We also show that circulating GBM microvesicles can be used to analyze primary tumor mutations and as a predictive metric of treatment-induced changes. This platform could provide both an early indicator of drug efficacy and a potential molecular stratifier for human clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2025018502,"A molecular mechanism in the brain and individual tissues allows mammals to adapt to a 24-hour clock. Garret FitzGerald and colleagues now show that genetic deletion of one member of this pathway specifically in the fat of mice results in acutely altered lipid profiles that, in turn, result in increased feeding and obesity. This could explain why human night-shift workers are at an increased risk for obesity and metabolic disease. Adipocytes store excess energy in the form of triglycerides and signal the levels of stored energy to the brain. Here we show that adipocyte-specific deletion of Arntl (also known as Bmal1), a gene encoding a core molecular clock component, results in obesity in mice with a shift in the diurnal rhythm of food intake, a result that is not seen when the gene is disrupted in hepatocytes or pancreatic islets. Changes in the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides that regulate appetite are consistent with feedback from the adipocyte to the central nervous system to time feeding behavior. Ablation of the adipocyte clock is associated with a reduced number of polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipocyte triglycerides. This difference between mutant and wild-type mice is reflected in the circulating concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids and nonesterified polyunsaturated fatty acids in hypothalamic neurons that regulate food intake. Thus, this study reveals a role for the adipocyte clock in the temporal organization of energy regulation, highlights timing as a modulator of the adipocyte-hypothalamic axis and shows the impact of timing of food intake on body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2060088882,"Through in vivo selection of human cancer cell populations, we uncover a convergent and cooperative miRNA network that drives melanoma metastasis. We identify miR-1908, miR-199a-5p, and miR-199a-3p as endogenous promoters of metastatic invasion, angiogenesis, and colonization in melanoma. These miRNAs convergently target apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and the heat shock factor DNAJA4. Cancer-secreted ApoE suppresses invasion and metastatic endothelial recruitment (MER) by engaging melanoma cell LRP1 and endothelial cell LRP8 receptors, respectively, while DNAJA4 promotes ApoE expression. Expression levels of these miRNAs and ApoE correlate with human metastatic progression outcomes. Treatment of cells with locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting these miRNAs inhibits metastasis to multiple organs, and therapeutic delivery of these LNAs strongly suppresses melanoma metastasis. We thus identify miRNAs with dual cell-intrinsic/cell-extrinsic roles in cancer, reveal convergent cooperativity in a metastatic miRNA network, identify ApoE as an anti-angiogenic and metastasis-suppressive factor, and uncover multiple prognostic miRNAs with synergistic combinatorial therapeutic potential in melanoma."

In olfactory neurons, OR genes converge in specialized heterochromatic foci The active OR allele in each neuron is transcribed outside of these foci Lamin B receptor (LBR) downregulation allows OR aggregation in olfactory neurons Ectopic LBR expression disrupts OR foci and causes OR coexpression Spatial compartmentalization of genes in the mammalian nucleus is believed to serve regulatory purposes (Fraser and Bickmore, 2007Fraser P. Bickmore W. Nuclear organization of the genome and the potential for gene regulation.Nature. 2007; 447: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Heterochromatin and euchromatin were originally cytological descriptions of silent and active regions of the genome and were only later biochemically characterized (Zacharias, 1995Zacharias H. Emil Heitz (1892-1965): chloroplasts, heterochromatin, and polytene chromosomes.Genetics. 1995; 141: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar). In most cell types, interactions with the nuclear lamina locate heterochromatin at the periphery of the nucleus, and euchromatin occupies the nuclear core (Peric-Hupkes and van Steensel, 2010Peric-Hupkes D. van Steensel B. Role of the nuclear lamina in genome organization and gene expression.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2010; 75: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Higher-resolution views of the nucleus reveal additional levels of organization and compartmentalization. For example, transcription may be restricted to specialized nuclear regions or transcription factories where genes converge in a nonrandom fashion (Eskiw et al., 2010Eskiw C.H. Cope N.F. Clay I. Schoenfelder S. Nagano T. Fraser P. Transcription factories and nuclear organization of the genome.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2010; 75: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, inter- and intragenic interactions over large genomic distances create regulatory networks that control gene expression and differentiation (de Wit and de Laat, 2012de Wit E. de Laat W.

Irreversible developmental decisions, such as those made by differentiating neurons, employ diverse epigenetic mechanisms to lock in transcriptional status for the life of a cell. Placing genes in subnuclear compartments compatible or incompatible with transcription could finalize these decisions. The differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) provides an extreme example of such developmental commitment; OSNs choose one out of ∼2,800 olfactory receptor (OR) alleles and subsequently establish a stable transcription program that assures that axons from like neurons converge to distinct glomeruli (Buck and Axel, 1991Buck L.

The monoallelic nature of OR expression (Chess et al., 1994Chess A. Simon I. Cedar H. Axel R. Allelic inactivation regulates olfactory receptor gene expression.Cell. 1994; 78: 823-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), together with the observation that OR promoters are extremely homogeneous and share common regulatory elements (Clowney et al., 2011Clowney E.J. Magklara A. Colquitt B.M. Pathak N. Lane R.P. Lomvardas S. High-throughput mapping of the promoters of the mouse olfactory receptor genes reveals a new type of mammalian promoter and provides insight into olfactory receptor gene regulation.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), implies that DNA sequence is not sufficient to instruct the expression of only one allele in each neuron and that an epigenetic mechanism is in place. Indeed, the discovery of OR heterochromatinization argues for epigenetic, nondeterministic control of OR choice (Magklara et al., 2011Magklara A. Yen A. Colquitt B.M. Clowney E.J. Allen W. Markenscoff-Papadimitriou E. Evans Z.A. Kheradpour P. Mountoufaris G. Carey C. et al.An epigenetic signature for monoallelic olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2011; 145: 555-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because active OR alleles have different chromatin modifications from the inactive ORs (Magklara et al., 2011Magklara A. Yen A. Colquitt B.M. Clowney E.J. Allen W. Markenscoff-Papadimitriou E. Evans Z.A. Kheradpour P. Mountoufaris G.

Barnea G. Pisapia D.J. Mendelsohn M. Kirkland J. Axel R. Interchromosomal interactions and olfactory receptor choice.Cell. 2006; 126: 403-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), this epigenetic regulation might have a spatial component. Although deletion of H does not have detectable effects on the transcription of most ORs (Khan et al., 2011Khan M. Vaes E. Mombaerts P. Regulation of the probability of mouse odorant receptor gene choice.Cell. 2011; 147: 907-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), its association with active OR alleles could reflect the physical separation of the active OR allele from silent OR genes and its transfer to an activating nuclear factory. Here, we examine the significance of nuclear organization in OR expression. Using a complex DNA FISH probe that recognizes most OR loci, we demonstrate OSN-specific and differentiation-dependent intra- and interchromosomal aggregation of silent ORs. Whereas these OR-specific foci colocalize with H3K9me3, H4K20me3, and heterochromatin protein 1 β (HP1β), the active OR alleles have minimal overlap with heterochromatic markers and reside in euchromatic territories, suggesting the existence of repressive and activating nuclear compartments for OR alleles. Critical for this nuclear organization is the downregulation and removal of lamin b receptor (LBR) from the nuclear envelope of OSNs. Deletion of LBR causes ectopic aggregation of OR loci in basal and sustentacular cells in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), whereas expression of LBR in OSNs disrupts the formation of OR foci, resulting in decompaction of OR heterochromatin, coexpression of a large number of ORs, overall reduction of OR transcription, and disruption of OSN targeting. Our analysis provides evidence for an instructive role of nuclear architecture in monogenic olfactory receptor expression. ORs and other AT-rich gene families frequently associate with the nuclear lamina (Peric-Hupkes et al., 2010Peric-Hupkes D. Meuleman W. Pagie L. Bruggeman S.W. Solovei I. Brugman W. Gräf S. Flicek P.

Cell. 2010; 38: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). However, our DNA FISH analysis with individual BAC probes failed to reveal a significant distribution of OR loci toward the nuclear periphery of OSNs (Lomvardas et al., 2006Lomvardas S. Barnea G. Pisapia D.J. Mendelsohn M. Kirkland J. Axel R. Interchromosomal interactions and olfactory receptor choice.Cell. 2006; 126: 403-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To obtain a comprehensive view of the distribution of OR loci in OSN nuclei, we sought to generate a DNA FISH probe that would allow the simultaneous detection of most OR loci. First, because OR clusters reside in extremely AT-rich isochores (Clowney et al., 2011Clowney E.J. Magklara A. Colquitt B.M. Pathak N. Lane R.P. Lomvardas S. High-throughput mapping of the promoters of the mouse olfactory receptor genes reveals a new type of mammalian promoter and provides insight into olfactory receptor gene regulation.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; Glusman et al., 2001Glusman G. Yanai I. Rubin I. Lancet D. The complete human olfactory subgenome.Genome Res. 2001; 11: 685-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), we digested genomic DNA with restriction enzymes that recognize AT-rich sequences and collected DNA fractions with significant enrichment for ORs. Next, these were amplified and subjected to a second round of purification by sequence capture on a custom tiling array covering OR clusters (Figure 1A) (Albert et al., 2007Albert T.J. Molla M.N. Muzny D.M. Nazareth L. Wheeler D. Song X. Richmond T.A. Middle C.M. Rodesch M.J. Packard C.J. et al.Direct selection of human genomic loci by microarray hybridization.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 903-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). This high-density array contains oligonucleotides against the unique sequences within the 46 OR genomic clusters, spanning a total region of 40 MB. Two rounds of capture, elution, and amplification produced a DNA library highly enriched for OR sequences. Quantitative PCR analysis (qPCR) of the final amplicon detects only sequences from OR clusters, suggesting the elimination of unique, non-OR DNA (Figure 1B). To further examine the composition of this DNA library, we analyzed its contents by whole-genome microarray hybridization, using a tiling array covering mouse chromosomes 1 to 4. This analysis demonstrates the sensitivity and selectivity of our purification strategy: the probe detects 340 of 346 OR genes located on these 4 chromosomes, 40 of ∼80 non-OR genes located cis to OR clusters (and included on the capturing array), and 6 of ∼5,000 non-OR genes (FDR < 0.05, 98.2% sensitivity, 98.4% OR cluster specificity, p ≤ 10−72) (Figures 1C and Figures S1B–S1D and Table S1 available online). We used this “panOR” library as a probe for DNA FISH experiments on sections of the MOE. Although there are 92 OR clusters in the diploid nucleus, the panOR probe detects an average of ∼5 large foci in OSNs (Figure 1D). This unexpected distribution is specific for OSNs: OR distribution in other cell populations represented in MOE sections (undifferentiated basal cells and sustentacular cells) is diffuse and more consistent with a random arrangement of the 92 OR clusters or ∼2,800 alleles. Quantification of the distribution of the DNA FISH signal in the three cell types of the MOE across the same sections in the same experiments supports this conclusion (Figure S1E–S1F): high-intensity pixels (above 120 in the 8 bit range of 0–255) were found only in OSNs and not in sustentacular or basal cells. To quantify the distribution of panOR signal, we calculated standard deviation of signal intensity across nuclear space. Average standard deviation in OSNs is 42.3, indicating spotty signal distribution, and is 9.3 or 11.3 in basal and sustentacular cells, indicating smoother distribution (n > 100 for each cell type). Finally, DNA FISH with this probe in other neuronal types demonstrates a diffuse distribution of OR loci (data not shown and Figure S2D), arguing for an OSN-specific nuclear pattern. The focal nature of the panOR DNA FISH signal suggests that OR alleles from different OR clusters merge in distinct nuclear regions during OSN differentiation. To test this, we pooled 10 OR- or 12 non-OR-BAC probes and performed two-color DNA FISH with the panOR probe. There was extensive colocalization between the panOR probe and OR BAC probes (Pearson’s coefficient r = 0.637, Mander’s coefficient of BAC signal colocalizing with panOR M1 = 0.835, n > 100) and little colocalization between the panOR probe and the non-OR BACs (r = 0.187, M1 = 0.109, n > 100) (Figures 1E and 1F and Table S2), suggesting selectivity for OR loci in the composition of these aggregates (Figure S1I). Though the panOR probe includes most OR loci, lack of complete overlap between the panOR and the individual OR BAC probes was expected. The panOR probe is 200-fold more complex than each BAC, and it is outcompeted for binding at ORs targeted by a BAC. Thus, BAC signals colocalized with panOR signal represent OR alleles surrounded by other OR loci labeled by the panOR probe at distances below the optical resolution of confocal microscopy. The combined OR BACs produce fewer DNA FISH spots in the OSNs (3.94 spots/nucleus/Z stack, n = 38) than in sustentacular (9.1 spots, n = 38) or basal cells (8.52 spots, n = 30), providing an independent verification for the extensive aggregation of these loci: they are optically indiscrete significantly more often in OSNs than in basal and sustentacular cells. Non-OR BAC probes did not appear more aggregated in the OSNs (10.08 spots in OSNs, 6.4 in sustentacular, and 7.1 in basal cells, n = 30 for each cell type). To explore the contribution of intra- and interchromosomal interactions to the formation of OR foci and the colocalization of ORs, we used two additional pools of OR BACs, one containing seven BACs targeting three clusters on chromosome 2 and the other containing eight BACs, each targeting a cluster from a different chromosome. These pools, when combined with panOR probe, revealed two layers of organization in OSNs: alleles within the same cluster coalesce into optically indiscrete signals, whereas clusters from different chromosomes generate distinguishable signals inside the same panOR focus (Figures 1G and 1H). The BACs from the same chromosome produce 5.9 dots in sustentacular cells and 2.3 dots in OSNs (n = 30 for each), whereas BACs from different chromosomes produce equal numbers of dots in both cell types. However, multiple OR BAC dots from different chromosomes were seen in 50% of the panOR foci, and more than two dots per aggregate in 29% of the cells (n = 50) (Figure 1H). Moreover, maternal and paternal alleles of the same OR cluster reside in the same OR aggregate in ∼6% of the tested OSNs (Figure S1H). Finally, panOR foci do not colocalize with large repeat classes, pericentromeric heterochromatin (PH), or other multigene families (Figures S2A–S2C and data not shown), suggesting that the aggregation of OR clusters produces distinct and selective OR gene territories. To reveal the epigenetic signature of OR foci, we combined DNA FISH analysis with immunofluorescence (IF) against the heterochromatic marks found on ORs (Magklara et al., 2011Magklara A. Yen A. Colquitt B.M. Clowney E.J. Allen W. Markenscoff-Papadimitriou E. Evans Z.A. Kheradpour P. Mountoufaris G. Carey C. et al.An epigenetic signature for monoallelic olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2011; 145: 555-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) or heterochromatin-binding protein 1 β (HP1β), the only heterochromatic HP1 member expressed in OSNs (data not shown). This analysis reveals overlap between the OR foci, H3K9me3, H4K20me3, and HP1β (Figures 2A–2C and Table S2), but not with Pol II (Figure S2E), consistent with a heterochromatic nature of these aggregates. This colocalization is differentiation dependent and cell type specific; we do not detect overlap between the two signals in basal cells in the MOE or in retinal neurons (Figure S2D). We then performed nascent RNA FISH on sections of the MOE using intronic probes against OR genes MOR28, M50, M71, and P2 combined with IF for H3K9me3, H4K20me3, or HP1β. In contrast with the bulk of the panOR signal, active OR alleles have little overlap with any of the three heterochromatic marks (Figures 2D–2J, S2F, and S2G and Table S2). We also combined nascent RNA FISH with IF for Pol II or H3K27-Acetyl and H4K20me3 or HP1β (Figures 2F–2J and Table S2). These experiments corroborate that the active OR allele is spatially segregated from the silent ORs and resides in euchromatic territory. It is intriguing that most OR genes and PH are located near the center of OSN nuclei instead of being distributed toward the nuclear envelope (Figure S1A). This “inside-out” nuclear morphology is reminiscent of the nuclear architecture reported in homozygous Ichthyosis mice, a spontaneous LBR loss-of-function mutant (Goldowitz and Mullen, 1982Goldowitz D. Mullen R.J. Nuclear morphology of ichthyosis mutant mice as a cell marker in chimeric brain.Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). LBR is a nuclear envelope protein that interacts with HP1 and heterochromatin (Hoffmann et al., 2002Hoffmann K. Dreger C.K. Olins A.L. Olins D.E. Shultz L.D. Lucke B. Karl H. Kaps R. Müller D.

The lamin B receptor (LBR) provides essential chromatin docking sites at the nuclear envelope.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7108-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). RNA-seq revealed a continuous reduction in LBR mRNA levels during differentiation from HBCs to OSNs, and IF confirmed that whereas LBR is present in the nuclear envelope of basal and sustentacular cells, it is absent in the neuronal lineage of the MOE (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). PanOR DNA FISH on MOE sections from the Ichthyosis mice revealed no changes in OR aggregation in OSNs, which already lack LBR. However, nuclear architecture and OR organization of Ichthyotic basal and sustentacular cells approach that of wild-type OSNs (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3B). PH forms large, centrally located foci in both cell types, and ORs form aggregates at the periphery of the pericentromeric foci. According to the pooled BAC assay in the Ichthyosis mouse, the number of DNA FISH spots is uniform among the three cell types, and the basal and sustentacular cells have similar numbers of DNA FISH spots to control OSNs (Figure 3E), supporting a role for LBR downregulation in OR aggregation. Because ectopic OR aggregation occurs in two cell types that do not express ORs and likely do not contain the transcription factors responsible for OR activation, an effect of this mutation on OR expression and OSN targeting is unlikely and was not detected (data not shown and Figure S3C). Thus, we sought to perform the opposite experiment: to restore LBR expression to OSNs instead of removing LBR from cells that do not express ORs. We generated a tetO LBR-IRES-GFP transgenic mouse that we crossed to OMP-IRES-tTA mice to achieve expression of LBR in OSNs. One transgenic line expresses the transgene in a significant proportion of OSNs (Figure 3F). Like endogenous LBR, transgenic LBR is restricted to the nuclear envelope without diffusing in the nucleoplasm (Figure 3F). We used this transgenic line to analyze the effects of ectopic LBR expression on the nuclear morphology of mOSNs. DAPI staining becomes less intense, and PH is moved toward the nuclear periphery of LBR+ OSNs (Figures 3G and S3D). OSNs in these sections that do not express the transgene have morphology similar to wild-type nuclei (Figure S3D). IF shows HP1β recruitment to the nuclear envelope in LBR+ OSNs, whereas centrally shifted euchromatin occupies most of the nucleus (Figures 3H, S3E, and S3F). Thus, ectopic LBR expression in a postmitotic cell is sufficient to reverse the “inside-out” arrangement and to recruit PH to the nuclear periphery. IF does not provide information about the structural and biophysical changes occurring in OSN chromatin upon ectopic LBR expression. To obtain this information, we imaged control and LBR+ OSNs with soft X-ray tomography (SXT), a high-resolution imaging method that is applied to fully hydrated, unfixed, and unstained cells and measures carbon and nitrogen concentration in biological samples (McDermott et al., 2009McDermott G. Le Gros M.A. Knoechel C.G. Uchida M. Larabell C.A. Soft X-ray tomography and cryogenic light microscopy: the cool combination in cellular imaging.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 587-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Orthoslices (computer-generated sections) and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of SXT imaging of control OSNs reveal that the more condensed (darker) chromatin is located at the center of the nucleus, in agreement with the morphology seen by IF (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4G and Movie S1). We also detect extremely condensed structures at the periphery of this PH core that are specific for this cell type; only sperm nuclei have chromatin particles with higher compaction values (data not shown). Although the arrangement of these dark foci is similar to the arrangement of the OR foci around the PH core of the OSN nucleus, DNA FISH or IF are incompatible with SXT, and therefore it is impossible to prove directly that these are the same structures. SXT imaging of LBR+ OSNs shows the relocation of the most condensed chromatin toward the nuclear membrane (Figures 4D, 4E, and 4H and Movie S2). Moreover, LBR expression increases the nuclear volume from 105u3 to 135u3 and induces the folding of the nuclear membrane and an overall change in the nuclear shape (Figures 4C and 4F and Movies S3 and S4). Overall, chromatin decondensation induced by LBR expression in OSNs is quantitatively described by measurements of the linear absorption coefficient (LAC) (McDermott et al., 2009McDermott G. Le Gros M.A. Knoechel C.G. Uchida M. Larabell C.A. Soft X-ray tomography and cryogenic light microscopy: the cool combination in cellular imaging.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 587-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) of control and LBR+ OSNs (Figure 4I). This measurement, which depicts the concentration of organic material per voxel, corroborates the loss of the densest foci upon LBR expression. Thus, if condensed regions correspond to OR foci, ectopic LBR expression should cause decompaction of OR heterochromatin. DNaseI sensitivity experiments (Magklara et al., 2011Magklara A. Yen A.

Carey C. et al.An epigenetic signature for monoallelic olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2011; 145: 555-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) in nuclei from fluorescence-activated cell-sorted (FAC-sorted) control or LBR+ OSNs confirms a significant decompaction of OR and pericentromeric heterochromatin upon LBR expression (Figure 4J). The spatial reorganization of HP1β, the elimination of the dark foci detected by SXT, and the increase in DNase sensitivity of OR chromatin suggest that ectopic LBR expression disrupts the aggregation of OR loci. To test this, we performed DNA FISH with the panOR probe in sections of LBR-expressing transgenic mice. Low-magnification images show significant effects of ectopic LBR expression on the distribution of OR loci. In the apical LBR+ neuronal layer, the intense OR foci dissolve; in contrast, immature OSNs and progenitors that do not yet express the transgene but have already downregulated the endogenous LBR retain a focal OR arrangement (Figures 5A and S4A). To investigate whether altering the tertiary organization of OR loci affects the epigenetic characteristics of these genes, we examined association of OR genes with H3K9me3, H4K20me3, and HP1β in LBR+ OSNs. H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 remained enriched on OR loci upon LBR expression by native ChIP-qPCR assays on FAC-sorted OSNs (Figures 5B and 5C) and FISH-IF (Figures S4B and S4C and Table S2). In contrast, association of OR loci with HP1β was reduced as measured by FISH-IF (Figures 5D and Table S2). Reduction in overlap between H4K20me3 and HP1β was also observed in the LBR+ OSNs. Thus, despite retaining heterochromatic histone marks, OR loci lose their aggregated arrangement and their nonhistone heterochromatic coat upon LBR expression, which is consistent with the increased DNase sensitivity. In wild-type OSNs, active OR alleles interact with the H enhancer. To test whether LBR expression also abrogates interchromosomal interactions between the active allele and H, we performed circularized chromosome conformation capture (4C) using inverse H PCR primers as previously described (Lomvardas et al., 2006Lomvardas S. Barnea G. Pisapia D.J. Mendelsohn M. Kirkland J. Axel R. Interchromosomal interactions and olfactory receptor choice.Cell. 2006; 126: 403-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) on LBR-expressing or control MOEs. To increase the proportion of LBR-expressing cells in this mixed population, we combined two tTA drivers (OMP-IRES-tTA and Gγ8 tTA). The enrichment of various OR sequences in this 4C library was assayed by qPCR. LBR expression in OSNs results in the loss of most H-OR associations. In LBR transgenics, H retains only its interaction with the linked OR MOR28 (Olfr1507) located 75 Kb downstream (Figure 5E). Therefore, ectopic LBR expression in OSNs not only prevents heterochromatic OR aggregation, but also disrupts the interaction between the H enhancer and unlinked ORs. IF and RNA FISH experiments in MOE sections from control and LBR-expressing mice revealed a 3-fold reduction in the numbers of neurons expressing particular ORs in the transgenic mice (Figure 6A). Importantly, most neurons that retain high-level OR expression do not express transgenic LBR (data not shown and Figure 6D). For more quantitative measure of the effects of LBR in OR expression, we used FAC-sorting to isolate control or LBR+ OSNs and performed quantitative, reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). This analysis supports that LBR expression has significant inhibitory effects on OR expression (Figure 6B). Similarly, whole-mount X-gal staining in MOEs from P2-IRES-τLacZ mice crossed to LBR-expressing transgenics shows reduced X-gal signal, supporting a repressive effect on OR expression (Figure 6C). Neurons that retained high β-gal protein expression often failed to express the LBR transgene, as demonstrated by IF for β-gal and GFP in sections of these mice (Figure 6D). Because OMP drives LBR expression only after OR choice, this result indicates postchoice downregulation of this P2 allele and the rest of the OR repertoire. To test whether the inhibitory effects of LBR expression apply to genes that do not follow the spatial regulation of endogenous OR genes, we used a transgenic OR that is under the control of the tetO promoter (tetO MOR28-IRES-τLacZ). This transgene also carries H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 (data not shown), but unlike the endogenous ORs, its heterochromatization is not OSN specific and is probably caused by its multicopy (16 tandem copies) insertion (Garrick et al., 1998Garrick D. Fiering S. Martin D.I. Whitelaw E. Repeat-induced gene silencing in mammals.Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). This transgene does not interact with either the endog"

Stochastic accumulator models commonly explain this speed-accuracy tradeoff by strategic adjustment of response threshold. Several laboratories identify specific neurons in prefrontal and parietal cortex with this accumulation process, yet no neurophysiological correlates of speed-accuracy tradeoff have been described. We trained macaque monkeys to trade speed for accuracy on cue during visual search and recorded the activity of neurons in the frontal eye field. Unpredicted by any model, we discovered that speed-accuracy tradeoff is accomplished through several distinct adjustments. Visually responsive neurons modulated baseline firing rate, sensory gain, and the duration of perceptual processing. Movement neurons triggered responses with activity modulated in a direction opposite of model predictions. Thus, current stochastic accumulator models provide an incomplete description of the neural processes accomplishing speed-accuracy tradeoffs. The diversity of neural mechanisms was reconciled with the accumulator framework through an integrated accumulator model constrained by requirements of the motor system."
https://openalex.org/W2114350859,"Mutations that cause intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are commonly found in genes that encode for synaptic proteins. However, it remains unclear how mutations that disrupt synapse function impact intellectual ability. In the SYNGAP1 mouse model of ID/ASD, we found that dendritic spine synapses develop prematurely during the early postnatal period. Premature spine maturation dramatically enhanced excitability in the developing hippocampus, which corresponded with the emergence of behavioral abnormalities. Inducing SYNGAP1 mutations after critical developmental windows closed had minimal impact on spine synapse function, whereas repairing these pathogenic mutations in adulthood did not improve behavior and cognition. These data demonstrate that SynGAP protein acts as a critical developmental repressor of neural excitability that promotes the development of life-long cognitive abilities. We propose that the pace of dendritic spine synapse maturation in early life is a critical determinant of normal intellectual development."
https://openalex.org/W2081356513,"Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-induced RNAi is used for biological discovery and therapeutics. Dicer, whose normal role is to liberate endogenous miRNAs from their precursors, processes shRNAs into different biologically active siRNAs, affecting their efficacy and potential for off-targeting. We found that, in cells, Dicer induced imprecise cleavage events around the expected sites based on the previously described 5'/3' counting rules. These promiscuous noncanonical cleavages were abrogated when the cleavage site was positioned 2 nt from a bulge or loop. Interestingly, we observed that the ~1/3 of mammalian endogenous pre-miRNAs that contained such structures were more precisely processed by Dicer. Implementing a ""loop-counting rule,"" we designed potent anti-HCV shRNAs with substantially reduced off-target effects. Our results suggest that Dicer recognizes the loop/bulge structure in addition to the ends of shRNAs/pre-miRNAs for accurate processing. This has important implications for both miRNA processing and future design of shRNAs for RNAi-based genetic screens and therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2103986580,"Estrogen is beneficial for obesity and type 2 diabetes, though its use is limited by important side effects. In a new study, Matthias Tschöp and colleagues avoid this issue by chemically linking estrogen to the hormone GLP-1 to selectively target metabolically relevant tissue and show that the conjugated compound corrects obesity, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in mice. This approach could be used for other hormone pairs to treat other diseases. We report the development of a new combinatorial approach that allows for peptide-mediated selective tissue targeting of nuclear hormone pharmacology while eliminating adverse effects in other tissues. Specifically, we report the development of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-estrogen conjugate that has superior sex-independent efficacy over either of the individual hormones alone to correct obesity, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in mice. The therapeutic benefits are driven by pleiotropic dual hormone action to improve energy, glucose and lipid metabolism, as shown by loss-of-function models and genetic action profiling. Notably, the peptide-based targeting strategy also prevents hallmark side effects of estrogen in male and female mice, such as reproductive endocrine toxicity and oncogenicity. Collectively, selective activation of estrogen receptors in GLP-1–targeted tissues produces unprecedented efficacy to enhance the metabolic benefits of GLP-1 agonism. This example of targeting the metabolic syndrome represents the discovery of a new class of therapeutics that enables synergistic co-agonism through peptide-based selective delivery of small molecules. Although our observations with the GLP-1–estrogen conjugate justify translational studies for diabetes and obesity, the multitude of other possible combinations of peptides and small molecules may offer equal promise for other diseases."

The blind activated the VWFA specifically and selectively during the processing of letter soundscapes relative to both textures and visually complex object categories and relative to mental imagery and semantic-content controls. Further, VWFA recruitment for reading soundscapes emerged after 2 hr of training in a blind adult on a novel script. Therefore, the VWFA shows category selectivity regardless of input sensory modality, visual experience, and long-term familiarity or expertise with the script. The VWFA may perform a flexible task-specific rather than sensory-specific computation, possibly linking letter shapes to phonology."
https://openalex.org/W2072934530,"A filamentous fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, is a causal agent of rice blast disease, which is one of the most serious diseases affecting cultivated rice, Oryza sativa. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying both rice defense and fungal attack are not yet fully understood. Extensive past studies have characterized many infection-responsive genes in the pathogen and host plant, separately. To understand the plant-pathogen interaction comprehensively, it is valuable to monitor the gene expression profiles of both interacting organisms simultaneously in the same infected plant tissue. Although the host-pathogen interaction during the initial infection stage is important for the establishment of infection, the detection of fungal gene expression in infected leaves at the stage has been difficult because very few numbers of fungal cells are present. Using the emerging RNA-Seq technique, which has a wide dynamic range for expression analyses, we analyzed the mixed transcriptome of rice and blast fungus in infected leaves at 24 hours post-inoculation, which is the point when the primary infection hyphae penetrate leaf epidermal cells. We demonstrated that our method detected the gene expression of both the host plant and pathogen simultaneously in the same infected leaf blades in natural infection conditions without any artificial treatments. The upregulation of 240 fungal transcripts encoding putative secreted proteins was observed, suggesting that these candidates of fungal effector genes may play important roles in initial infection processes. The upregulation of transcripts encoding glycosyl hydrolases, cutinases and LysM domain-containing proteins were observed in the blast fungus, whereas pathogenesis-related and phytoalexin biosynthetic genes were upregulated in rice. Furthermore, more drastic changes in expression were observed in the incompatible interactions compared with the compatible ones in both rice and blast fungus at this stage. Our mixed transcriptome analysis is useful for the simultaneous elucidation of the tactics of host plant defense and pathogen attack."

Here, we show that Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a dedicated regulator of the initiation of ciliogenesis in vivo. We identified a null allele of mouse Ttbk2 based on loss of Sonic hedgehog activity, a signaling pathway that requires the primary cilium. Despite a normal basal body template, Ttbk2 mutants lack cilia. TTBK2 acts at the distal end of the basal body, where it promotes the removal of CP110, which caps the mother centriole, and promotes recruitment of IFT proteins, which build the ciliary axoneme. Dominant truncating mutations in human TTBK2 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11); these mutant proteins do not promote ciliogenesis and inhibit ciliogenesis in wild-type cells.

Tau tubulin kinase 2 (Ttbk2) is essential for mouse Shh signaling and ciliogenesis TTBK2 recruits IFT proteins and removes CP110 from the mother centriole TTBK2 recruitment to the basal body correlates with the removal of CP110 Human TTBK2 mutations that cause SCA11 inhibit cilia formation in wild-type cells Single nonmotile cilia (primary cilia) are found on the surface of most vertebrate cells, both during embryogenesis and in the adult. During embryonic development, the primary cilium is required for the activity of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway (Huangfu et al., 2003Huangfu D. Liu A. Rakeman A.S. Murcia N.S. Niswander L. Anderson K.V. Hedgehog signalling in the mouse requires intraflagellar transport proteins.Nature. 2003; 426: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar; Goetz and Anderson, 2010Goetz S.C. Anderson K.V. The primary cilium: a signalling centre during vertebrate development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Because of the critical roles of Shh signaling in embryonic patterning, disruptions in primary cilia cause lethality at midgestation associated with defects in neural and limb patterning. Later in development and after birth, cilia are important for the development of most organ systems and for the maintenance of stem cells of some tissues. Mutations that disrupt the assembly or function of cilia cause a set of complex human genetic syndromes, collectively termed ciliopathies, which have phenotypes as diverse as obesity and cystic kidney disease (Badano et al., 2006Badano J.L.

Life Sci. 2010; 67: 3287-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cilia are templated by the basal body, a modified form of the more mature of the cell’s two centrioles, the mother centriole. During maturation of the basal body, the mother centriole forms two sets of specialized appendages: the subdistal appendages that mediate the attachment of the basal body to cytoplasmic microtubules, and distal appendages that mediate the docking of the basal body to the plasma membrane (Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011Ishikawa H. Marshall W.F. Ciliogenesis: building the cell’s antenna.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar; Pedersen et al., 2008Pedersen L.B. Veland I.R. Schrøder J.M. Christensen S.T. Assembly of primary cilia.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 1993-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The ciliary axoneme is assembled by the evolutionarily conserved process of intraflagellar transport (IFT). During IFT, proteins are transported into the cilium by kinesin-2, a dedicated anterograde motor, in conjunction with two multiprotein complexes: IFT-A and IFT-B. Ciliary proteins are recycled to the base of the cilium by a dedicated dynein motor, cytoplasmic Dynein-2 (Iomini et al., 2001Iomini C. Babaev-Khaimov V. Sassaroli M. Piperno G. Protein particles in Chlamydomonas flagella undergo a transport cycle consisting of four phases.J.

Dyn. 2008; 237: 1993-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of primary cilia in development and disease, it is not known what controls the initiation of ciliogenesis or how ciliogenesis is regulated by the cell cycle or by cell type. The cilium is a dynamic organelle that is rapidly assembled and disassembled during the cell cycle to enable the centrioles to become components of the spindle poles during mitosis (Seeley and Nachury, 2010Seeley E.S. Nachury M.V. The perennial organelle: assembly and disassembly of the primary cilium.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Regulation of ciliogenesis by cell-cycle factors must differ between cell types because many cultured cells ciliate only after withdrawal from the cell cycle, whereas most rapidly cycling cells in mouse embryos have cilia (Fonte et al., 1971Fonte V.G. Searls R.L. Hilfer S.R. The relationship of cilia with cell division and differentiation.J. Cell Biol. 1971; 49: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; Ocbina et al., 2011Ocbina P.J.

In addition, although most cell types have primary cilia, some differentiated cell types such as pancreatic acinar cells and hepatocytes are not ciliated (Aughsteen, 2001Aughsteen A.A.

Int. 1996; 20: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and cilia are lost during development of some tumors (Seeley and Nachury, 2010Seeley E.S. Nachury M.V. The perennial organelle: assembly and disassembly of the primary cilium.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Analysis of the factors that control the decision of a cell whether or not to make cilia has focused on a set of negative regulators. The centriolar proteins CP110 and CEP97 cap the distal centrioles: knockdown of these proteins causes inappropriate formation of cilia in cycling cultured cells, and overexpression of CP110 is sufficient to block cilia formation in quiescent cells (Spektor et al., 2007Spektor A.

However, the mechanism by which CP110 is displaced from the mother centriole to enable cilia formation is unknown. Several positive regulators of cilia formation, including Ran, Rab8, and Rab11, have been identified, but there is, as yet, no evidence that any of these proteins regulate ciliogenesis in the animal (Fan et al., 2011Fan S.

USA. 2011; 108: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In the course of a genetic screen for mutations that affect neural patterning in the mouse embryo, we identified a gene required for Shh signaling because it was required for formation of primary cilia. Here, we show that this gene encodes a serine-threonine kinase, Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2), and that TTBK2 is a critical regulator of the initiation of ciliogenesis in vivo. TTBK2 was first identified based on its physical association with microtubules and its ability to phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins in vitro (Takahashi et al., 1995Takahashi M.

We show that TTBK2 is not required for the formation of mature basal bodies but is required to initiate assembly of the ciliary axoneme. Truncating mutations in human TTBK2 cause the dominant human neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11) (Bauer et al., 2010Bauer P. Stevanin G. Beetz C. Synofzik M. Schmitz-Hübsch T. Wüllner U. Berthier E. Ollagnon-Roman E. Riess O. Forlani S. et al.Spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11) is an uncommon cause of dominant ataxia among French and German kindreds.J.

Genet. 2007; 39: 1434-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We find that the disease-associated variants of TTBK2 can inhibit ciliogenesis in wild-type (WT) cells, suggesting that the mutations cause disease by interfering with the product of the WT allele. The findings raise the possibility that cilia may play a role in preventing neural degeneration. We identified an ENU-induced mutation, bartleby (bby), based on morphological defects of homozygous embryos at midgestation similar to those seen in mutants that lack cilia, including holoprosencephaly, twisted body axis, abnormal limb development, and randomized laterality of heart looping; the mutants die at midgestation (∼E10.5) (Figures 1A and 1B). Mouse embryos that lack cilia show holoprosencephaly because they lack ventral neural cell types that depend on activation of the Shh pathway (Huangfu and Anderson, 2005Huangfu D. Anderson K.V.

Cilia are also required for normal proteolytic processing of Gli3, the transcriptional repressor that keeps Shh target genes off in the absence of ligand. As a result, mutants that lack cilia show an increased basal level of target gene expression that causes phenotypes such as polydactyly (Huangfu and Anderson, 2005Huangfu D. Anderson K.V.

As in mutants that lack cilia, a set of Shh-dependent ventral neural cell types was not specified in bby mutants, including Shh-expressing floor plate cells (Figures 1C and 1D), Nkx2.2-positive V3 interneuron progenitors (Figures 1E and 1F), and Isl1-positive motor neurons (Figures 1G and 1H); ventral cells in the mutant neural tube expressed Pax6, which is normally repressed by Shh in ventral neural progenitors (Figures 1I and 1J). Anterior-posterior patterning of the limb bud also depends on the activity of the Shh pathway (Zeller et al., 2009Zeller R. López-Ríos J. Zuniga A. Vertebrate limb bud development: moving towards integrative analysis of organogenesis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Ptch1, a direct downstream target of Shh signaling, was robustly expressed in the posterior of the WT limbs but was absent in bby mutant embryos (Figures 1K and 1L), indicating that in the limb, as in the neural tube, Shh failed to activate target genes in bby embryos. Expression of Fgf4, Hand2, and Hoxd11, which are restricted to the posterior limb, was expanded anteriorly in bby mutants (Figures 1M–1R), which suggested that Gli3 repressor activity was decreased in the mutants, similar to cilia mutants (Huangfu and Anderson, 2005Huangfu D. Anderson K.V. Cilia and Hedgehog responsiveness in the mouse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 11325-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar; Liu et al., 2005Liu A. Wang B. Niswander L.A. Mouse intraflagellar transport proteins regulate both the activator and repressor functions of Gli transcription factors.Development. 2005; 132: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus, bby mutant embryos showed the same types of disruptions of Shh-dependent patterning in the neural tube and limb that are seen in mutants that lack cilia. Because of the phenotypic similarities of bby embryos and mutants with defects in cilia, we analyzed cilia formation in bby mutants. Arl13b is a sensitive and specific marker for cilia in WT cells (Caspary et al., 2007Caspary T. Larkins C.E. Anderson K.V. The graded response to Sonic Hedgehog depends on cilia architecture.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 767-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), but no Arl13b-positive cilia were detected in the bby neural tube (Figures 2A and 2B) or in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from bby embryos (Figures 2C and 2D). Nearly every cell in the WT E10.5 neural tube had a single cilium that could be detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 2E, arrowheads), but cilia were not detected by SEM in the bby neural tube (Figure 2F). We mapped the bby mutation by meiotic recombination to a 1 Mb region on chromosome 2 (see Figure S1A available online). Analysis of the gene sequences in the interval identified an A→T nucleotide substitution in the coding region of Tau tubulin kinase 2 (Ttbk2). This nucleotide change converted lysine 142 to a stop codon, truncating the protein within the kinase domain (Figure S1B). TTBK2 is a member of the Casein Kinase 1 family of serine-threonine protein kinases (Qi et al., 2009Qi H. Yao C. Cai W. Girton J. Johansen K.M. Johansen J. Asator, a tau-tubulin kinase homolog in Drosophila localizes to the mitotic spindle.Dev. Dyn. 2009; 238: 3248-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and was first identified based on its physical association with microtubules (Takahashi et al., 1995Takahashi M. Tomizawa K. Sato K. Ohtake A. Omori A. A novel tau-tubulin kinase from bovine brain.FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ttbk2 was also identified in siRNA-based screens for kinases that modulate Hh signaling (Evangelista et al., 2008Evangelista M. Lim T.Y. Lee J. Parker L. Ashique A. Peterson A.S. Ye W. Davis D.P. de Sauvage F.J. Kinome siRNA screen identifies regulators of ciliogenesis and hedgehog signal transduction.Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: ra7Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and for genes important in cilia formation (Kim et al., 2010Kim J. Lee J.E. Heynen-Genel S. Suyama E. Ono K. Lee K. Ideker T. Aza-Blanc P. Gleeson J.G. Functional genomic screen for modulators of ciliogenesis and cilium length.Nature. 2010; 464: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In addition, embryos homozygous for a targeted knockin allele of Ttbk2 die at midgestation with a morphology similar to that of bby embryos (Bouskila et al., 2011Bouskila M. Esoof N. Gay L. Fang E.H. Deak M. Begley M.J. Cantley L.C. Prescott A. Storey K.G. Alessi D.R.

J. 2011; 437: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore concluded that the mutation in the Ttbk2 gene was responsible for the bby phenotype. To define the cellular and molecular basis of the defect in ciliogenesis, we examined basal bodies and cilia in the E10.5 Ttbk2bby mutant neural tube by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Although ciliary axonemes were not found in Ttbk2bby mutant tissue (Figures 2G, 2H, and S2), the centrioles in Ttbk2bby cells had the normal nine triplets of microtubules (Figures 2I and 2J). The basal bodies (modified mother centrioles) in Ttbk2bby cells were correctly apposed to the membrane, and both the subdistal appendages that anchor the centriole to microtubules and the distal appendages that help anchor the basal body to the cell surface were apparent in the micrographs (Figures 2G, 2H, and S2). Despite normal docking of the basal body to the cell surface, no cilium extending from the basal body was detected by TEM. We then examined centrosomal and ciliary markers by immunofluorescence in MEFs derived from Ttbk2bby mutant embryos. Ninein, a marker of the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole (Delgehyr et al., 2005Delgehyr N. Sillibourne J. Bornens M. Microtubule nucleation and anchoring at the centrosome are independent processes linked by ninein function.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), was present at the mutant centrosome, as in WT (Figures 3A and S3A). CEP164, a distal appendage protein that is required for ciliogenesis in cultured cells (Graser et al., 2007Graser S. Stierhof Y.D. Lavoie S.B. Gassner O.S. Lamla S. Le Clech M. Nigg E.A. Cep164, a novel centriole appendage protein required for primary cilium formation.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), was also associated with the centrosome in Ttbk2bby cells (Figures 3B and S3B). Thus, markers of the subdistal and distal appendages were correctly localized to the basal body inTtbk2bby cells, consistent with the normal appearance of the appendages seen in TEM.Figure S3Lower-Magnification Fields of Cells Labeled with Centriolar, Transition Zone, and Axonemal Markers, Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full caption(A and B) Appendage proteins Ninein (A) and CEP164 (B) in WT and Ttbk2bby (both green) cells, as indicated.

MKS1 and TMEM67, components of a large protein complex at the transition zone (Dowdle et al., 2011Dowdle W.E. Robinson J.F. Kneist A. Sirerol-Piquer M.S. Frints S.G. Corbit K.C.

Thus, these components of the mature basal body assembled correctly in the absence of TTBK2, despite a failure of axoneme elongation. IFT is required to assemble the microtubule doublets of the ciliary axoneme from the basal body template (Pedersen et al., 2008Pedersen L.B. Veland I.R. Schrøder J.M. Christensen S.T. Assembly of primary cilia.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 1993-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Both IFT140, a component of the IFT-A complex, and IFT88, a component of the IFT-B complex, localized to the transition zone and the ciliary axoneme in WT cells (Figures 4A, 4B, S3E, and S3F). In Kif3a−/− mutants, which lack the anterograde kinesin-2 IFT motor, both IFT140 and IFT88 localized to the basal body (Figures 4A, 4B, S3E, and S3F), although no axoneme was extended. IFT140 also localized to the basal body in the IFT-B mutants Ift88−/− and Ift172wim/wim, which lack cilia, and IFT88 was present at the basal body of Ift172wim/wim cells (Figures S4A, S4B, and S4D). Thus, IFT proteins can be recruited to the basal body under conditions where IFT is not actively promoting cilia formation. In contrast, Ttbk2bby mutant cells lacked detectable IFT88 or IFT140 at the basal body (Figures 4A, 4B, S3E, and S3F). We conclude, therefore, that TTBK2 acts upstream of IFT and is required for the recruitment or retention of IFT complexes at the basal body prior to cilia assembly.Figure S4Localization of Additional Centriolar and Transition Zone Markers in IFT Mutant MEFs, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A and B) The IFT-A complex protein IFT140 in Ift88−/− (A) and Ift172wim/wim (B) cells.(C) CP110 localization in Ift88−/− mutant MEFs.(D) IFT88 in Ift172wim/wim cells.(E) Localization of the transition zone protein MKS1 in Ift88−/− MEFs.(F and G) Localization of CP110 (green) at centrioles in WT (F) and Ttbk2bby (G) mutant MEFs, counter-stained with an antibody against Centrin (red).

CP110 is a centriolar protein that caps the distal end of centrioles (Chen et al., 2002Chen Z. Indjeian V.B. McManus M. Wang L. Dynlacht B.D. CP110, a cell cycle-dependent CDK substrate, regulates centrosome duplication in human cells.Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and removal of CP110 correlates with the ability to initiate ciliogenesis in cultured cells (Spektor et al., 2007Spektor A. Tsang W.Y. Khoo D. Dynlacht B.D. Cep97 and CP110 suppress a cilia assembly program.Cell. 2007; 130: 678-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed that CP110 was localized only to the daughter centriole (the centriole not associated with a cilium) in the vast majority of WT MEFs that had been serum starved to induce cilia formation. Similarly, CP110 was restricted to one of the two centrosomes in Kif3a−/− and Ift88−/− cells (Figures 4C, S3G, and S4C). In contrast, CP110 was present on both centrosomes in 88.8% of Ttbk2bby cells (Figures 4C, 4D, S3G, S4F, and S4G). Thus, TTBK2 is required for removal of CP110 from the mother centriole to allow ciliogenesis. To determine whether TTBK2 could directly control cilia formation at the basal body, we expressed tagged forms of mouse TTBK2 in WT MEFs and assessed their localization within the cell. TTBK2 tagged at the N terminus with eGFP (mTTBK2::eGFP) localized to the transition zone of ciliated cells, between the axoneme and the basal body (Figure 5A). In cells where the ciliary axoneme had not yet extended, tagged TTBK2 was seen on one of the two centrosomes (Figure 5B). TTBK2 tagged at the C terminus with V5 also localized to the transition zone of ciliated cells (Figure 5C), where it colocalized with IFT88 (Figure 5D), consistent with a role for TTBK2 in mediating the recruitment or retention of IFT complexes to this compartment. In contrast, we did not detect TTBK2 at the spindle poles of dividing cells (data not shown). An antibody to human TTBK2 confirmed that the protein localized to the ciliary transition zone of human RPE cells (Figure 5E). Thus, the TTBK2 protein was present at the basal body and transition zone, where it could directly regulate the initiation and maintenance of ciliogenesis. The initiation of cilia formation is coupled to the cell cycle because cilia are not found on most cells undergoing mitosis (Rieder et al., 1979Rieder C.L. Jensen C.G. Jensen L.C.

However, the molecular basis of this process remains poorly understood. We found that HDAC4, a histone deacetylase that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, controls a transcriptional program essential for synaptic plasticity and memory. The nuclear import of HDAC4 and its association with chromatin is negatively regulated by NMDA receptors. In the nucleus, HDAC4 represses genes encoding constituents of central synapses, thereby affecting synaptic architecture and strength. Furthermore, we show that a truncated form of HDAC4 encoded by an allele associated with mental retardation is a gain-of-function nuclear repressor that abolishes transcription and synaptic transmission despite the loss of the deacetylase domain. Accordingly, mice carrying a mutant that mimics this allele exhibit deficits in neurotransmission, spatial learning, and memory. These studies elucidate a mechanism of experience-dependent plasticity and define the biological role of HDAC4 in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2093356049,"Attenuated viruses can be highly effective vaccines. In this issue, Ralph Baric and colleagues report that inactivating mutations in the exonuclease ExoN of a mouse-adapted SARS coronavirus impair replication fidelity and cause a mutator phenotype. The resulting attenuated virus protected mice against a lethal coronavirus challenge. Live, attenuated RNA virus vaccines are efficacious but subject to reversion to virulence. Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy; increased fidelity is attenuating for some viruses. Coronavirus (CoV) replication fidelity is approximately 20-fold greater than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3′→5′ exonuclease (ExoN) activity that probably functions in RNA proofreading. In this study we demonstrate that engineered inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity in vivo and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged and immunocompromised mice. The ExoN inactivation genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or long-term persistent infection in vivo. ExoN inactivation has potential for broad applications in the stable attenuation of CoVs and, perhaps, other RNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2054349237,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are processed from primary transcripts that contain partially self-complementary foldbacks. As in animals, the core microprocessor in plants is a Dicer protein, DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1). Processing accuracy and strand selection is greatly enhanced through the RNA binding protein HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1) and the zinc finger protein SERRATE (SE). We have combined a luciferase-based genetic screen with whole-genome sequencing for rapid identification of new regulators of miRNA biogenesis and action. Among the first six mutants analyzed were three alleles of C-TERMINAL DOMAIN PHOSPHATASE-LIKE 1 (CPL1)/FIERY2 (FRY2). In the miRNA processing complex, SE functions as a scaffold to mediate CPL1 interaction with HYL1, which needs to be dephosphorylated for optimal activity. In the absence of CPL1, HYL1 dephosphorylation and hence accurate processing and strand selection from miRNA duplexes are compromised. Our findings thus define a new regulatory step in plant miRNA biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1996321460,"piRNAs silence transposons during germline development. In Drosophila, transcripts from heterochromatic clusters are processed into primary piRNAs in the perinuclear nuage. The nuclear DEAD box protein UAP56 has been previously implicated in mRNA splicing and export, whereas the DEAD box protein Vasa has an established role in piRNA production and localizes to nuage with the piRNA binding PIWI proteins Ago3 and Aub. We show that UAP56 colocalizes with the cluster-associated HP1 variant Rhino, that nuage granules containing Vasa localize directly across the nuclear envelope from cluster foci containing UAP56 and Rhino, and that cluster transcripts immunoprecipitate with both Vasa and UAP56. Significantly, a charge-substitution mutation that alters a conserved surface residue in UAP56 disrupts colocalization with Rhino, germline piRNA production, transposon silencing, and perinuclear localization of Vasa. We therefore propose that UAP56 and Vasa function in a piRNA-processing compartment that spans the nuclear envelope."

We show that the Sen1/Senataxin DNA/RNA helicase associates with forks, promoting their progression across RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-transcribed genes. sen1 mutants accumulate aberrant DNA structures and DNA-RNA hybrids while forks clash head-on with RNAPII transcription units. These replication defects correlate with hyperrecombination and checkpoint activation in sen1 mutants. The Sen1 function at the forks is separable from its role in RNA processing. Our data, besides unmasking a key role for Senataxin in coordinating replication with transcription, provide a framework for understanding the pathological mechanisms caused by Senataxin deficiencies and leading to the severe neurodegenerative diseases ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4."

Jian Huang et al. show that mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells can be maintained in culture in the absence of exogenous cytokines by combined treatment with agents that activate Wnt and inhibit mTOR signaling, two major signaling pathways implicated in stem cell homeostasis. Moreover, treatment with two such compounds used clinically increases the number of hematopoietic stem cells in mice in vivo. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self renewal and lineage commitment depend on complex interactions with the microenvironment. The ability to maintain or expand HSCs for clinical applications or basic research has been substantially limited because these interactions are not well defined. Recent evidence suggests that HSCs reside in a low-perfusion, reduced-nutrient niche and that nutrient-sensing pathways contribute to HSC homeostasis. Here we report that suppression of the mTOR pathway, an established nutrient sensor, combined with activation of canonical Wnt–β-catenin signaling, allows for the ex vivo maintenance of human and mouse long-term HSCs under cytokine-free conditions. We also show that the combination of two clinically approved medications that together activate Wnt–β-catenin and inhibit mTOR signaling increases the number (but not the proportion) of long-term HSCs in vivo."

We report that miR-126, a miRNA expressed in HSC and early progenitors, plays a pivotal role in restraining cell-cycle progression of HSC in vitro and in vivo. miR-126 knockdown by using lentiviral sponges increased HSC proliferation without inducing exhaustion, resulting in expansion of mouse and human long-term repopulating HSC. Conversely, enforced miR-126 expression impaired cell-cycle entry, leading to progressively reduced hematopoietic contribution. In HSC/early progenitors, miR-126 regulates multiple targets within the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β pathway, attenuating signal transduction in response to extrinsic signals. These data establish that miR-126 sets a threshold for HSC activation and thus governs HSC pool size, demonstrating the importance of miRNA in the control of HSC function."

We investigate how each nucleosomal component-the histone tails, the specific histone-DNA contacts, and the DNA sequence-contributes to the strength of the barrier. Removal of the tails favors progression of RNA polymerase II into the entry region of the nucleosome by locally increasing the wrapping-unwrapping rates of the DNA around histones. In contrast, point mutations that affect histone-DNA contacts at the dyad abolish the barrier to transcription in the central region by decreasing the local wrapping rate. Moreover, we show that the nucleosome amplifies sequence-dependent transcriptional pausing, an effect mediated through the structure of the nascent RNA. Each of these nucleosomal elements controls transcription elongation by affecting distinctly the density and duration of polymerase pauses, thus providing multiple and alternative mechanisms for control of gene expression by chromatin remodeling and transcription factors."

Failure to correctly fold is the basis of numerous disorders of central importance to modern medicine (Dobson, 2003Dobson C.M. Protein folding and misfolding.Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar). In particular, the third of human proteins that traverse the secretory pathway and that possess disulfide bonds pose unresolved challenges to our understanding of protein folding and disease (Gething and Sambrook, 1992Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Protein folding in the cell.Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3599) Google Scholar; Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P.

Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) introduces disulfide bonds into folding proteins and is the main catalyst of oxidative folding in humans (Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Protein disulfide isomerase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed a link between disulfide chemistry and the pathogenesis of misfolding diseases and specifically implicated PDI as a novel target for treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (Hoffstrom et al., 2010Hoffstrom B.G. Kaplan A. Letso R. Schmid R.S. Turmel G.J. Lo D.C. Stockwell B.R. Inhibitors of protein disulfide isomerase suppress apoptosis induced by misfolded proteins.Nat. Chem.

These studies stress the importance of understanding how PDI catalyzes oxidative folding. Human PDI catalyzes the formation of disulfides (oxidase activity) as well as the rearrangement of incorrectly formed disulfide bonds (isomerase activity) (Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Protein disulfide isomerase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of two catalytically active A domains and two redox-inactive B domains. Isolated A domains have been shown to effectively catalyze the introduction of disulfides into protein substrates; meanwhile the full-length protein is generally thought to be required for efficient isomerase activity (Darby and Creighton, 1995bDarby N.J. Creighton T.E. Functional properties of the individual thioredoxin-like domains of protein disulfide isomerase.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PDI belongs to a ubiquitous family of enzymes that catalyze thiol-disulfide exchange (Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Protein disulfide isomerase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In addition to PDI, this family includes other oxidoreductases such as thioredoxin (TRX), glutaredoxin, and the bacterial Dsb enzymes (Martin, 1995Martin J.L. Thioredoxin—a fold for all reasons.Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes share a characteristic structural fold and a highly conserved Cys-X-X-Cys motif in their active sites (Martin, 1995Martin J.L. Thioredoxin—a fold for all reasons.Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Their mechanism of action has been revealed through numerous studies over the past 40 years. In all cases, the reaction mechanism involves the formation of a mixed disulfide between a cysteine in the substrate and the N-terminal cysteine in the active site of the enzyme (Holmgren, 1985Holmgren A. Thioredoxin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Walker et al., 1996Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Catalysis of oxidative protein folding by mutants of protein disulfide isomerase with a single active-site cysteine.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Figure S1 available online). The C-terminal cysteine can attack and cleave the mixed disulfide, thereby spontaneously releasing the enzyme (Walker and Gilbert, 1997Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F.

Whereas spontaneous release is necessary during reduction of substrate disulfide bonds, it is unknown how this activity affects catalysis of oxidative folding.

Emerging sequentially into the ER, the nascent polypeptide encounters PDI, which catalyzes cotranslational oxidative folding (Bulleid and Freedman, 1988Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B.

This reaction is mediated by the formation of a mixed disulfide bond between the PDI enzyme and a cysteine in the nascent polypeptide (Figure 1A) (Frand and Kaiser, 1999Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A.

The mixed disulfide is then transferred to the folding polypeptide. Given the crucial roles of mixed disulfides in oxidoreductase catalysis, many studies have been focused on these ephemeral intermediates.

Although these studies have provided us with snapshots of mixed disulfide complexes, their dynamics during oxidative protein folding remain unknown. In order to study the intersection of covalent chemistry and protein folding, a method is needed that can independently measure these two concurrent processes. Here we demonstrate single-molecule techniques that measure the kinetics of enzyme attachment and release and the kinetics of protein oxidation and folding. We used an atomic force microscope (AFM) to mimic the initial stages of oxidative folding by extending an individual polypeptide to a state wherein the substrate cysteines were spatially separated, and a mixed disulfide complex was formed with the catalytic domain A1 from human PDI (hereafter referred to as PDIa, Figure 1B). We then allowed the polypeptide to refold in the absence of external force and probed the progress of oxidative folding by applying additional force pulses. Our data are consistent with a model in which PDIa acts as a placeholder that allows the substrate to guide the pairing of cysteines into native disulfide bonds. This mechanism is general in its nature and therefore does not require substrate specificity. Formation of a PDI-substrate mixed disulfide is thought to enable oxidative folding of newly synthesized proteins. We sought to create such a mixed disulfide complex and, starting from this state, study the progression of oxidative folding. A mixed disulfide complex can be formed through two pathways (Figure S1). In the first pathway, an oxidized PDI enzyme reacts with a free substrate cysteine (Frand and Kaiser, 1999Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Ero1p oxidizes protein disulfide isomerase in a pathway for disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar; Tu et al., 2000Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Biochemical basis of oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In the second pathway, the mixed disulfide is formed when reduced PDI reacts with a substrate disulfide (Lundström and Holmgren, 1990Lundström J. Holmgren A. Protein disulfide-isomerase is a substrate for thioredoxin reductase and has thioredoxin-like activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of the pathway, the resulting mixed disulfide complex is identical. Although we could use both pathways (see Figures 6 and S7), the second pathway proved more advantageous in our experiments because we could then directly detect the formation of the mixed disulfide, as described in detail below. We used in our experiments human PDI A1 (PDIa). Although essentially inactive in disulfide isomerization as compared to the full-length enzyme, PDIa is sufficient for catalysis of oxidative folding (Darby and Creighton, 1995bDarby N.J. Creighton T.E. Functional properties of the individual thioredoxin-like domains of protein disulfide isomerase.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The substrate we chose was the 27th Ig domain from human cardiac titin containing a buried disulfide between residues 32 and 75 (hereafter referred to as I2732–75), which has been well characterized in the past (Ainavarapu et al., 2007Ainavarapu S.R.

Probing the chemistry of thioredoxin catalysis with force.Nature. 2007; 450: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Our strategy to establish mixed disulfide complexes is illustrated in Figure 1C, and an experimental recording is displayed in Figure 1D. We used a custom-built AFM to apply a constant calibrated force to the termini of a single I2732–75 protein, while measuring its extension (Fernandez and Li, 2004Fernandez J.M. Li H. Force-clamp spectroscopy monitors the folding trajectory of a single protein.Science. 2004; 303: 1674-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). A force of 130–150 pN enables protein unfolding but does not break any of its covalent bonds (Grandbois et al., 1999Grandbois M. Beyer M. Rief M. Clausen-Schaumann H. Gaub H.E. How strong is a covalent bond?.Science. 1999; 283: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar; Wiita et al., 2006Wiita A.P. Ainavarapu S.R. Huang H.H. Fernandez J.M. Force-dependent chemical kinetics of disulfide bond reduction observed with single-molecule techniques.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 7222-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The polypeptide chain can thus unravel only up to the disulfide bond, resulting in the 11 nm extension step seen in the recording (Figure 1D). Meanwhile, the 11 nm extension exposes the 32–75 disulfide to the solvent and enables reactions with enzymes present in the surrounding media (Wiita et al., 2006Wiita A.P. Ainavarapu S.R. Huang H.H. Fernandez J.M. Force-dependent chemical kinetics of disulfide bond reduction observed with single-molecule techniques.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 7222-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In Figure 1D, a reduced PDIa enzyme present in solution reacts with the now solvent-exposed disulfide, creating a mixed disulfide. The enzymatic reaction is captured as a 14 nm step that results from mechanical unraveling of the rest of the substrate as soon as the original disulfide is broken. A 14 nm step in our experiments thus indicates the formation of a mixed disulfide complex. Once a mixed disulfide was acquired in a fully extended polypeptide, we could proceed to study its effect on protein folding. We used a three-part experimental protocol consisting of two mechanically equivalent force pulses separated by a refolding interval [denature − folding − probe] to study the effect of PDIa mixed disulfide complexes on the folding of an (I2732–75)8 polyprotein substrate (Figure 1E). A polyprotein was used because it yields multiple events within a single recording, thereby providing a stronger fingerprint of the reactions. Figure 1F shows how each substrate domain was first completely extended and linked to a PDIa enzyme during an initial denature pulse, as described in the previous section. The force was subsequently switched off, and the substrate was allowed to fold for a set time Δt folding (ΔtF). In order to detect the formation of disulfide bonds and protein folding during ΔtF, we once again applied force, thereby halting the folding reaction. This probe pulse was identical to the initial denature pulse and in the same manner allowed us to detect folded domains and disulfide bonds. A 25 nm step appearing during the probe pulse reports that a domain had folded but not formed a disulfide during ΔtF. An 11 nm step, on the other hand, indicates that a domain had folded during ΔtF and also acquired a disulfide. Given that PDIa was present in the surrounding media throughout the experiment, 14 nm steps would be seen in the probe pulse if newly formed disulfide bonds were again broken. In summary, a 25 nm step provided a signature of a natively folded domain with no disulfide, whereas an 11 nm step (followed by a 14 nm step) indicated a natively folded domain with a disulfide (Figure 1F). Figure 1G shows an experimental recording of the [denature − folding − probe] experiment in a solution containing reduced PDIa, and Figure 1H shows histograms of the step sizes detected in several such recordings. During the denature pulse, 11 and 14 nm steps were seen, indicating formation of mixed disulfide complexes between PDIa and the substrate. When the force was removed (ΔtF = 5 s), the substrate rapidly collapsed as seen in the experimental trace (Figure 1G). The 11 and 14 nm steps seen in the probe pulse unambiguously showed that disulfides had been formed in the substrate during folding. The reaction path for these domains is readily interpreted. When the force was removed, the substrate collapsed and allowed the free cysteine in each domain to attack the mixed disulfide bond, thus releasing the PDIa enzyme and establishing the intramolecular 32–75 disulfide bond. The appearance of 11 nm unfolding steps is consistent with these domains also acquiring their native fold. Additional experiments performed with full-length bovine PDI showed similar results, validating our use of PDIa (see Figure S2C for a representative recording). In addition to 11 and 14 nm steps, 25 nm steps were also seen in the probe pulse (Figures 1G, 1H, and S2B), revealing that some substrate domains had folded without forming disulfide bonds. Two scenarios can account for these 25 nm steps: either (1) PDIa was still attached to the folded substrate but had failed to introduce the 32–75 disulfide bond, or (2) PDIa had spontaneously released before substrate oxidation could be realized. We could thus distinguish between these scenarios by using two oxidoreductase enzymes with vastly different release rates: wild-type (WT) and C35S TRX. TRX is capable of catalyzing the same reactions as PDI (Carvalho et al., 2006Carvalho A.P. Fernandes P.A. Ramos M.J. Similarities and differences in the thioredoxin superfamily.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2006; 91: 229-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar; Debarbieux and Beckwith, 2000Debarbieux L. Beckwith J.

Ruddock L.W. Reexamination of the role of interplay between glutathione and protein disulfide isomerase.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consequently, in a [denature − folding − probe] experiment with WT TRX, all enzymes would have released from the substrate before the end of the denature pulse. We would thus expect only 25 nm steps in the probe pulse as the substrate folds in the absence of the enzyme. Experiments with TRX confirmed that only 25 nm steps were detected in the probe pulse (Figure 2A). Spontaneous release from the mixed disulfide is mediated by the C-terminal cysteine in the active site of oxidoreductases (Cys35 in TRX). We mutated this cysteine to abolish spontaneous release (TRX C35S, Figure 2B; see also Figure S3). This resulted in the complete absence of 25 nm steps and full oxidation of the substrate (as indicated by 11 and 14 nm steps in the probe pulse). Thus, every domain that folded in the presence of a mixed disulfide complex successfully completed oxidative folding. These observations indicate that 25 nm steps are only caused by spontaneous release of the enzyme from the mixed disulfide complex prior to folding, in agreement with scenario (2) described above (see Figure S4C for further support of this conclusion). We could therefore use 25 nm steps as an indicator of spontaneous enzyme release.Figure S4Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The kinetic competition during refolding of I27-PDIa mixed disulfide complexes. When the substrate is extended (during ongoing translocation, or during application of mechanical force in ΔtD), no substrate cysteine is available to cleave the mixed disulfide bond. However, the enzyme can release spontaneously through nucleophilic attack by the C-terminal cysteine in its active site. As soon as the substrate collapses (upon completion of translocation or removal of the mechanical force), its free cysteines become available.

In our experiments, we could detect the formation of individual mixed disulfide complexes (14 nm steps in the denature pulse), their presence during protein folding (14 nm steps in the probe pulse), and their spontaneous dissociation prior to folding (25 nm steps in the probe pulse). By varying the time before folding (the duration of the denature pulse, ΔtD; see Figures 3 and S4A) and measuring the resulting proportion of 25 nm steps in the probe pulse, we could thus measure the rate of PDIa spontaneous release from a protein substrate. In these experiments, we used a force protocol optimized for long experiments with split denature and probe pulses (see Experimental Procedures). For a denature pulse duration ΔtD = 5 s, ∼50% of the refolded domains contained disulfide bonds (11 nm, 14 nm steps in probe pulse of Figure 3A). In contrast, for ΔtD = 30 s, the enzymes had more time to release from the mixed disulfide complex, which led to 80% of folded domains not having acquired disulfide bonds (25 nm steps in probe pulse of Figure 3B). Figure 3D shows a simple model of the PDIa dissociation process. This model contains three rates, representing the rate of spontaneous enzyme release (koff), the rate of oxidative folding from the mixed disulfide complex (kox), and the rate of folding of the reduced substrate (kfold). The model also assumes that PDIa can dissociate during both ΔtD and ΔtF. Notably, the total amount of refolding remained constant for all values of ΔtD (Figure S4B), leading to the conclusion that kox and kfold were approximately equal (this is further verified by the kinetic data in Figure 4C). Given that the folding and oxidation rates were similar, it follows that 14 versus 25 nm steps report on the PDIa enzyme being “on” and “off,” respectively. We measured the dissociation of PDIa as the ratio between the number of 25 nm steps and the total number of refolded domains"
https://openalex.org/W1965584354,"It is not understood how Hsp104, a hexameric AAA+ ATPase from yeast, disaggregates diverse structures, including stress-induced aggregates, prions, and α-synuclein conformers connected to Parkinson disease. Here, we establish that Hsp104 hexamers adapt different mechanisms of intersubunit collaboration to disaggregate stress-induced aggregates versus amyloid. To resolve disordered aggregates, Hsp104 subunits collaborate noncooperatively via probabilistic substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis. To disaggregate amyloid, several subunits cooperatively engage substrate and hydrolyze ATP. Importantly, Hsp104 variants with impaired intersubunit communication dissolve disordered aggregates, but not amyloid. Unexpectedly, prokaryotic ClpB subunits collaborate differently than Hsp104 and couple probabilistic substrate binding to cooperative ATP hydrolysis, which enhances disordered aggregate dissolution but sensitizes ClpB to inhibition and diminishes amyloid disaggregation. Finally, we establish that Hsp104 hexamers deploy more subunits to disaggregate Sup35 prion strains with more stable ""cross-β"" cores. Thus, operational plasticity enables Hsp104 to robustly dissolve amyloid and nonamyloid clients, which impose distinct mechanical demands."

Surprisingly little, however, is understood about the neurobiology underlying this quintessential aspect of primate cognition. In our experiment, participants first acquired knowledge about a social and a nonsocial hierarchy and then used this information to guide investment decisions. We found that neural activity in the amygdala tracked the development of knowledge about a social, but not a nonsocial, hierarchy. Further, structural variations in amygdala gray matter volume accounted for interindividual differences in social transitivity performance. Finally, the amygdala expressed a neural signal selectively coding for social rank, whose robustness predicted the influence of rank on participants' investment decisions. In contrast, we observed that the linear structure of both social and nonsocial hierarchies was represented at a neural level in the hippocampus. Our study implicates the amygdala in the emergence and representation of knowledge about social hierarchies and distinguishes the domain-general contribution of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2013648154,"Chromatin-remodelling complexes (CRCs) mobilize nucleosomes to mediate the access of DNA-binding factors to their sites in vivo. These CRCs contain a catalytic subunit that bears an ATPase/DNA-translocase domain and flanking regions that bind nucleosomal epitopes. A central question is whether and how these flanking regions regulate ATP hydrolysis or the coupling of hydrolysis to DNA translocation, to affect nucleosome-sliding efficiency. ISWI-family CRCs contain the protein ISWI, which uses its ATPase/DNA-translocase domain to pump DNA around the histone octamer to enable sliding. ISWI is positively regulated by two 'activating' nucleosomal epitopes: the 'basic patch' on the histone H4 tail, and extranucleosomal (linker) DNA. Previous work defined the HAND-SANT-SLIDE (HSS) domain at the ISWI carboxy terminus that binds linker DNA, needed for ISWI activity. Here we define two new, conserved and separate regulatory regions on Drosophila ISWI, termed AutoN and NegC, which negatively regulate ATP hydrolysis (AutoN) or the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to productive DNA translocation (NegC). The two aforementioned nucleosomal epitopes promote remodelling indirectly by preventing the negative regulation of AutoN and NegC. Notably, mutation or removal of AutoN and NegC enables marked nucleosome sliding without the H4 basic patch or extranucleosomal DNA, or the HSS domain, conferring on ISWI the biochemical attributes normally associated with SWI/SNF-family ATPases. Thus, the ISWI ATPase catalytic core is an intrinsically active DNA translocase that conducts nucleosome sliding, onto which selective 'inhibition-of-inhibition' modules are placed, to help ensure that remodelling occurs only in the presence of proper nucleosomal epitopes. This supports a general concept for the specialization of chromatin-remodelling ATPases, in which specific regulatory modules adapt an ancient active DNA translocase to conduct particular tasks only on the appropriate chromatin landscape."

Here, intra- and extracellular recordings from the auditory cortex of halothane-anesthetized rats revealed the existence of a finer sensitivity to the structure of sound sequences. Using oddball sequences in which the order of stimulus presentations is periodic, we found that tones in periodic sequences evoked smaller responses than the same tones in random sequences. Significant reduction in the responses to the common tones in periodic relative to random sequences occurred even when these tones consisted of 95% of the stimuli in the sequence. The reduction in responses paralleled the complexity of the sound sequences and could not be explained by short-term effects of clusters of deviants on succeeding standards. We conclude that neurons in auditory cortex are sensitive to the detailed structure of sound sequences over timescales of minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2055740572,"Interleukin-1β-induced disruption to endothelial stability and vascular permeability in a human in vitro model is shown to be independent of downstream nuclear factor-κB activation, relying instead on a MYD88–ARNO–ARF6 signalling cascade; inhibiting proteins involved in this pathway is shown to improve outcomes in animal models of inflammatory disease. Cytokines, the circulating proteins that activate the immune system, also disrupt cell–cell junctions and can trigger tissue oedema and destruction. Using an in vitro human endothelial cell model, this study shows that the disruptive effects of one such cytokine, interleukin-1 β, are NF-κB independent. Instead they depend on a novel non-canonical pathway involving intracellular GTPases that regulate cadherin trafficking and cell–cell interactions. Targeting of this signalling cascade in an animal model of arthritis prevents cytokine-mediated disruption of endothelial cell barriers and limits tissue damage. The innate immune response is essential for combating infectious disease. Macrophages and other cells respond to infection by releasing cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which in turn activate a well-described, myeloid-differentiation factor 88 (MYD88)-mediated, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent transcriptional pathway that results in inflammatory-cell activation and recruitment1,2,3,4. Endothelial cells, which usually serve as a barrier to the movement of inflammatory cells out of the blood and into tissue, are also critical mediators of the inflammatory response5,6. Paradoxically, the cytokines vital to a successful immune defence also have disruptive effects on endothelial cell–cell interactions and can trigger degradation of barrier function and dissociation of tissue architecture7,8,9. The mechanism of this barrier dissolution and its relationship to the canonical NF-κB pathway remain poorly defined. Here we show that the direct, immediate and disruptive effects of IL-1β on endothelial stability in a human in vitro cell model are NF-κB independent and are instead the result of signalling through the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and its activator ARF nucleotide binding site opener (ARNO; also known as CYTH2). Moreover, we show that ARNO binds directly to the adaptor protein MYD88, and thus propose MYD88–ARNO–ARF6 as a proximal IL-1β signalling pathway distinct from that mediated by NF-κB. Finally, we show that SecinH3, an inhibitor of ARF guanine nucleotide-exchange factors such as ARNO, enhances vascular stability and significantly improves outcomes in animal models of inflammatory arthritis and acute inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2011678579,"Rhythmic neural network activity patterns are defining features of sleep, but interdependencies between limbic and cortical oscillations at different frequencies and their functional roles have not been fully resolved. This is particularly important given evidence linking abnormal sleep architecture and memory consolidation in psychiatric diseases. Using EEG, local field potential (LFP), and unit recordings in rats, we show that anteroposterior propagation of neocortical slow-waves coordinates timing of hippocampal ripples and prefrontal cortical spindles during NREM sleep. This coordination is selectively disrupted in a rat neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia: fragmented NREM sleep and impaired slow-wave propagation in the model culminate in deficient ripple-spindle coordination and disrupted spike timing, potentially as a consequence of interneuronal abnormalities reflected by reduced parvalbumin expression. These data further define the interrelationships among slow-wave, spindle, and ripple events, indicating that sleep disturbances may be associated with state-dependent decoupling of hippocampal and cortical circuits in psychiatric diseases."

We found previously that incubation of human bone marrow MSCs (hMSCs) with TNF-α upregulated multiple genes including TRAIL, which has cancer apoptotic activity. Here, we show that weekly infusions into mice of hMSCs preactivated with TNF-α inhibited the progression of lung tumors formed from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (MDA). In coculture, preactivated hMSCs induced apoptosis in MDA and several other TRAIL-sensitive cancer cell lines. TRAIL was further upregulated by apoptotic MDA cells in a TLR3-dependent manner; this feedforward cycle increased MDA cell apoptosis, and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin had a synergistic effect. Also, activated hMSCs secreted DKK3 to suppress MDA cell cycling, leading to a decrease in β-catenin and cyclin D1/D3 and an increase in p21. Thus, culturing hMSCs with TNF-α enhances their tumor-suppressive properties and may represent a useful strategy to develop hMSC-based approaches for the treatment of cancer. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can either suppress or promote tumors. We found previously that incubation of human bone marrow MSCs (hMSCs) with TNF-α upregulated multiple genes including TRAIL, which has cancer apoptotic activity. Here, we show that weekly infusions into mice of hMSCs preactivated with TNF-α inhibited the progression of lung tumors formed from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (MDA). In coculture, preactivated hMSCs induced apoptosis in MDA and several other TRAIL-sensitive cancer cell lines. TRAIL was further upregulated by apoptotic MDA cells in a TLR3-dependent manner; this feedforward cycle increased MDA cell apoptosis, and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin had a synergistic effect. Also, activated hMSCs secreted DKK3 to suppress MDA cell cycling, leading to a decrease in β-catenin and cyclin D1/D3 and an increase in p21. Thus, culturing hMSCs with TNF-α enhances their tumor-suppressive properties and may represent a useful strategy to develop hMSC-based approaches for the treatment of cancer. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exposed to TNF-α activate TRAIL and DKK3 expression Activated MSCs decrease tumors in mice caused by a human breast cancer cell line Activated MSCs also induce apoptosis in several different cancer cell lines in culture TRAIL from MSCs causes apoptosis and DKK3 decreases cell cycling of cancer cells Nonhematopoietic progenitor cells derived from bone marrow, known as mesenchymal stem cells or multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), have been investigated for the treatment of cancers because they are able to preferentially home to tumors and incorporate into tumor stroma (Kanehira et al., 2007Kanehira M.

Recently, we observed that incubation of human MSCs (hMSCs) with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activated the cells to express a number of potentially therapeutic proteins including tumor necrosis factor-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (Rahman et al., 2009Rahman M. Davis S.R. Pumphrey J.G. Bao J. Nau M.M. Meltzer P.S. Lipkowitz S. TRAIL induces apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer cells with a mesenchymal phenotype.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2009; 113: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). TRAIL causes apoptosis in many malignant cells but not in normal cells; for this reason, soluble recombinant TRAIL was employed in a series of clinical trials (Gazitt, 1999Gazitt Y.

Cudrici C. Mathai S. Via C.S. Increased expression and release of functional tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) by T cells from lupus patients with active disease.Clin. Immunol. 2005; 117: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One strategy to overcome the limitations of soluble TRAIL is to use hMSCs as delivery vectors and thereby capitalize on their ability to home to tumors. hMSCs that were transduced with viral vectors to overexpress TRAIL suppressed tumor xenografts in several in vivo models including glioma, colorectal carcinoma, and metastatic breast cancer (Grisendi et al., 2010Grisendi G.

The use of viral vectors, however, introduces limitations such as insertional mutagenesis and phenotypic changes in the hMSCs. We also observed that DKK3 expression was increased upon exposure of hMSCs to TNF-α. DKK3 is suppressed in many breast cancer cell lines because the gene promoter is hypermethylated (Kuphal et al., 2006Kuphal S. Lodermeyer S. Bataille F. Schuierer M. Hoang B.H. Bosserhoff A.K. Expression of Dickkopf genes is strongly reduced in malignant melanoma.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5027-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), an observation suggesting that DKK3 is a tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore, several reports showed that epigenetic inactivation of DKK3 stimulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway that plays an important role in tumorigenesis (Bafico et al., 2004Bafico A. Liu G.

This inactivation promotes the growth of human breast, lung, and cervical cancer (Lee et al., 2009aLee E.J. Jo M. Rho S.B. Park K. Yoo Y.N. Park J. Chae M. Zhang W. Lee J.H.

Downregulation of Dkk3 activates beta-catenin/TCF-4 signaling in lung cancer.Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because hMSCs activated with TNF-α expressed both TRAIL and DKK3, we tested the hypothesis that activated hMSCs are tumor suppressive. Here, we show that preactivated hMSCs reduced the tumor burden in a lung metastatic xenograft model that was produced with MDA-MB-231 (MDA) in vivo. They also induced apoptosis of MDA cells and several other TRAIL-sensitive cancer cell lines and prevented cell-cycle progression of MDA cells in vitro. First, we observed that expression of TRAIL and DKK3 protein was upregulated in hMSCs after incubating the cells with 10 ng/ml TNF-α (Figure 1A and Figures S1A and 1B, available online). To explore whether hMSCs preactivated with TNF-α (preactivated hMSCs) have the ability to induce cell death in cancer cells, a xenograft model of human breast cancer metastasis with progressive tumor growth (Figure S1B) was induced by injecting MDA cells (2 × 106) intravenously into NOD/SCID mice (Figure 1C). The model was previously shown to respond to hMSCs virally transduced to express TRAIL (Loebinger et al., 2009Loebinger M.R. Eddaoudi A. Davies D. Janes S.M. Mesenchymal stem cell delivery of TRAIL can eliminate metastatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4134-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). A week after MDA injection, either male control hMSCs (2 × 106) or male preactivated hMSCs (2 × 106) were intravenously injected weekly for 4 or 9 consecutive weeks. Both preactivated hMSCs and control hMSCs were found by immunofluorescence (IF) staining in the tumors 1 day after IV injection (Figure S1C). Some of the cells migrated to tumor sites and incorporated into the tumors (Figure S1C). However, the cells did not persist; after 1 week, less than 0.01% of the infused cells were detected by qPCR for the human Y chromosome in the injected male hMSCs (not shown). Therefore, we were able to employ qPCR for repetitive human Alu sequences to provide quantitative estimates of the growth of the human female breast cancer cells in the mouse lung. We did not examine the distribution of cancer cells and hMSCs in other organs. The results demonstrated that preactivated hMSCs suppressed tumor cell growth compared to HBSS control group at both early and late time points (Figure 1D). Controls of hMSCs that were not exposed to TNF-α and that did not express TRAIL (Figure 1A and S1A) did not have any statistically significant effect on tumor burden compared to the HBSS control group (Figure 1D). The gross pictures and histology images (H&E staining) of lungs demonstrated that injection of preactivated hMSCs decreased the number of tumor nodules (Figures 1E and 1F). The decrease in tumor burden seemed larger by gross images and histology of the lung (Figures 1E and 1F) than by the assays for Alu sequence (Figure 1D), perhaps because the assays for Alu sequences underestimated the tumor burden in the control samples as a result of necrosis and DNA degradation at the center of large tumors. Therefore, the results suggested that the hMSCs suppressed the tumors by homing to the tumor site. To determine whether hMSCs can induce apoptosis in MDA cells in vitro, MDA cells were directly cocultured with hMSCs, hMSCs in the presence of TNF-α (activated hMSCs), or preactivated hMSCs. After 24 hr coculture, hMSCs and MDA cells were distinguished by antibodies to CD90, an epitope expressed by hMSCs but not by MDA cells (Figure 2A ), and apoptosis of MDA cells was analyzed using 7AAD and Annexin V staining (Figure 2B). When MDA cells were cultured with activated hMSCs or preactivated hMSCs, the apoptosis increased remarkably with a corresponding decrease in the number of live MDA cells (Figure 2C). Naive hMSCs cocultured with MDA cells also reduced the number of live MDA cells, but to a lesser extent than activated hMSCs (Figure 2C). In addition, TRAIL expression in hMSCs was induced by incubation of the cells with two other proinflammatory agents, LPS and IFN-γ (Figures S2A and S2B). hMSCs preincubated with LPS or IFN-γ induced apoptosis of MDA cells in cocultures (Figures S2C and S2D). However, preactivated hMSCs with LPS induced more cell death because the upregulation of TRAIL by LPS was 500-fold whereas the upregulation by IFN-γ was only 30-fold. We also cocultured activated hMSCs with other TRAIL-sensitive cancer cell lines (Figure 2D). The activated hMSCs were effective in reducing the live cell number in two triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines (HCC38 and MDA-MB-436) in addition to MDA, a pancreatic cancer cell line (CFPAC), a cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), and carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549). Activated hMSCs had no effect on a line of glioblastoma cells (U87) even though MSCs transduced to express TRAIL were previously shown to inhibit intracranial U87 glioma growth (Menon et al., 2009Menon L.G. Kelly K. Yang H.W. Kim S.K. Black P.M. Carroll R.S. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells expressing S-TRAIL as a cellular delivery vehicle for human glioma therapy.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2320-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The discrepancy is probably explained by the observation that U87 cells are less sensitive to rhTRAIL than MDA cells (Figure S2E). The results suggest that preconditioning hMSCs to express TRAIL can be useful, but gene modification may be necessary to obtain optimal therapeutic benefits in some circumstances. We elected to focus on the three triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Induction of apoptosis by hMSCs in all three cell lines was partially reduced when TRAIL activity was inhibited by a TRAIL blocking antibody: MDA-MB-231 (denoted as MDA in Figures 2E and 2F), HCC38, and MDA-MB-436 cells (Figure S2F). The antibody was more effective in blocking the effects of rhTRAIL than in blocking the effects of preactivated hMSCs (Figures 2E and 2F), apparently because the hMSCs were continually activated to express TRAIL in the coculture system. Also, inhibition of a decoy receptor for TRAIL (osteoprotegerin; OPG) in hMSCs with troglitazone (Krause et al., 2010Krause U. Harris S. Green A. Ylostalo J. Zeitouni S. Lee N. Gregory C.A. Pharmaceutical modulation of canonical Wnt signaling in multipotent stromal cells for improved osteoinductive therapy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 4147-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) increased the apoptosis compared to control (Figure 2G). The results indicated that activated hMSCs induced TRAIL-dependent apoptosis in the three triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. The activation of hMSCs by TNF-α to induce apoptosis of MDA cells in coculture was concentration dependent over the range of 0.1 to 10 ng/ml (Figure 3A ). Activation of hMSCs with as little as 0.1 ng/ml TNF-α was adequate to induce MDA apoptosis. Cell-to-cell contact was required, since the hMSCs had no effect in transwell cocultures (Figure 3B) and an increase in soluble TRAIL was not detected in conditioned medium from the cells (Figure S3A), suggesting that TRAIL expressed by hMSCs was transmembrane. The apoptosis of MDA cells in cocultures increased with increasing ratios of hMSCs to MDA cells over the range of 0.06:1 to 2:1 (Figure 3C). Control experiments demonstrated that human foreskin fibroblasts (Hs68) did not express TRAIL upon incubation with TNF-α (Figure S3B) and they did not induce apoptosis of MDA cells upon coculture (Figure S3C). Two other samples of primary preparations of human dermal fibroblasts (hDF) slightly decreased the number of live MDA cells when cocultured with the MDA cells (Figures S3D and S3E) and TNF-α, but the effect was not inhibited by a blocking antibody to TRAIL (Figure S3F). As reported previously, there were variations in the quality of hMSCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates, even if the aspirates were drawn from the same normal volunteer at the same session and the hMSCs were isolated and expanded with a standardized protocol (Phinney et al., 1999Phinney D.G. Kopen G. Righter W. Webster S. Tremain N. Prockop D.J. Donor variation in the growth properties and osteogenic potential of human marrow stromal cells.J. Cell.

Pochampally R. Swaney W. Reger R.L. Isolation and culture of bone marrow-derived human multipotent stromal cells (hMSCs).Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 449: 3-25PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared four preparations of hMSCs, identified by their anonymous donor numbers. The four samples of preactivated hMSCs demonstrated large variations in the apoptosis induced in the MDA cells (Figure 3D). As expected, the apoptosis induced by the hMSCs correlated with their levels of TRAIL expression following incubation with TNF-α (Figure 3E). As observed previously, cultures of hMSCs lose many of their biological properties as they are expanded beyond about 20 population doublings in culture (Digirolamo et al., 1999Digirolamo C.M. Stokes D. Colter D. Phinney D.G. Class R. Prockop D.J.

Sox11 is expressed in early progenitor human multipotent stromal cells and decreases with extensive expansion of the cells.Tissue Eng. Part A. 2010; 16: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As expected, hMSCs gradually lost their ability to express TRAIL upon TNF-α activation (Figure 3F) and to induce apoptosis of MDA cells as they were expanded through 20 or 25 population doublings (Figure 3G). These observations demonstrated that apoptosis induced by TNF-α activated hMSCs required upregulation of TRAIL and that the effectiveness of the cells varies with the quality of the hMSCs. To examine synergistic interactions between TRAIL-expressing activated hMSCs and chemotherapeutic drugs, we treated MDA cells with both doxorubicin and hMSCs or activated hMSCs. As reported previously (Mallory et al., 2005Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Oliva A. Saunders C. Stromberg A. Craven R.J. A novel group of genes regulates susceptibility to antineoplastic drugs in highly tumorigenic breast cancer cells.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), doxorubicin in a low concentration of 100 ng/ml (0.2 μM) suppressed proliferation of MDA as indicated by the decrease in recovery of live cells (Figure 3I) but did not induce apoptosis (Figure 3H). Incubation of MDA cells with doxorubicin decreased the number of live MDA cells recovered from cultures after 24 hr (Figure 3I) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S3G). Addition of hMSCs, however, together with 100 ng/ml doxorubicin both further decreased the number of live MDA cells recovered from the cultures (Figure 3I) and greatly increased apoptosis (Figure 3H). The effect was synergistic in that the decrease in live MDA cells was greater than the additive effect observed with doxorubicin alone (Figure 3H) and activated hMSCs alone (Figure 2B). Of special note, the hMSCs were effective regardless of TNF-α activation (Figures 3H and 3I). Since doxorubicin enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis by activating caspase or TRAIL receptors on cancer cells (Buchsbaum et al., 2003Buchsbaum D.J. Zhou T. Grizzle W.E. Oliver P.G. Hammond C.J. Zhang S. Carpenter M. LoBuglio A.F. Antitumor efficacy of TRA-8 anti-DR5 monoclonal antibody alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in a human breast cancer model.Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 3731-3741PubMed Google Scholar; Keane et al., 1999Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Russell E.K. Lipkowitz S. Chemotherapy augments TRAIL-induced apoptosis in breast cell lines.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 734-741PubMed Google Scholar; Singh et al., 2003Singh T.R. Shankar S. Chen X. Asim M. Srivastava R.K. Synergistic interactions of chemotherapeutic drugs and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand/Apo-2 ligand on apoptosis and on regression of breast carcinoma in vivo.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5390-5400PubMed Google Scholar), the low level of TRAIL activation in hMSCs, which was induced by the coculture with MDA even without TNF-α (Figure S3H), might be sufficient to induce the apoptosis in MDA cells, and then these dead cells create feedforward stimulation of TRAIL. This synergistic effect was replicated in two additional triple-negative breast cancer cell lines HCC38 and MDA-MB-436 (Figure S3I). Therefore, combination treatment of a chemotherapeutic drug and activated hMSCs can create synergistic effects and preactivation of hMSCs with proinflammatory cytokines may not be essential to induce apoptosis in MDA cells exposed to doxorubicin. Apoptosis of MDA cells by activated hMSCs appeared to increase with time in culture (Figure 4A ). Therefore, we assayed the levels of TRAIL in hMSCs isolated from the cocultures. There was a 10-fold increase in the expression of TRAIL in hMSCs recovered from cocultures of MDA cells and activated hMSCs (Figures 4B and 4C). The results suggested the hypothesis that apoptotic MDA cells might enhance expression of TRAIL in hMSCs. To test the hypothesis, we incubated hMSCs with apoptotic MDA cells. The apoptotic MDA cells were prepared by incubation with 100 ng/ml of recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) for 24 hr in serum-free media (Figure S4A) and recovery of nonadherent cells from the cultures. As expected, apoptotic MDA cells enhanced TRAIL expression in TNF-α activated hMSCs to the same extent as in the coculture system (compare Figure 4D to 4B). We then tested the hypothesis that the effects of the apoptotic MDA cells were explained by RNA that is released from damaged tissue (Karikó et al., 2004Karikó K. Ni H. Capodici J. Lamphier M. Weissman D. mRNA is an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 3.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12542-12550Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). We assayed hMSCs for expression of TLR3, a specific receptor for RNA (Karikó et al., 2004Karikó K. Ni H. Capodici J. Lamphier M. Weissman D. mRNA is an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 3.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12542-12550Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) that increases NF-κB signaling and thereby triggers an essential step in the pathway for induction of TRAIL (Rivera-Walsh et al., 2001Rivera-Walsh I. Waterfield M. Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.C. NF-kappaB signaling pathway governs TRAIL gene expression and human T-cell leukemia virus-I Tax-induced T-cell death.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40385-40388Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Expression of TLR3 in hMSCs was increased by incubation with TNF-α and further enhanced by coculture of the activated hMSCs with MDA cells (Figures 4E). Increased expression of TLR3 was also observed when hMSCs were treated with apoptotic MDA cells (Figure 4F). Treatment of apoptotic MDA cells with RNase inhibited the increase of TRAIL in hMSCs (Figure 4G). Treatment with DNase also inhibited the increase of TRAIL in hMSCs; however, the expression level of TLR9, a receptor for DNA (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang Q. Raoof M. Chen Y. Sumi Y. Sursal T. Junger W. Brohi K. Itagaki K. Hauser C.J.

The roles of RNA and TLR3 were confirmed by the observations that poly(I:C), a synthetic ligand for TLR3 (Alexopoulou et al., 2001Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Recognition of double-stranded RNA and activation of NF-kappaB by Toll-like receptor 3.Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4909) Google Scholar), increased expression of TRAIL in hMSCs (Figures 4H and S4B) and caused a small but statistically significant increase in MDA apoptosis when added to cocultures (Figure 4I). Furthermore, adding a TLR3 blocking antibody reduced apoptosis of MDA cells in the coculture system and led to recovery of greater numbers of live MDA cells (Figure 4J and S4C). The results suggested that the further increase of TRAIL in hMSCs observed in cocultures with MDA cells was mediated by feedforward stimulation of TLR3 by RNA, by DNA, and probably by other DAMPs from apoptotic MDA cells. In the coculture system, preactivated hMSCs also inhibited cell-cycle progression in the recovered adherent viable MDA cells (Figures 5A and S5A). In transwell cocultures, the inhibition was less: 3.3% increase in G1 (Figures S5B and S5C) versus 17.4% in cocultures with direct contact between the cells (Figures 5A and S5A). The results therefore suggested t"

The mechanisms underlying their activation are not fully understood. Here, we show that C. elegans DLK-1 is activated by a Ca2+-dependent switch from inactive heteromeric to active homomeric protein complexes. We identify a DLK-1 isoform, DLK-1S, that shares identical kinase and leucine zipper domains with the previously described long isoform DLK-1L but acts to inhibit DLK-1 function by binding to DLK-1L. The switch between homo- or heteromeric DLK-1 complexes is influenced by Ca2+ concentration. A conserved hexapeptide in the DLK-1L C terminus is essential for DLK-1 activity and is required for Ca2+ regulation. The mammalian DLK-1 homolog MAP3K13 contains an identical C-terminal hexapeptide and can functionally complement dlk-1 mutants, suggesting that the DLK activation mechanism is conserved.

As neurons are highly polarized cells receiving spatially segregated information, a critical aspect of MAP kinases is their ability to be locally regulated within cells and with tight temporal control. For example, in developing axons, local activation of p38 and Erk MAP kinases by the MAPKK MEK1/MEK2 is differentially required for BDNF and netrin-1-induced growth cone turning (Ming et al., 2002Ming G.L. Wong S.T. Henley J. Yuan X.B. Song H.J. Spitzer N.C. Poo M.M.

Local activation of MAP kinases by neuronal excitation plays important roles in dendritic spine dynamics (Wu et al., 2001Wu G.Y. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

Axonal injury can trigger activation of Erk at the injury site to regulate signal transduction via retrograde transport (Perlson et al., 2005Perlson E. Hanz S. Ben-Yaakov K. Segal-Ruder Y. Seger R.

In a typical MAP kinase cascade, activation of the upstream MAPKKK is a critical control point for signal specificity and amplification (Chang and Karin, 2001Chang L. Karin M. Mammalian MAP kinase signalling cascades.Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4381) Google Scholar). However, our knowledge of how MAPKKKs are activated in vivo by local neuronal signals remains limited. The dual leucine zipper-bearing kinases (DLKs) are key regulators of synapse formation, axon regeneration, and axon degeneration from C. elegans to mammals (Collins et al., 2006Collins C.A.

The DLK kinases belong to the mixed-lineage family of MAPKKKs (Holzman et al., 1994Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G.

The hallmark of these kinases is a leucine zipper domain, which can mediate protein dimerization or oligomerization and has been implicated in kinase activation (Nihalani et al., 2000Nihalani D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28622-28629Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both kinases are widely expressed in the nervous system, and DLK/MAP3K12 was identified as a synapse-associated MAPKKK (Mata et al., 1996Mata M. Merritt S.E. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B.

The in vivo functions of these kinases were discovered through genetic studies of the synaptic E3 ubiquitin ligases known as PHR proteins, including C. elegans RPM-1, Drosophila Highwire, mouse Phr1, and human Pam (Collins et al., 2006Collins C.A.

Activated DLK kinases are targeted for degradation by these E3 ligases, resulting in a tight control of duration of signal transduction. In C. elegans, loss-of-function mutations in dlk-1 genetically suppress the neuronal defects of rpm-1 mutants, but dlk-1 mutants themselves are viable and grossly normal (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y.

Constitutive activation of the DLK-1 pathway induces developmental defects mimicking rpm-1(lf) (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Regulation of a DLK-1 and p38 MAP kinase pathway by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 is required for presynaptic development.Cell. 2005; 120: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of a constitutively active MAK-2, a downstream kinase of DLK-1, at synapses can disrupt synapse morphology and decrease synapse number (Yan et al., 2009Yan D. Wu Z. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. The DLK-1 kinase promotes mRNA stability and local translation in C. elegans synapses and axon regeneration.Cell. 2009; 138: 1005-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), suggesting that local activation of the DLK-1 pathway plays important roles in synapse formation. In adult neurons, DLK-1 is essential for injured axons to regenerate, and its activity is required within a limited time window after injury (Hammarlund et al., 2009Hammarlund M. Nix P. Hauth L. Jorgensen E.M. Bastiani M. Axon regeneration requires a conserved MAP kinase pathway.Science. 2009; 323: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar; Yan et al., 2009Yan D. Wu Z. Chisholm A.D.

These results indicate that the activation of DLK-1 must be precisely controlled in time and space by neuronal activity or injury. Despite extensive studies of DLK kinase function and their negative regulation by PHR proteins, the mechanisms by which DLK kinases are activated have remained elusive. Here we identify a short isoform, DLK-1S, that shares identical kinase and leucine zipper domains with the previously reported long isoform DLK-1L but binds to and inhibits the activity of the active DLK-1L. We identify a unique hexapeptide at the DLK-1L C terminus that plays critical roles in DLK-1 isoform-specific interactions. We further show that mammalian MAP3K13 contains identical hexapeptide and can complement DLK-1 function. Our results reveal a mechanism for tight spatial and temporal control of MAPKKK activity in neurons. The previously reported C. elegans DLK-1 protein contains 928 amino acid (aa) residues, including a kinase domain (aa 133–382) and a leucine zipper (LZ, aa 459–480) (Figures 1A and 1B ). By our analysis of new dlk-1 cDNA clones, and subsequently by RT-PCR and northern blotting, we found that the dlk-1 locus generates a second shorter transcript by use of an alternative polyadenylation site in intron 7 (Figure 1A, Experimental Procedures, and see Figure S1A available online). This transcript encodes a DLK-1 isoform of 577 residues. We here name the two isoforms DLK-1L (long) and DLK-1S (short). Both isoforms contain identical N-terminal kinase and LZ domains. The C terminus of DLK-1S consists of 11 isoform-specific residues, whereas the DLK-1L-specific C terminus contains 361 residues. Neither C-terminal domain contains known protein motifs. Analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for human and rat DLK family members indicates that these genes can also encode long and short isoforms (Figure 1B). To gain clues about the functions of the two isoforms of DLK-1, we took advantage of our collection of genetic loss-of-function mutations in dlk-1, all of which were isolated as suppressors of rpm-1(lf) (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Regulation of a DLK-1 and p38 MAP kinase pathway by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 is required for presynaptic development.Cell. 2005; 120: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A large number of missense mutations affect conserved residues in the kinase domain (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C and Table S1); one mutation (ju591) changes the conserved Leu at residue 459 in the LZ domain (Figure 1B). The strong loss-of-function phenotypes induced by these mutations are consistent with the essential roles of the kinase and LZ domains (Figure S1C). Unexpectedly, another set of strong loss-of-function mutations affect the C terminus specific to DLK-1L and are not predicted to affect DLK-1S (Figures 1B and S1C and Table S1). RT-PCR analysis showed that DLK-1S transcripts were produced at normal levels in the C-terminal mutants (Figure S1D). These observations raised the possibility that DLK-1S does not have the same activity as DLK-1L. To more directly address the role of DLK-1S, we assayed its function in synaptogenesis and developmental axon outgrowth, using transgenic rescue of the phenotypes of dlk-1(lf); rpm-1(lf) double mutants. rpm-1 mutants exhibit defects in motor neuron synapse development and in touch neuron axon growth (Schaefer et al., 2000Schaefer A.M.

Both synaptic and axonal rpm-1 defects are strongly suppressed by dlk-1(lf) (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Regulation of a DLK-1 and p38 MAP kinase pathway by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 is required for presynaptic development.Cell. 2005; 120: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (Figures 1C, 1D, and S2A). Neuronal expression of a DLK-1L cDNA at low concentrations fully rescued the dlk-1(lf) suppression phenotype (Figures 1C, 1D, and S2A, juEx2789, juEx2519). Expression of a DLK-1 minigene that produces both DLK-1L and DLK-1S proteins at comparable levels (Figure S2B) also fully rescued dlk-1 suppression phenotype (Figure 1D, juEx3452). In contrast, expression of DLK-1S alone showed no rescuing activity (Figures 1C and 1D, juEx2791, juEx2523), consistent with the interpretation that DLK-1S cannot substitute for DLK-1L. Furthermore, the rescuing activity of DLK-1L was strongly attenuated by co-overexpression with DLK-1S (Figures 1C and 1D, juEx2802, juEx2813). This inhibitory effect of DLK-1S was eliminated when the LZ domain was deleted from DLK-1S (Figure S2C). However, expression of a kinase-dead mutant DLK-1S(K162A), in which the Lys162 at the ATP binding site of the kinase domain was mutated to Ala (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Regulation of a DLK-1 and p38 MAP kinase pathway by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 is required for presynaptic development.Cell. 2005; 120: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), inhibited DLK-1L to a similar degree as did wild-type DLK-1S (Figure S2C). These data suggest that the ability of DLK-1S to inhibit DLK-1L requires its LZ domain but not its kinase activity. As a further test for the role of DLK-1S, we expressed various DLK-1 constructs in the wild-type background (Figure S2D). Overexpression of DLK-1L alone caused abnormal neuronal development, whereas overexpression of DLK-1(mini) gene had a much weaker effect. Removing intron 7 from DLK-1(mini), which would prevent production of DLK-1S, resulted in gain-of-function effects similar to DLK-1(L). Finally, to address whether transgenically expressed DLK-1S could interfere with endogenous DLK-1L, we overexpressed DLK-1S in rpm-1(lf) single mutants and observed significant suppression of rpm-1(lf) phenotypes (Figure S3A). Together, these analyses demonstrate that despite sharing identical kinase and LZ domains, DLK-1S is a potent inhibitor of DLK-1L function. If DLK-1S acts as an endogenous inhibitory isoform, how does DLK-1L become activated at all? Since DLK-1L and DLK-1S differ only in their C termini, we hypothesized that the C terminus of DLK-1L may contain elements important for its kinase activation and that DLK-1S may act by preventing the interactions between such elements and the kinase domain. To test this idea, we generated a series of DLK-1L variants in which the C terminus was either truncated or contained internal deletions (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and assayed rescuing activity of these constructs in the dlk-1(lf); rpm-1(lf) double mutant strain (Figure 2, Table S2). We found that a region of 25 amino acids from residues 856 to 881 in the DLK-1L C terminus was necessary for DLK-1L activity (Figure 2, juEx3586). Remarkably, a construct lacking all of the DLK-1L C terminus except for aa 856–881 recapitulated the activity of the full-length DLK-1L (Figure 2, juEx3657), suggesting that this region is sufficient for DLK-1L regulation. Upon closer inspection of the amino acid sequences, we found a six residue motif SDGLSD (aa 874–879, hereafter referred to as the hexapeptide) that is completely conserved between C. elegans DLK-1 and vertebrate MAP3K13/LZK (Figure 3A); the remainder of the C termini of these kinases show little sequence conservation. Moreover, dlk-1(ju620), a strong loss-of-function mutation, results in a missense alteration (G870E) adjacent to this hexapeptide. We expressed a DLK-1L(G870E) mutant cDNA and observed little rescuing activity (Figure 2, juEx3659). Deleting the conserved hexapeptide in DLK-1L also completely abolished rescuing activity (Figure 2, juEx4098). Together, these results identify the conserved C-terminal hexapeptide as critical for DLK-1L function.Figure 3DLK-1L Can Bind to Itself or to DLK-1S, and the Interactions Are Regulated by a C-Terminal Conserved HexapeptideShow full caption(A) Sequence conservation of the C-terminal peptide of DLK-1L (aa 868–881) with human MAP3K13/LZK (accession number EAW78225.1), mouse (accession number NM_172821.3), Bos taurus (accession number NM_001101853.1), and Xenopus laevis (accession number NM_001172189.1).

(E) aa 850–881 of DLK-1L bind to the kinase domain (KiD). The interaction is noticeably enhanced by phosphomimetic mutations (EE) and slightly reduced by nonphosphorylatable mutations (AA) of the hexapeptide. (F) The DLK-1L C-terminal aa 850–881 interacts with the kinase domain of human MAP3K13 (KiD(H)). To determine how DLK-1S interacts with DLK-1L and how the C-terminal hexapeptide regulates their interaction, we next performed protein interaction studies using yeast two-hybrid assays. We found that full-length DLK-1L interacted with itself and also with DLK-1S (Figure 3B). Removal of the LZ domain in DLK-1L or DLK-1S eliminated these interactions. Unexpectedly, despite containing the LZ domain, DLK-1S did not show interaction with itself, suggesting that the LZ domain is not sufficient for DLK-1 dimerization or oligomerization. To test the role of the C-terminal hexapeptide SDGLSD in the interactions between DLK-1 isoforms, we deleted it from DLK-1L. We found that a DLK-1L construct lacking the hexapeptide failed to show any homomeric interaction and, instead, displayed an enhanced heteromeric interaction with DLK-1S (Figure 3C). These results suggest that the C-terminal hexapeptide plays a critical regulatory role in DLK-1 isoform-specific interactions. Since the C-terminal aa 856–881 region can endow a truncated DLK-1(kinase+LZ) with complete function (Figure 2, juEx3588), we tested whether this domain might interact with the kinase domain. In yeast two-hybrid assays, we observed that the aa 850–881 region interacted with the kinase domain of DLK-1 (Figure 3E). The hexapeptide SDGLSD contains two potential phosphorylation sites (Ser 874 and Ser878, Figure 3A). We addressed whether these serines were sites of regulation by generating phosphomimetic and nonphosphorylatable forms of the hexapeptide. We found that full-length DLK-1L containing phosphomimetic (S874E, S878E) hexapeptide showed stronger binding to itself (Figure 3C). Conversely, full-length DLK-1L containing nonphosphorylatable (S874A, S878A) hexapeptide showed an enhanced interaction with DLK-1S (Figure 3C). The phosphomimetic C-terminal aa 850–881 region also showed stronger binding to the kinase domain of DLK-1 (Figure 3E). The C-terminal domain alone did not interact with itself in yeast two-hybrid assays (data not shown), although a region of 209 amino acids between LZ domain and the hexapeptide was necessary for DLK-1L to interact with DLK-1S (Figure 3D). Taken together, the results from yeast two-hybrid interaction assays suggest that phosphorylation of the DLK-1L hexapeptide could regulate the balance between active DLK-1L homomers and inactive DLK-1L/S heteromers. To address the in vivo importance of DLK-1 C-terminal hexapeptide phosphorylation, we turned to transgenic expression. DLK-1L with a nonphosphorylatable hexapeptide (S874A, S878A) was expressed normally (Figure S4) but lacked rescuing activity (Figure 4A, juEx4708). However, coexpression of the phosphomimetic DLK-1L(S874E, S878E) overcame the inhibitory effects of DLK-1S (Figure 4A, juEx4694). Strikingly, coexpression of DLK-1S with the DLK-1L C-terminal 328 aa or the aa 850–881 fragment in dlk-1; rpm-1 mutants significantly rescued the suppression effects of dlk-1(lf) (Figure 4A, juEx3661, juEx3729). These results suggest that the C terminus of DLK-1L can activate DLK-1 in trans. Vertebrate MAP3K13/LZK proteins contain C-terminal hexapeptides identical to that of DLK-1L (Figure 3A). We therefore tested whether the function of DLK-1L was conserved with human MAP3K13. The kinase domain of MAP3K13 is 60% identical to that of DLK-1 (Figure S1B). We found that DLK-1L (aa 850–881) could bind to the kinase domain of human MAP3K13 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Figure 3F). We then expressed the human MAP3K13 cDNA under a panneural promoter in dlk-1(lf); rpm-1(lf) animals (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and observed a significant rescue of dlk-1(lf) phenotypes (Figures 4B and S3, juEx4748). In contrast, expression of a mutant MAP3K13 containing Ala mutations in the hexapeptide (S903A, S907A) did not rescue dlk-1(lf) (Figure 4B, juEx4995). The MAP3K12/DLK shares an almost identical kinase domain with MAP3K13/LZK but lacks the C-terminal hexapeptide. However, expression of MAP3K12/DLK alone failed to rescue dlk-1 phenotypes (Figure 4B, juEx4701). Interestingly, coexpression of MAP3K12/DLK with a fragment containing the DLK-1 C-terminal hexapeptide partially rescued dlk-1(lf) (Figure 4B, juEx5167). These results show that human MAP3K13 complements dlk-1 function and suggest that MAP3K13 can be activated by a similar mechanism involving the conserved hexapep"
https://openalex.org/W2028774002,"At small central synapses, efficient turnover of vesicles is crucial for stimulus-driven transmission, but how the structure of this recycling pool relates to its functional role remains unclear. Here we characterize the organizational principles of functional vesicles at native hippocampal synapses with nanoscale resolution using fluorescent dye labeling and electron microscopy. We show that the recycling pool broadly scales with the magnitude of the total vesicle pool, but its average size is small (∼45 vesicles), highly variable, and regulated by CDK5/calcineurin activity. Spatial analysis demonstrates that recycling vesicles are preferentially arranged near the active zone and this segregation is abolished by actin stabilization, slowing the rate of activity-driven exocytosis. Our approach reveals a similarly biased recycling pool distribution at synapses in visual cortex activated by sensory stimulation in vivo. We suggest that in small native central synapses, efficient release of a limited pool of vesicles relies on their favored spatial positioning within the terminal."
https://openalex.org/W2003402227,"The effectiveness of RNA interference (RNAi) in many organisms is potentiated through the signal-amplifying activity of a targeted RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) system that can convert a small population of exogenously-encountered dsRNA fragments into an abundant internal pool of small interfering RNA (siRNA). As for any biological amplification system, we expect an underlying architecture that will limit the ability of a randomly encountered trigger to produce an uncontrolled and self-escalating response. Investigating such limits in Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that feed-forward amplification is limited by biosynthetic and structural distinctions at the RNA level between (1) triggers that can produce amplification and (2) siRNA products of the amplification reaction. By assuring that initial (primary) siRNAs can act as triggers but not templates for activation, and that the resulting (secondary) siRNAs can enforce gene silencing on additional targets without unbridled trigger amplification, the system achieves substantial but fundamentally limited signal amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1976053959,"L-carnitine (LC) is generally believed to transport long-chain acyl groups from fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for ATP generation via the citric acid cycle. Based on Warburg's theory that most cancer cells mainly depend on glycolysis for ATP generation, we hypothesize that, LC treatment would lead to disturbance of cellular metabolism and cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In this study, Human hepatoma HepG2, SMMC-7721 cell lines, primary cultured thymocytes and mice bearing HepG2 tumor were used. ATP content was detected by HPLC assay. Cell cycle, cell death and cell viability were assayed by flow cytometry and MTS respectively. Gene, mRNA expression and protein level were detected by gene microarray, Real-time PCR and Western blot respectively. HDAC activities and histone acetylation were detected both in test tube and in cultured cells. A molecular docking study was carried out with CDOCKER protocol of Discovery Studio 2.0 to predict the molecular interaction between L-carnitine and HDAC. Here we found that (1) LC treatment selectively inhibited cancer cell growth in vivo and in vitro; (2) LC treatment selectively induces the expression of p21(cip1) gene, mRNA and protein in cancer cells but not p27(kip1); (4) LC increases histone acetylation and induces accumulation of acetylated histones both in normal thymocytes and cancer cells; (5) LC directly inhibits HDAC I/II activities via binding to the active sites of HDAC and induces histone acetylation and lysine-acetylation accumulation in vitro; (6) LC treatment induces accumulation of acetylated histones in chromatin associated with the p21(cip1) gene but not p27(kip1) detected by ChIP assay. These data support that LC, besides transporting acyl group, works as an endogenous HDAC inhibitor in the cell, which would be of physiological and pathological importance."
https://openalex.org/W1993635797,"Background Cah3 is the only carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoform located in the thylakoid lumen of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Previous studies demonstrated its association with the donor side of the photosystem II (PSII) where it is required for the optimal function of the water oxidizing complex. However this enzyme has also been frequently proposed to perform a critical function in inorganic carbon acquisition and CO2 fixation and all mutants lacking Cah3 exhibit very poor growth after transfer to low CO2 conditions. Results/Conclusions In the present work we demonstrate that after transfer to low CO2, Cah3 is phosphorylated and that phosphorylation is correlated to changes in its localization and its increase in activity. When C. reinhardtii wild-type cells were acclimated to limiting CO2 conditions, the Cah3 activity increased about 5–6 fold. Under these conditions, there were no detectable changes in the level of the Cah3 polypeptide. The increase in activity was specifically inhibited in the presence of Staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, suggesting that the Cah3 protein was post-translationally regulated via phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro dephosphorylation experiments confirm this hypothesis. In vivo phosphorylation analysis of thylakoid polypeptides indicates that there was a 3-fold increase in the phosphorylation signal of the Cah3 polypeptide within the first two hours after transfer to low CO2 conditions. The increase in the phosphorylation signal was correlated with changes in the intracellular localization of the Cah3 protein. Under high CO2 conditions, the Cah3 protein was only associated with the donor side of PSII in the stroma thylakoids. In contrast, in cells grown at limiting CO2 the protein was partly concentrated in the thylakoids crossing the pyrenoid, which did not contain PSII and were surrounded by Rubisco molecules. Significance This is the first report of a CA being post-translationally regulated and describing phosphorylation events in the thylakoid lumen."
https://openalex.org/W2041679548,"After releasing neurotransmitter, synaptic vesicles are retrieved by endocytosis and recycled via fast and slow pathways to be reused for synaptic transmission. To maintain the synaptic efficacy, vesicles must be refilled with neurotransmitter during recycling. However, the refilling speed estimated in isolated or reconstructed vesicles is, thus far, too slow to fill up vesicles within the period of recycling. Here, we re-examined the vesicle refilling rate directly at central glutamatergic synapses in slices, using simultaneous presynaptic and postsynaptic whole-cell recording combined with caged glutamate photolysis. After washing out vesicular glutamate, refilling of vesicles with uncaged glutamate caused a recovery of EPSCs with a time constant of 15 s that varied depending upon temperature, age, and cytosolic Cl− concentrations. This time constant is faster than that of the slow recycling pathway (∼30 s) after clathrin-mediated endocytosis but is much too slow to fill up vesicles replenished through fast recycling pathways (<1 s).

Vesicle filling time constant estimated for glutamate is 15 s at room temperature The vesicle refilling time with glutamate becomes faster as animals mature Vesicle refilling with glutamate is slower in Cl-deficient cytosolic solutions At chemical synapses, neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles by exocytosis. Vesicles are then retrieved by endocytosis, refilled with neurotransmitter, and recycled for reuse in synaptic transmission. Vesicle endocytosis is thought to be a rate-limiting step for the maintenance of synaptic transmission (Gandhi and Stevens, 2003Gandhi S.P. Stevens C.F.

Tsien R.W. The dynamic control of kiss-and-run and vesicular reuse probed with single nanoparticles.Science. 2009; 323: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) is thought to play an essential role in rapid vesicle replenishment at nerve terminals having a relatively small number of vesicles in the reserve pool (Harata et al., 2001Harata N.

For recycled vesicles to contribute to synaptic efficacy, it is essential that vesicles are fully refilled with neurotransmitter before being reused. At hippocampal glutamatergic synapses, mean amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) remains unchanged after prolonged high-frequency stimulation, suggesting that vesicle refilling is completed during vesicle recycling (Zhou et al., 2000Zhou Q. Petersen C.C.H. Nicoll R.A. Effects of reduced vesicular filling on synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal neurones.J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that vesicle refilling could occur in milliseconds (Südhof, 2004Südhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar). Glutamate is taken up into vesicles via vesicle glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) using H+ gradient and membrane potential. The time constant for vesicle acidification estimated in hippocampal cell culture is 0.4 s (Gandhi and Stevens, 2003Gandhi S.P. Stevens C.F. Three modes of synaptic vesicular recycling revealed by single-vesicle imaging.Nature. 2003; 423: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) or 4–5 s (Atluri and Ryan, 2006Atluri P.P. Ryan T.A. The kinetics of synaptic vesicle reacidification at hippocampal nerve terminals.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2313-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, glutamate uptake into isolated or reconstructed vesicles takes several to 10 min (Maycox et al., 1988Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. Glutamate uptake by brain synaptic vesicles.

Presynaptic regulation of quantal size by the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT1.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6221-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This uptake speed is much too slow to fill up vesicles during recycling in any type of pathway. During isolation or reconstitution, vesicles may lose their original transport efficiency. It is, therefore, desirable to measure vesicle refilling kinetics at living synapses. This is technically feasible at the calyx of Held as intravesicular glutamate can be depleted by washing out cytosolic glutamate in this nerve terminal (Ishikawa et al., 2002Ishikawa T. Sahara Y. Takahashi T. A single packet of transmitter does not saturate postsynaptic glutamate receptors.Neuron. 2002; 34: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Refilling of vesicles after endocytosis can then be reproduced in this model system by rapidly raising cytosolic glutamate concentration using a caged glutamate compound. Simultaneous presynaptic and postsynaptic whole-cell recordings were made at the calyx of Held synapse of mice (postnatal days 13–15 [P13–P15]). When the presynaptic pipette did not contain glutamate, EPSCs evoked at 1 Hz gradually declined in amplitude (Figure 1A and see Figure S1A available online) concomitantly with the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous mEPSCs (data not shown), suggesting that glutamate in vesicles was depleted as previously reported (Ishikawa et al., 2002Ishikawa T. Sahara Y. Takahashi T. A single packet of transmitter does not saturate postsynaptic glutamate receptors.Neuron. 2002; 34: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When the EPSC amplitude reached a low level (19%–27%), we applied a UV flash (1 s) and photoreleased glutamate from 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (MNI)-glutamate (10 mM) that had been included in a presynaptic patch pipette (Figure 1A). Glutamate uncaging produced a nearly full (94%) recovery of EPSC amplitude (Figure 1C and Figure S1E) with a time constant (τ) of 17.2 ± 1.0 s (n = 7). This recovery time constant was similar when the stimulus frequency was 10 Hz (17.2 ± 2.8 s, n = 3, data not shown) instead of 1 Hz. To realize sufficient recovery of EPSC amplitude after glutamate uncaging, we found it necessary to include glutathione (20 mM) in the presynaptic pipette solution, to minimize toxicity of MNI (Figure S1C). It was also necessary to retract the presynaptic pipette, just before glutamate uncaging, to prevent dilution of photoreleased glutamate by MNI-glutamate remaining in the pipette (Figure S1E). The recovery of EPSCs after glutamate uncaging is probably caused by glutamate uptake into vesicles via VGLUTs after vesicle reacidification by vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. As there is no specific blocker for VGLUTs, we tested the effect of H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (5 μM, 100 s) (Moriyama and Futai, 1990Moriyama Y. Futai M. H+-ATPase, a primary pump for accumulation of neurotransmitters, is a major constituent of brain synaptic vesicles.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) on the recovery of EPSCs. Bath-applied bafilomycin A1 blocked the recovery of EPSCs after glutamate uncaging (Figures 1B and 1C), suggesting that the EPSC recovery was produced by the refilling of vesicles with glutamate via H+-ATPase and VGLUT. To exclude factors other than vesicle refilling, which can contribute to the EPSC recovery after glutamate uncaging, we monitored presynaptic membrane capacitance that changes when vesicular membranes are fused into, or retrieved from, plasma membrane. This method, established in secretory cells (Neher and Marty, 1982Neher E. Marty A. Discrete changes of cell membrane capacitance observed under conditions of enhanced secretion in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), has recently been applied to the calyx of Held for assessing the number of synaptic vesicles undergoing exocytosis and endocytosis (Sun et al., 2002Sun J.-Y.

Maturation of a PKG-dependent retrograde mechanism for exoendocytic coupling of synaptic vesicles.Neuron. 2012; 74: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While the amplitude of EPSCs, evoked by presynaptic Ca2+ currents, recovered after glutamate uncaging, both the magnitude of exocytic capacitance change (ΔCm, 162 ± 22 fF before and 154 ± 17 fF after glutamate uncaging, n = 6) and the kinetics of the endocytic capacitance change (half-decay time, 8.1 ± 0.4 s before and 8.2 ± 0.2 s after uncaging, n = 6) remained essentially the same (Figure 1D). Thus, the UV glutamate uncaging had no effect on the number of vesicles fused into the plasma membrane by a given stimulation or on the endocytic rate of synaptic vesicles. Photolysis of MNI-glutamate had no effect on presynaptic Ca2+ currents either (data not shown). Thus, the EPSC recovery after glutamate uncaging must be caused by vesicle refilling with glutamate. In order to confirm this view, we examined the effect of glutamate uncaging on spontaneous mEPSCs (Figure 1E). Cytosolic glutamate washout decreases the number of detectable mEPSCs (Ishikawa et al., 2002Ishikawa T. Sahara Y. Takahashi T. A single packet of transmitter does not saturate postsynaptic glutamate receptors.Neuron. 2002; 34: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This is probably caused by a passive leakage of vesicular glutamate, in combination with the recycling of empty vesicles (Parsons et al., 1999Parsons R.L. Calupca M.A. Merriam L.A. Prior C. Empty synaptic vesicles recycle and undergo exocytosis at vesamicol-treated motor nerve terminals.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 2696-2700PubMed Google Scholar; Bartoletti and Thoreson, 2011Bartoletti T.M. Thoreson W.B. Quantal amplitude at the cone ribbon synapse can be adjusted by changes in cytosolic glutamate.Mol. Vis. 2011; 17: 920-931PubMed Google Scholar), because, after glutamate washout, the EPSC amplitude declines even without stimulation, but the declining rate becomes faster when stimulated at high frequencies (T.H. and T.T., unpublished data). After glutamate washout, the mEPSC frequency decreased by 20-fold (from 11.4 ± 3.6 Hz to 0.54 ± 0.16 Hz, n = 6) and recovered fully after glutamate uncaging (13.7 ± 3.2 Hz) (Figure 1E). The mEPSC amplitude after glutamate uncaging (33.9 ± 2.0 pA, n = 6) remained similar to the control before glutamate washout (34.6 ± 1.9 pA, n = 6). When the mEPSC frequency significantly decreases owing to the vesicular glutamate depletion, many mEPSC events will become undetectable, with their amplitudes being merged into a noise level (∼5 pA). In such a condition, the mean amplitude of detectable mEPSCs no longer provides a reliable measure for the quantal size. Therefore, to assess the time course of vesicle refilling, we adopted quantal charge (time integral of mEPSCs in 1 s windows), which reflects both the amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs. Upon glutamate uncaging, quantal charge increased with a time constant of 18.3 s (±2.1 s, n = 6) that was similar to the recovery time constant of evoked EPSCs (17.2 s, Figure 1A). Altogether, these results indicate that the recovery of the evoked EPSC amplitude is caused primarily by vesicle refilling with glutamate. Glutamate-binding affinity (Km) and kinetics of VGLUT have been determined in isolated or reconstructed vesicles (Naito and Ueda, 1985Naito S. Ueda T. Characterization of glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicles.J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar; Carlson et al., 1989Carlson M.D. Kish P.E. Ueda T.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5442-5451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The speed of glutamate uptake depends upon the copy number of VGLUT on vesicles and extravesicular glutamate concentrations, whereas the affinity is an intrinsic property of the glutamate transporter. To determine these parameters for vesicles in the calyx of Held terminal, we first examined the relationship between presynaptic cytosolic glutamate concentration ([glu]i) and the magnitude of EPSCs (Figure 2A) by switching presynaptic whole-cell pipettes containing different concentrations (0.1–10 mM) of glutamate. Next, we varied [glu]i by photolysis of the MNI-glutamate of different concentrations (2–10 mM) after depleting vesicular glutamate (Figure 2B). Photolysis of higher concentrations of MNI-glutamate produced faster and larger recoveries of EPSCs, with the recovery time constant (τ) being inversely related to the magnitude of recovery after glutamate uncaging (Figure 2B). By combining these relationships (Figures 2A and 2B), we plotted τ against [glu]i (Figure 2C). In the Lineweaver-Burk plot, Km was estimated as 0.91 mM, which is similar to those estimated for VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 reconstituted in the heterologous expression system (1–2 mM) (Bellocchio et al., 2000Bellocchio E.E.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5442-5451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results confirm that the EPSC recovery was caused by vesicle refilling with glutamate via VGLUTs. The maximal refilling time constant 1/Vmax was estimated to be 15.1 s, which is 10–100 times faster than those estimated in isolated vesicles (Naito and Ueda, 1985Naito S. Ueda T.

This difference between isolated vesicles and intact vesicles in the nerve terminal may arise from a loss of original luminal ionic compositions or damage of VGLUT transport system during fractionation in isolated vesicles. What factors can change vesicle refilling kinetics? As the temperature was raised, vesicle refilling became faster. At the physiological temperature (36°C), τ was 7 s on average (n = 4) (Figure 3A), indicating that the Q10 of vesicle refilling was 2.4. This temperature dependence is similar to that estimated for glutamate uptake by astrocytes in hippocampal slices (Bergles and Jahr, 1998Bergles D.E. Jahr C.E. Glial contribution to glutamate uptake at Schaffer collateral-commissural synapses in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7709-7716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that vesicular and astrocytic transporters have a similar temperature dependence for glutamate uptake. Faster vesicle refilling at the physiological temperature will be favorable for the maintenance of high-frequency synaptic transmission in vivo. The calyx of Held expresses both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. As animals mature, expression of VGLUT1 increases, whereas VGLUT2 expression remains similar (Billups, 2005Billups B. Colocalization of vesicular glutamate transporters in the rat superior olivary complex.Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 382: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; Blaesse et al., 2005Blaesse P. Ehrhardt S. Friauf E. Nothwang H.G. Developmental pattern of three vesicular glutamate transporters in the rat superior olivary complex.Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 320: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We examined whether the vesicle refilling time becomes faster at more mature calyces. Compared with the calyx synapse after hearing onset, prehearing synapses at P7–P9 show a marked rundown in the EPSC amplitude during 1 Hz stimulation. When evoked at 1 Hz, the EPSC recovery after glutamate uncaging was incomplete (67%, data not shown), whereas EPSCs evoked at 0.05 Hz showed a full recovery (96%) after glutamate uncaging, with a τ of 60.7 s (±11 s, n = 8, Figure 3B). Thus, at P7–P9, the refilling time was significantly slower than that after hearing (17.2 ± 1.0 s, n = 7 at P13–P15). From P13–P15 to P20–P22, there was no further change in the refilling speed (τ = 13.5 ± 3.8 s, n = 4, at P20–P22, p = 0.13, Figure 3B). The increased speed of the vesicle refilling time from P7–P8 to P13–P15 may result from a developmental increase in the copy number of VGLUTs on vesicles. Another possibility would be that VGLUT1 transports glutamate faster than VGLUT2. However, at least in the reconstituted VGLUT expression system, glutamate uptake by VGLUT2 is similar in kinetics to that by VGLUT2 (Herzog et al., 2001Herzog E. Bellenchi G.C. Gras C. Bernard V.

Thus, it is more likely that developmental upregulation in the expression of VGLUTs (Billups, 2005Billups B.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7121-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) accelerates the vesicle filling with glutamate from P7–P8 to P13–P15 at the calyx of Held. Previous experiments in isolated or reconstructed vesicles indicate that the magnitude of glutamate uptake exhibits a biphasic dependence on Cl− concentrations ([Cl]i), with less uptake both at low (<1 mM) and high (100 mM) concentrations (Carlson et al., 1989Carlson M.D. Kish P.E.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7369-7376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Wolosker et al., 1996Wolosker H. de Souza D.O. de Meis L.

Uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles by an inorganic phosphate transporter.Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). By contrast, at the calyx of Held terminal, varying presynaptic [Cl]i between 5 and 100 mM is reported to cause no effect on the mEPSC amplitude (Price and Trussell, 2006Price G.D. Trussell L.O. Estimate of the chloride concentration in a central glutamatergic terminal: a gramicidin perforated-patch study on the calyx of Held.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11432-11436Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In our assay system, we asked whether [Cl]i might affect the rate or magnitude of glutamate uptake into vesicles. When [Cl]i was reduced from 30 mM to submilimolar range, the refilling rate became markedly slow (Figures 4A and 4B ). Concomitantly, the magnitude of refilling assessed from the EPSC amplitude after recovery was reduced (Figure 4C). By contrast, when [Cl]i was increased to 110 mM, refilling rate was similar (p = 0.18), but the refilling magnitude was significantly lowered compared to that at 30 mM [Cl]i (p < 0.05, Figure 4C). The inhibitory effect of low [Cl]i on the vesicle refilling rate and magnitude is consistent with those reported in isolated or reconstructed vesicles (Carlson et al., 1989Carlson M.D. Kish P.E.

Uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles by an inorganic phosphate transporter.Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis of the allosteric activation of VGLUT by chloride ions (Hartinger and Jahn, 1993Hartinger J.

Metabolic control of vesicular glutamate transport and release.Neuron. 2010; 68: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The significant reduction in the refilling magnitude in high [Cl]i is compatible with the hypothesis that glutamate uptake into vesicles requires transvesicular Cl− concentration gradient (Wolosker et al., 1996Wolosker H. de Souza D.O. de Meis L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11726-11731Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar; Schenck et al., 2009Schenck S. Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Takamori S. A chloride conductance in VGLUT1 underlies maximal glutamate loading into synaptic vesicles.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The difference between the present results and those reported (Price and Trussell, 2006Price G.D. Trussell L.O. Estimate of the chloride concentration in a central glutamatergic terminal: a gramicidin perforated-patch study on the calyx of Held.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11432-11436Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) is that glutamate in vesicles is depleted in the present study, whereas it is intact in the previous report. These results suggest that presynaptic [Cl]i plays biphasic regulatory roles in the process of glutamate refilling into vesicles via VGLUTs. In the present study, we have made an estimation for the rate of transmitter refilling into synaptic vesicles at an intact mammalian central synapse. Our estimation indicated that the maximal vesicle refilling rate constant is 1/15 s−1 in the presence of [glu]i at 3–30 mM [Cl]i. Supposing that the number of glutamate molecules in a vesicle is 2,000 (Ryan et al., 1993Ryan T.A. Reuter H. Wendland B. Schweizer F.E. Tsien R.W. Smith S.J. The kinetics of synaptic vesicle recycling measured at single presynaptic boutons.Neuron. 1993; 11: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), 1,260 (63%) glutamate molecules would be transported into a vesicle within 15 s after endocytosis. This gives the transport rate of 84 molecules/s/vesicle. Assuming that the copy number of VGLUT on a vesicle is 10 (Takamori et al., 2006Takamori S. Holt M. Stenius K. Lemke E.A. Grønborg M. Riedel D. Urlaub H. Schenck S. Brügger B. Ringler P. et al.Molecular anatomy of a trafficking organelle.Cell. 2006; 127: 831-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar), transport rate of a single VGLUT molecule can be estimated as 8.4 molecules/s. Compared to previous estimates of 3H-glutamate uptake into isolated or reconstructed vesicles (Maycox et al., 1988Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6221-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), glutamate uptake into vesicles in the nerve terminal is much faster. It is possible that VGLUT in isolated or reconstructed vesicles may contain a lower number of VGLUTs than intact vesicles in the nerve terminal. Lower copy numbers of VGLUT may also underlie slower glutamate refilling at immature synapses (Figure 3B), as VGLUT1 expression undergoes developmental upregulation at the calyx of Held terminal (Blaesse et al., 2005Blaesse P. Ehrhardt S. Friauf E. Nothwang H.G. Developmental pattern of three vesicular glutamate transporters in the rat superior olivary complex.Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 320: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; Billups, 2005Billups B. Colocalization of vesicular glutamate transporters in the rat superior olivary complex.Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 382: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Slow vesicle refilling at immature synapses will limit the efficient reuse of vesicles, thereby limiting the frequency at which synaptic transmission is maintained. The glutamate refilling time constant estimated here (15 s) is slower than that reported for vesicle acidification estimated using synapto-pHluorin (0.5–5 s) (Gandhi and Stevens, 2003Gandhi S.P. Stevens C.F. Three modes of synaptic vesicular recycling revealed by single-vesicle imaging.Nature. 2003; 423: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), suggesting that intravesicular acidification precedes glutamate uptake in vesicles after endocytosis. This refilling time constant is faster than that of the recovery of EPSCs after depleting releasable vesicles by high-frequency stimulation (40 s, Liu and Tsien, 1995Liu G. Tsien R.W. Properties of synaptic transmission at single hippocampal synaptic boutons.Nature. 1995; 375: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and that of vesicles to become reavailable after KCl perfusion (30 s, Ryan et al., 1993Ryan T.A. Reuter H. Wendland B. Schweizer F.E. Tsien R.W. Smith S.J. The kinetics of synaptic vesicle recycling measured at single presynaptic boutons.Neuron. 1993; 11: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), suggesting that most vesicles are fully refilled during recycling. In vesicle recycling steps, fast and slow endocytosis ranging from subseconds to tens of seconds in time constants have been documented. Fast endocytosis of subsecond- and second-order time constant includes the kiss-and-run fusion pore flicker (Pyle et al., 2000Pyle J.L. Kavalali E.T. Piedras-Rentería E.S. Tsien R.W.

Mohan R. Wu L.-G. Two modes of fusion pore opening revealed by cell-attached recordings at a synapse.Nature. 2006; 444: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and the activity-dependent rapid endocytosis (Wu et al., 2005Wu W. Xu J. Wu X.-S. Wu L.-G. Activity-dependent acceleration of endocytosis at a central synapse.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11676-11683Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that vesicle endocytosis is a rate-limiting step for the vesicle pool replenishment (Gandhi and Stevens, 2003Gandhi S.P. Stevens C.F. Three modes of synaptic vesicular recycling revealed by single-vesicle imaging.Nature. 2003; 423: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and that fast endocytosis leads to a rapid reuse of vesicles, thereby contributing to maintaining high-frequency transmission, particularly at presynaptic terminals having a small number of vesicles (Harata et al., 2001Harata N. Pyle J.L. Aravanis A.M. Mozhayeva M. Kavalali E.T. Tsien R.W. Limited numbers of recycling vesicles in small CNS nerve terminals: implications for neural signaling and vesicular cycling.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the vesicle refilling time constant estimated in the present study does not support the idea that fast recycling vesicles can be reused within seconds to maintain synaptic efficacy. In this regard, the time for vesicle reuse after subsecond kiss-and-run exo-endocytosis is reported to be 23 s (Aravanis et al., 2003Aravanis A.M. Pyle J.L. Tsien R.W. Single synaptic vesicles fusing transiently and successively without loss of identity.Nature. 2003; 423: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), which is long enough for vesicles to be refilled with glutamate. Physiologically, fast endocytosis may contribute to maintaining balance between vesicular and terminal membranes, but its contribution to synaptic transmission is limited by the rate of vesicle refilling with neurotransmitter. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan. Transverse brainstem slices (150 μm thick) containing the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) were prepared from P7–P22 C57BL6 mice. The calyx of Held presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic principal cells were visually identified in the MNTB region with a 60× water immersion objective (Olympus) attached to an upright microscope (Axioskop, Carl Zeiss). Simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic whole-cell recordings were made from a calyceal nerve terminal and postsynaptic principal cell using an Axopatch 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments) and a HEKA EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik). Throughout the experiments, presynaptic recordings were made in current-clamp mode, unless otherwise noted, whereas postsynaptic recordings were made under voltage clamp at the holding potential of –70mV. EPSCs were evoked by afferent nerve stimulation using a bipolar platinum electrode placed in the midline of a brainstem slice, in the presence of bicuculline methiodide (10 μM) and strychnine hydrochloride (0.5 μM). For membrane capacitance (Cm) measurements, calyceal terminals were voltage clamped at the holding potential of −80mV and a sinusoidal voltage command with a peak-to-peak voltage of 60mV was applied at 1 kHz. Single pulse step depolarization (to 0mV, 10 ms) was used to evoke presynaptic Ca2+ currents and EPSCs. Experiments were made at room temperature (25°C–27°C) or at physiological temperature (35°C–37°C). Presynaptic pipette solutions containing MNI-caged-glutamate (10 mM, (S)-a-amino2,3-dihydro-4-methoxy-7-nitro-d-oxo-1H-indole-1-pentanoic acid, Tocris Cookson) were loaded into calyces through whole-cell pipettes. MNI-glutamate was dissolved in the presynaptic pipette solution on the day of the experiment. A UV light flash was applied from a mercury lamp light source (100 μW) by opening a shutter (Uniblitz, Vincent Associate) for 1 s under the control of a shutter driver (JML Optical Industries). Data were analyzed using IGOR Pro 6.2J (WaveMatrics) and MS Excel 2003 (Microsoft) softwares.

https://openalex.org/W2026017209,"Differentiation of pre- and postsynaptic sites is coordinated by reciprocal interaction across synaptic clefts. At parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses, dendritic spines are autonomously formed without PF influence. However, little is known about how presynaptic structural changes are induced and how they lead to differentiation of mature synapses. Here, we show that Cbln1 released from PFs induces dynamic structural changes in PFs by a mechanism that depends on postsynaptic glutamate receptor delta2 (GluD2) and presynaptic neurexin (Nrx). Time-lapse imaging in organotypic culture and ultrastructural analyses in vivo revealed that Nrx-Cbln1-GluD2 signaling induces PF protrusions that often formed circular structures and encapsulated PC spines. Such structural changes in PFs were associated with the accumulation of synaptic vesicles and GluD2, leading to formation of mature synapses. Thus, PF protrusions triggered by Nrx-Cbln1-GluD2 signaling may promote bidirectional maturation of PF-PC synapses by a positive feedback mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2002112707,"Cells modulate themselves in response to the surrounding environment like substrate elasticity, exhibiting structural reorganization driven by the contractility of cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is the scaffolding structure of eukaryotic cells, playing a central role in many mechanical and biological functions. It is composed of a network of actins, actin cross-linking proteins (ACPs), and molecular motors. The motors generate contractile forces by sliding couples of actin filaments in a polar fashion, and the contractile response of the cytoskeleton network is known to be modulated also by external stimuli, such as substrate stiffness. This implies an important role of actomyosin contractility in the cell mechano-sensing. However, how cells sense matrix stiffness via the contractility remains an open question. Here, we present a 3-D Brownian dynamics computational model of a cross-linked actin network including the dynamics of molecular motors and ACPs. The mechano-sensing properties of this active network are investigated by evaluating contraction and stress in response to different substrate stiffness. Results demonstrate two mechanisms that act to limit internal stress: (i) In stiff substrates, motors walk until they exert their maximum force, leading to a plateau stress that is independent of substrate stiffness, whereas (ii) in soft substrates, motors walk until they become blocked by other motors or ACPs, leading to submaximal stress levels. Therefore, this study provides new insights into the role of molecular motors in the contraction and rigidity sensing of cells."

These cells are part of a circuit in which they are asymmetrically wired to inhibitory neurons. Thus, they respond strongly to an image moving in the preferred direction and weakly to an image moving in the opposite (null) direction. Here, we demonstrate that adaptation with short visual stimulation of a direction-selective ganglion cell using drifting gratings can reverse this cell’s directional preference by 180°. This reversal is robust, long lasting, and independent of the animal’s age. Our findings indicate that, even within circuits that are hardwired, the computation of direction can be altered by dynamic circuit mechanisms that are guided by visual stimulation.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIzNzE5M2RkNzUzZDc0ZjEwNzdhNmVlNTFkZTc0YzA5OSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NTc1MzIxfQ.ZqCQiyNkCreWl5ErdLZASkBEimsQTnXrTpjfCh3kJlPCtbnUPcxI2f_la2c6zARALFhVF1qbuqynNqlgpEFbKJUVI2o427GfTUavhsInPi75tgEbg7nbacHPyG9gp33fN9drw-CXFrXBDK3jZPioNFSfFqJh8DGwTinYs06LKM01yMX_WzlpDwD-jxzaD0ACoc_E_RY2gF1uR1nro8rY5WiDSDA-KiItpk2SEi-6Ow9zqOizrC0TfbDR595QTvLlThSRpwOE7CRNVmOthj9XU4ahkuDzq-u3wJNrcUlK1ldYSFjUYdbDpfqIiUMX514mk10p1NGla3nOzTFQcUdNVg(mp4, (13.25 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2092742664,"Kainate receptors (KARs) play a key role in the regulation of synaptic networks. Here, we show that zinc, a cation released at a subset of glutamatergic synapses, potentiates glutamate currents mediated by homomeric and heteromeric KARs containing GluK3 at 10-100 μM concentrations, whereas it inhibits other KAR subtypes. Potentiation of GluK3 currents is mainly due to reduced desensitization, as shown by kinetic analysis and desensitization mutants. Crystallographic and mutation analyses revealed that a specific zinc binding site is formed at the base of the ligand binding domain (LBD) dimer interface by a GluK3-specific aspartate (Asp759), together with two conserved residues, His762 and Asp730, the latter located on the partner subunit. In addition, we propose that tetrameric GluK2/GluK3 receptors are likely assembled as pairs of heterodimeric LBDs. Therefore, zinc binding stabilizes the labile GluK3 dimer interface, slows desensitization, and potentiates currents, providing a mechanism for KAR potentiation at glutamatergic synapses."

Here, we show that chronic activity deprivation gives rise to synaptic AMPAR responses with enhanced fidelity. Extrasynaptic AMPARs exhibited changes in kinetics and pharmacology associated with splicing of the alternative flip/flop exons. AMPAR mRNA indeed exhibited reprogramming of the flip/flop exons for GluA1 and GluA2 subunits in response to activity, selectively in the CA1 subfield. However, the functional changes did not directly correlate with the mRNA expression profiles but result from altered assembly of GluA1/GluA2 subunit splice variants, uncovering an additional regulatory role for flip/flop splicing in excitatory signaling. Our results suggest that activity-dependent AMPAR remodeling underlies changes in short-term synaptic plasticity and provides a mechanism for neuronal homeostasis."

However, the function of calcineurin genes in Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is unclear. We identified and characterized the calcineurin genes PsCNA1 and PsCNB1 in Pst. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PsCNA1 and PsCNB1 form a calcium/calmodulin regulated protein phosphatase belonging to the calcineurin heterodimers composed of subunits A and B. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that both PsCNA1 and PsCNB1 expression reached their maximum in the stage of haustorium formation, which is one day after inoculation. Using barely stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) as a transient expression vector in wheat, the expression of PsCNA1 and PsCNB1 in Pst was suppressed, leading to slower extension of fungal hyphae and reduced production of urediospores. The immune-suppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 markedly reduced the germination rates of urediospores, and when germination did occur, more than two germtubes were produced. These results suggest that the calcineurin signaling pathway participates in stripe rust morphogenetic differentiation, especially the formation of haustoria during the early stage of infection and during the production of urediospores. Therefore PsCNA1 and PsCNB1 can be considered important pathogenicity genes involved in the wheat-Pst interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1988999122,"In patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the standard mdx mouse model of DMD, dystrophin deficiency causes loss of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) from the sarcolemma, producing functional ischemia when the muscles are exercised. We asked if functional muscle ischemia would be eliminated and normal blood flow regulation restored by treatment with an exogenous nitric oxide (NO)-donating drug. Beginning at 8 weeks of age, mdx mice were fed a standard diet supplemented with 1% soybean oil alone or in combination with a low (15 mg/kg) or high (45 mg/kg) dose of HCT 1026, a NO-donating nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent which has previously been shown to slow disease progression in the mdx model. After 1 month of treatment, vasoconstrictor responses to intra-arterial norepinephrine (NE) were compared in resting and contracting hindlimbs. In untreated mdx mice, the usual effect of muscle contraction to attenuate NE-mediated vasoconstriction was impaired, resulting in functional ischemia: NE evoked similar decreases in femoral blood flow velocity and femoral vascular conductance (FVC) in the contracting compared to resting hindlimbs (ΔFVC contraction/ΔFVC rest=0.88 ± 0.03). NE-induced functional ischemia was unaffected by low dose HCT 1026 (ΔFVC ratio=0.92 ± 0.04; P>0.05 vs untreated), but was alleviated by the high dose of the drug (ΔFVC ratio=0.22 ± 0.03; P<0.05 vs untreated or low dose). The beneficial effect of high dose HCT 1026 was maintained with treatment up to 3 months. The effect of the NO-donating drug HCT 1026 to normalize blood flow regulation in contracting mdx mouse hindlimb muscles suggests a putative novel treatment for DMD. Further translational research is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2040660031,"Otx and Mitf transcription factors have been implicated in the development of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), but the relationship between these factors and their specific roles in the development of the RPE have not been fully defined. The role of the three Otx transcription factors (Otx1a, Otx1b, and Otx2) and two Mitf transcription factors (Mitfa and Mitfb) in the development of the zebrafish RPE was explored in these experiments. The loss of Otx activity through morpholino knockdown produced variable eye defects, ranging from delayed RPE pigmentation to severe coloboma, depending on the combination of Otx factors that were targeted. Expression analysis through in situ hybridization demonstrates that otx transcription factors are necessary for the proper expression of mitfa and mitfb while Mitf transcription factors are not required for the expression of otx genes. Surprisingly, the loss of Mitf activity in mitfa, mitfb, or double mitf mutant zebrafish had no effect on RPE pigmentation or development. Moreover, histological analysis revealed that retinal lamination is unaffected in mitf mutants, as well as in otx morphants, even in regions lacking RPE. Otx and Mitf combined loss of function experiments suggest that mitfa and mitfb may still influence zebrafish RPE development. This is further supported by the ability of mitfa to induce pigmentation in the zebrafish retina when misexpressed. These findings suggest that one or more Otx targets in addition to mitfa and mitfb, possibly another mitf family member, are necessary for development of the RPE in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2082671921,"Establishment and maintenance of equilibrium in the fatty acid (FA) composition of phospholipids (PL) requires both regulation of the substrate available for PL synthesis (the acyl-CoA pool) and extensive PL turnover and acyl editing. In the present study, we utilize acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) deficient cells, unable to recycle FA derived from lipid deacylation, to evaluate the role of several enzymatic activities in FA trafficking and PL homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data presented show that phospholipases B are not contributing to constitutive PL deacylation and are therefore unlikely to be involved in PL remodeling. In contrast, the enzymes of neutral lipid (NL) synthesis and mobilization are central mediators of FA trafficking. The phospholipid:DAG acyltransferase (PDAT) Lro1p has a substantial effect on FA release and on PL equilibrium, emerging as an important mediator in PL remodeling. The acyl-CoA dependent biosynthetic activities of NL metabolism are also involved in PL homeostasis through active modulation of the substrate available for PL synthesis. In addition TAG mobilization makes an important contribution, especially in cells from stationary phase, to FA availability. Beyond its well-established role in the formation of a storage pool, NL metabolism could play a crucial role as a mechanism to uncouple the pools of PL and acyl-CoAs from each other and thereby to allow independent regulation of each one."
https://openalex.org/W2122032350,"Plasmids in lactic acid bacteria occasionally confer adaptive advantages improving the growth and behaviour of their host cells. They are often associated to starter cultures used in the food industry and could be a signature of their superiority. Oenococcus oeni is the main lactic acid bacteria species encountered in wine. It performs the malolactic fermentation that occurs in most wines after alcoholic fermentation and contributes to their quality and stability. Industrial O. oeni starters may be used to better control malolactic fermentation. Starters are selected empirically by virtue of their fermentation kinetics and capacity to survive in wine. This study was initiated with the aim to determine whether O. oeni contains plasmids of technological interest. Screening of 11 starters and 33 laboratory strains revealed two closely related plasmids, named pOENI-1 (18.3-kb) and pOENI-1v2 (21.9-kb). Sequence analyses indicate that they use the theta mode of replication, carry genes of maintenance and replication and two genes possibly involved in wine adaptation encoding a predicted sulphite exporter (tauE) and a NADH:flavin oxidoreductase of the old yellow enzyme family (oye). Interestingly, pOENI-1 and pOENI-1v2 were detected only in four strains, but this included three industrial starters. PCR screenings also revealed that tauE is present in six of the 11 starters, being probably inserted in the chromosome of some strains. Microvinification assays performed using strains with and without plasmids did not disclose significant differences of survival in wine or fermentation kinetics. However, analyses of 95 wines at different phases of winemaking showed that strains carrying the plasmids or the genes tauE and oye were predominant during spontaneous malolactic fermentation. Taken together, the results revealed a family of related plasmids associated with industrial starters and indigenous strains performing spontaneous malolactic fermentation that possibly contribute to the technological performance of strains in wine."
https://openalex.org/W2097811479,"(+)-SKF 10047 (N-allyl-normetazocine) is a prototypic and specific sigma-1 receptor agonist that has been used extensively to study the function of sigma-1 receptors. (+)-SKF 10047 inhibits K+, Na+ and Ca2+ channels via sigma-1 receptor activation. We found that (+)-SKF 10047 inhibited NaV1.2 and NaV1.4 channels independently of sigma-1 receptor activation. (+)-SKF 10047 equally inhibited NaV1.2/1.4 channel currents in HEK293T cells with abundant sigma-1 receptor expression and in COS-7 cells, which barely express sigma-1 receptors. The sigma-1 receptor antagonists BD 1063,BD 1047 and NE-100 did not block the inhibitory effects of (+)-SKF-10047. Blocking of the PKA, PKC and G-protein pathways did not affect (+)-SKF 10047 inhibition of NaV1.2 channel currents. The sigma-1 receptor agonists Dextromethorphan (DM) and1,3-di-o-tolyl-guanidine (DTG) also inhibited NaV1.2 currents through a sigma-1 receptor-independent pathway. The (+)-SKF 10047 inhibition of NaV1.2 currents was use- and frequency-dependent. Point mutations demonstrated the importance of Phe1764 and Tyr1771 in the IV-segment 6 domain of the NaV1.2 channel and Phe1579 in the NaV1.4 channel for (+)-SKF 10047 inhibition. In conclusion, our results suggest that sigma-1 receptor agonists directly inhibit NaV1.2/1.4 channels and that these interactions should be given special attention for future sigma-1 receptor function studies."
https://openalex.org/W2074582446,"The morphology of confirmed projection neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the rat was examined by filling these cells retrogradely with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) injected into the visual cortex. BDA-labeled projection neurons varied widely in the shape and size of their cell somas, with mean cross-sectional areas ranging from 60-340 µm(2). Labeled projection neurons supported 7-55 dendrites that spanned up to 300 µm in length and formed dendritic arbors with cross-sectional areas of up to 7.0 × 10(4) µm(2). Primary dendrites emerged from cell somas in three broad patterns. In some dLGN projection neurons, primary dendrites arise from the cell soma at two poles spaced approximately 180° apart. In other projection neurons, dendrites emerge principally from one side of the cell soma, while in a third group of projection neurons primary dendrites emerge from the entire perimeter of the cell soma. Based on these three distinct patterns in the distribution of primary dendrites from cell somas, we have grouped dLGN projection neurons into three classes: bipolar cells, basket cells and radial cells, respectively. The appendages seen on dendrites also can be grouped into three classes according to differences in their structure. Short ""tufted"" appendages arise mainly from the distal branches of dendrites; ""spine-like"" appendages, fine stalks with ovoid heads, typically are seen along the middle segments of dendrites; and ""grape-like"" appendages, short stalks that terminate in a cluster of ovoid bulbs, appear most often along the proximal segments of secondary dendrites of neurons with medium or large cell somas. While morphologically diverse dLGN projection neurons are intermingled uniformly throughout the nucleus, the caudal pole of the dLGN contains more small projection neurons of all classes than the rostral pole."
