https://openalex.org/W1534360145,"We show that NF-kappaB and transcriptional targets are activated in liver by obesity and high-fat diet (HFD). We have matched this state of chronic, subacute 'inflammation' by low-level activation of NF-kappaB in the liver of transgenic mice, designated LIKK, by selectively expressing constitutively active IKK-b in hepatocytes. These mice exhibit a type 2 diabetes phenotype, characterized by hyperglycemia, profound hepatic insulin resistance, and moderate systemic insulin resistance, including effects in muscle. The hepatic production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, was increased in LIKK mice to a similar extent as induced by HFD in in wild-type mice. Parallel increases were observed in cytokine signaling in liver and mucscle of LIKK mice. Insulin resistance was improved by systemic neutralization of IL-6 or salicylate inhibition of IKK-beta. Hepatic expression of the IkappaBalpha superrepressor (LISR) reversed the phenotype of both LIKK mice and wild-type mice fed an HFD. These findings indicate that lipid accumulation in the liver leads to subacute hepatic 'inflammation' through NF-kappaB activation and downstream cytokine production. This causes insulin resistance both locally in liver and systemically."

https://openalex.org/W2162393583,"The rate of ammonia synthesis over a nanoparticle ruthenium catalyst can be calculated directly on the basis of a quantum chemical treatment of the problem using density functional theory. We compared the results to measured rates over a ruthenium catalyst supported on magnesium aluminum spinel. When the size distribution of ruthenium particles measured by transmission electron microscopy was used as the link between the catalyst material and the theoretical treatment, the calculated rate was within a factor of 3 to 20 of the experimental rate. This offers hope for computer-based methods in the search for catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W1997655974,"Bats make up more than 20% of extant mammals, yet their evolutionary history is largely unknown because of a limited fossil record and conflicting or incomplete phylogenies. Here, we present a highly resolved molecular phylogeny for all extant bat families. Our results support the hypothesis that megabats are nested among four major microbat lineages, which originated in the early Eocene [52 to 50 million years ago (Mya)], coincident with a significant global rise in temperature, increase in plant diversity and abundance, and the zenith of Tertiary insect diversity. Our data suggest that bats originated in Laurasia, possibly in North America, and that three of the major microbat lineages are Laurasian in origin, whereas the fourth is Gondwanan. Combining principles of ghost lineage analysis with molecular divergence dates, we estimate that the bat fossil record underestimates (unrepresented basal branch length, UBBL) first occurrences by, on average, 73% and that the sum of missing fossil history is 61%."

https://openalex.org/W2102646072,"Resveratrol, a small molecule found in red wine, is reported to slow aging in simple eukaryotes and has been suggested as a potential calorie restriction mimetic. Resveratrol has also been reported to act as a sirtuin activator, and this property has been proposed to account for its anti-aging effects. We show here that resveratrol is a substrate-specific activator of yeast Sir2 and human SirT1. In particular, we observed that, in vitro, resveratrol enhances binding and deacetylation of peptide substrates that contain Fluor de Lys, a non-physiological fluorescent moiety, but has no effect on binding and deacetylation of acetylated peptides lacking the fluorophore. Consistent with these biochemical data we found that in three different yeast strain backgrounds, resveratrol has no detectable effect on Sir2 activity in vivo, as measured by rDNA recombination, transcriptional silencing near telomeres, and life span. In light of these findings, the mechanism accounting for putative longevity effects of resveratrol should be reexamined."
https://openalex.org/W2153993450,"Improved phylogenies and the accumulation of broad comparative data sets have opened the way for phylogenetic analyses to trace trait evolution in major groups of organisms. We arrayed seed mass data for 12,987 species on the seed plant phylogeny and show the history of seed size from the emergence of the angiosperms through to the present day. The largest single contributor to the present-day spread of seed mass was the divergence between angiosperms and gymnosperms, whereas the widest divergence was between Celastraceae and Parnassiaceae. Wide divergences in seed size were more often associated with divergences in growth form than with divergences in dispersal syndrome or latitude. Cross-species studies and evolutionary theory are consistent with this evidence that growth form and seed size evolve in a coordinated manner."
https://openalex.org/W1984116068,"In mammals, a small population of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) plays a key role in the regulation of nonvisual photic responses, such as behavioral responses to light, pineal melatonin synthesis, pupillary light reflex, and sleep latency. These ipRGCs also express melanopsin (Opn4), a putative opsin-family photopigment that has been shown to play a role in mediating these nonvisual photic responses. Melanopsin is required for the function of this inner retinal pathway, but its precise role in generating photic responses has not yet been determined. We found that expression of melanopsin in Xenopus oocytes results in light-dependent activation of membrane currents through the Galpha(q)/Galpha(11) G protein pathway, with an action spectrum closely matching that of melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs and of behavioral responses to light in mice lacking rods and cones. When coexpressed with arrestins, melanopsin could use all-trans-retinaldehyde as a chromophore, which suggests that it may function as a bireactive opsin. We also found that melanopsin could activate the cation channel TRPC3, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila phototransduction channels TRP and TRPL. Melanopsin therefore signals more like an invertebrate opsin than like a classical vertebrate rod-and-cone opsin."

https://openalex.org/W2040640278,"Exposure to arsenite inhibits protein synthesis and activates multiple stress signaling pathways. Although arsenite has diverse effects on cell metabolism, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 at Ser-51 on the α subunit was necessary to inhibit protein synthesis initiation in arsenite-treated cells and was essential for stress granule formation. Of the four protein kinases known to phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, only the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) was required for the translational inhibition in response to arsenite treatment in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In addition, HRI expression was required for stress granule formation and cellular survival after arsenite treatment. In vivo studies elucidated a fundamental requirement for HRI in murine survival upon acute arsenite exposure. The results demonstrated an essential role for HRI in mediating arsenite stress-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, inhibition of protein synthesis, stress granule formation, and survival.

The aqueous form of the trivalent arsenical is a potent environmental toxin that significantly contributes to human pathogenesis. Exposure to the arsenite anion (AsO–3) results in skin disease, cancer, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (1Abernathy C.O. Liu Y.P. Longfellow D. Aposhian H.V. Beck B. Fowler B. Goyer R. Menzer R. Rossman T. Thompson C. Waalkes M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Arsenite exposure is also causative of diabetes (2Tseng C.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 197: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Unfortunately chronic exposure to arsenite through contaminated water occurs frequently and contributes to carcinogenicity as well as neurological and renal pathology (3Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Based upon incidence, toxicity, and potential for human exposure, this toxin is ranked as the number one hazardous substance (4Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Toxic Substance and Disease Registry. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA2003Google Scholar). Higher doses of arsenite (>5 μm) damage different tissues by induction of apoptosis and necrosis. The dose-dependent and tissue-dependent apoptosis induced by arsenite has led to the use of this compound for the treatment of certain types of cancer including acute promyelocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma (5Shen Z.X. Chen G.Q. Ni J.H. Li X.S. Xiong S.M. Qiu Q.Y. Zhu J. Tang W. Sun G.L. Yang K.Q. Chen Y. Zhou L. Fang Z.W. Wang Y.T. Ma J. Zhang P. Zhang T.D. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Wang Z.Y.

As an issue of major public health concern and its potential application to treat cancer, it is essential to obtain an understanding of the mechanisms mediating arsenite toxicity as well as those affording protection against arsenite exposure. The physiologically important biological target(s) of arsenite exposure is unknown. Arsenite-induced stress is thought to be the chemical paradigm of heat stress. It is believed that acute arsenite toxicity is due to oxidation of cysteine residues in target proteins that directly alters their conformation and/or activity (7Thompson D.J. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1993; 88: 89-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, many cellular responses to arsenite exposure may be a consequence of protein misfolding due to arsenite modification. Compounding the production of unfolded protein, the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway responsible for degrading misfolded and damaged proteins is impaired upon arsenite exposure (8Bredfeldt T.G. Kopplin M.J. Gandolfi A.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 198: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Alternatively arsenite may interact with cysteine-rich, redox-sensitive molecules, such as thioredoxin and glutathione, to generate oxidative stress and interfere with specific biological processes. Exposure to arsenite influences numerous signal transduction pathways that include activation of the stress-activated, mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, and p38 to induce activator protein-1-dependent transcription (9Bernstam L. Nriagu J. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B Crit. Rev. 2000; 3: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M.

In addition, arsenite inactivates the proinflammatory NFκB signaling pathway through inhibition of IκB kinase β (12Kapahi P. Takahashi T. Natoli G. Adams S.R. Chen Y. Tsien R.Y. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36062-36066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), inhibits the signal transducers and activators of transcription family of transcription factors (13Cheng H.Y. Li P. David M. Smithgall T.E. Feng L. Lieberman M.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and activates heat shock transcription factor (14Mosser D.D. Duchaine J. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5427-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As a consequence, arsenite suppresses expression of genes encoding antiapoptotic functions and induces transcription of genes encoding proapoptotic functions, cytosolic protein chaperones, and other stress response genes, such as CHOP/GADD153 and metallothionein (15Palmiter R.D.

One of the most immediate cellular responses to arsenite exposure is inhibition of protein synthesis that correlates with phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 at Ser-51 on the α subunit (eIF2α) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor; HRI, heme-regulated inhibitor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SG, stress granule; TIA-1, T-cell internal antigen 1; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; PKR, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase; GCN, general control of nitrogen metabolism kinase; PERK/PEK, PKR-related ER kinase/pancreatic EIF2α kinase.

Biophys. 1987; 256: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α is a fundamental regulatory mechanism that controls global rates of protein synthesis in all eukaryotic cells (20Hershey J. Merrick W. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. Matthews M.B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 is a heteromeric GTP-binding protein that binds initiator tRNAMeti to form a ternary complex required for 40 S ribosomal subunit recognition of the AUG initiation codon within mRNAs. Prior to 60 S ribosomal subunit joining, GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. To catalyze another round of initiation, it is necessary to exchange GDP for GTP. As this spontaneous exchange rate is slow, this reaction requires catalysis by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Since the cellular amount of eIF2B is limiting over the amount of eIF2 (22Oldfield S. Jones B.L. Tanton D. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), continued protein translation initiation requires catalytic recycling of eIF2B. The recycling of eIF2B is regulated by phosphorylation of eIF2α at residue Ser-51. Phosphorylation at this site increases the affinity of eIF2·GDP for eIF2B by 150-fold (23Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, eIF2B is sequestered in a nonproductive complex with eIF2·GDP and prevents further initiation events. Therefore, small increases in the level of phosphorylated eIF2α profoundly inhibit the cellular protein synthetic rate. Such a drastic reduction in the rate of translation upon arsenite exposure may be an adaptive mechanism to conserve cellular energy and resources and to prevent the further accumulation of unfolded protein. It was previously demonstrated that arsenite treatment induces phosphorylation of eIF2α (21Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There are four protein kinases known to phosphorylate eIF2α at Ser-51 in mammalian cells: the double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase PKR (24Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. Matthews M.B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar), the mammalian homologue of yeast Gcn2p (25Hinnebusch A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. Matthews M.B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized eIF2α kinase PERK/PEK (26Ron D. Harding H. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. Matthews M.B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 547-560Google Scholar, 27Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), and the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase HRI (28Chen J.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. Matthews M.B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 529Google Scholar). Although these protein kinases are homologous in their kinase catalytic domains, they each have different regulatory domains that respond to different stress stimuli. PKR gene expression is induced by class 1 interferons, and the protein is translated in a latent form that requires activation by binding to highly structured or double-stranded RNA. GCN2 is activated by amino acid starvation and mediates translational and transcriptional adaptation to amino acid limitation. PERK is activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. HRI is expressed most abundantly in erythroid cells. HRI is the most important eIF2α kinase in erythroid cells where it is activated by deficiency in heme, the prosthetic group of hemoglobin, through two heme-binding domains. In this manner, HRI coordinates globin mRNA translation with available iron (29Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). HRI is required to prevent accumulation of misfolded globin chains in the absence of heme. Previous studies have demonstrated that arsenite mediates phosphorylation of eIF2α through HRI in erythroid cells (30Lu L. Han A.P. Chen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7971-7980Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which, if any, of these eIF2α kinases mediates the translational inhibition by arsenite in non-erythroid cells. Environmental stress initiates the appearance of phase-dense particles termed stress granules (SGs) that were first identified upon heat treatment of tomato cells in culture (31Nover L. Scharf K.D. Neumann D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1648-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). SG assembly occurs when translation initiation is aborted. When translation is initiated in the absence of functional eIF2·GTP·tRNAMeti, the 40 S ribosome stalls on the mRNA to form a 48 S preinitiation complex. These complexes of 40 S ribosomes, initiation factors, and their associated mRNA transcripts accumulate to form SGs. SG formation requires T-cell internal antigen 1 (TIA-1) and TIA-1-related proteins (32Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 33Kedersha N. Chen S. Gilks N. Li W. Miller I.J. Stahl J. Anderson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The mRNAs in SGs are in dynamic equilibrium with the polysomes (34Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Stress granule formation in response to ER stress requires the ER stress kinase PERK (35Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Ron D. Jefferson L.S. Harding H.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C273-C284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although depletion of the eIF2·GTP·tRNAMeti ternary complex correlates with SG formation, it is not known whether eIF2 inactivation through eIF2α phosphorylation is required for SG formation (36Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of arsenite on protein synthesis was mediated through phosphorylation at Ser-51 on eIF2α. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was necessary for arsenite-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and SG formation. We demonstrated that HRI was expressed and was required for eIF2α phosphorylation to inhibit protein synthesis in response to arsenite-induced stress in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The significance of arsenite-induced protein synthesis inhibition was corroborated in vivo as HRI was required for survival when cells or mice were exposed acutely to arsenite. Generation of Kinase-null Mice and MEFs—Homozygous HRI–/– mutant mice (37Han A.P. Yu C. Lu L. Fujiwara Y. Browne C. Chin G. Fleming M. Leboulch P. Orkin S.H. Chen J.J.

PKR–/– mutant mice were kindly provided by Bryan Williams (39Yang Y-L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schäfer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). MEFs were generated using standard isolation procedures (40Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). PERK–/– mutant, GCN2–/– mutant, and control MEFs were kindly provided by David Ron (27Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium with high glucose (Invitrogen) with the addition of 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and essential and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). HRI mRNA Expression Analysis—RNA was extracted from wild-type and HRI–/– mutant MEFs using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reverse transcriptase reaction mixture was assembled as follows: 2 pmol of oligo(dT)15 (Promega, Madison, WI), 4 μl of 5× avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase buffer, 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), 40 units of rRNAsin recombinant RNase inhibitor (Promega), 2 μg of RNA, 1.25 mm dNTP mixture (Qbiogene, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), and purified water to a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The reaction was heated to 50 °C for 1 h and then to 75 °C for 10 min. The resulting cDNA was purified using a PCR purification column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and eluted in 30 μl of water. cDNA eluate (5 μl) or HRI cDNA (5 ng) was used as template for the PCR. The PCR was performed using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol plus 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The specific primers for HRI were 5′-ATGCTGGGGGGCAGCTCC-′3 and 5′-TCATCTCTTCATCCCTCTG-3. The reaction was cycled at 95 °C for 1 min, then 50 °C for 1 min, and then 72 °C for 2 min for 32 cycles followed by a final extension of 72 °C for 2 min. The expected product size for the HRI+/+ MEFs was 1549 base pairs, and for the HRI–/– MEFs it was 1145 base pairs. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 0.9% agarose gel for analysis. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion). RNA was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde gel and then transferred onto a nylon membrane for hybridization to a digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe specific to HRI. Detection was performed using anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-complexed antibody. Protein Synthesis Analysis—MEF cultures were grown overnight after passage and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in media containing 0–200 μm arsenite or 1 μm thapsigargin. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then radiolabeled with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (specific activity =>1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in methionine- and cysteine-free medium (Invitrogen) for 10 min. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cell extracts were prepared. Radioactivity incorporated was measured by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid and scintillation counting. Some cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and prepared for autoradiography using EnHance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western Blot Analysis—MEFs were cultured and treated as indicated. Cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH = 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete miniprotease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on reducing gels, and the phosphorylated and total forms of eIF2α were detected by Western blot analysis as described previously (41Srivastava S.P. Kumar K.U. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Antibody for phosphorylated eIF2α was obtained from BIOSOURCE, and mouse monoclonal antibody was used for detection of total eIF2α (41Srivastava S.P. Kumar K.U. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-p38 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Densitometry scanning was performed and quantified with Image J software obtained from the National Institutes of Health website. Polysome Profile Analysis—Cells in log phase growth were treated with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml for 10 min) prior to being harvested by scraping and processed for polysome analysis essentially as described previously (42Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The fractionated polysomes were eluted using an ISCO fractionator with continual monitoring at A254. Immunofluorescence of Stress Granules—Cells were treated with different stress treatments including graded concentrations of sodium arsenite for 45 min, heat shock (44 °C for 1 h), puromycin (20 μg/ml for 2 h), and glucose starvation. After treatment, the cells were fixed and stained for goat polyclonal antibodies against TIA-1 (sc-1751, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), eIF3 (sc-16378, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and other SG markers as described previously (33Kedersha N. Chen S. Gilks N. Li W. Miller I.J. Stahl J. Anderson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). MEFs were transfected using Qiagen reagent as described previously (32Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Cell Viability Assay—MEF cells were cultured in 96-well plates overnight before exposure to medium containing sodium arsenite. Cell viability was measured with a ProCheck cell viability assay kit (Serologicals Corp., Norcross, GA). The assay is based on the conversion of an oxidized tetrazole to a reduced form by mitochondria in metabolically active cells. The absorbance at 480 nm is proportional to the number of viable cells. In Vivo Response to Arsenite Injection—The survival of wild-type, HRI–/–, PKR–/–, and HRI–/–PKR–/– mutant mice upon acute arsenite exposure was assessed 24 h after subcutaneous injection of freshly prepared, sterile sodium arsenite (0–20 mg/kg of body weight as indicated) or phenylhydrazine (45 mg/kg of body weight). The University of Michigan Committee for the Care and Use of Animals (UCUCA) approved all animal procedures. Blood samples were collected in EDTA by tail bleed before and at 1 h and 4.5–5 h after injection. Reticulocyte counts were analyzed by Coulter counting based on size. Liver samples were taken at 4 h after injection, and extracts were prepared by homogenization in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 150 mm NaF, 0.5 mm orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Arsenite-mediated Inhibition of Protein Synthesis Requires Phosphorylation of eIF2α—To evaluate the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in the cellular stress response to arsenite, we studied MEFs that harbor a S51A knock-in mutation into the eIF2α gene (38Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Lui C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of sodium arsenite and then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine to measure the rates of protein synthesis. Whereas increasing concentrations of sodium arsenite inhibited protein synthesis greater than 90% in wild-type MEFs, the inhibition was significantly less in the homozygous eIF2α A/A mutant MEFs (Fig. 1, A and B). Although the spectrum of abundant polypeptides synthesized was similar under control and arsenite treatment conditions, the homozygous eIF2α A/A mutant cells were more resistant to the inhibition mediated by arsenite (Fig. 1A). In three independent experiments, 50 μm sodium arsenite reproducibly inhibited protein synthesis in wild-type MEFs with little change in the homozygous eIF2α A/A mutant MEFs (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analysis using antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated eIF2α and total eIF2α demonstrated a 3-fold increase in eIF2α phosphorylation in wild-type (S/S) MEFs, whereas phosphorylation was not detected in the homozygous eIF2 A/A mutant MEFs (Fig. 1D). Treatment of cells with sodium arsenite activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (7Thompson D.J. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1993; 88: 89-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To determine whether arsenite actually induces a stress response in the homozygous eIF2α A/A mutant MEFs, we studied the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by Western blot analysis using an antibody that is specific to phosphorylated p38. The results demonstrated that sodium arsenite activated p38 to a similar level in the wild-type (S/S) and homozygous eIF2α A/A mutant cell lines by comparison to the total eIF2α loading control (Fig. 1D). Therefore, although arsenite induced a stress response, protein synthesis was not inhibited in the eIF2α A/A mutant cells. In addition, p38 activation did not require eIF2α phosphorylation or translational attenuation. Arsenite-mediated eIF2α Phosphorylation and Inhibition of Protein Synthesis Requires HRI—To evaluate the requirement for the four different eIF2α kinases in arsenite-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation and translational inhibition, we studied arsenite responses in MEFs isolated from mice that harbor gene deletions in the different eIF2α kinases. An initial experiment compared eIF2α phosphorylation in wild-type HRI+/+, HRI+/–, HRI–/–, and PKR–/– MEFs. While the eIF2α phosphorylation in wild type, heterozygous HRI+/–, and PKR–/– MEFs increased 3–4-fold, there was no comparable increase in the HRI–/– MEFs (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the same Western blot using an anti-phospho-p38 antibody indicated similar amounts of activated p38 upon arsenite treatment for all MEFs. Analysis of protein synthesis by [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine pulse labeling and SDS-PAGE indicated substantial translational inhibition in all cell lines tested except the HRI–/– MEFs (Fig. 2B and data not shown). We then analyzed MEFs harboring deletions in each of the eIF2α kinases: HRI, PKR, GCN2, and PERK. Homozygous deletion of PKR, GCN2, or PERK had no effect on the arsenite-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α and inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, deletion of HRI alone prevented both arsenite-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation and translational inhibition. Although there was a background level of eIF2α phosphorylation in the HRI–/– mutant MEFs, this phosphorylation was not increased upon sodium arsenite treatment (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). Treatment of the MEFs with thapsigargin, an agent that induces ER stress, significantly inhibited protein synthesis in all cell lines except the PERK–/– mutant MEFs (Fig. 3B), consistent with the role of PERK in translational attenuation on ER stress (26Ron D. Harding H. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. Matthews M.B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 547-560Google Scholar, 27Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits translation at the level of initiation and causes dissociation of polyribosomes and accumulation of monoribosomes and ribosomal subunits. Therefore, we analyzed polysome profiles for control and arsenite-treated MEFs (Fig. 4). These results were quantified by measuring the ratio of polysomes/80 S species observed for treated cells relative to untreated cells (values presented in Fig. 4). Comparison of these ratios between wild-type and mutant MEFs shows the area of polysomes/80 S upon arsenite treatment was ∼2-fold greater in the HRI–/– and eIF2α A/A mutant MEFs compared with their wild-type controls. In addition, this ratio between the PKR–/– MEFs and wild-type MEFs did not significantly differ (0.9) (Fig. 4). Thus, less polysome dissociation occurred upon arsenite treatment of homozygous eIF2α A/A mutant MEFs and HRI–/– mutant MEFs (Fig. 4). These differences in polysome profiles are consistent with the effects of arsenite on protein synthesis in these cells. Our data support the conclusion that HRI is the dedicated eIF2α kinase that mediates translational control in response to sodium arsenite in MEFs. Since previous studies questioned the significance of HRI detected in non-erythroid cells (43Mellor H. Flowers K.M. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Crosby J.S. Lee K. London I.M. Chen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3906-3914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we characterized HRI expression. Unfortunately immunoblot analysis with several anti-HRI antibodies did not detect HRI in extracts of wild-type MEFs. Therefore, we performed reverse transcription-PCR as a more sensitive means to detect whether HRI mRNA is expressed in MEFs. This analysis demonstrated the presence of a 1.5-kb product in wild-type MEFs that was absent in the HRI–/– mutant MEFs (Fig. 5A). HRI–/– mutant MEFs displayed a 1.1-kb product, consistent with deletion of 404 bases in the mRNA from the HR"

Recently, this protein has been detected in macrophages where it strongly contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Here, we investigated the role of aP2 in macrophage biology and the molecular mechanisms underlying its actions. We demonstrate that aP2-deficient macrophages display defects in cholesterol accumulation and alterations in pro-inflammatory responsiveness. Deficiency of aP2 alters the lipid composition in macrophages and enhances peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activity, leading to elevated CD36 expression and enhanced uptake of modified low denwsity lipoprotein. The increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activity in aP2-deficient macrophages is also accompanied by a significant stimulation of the liver X receptor α-ATP-binding cassette transporter A1-mediated cholesterol efflux pathway. In parallel, aP2-deficient macrophages display reduced IκB kinase and NF-κB activity, resulting in suppression of inflammatory function including reduced cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression and impaired production of inflammatory cytokines. Our results demonstrate that aP2 regulates two central molecular pathways to coordinate macrophage cholesterol trafficking and inflammatory activity.

FABPs display distinct patterns of tissue expression and have been the subject of extensive investigation at the biochemical level in terms of structure and ligand binding properties (1.Makowski L. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2464S-2468SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding the primary functional role of these proteins and their mechanisms of action. Adipocyte FABP, also designated aP2 and FABP4, is an important contributor to the maintenance of systemic glucose metabolism (2.Hotamisligil G.S. Johnson R.S. Distel R.J. Ellis R. Papaioannou V.E.

Because aP2 has been traditionally regarded as a protein expressed exclusively in differentiated adipocytes, the physiological consequences of its deficiency have been predominantly linked to changes in adipocytes. However, recent publications have reported the presence of aP2 in macrophages and have shown that aP2 expression can be induced by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists, oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages and can be decreased by treatment with a cholesterol-lowering statin (5.Pelton P.D.

Med. 2001; 7: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). aP2 deficiency was shown to provide remarkable protection against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient models of atherosclerosis. Bone marrow transplantation studies demonstrated that this atheroprotective effect of aP2 is predominantly related to its actions in the macrophage (9.Makowski L. Boord J.B. Maeda K. Babaev V.R. Uysal K.T. Morgan M.A. Parker R.A. Suttles J. Fazio S. Hotamisligil G.S. Linton M.F. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 10.Boord J.B. Maeda K. Makowski L.

Thus, it is clear that aP2 plays a vital role in the local macrophage responses in atherogenesis but the cellular mechanisms of action remain unknown. aP2 binds a number of hydrophobic ligands known to influence macrophage function including fatty acids, various cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase metabolites, and retinoic acid as well as several synthetic PPAR agonists (1.Makowski L. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2464S-2468SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that aP2 may regulate the accessibility of lipid ligands to their molecular targets in macrophages. A number of lipid-regulated pathways have been shown to play an important role in macrophage biology as it relates to cardiovascular and inflammatory disease. For example, the PPAR family of nuclear receptors, activated by multiple long chain fatty acids and eicosanoids, regulates the expression of numerous genes including those encoding proteins involved in cholesterol trafficking and the inflammatory response (11.Nagy L.

In addition, the IKK-NF-κB pathway, which is critical to the control of macrophage pro-inflammatory activity, has been shown to be highly sensitive to inactivation by cyclopentenone prostaglandins (16.Rossi A.

Because the impact of aP2 deficiency on atherosclerosis equals or surpasses that of the manipulations targeting individual components of these pathways, we investigated the possibility that aP2 acts as a common upstream coordinator of these lipid-regulated pathways. In this report, we provide evidence that aP2 modulates signaling pathways that regulate both macrophage cholesterol trafficking and inflammatory activity. Cell Culture—All of the cell culture was performed using low endotoxin regents in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Immortalized macrophage cell lines were established from aP2+/+ and aP2−/- mice (2.Hotamisligil G.S. Johnson R.S. Distel R.J. Ellis R. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1377-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) as previously described (9.Makowski L. Boord J.B. Maeda K. Babaev V.R. Uysal K.T. Morgan M.A. Parker R.A. Suttles J. Fazio S.

Transfection of Macrophages and Reporter Assays—Cell lines were transfected by electroporation using the Eppendorf Multiporator (Eppendorf Scientific, Inc., Westbury, NY). Macrophages were co-transfected with 20 μg of endotoxin-free prepared firefly luciferase (Luc) plasmids, pPPRE-Luc, pGST-Luc (a gift from Dr. Russell Prough, Department of Biochemistry, University of Louisville), pNF-κB-Luc, or pMCS-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and 2 μg of Renilla luciferase plasmid (phRL-null-Luc) (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). For NF-κB activity, macrophages were left untreated or treated for 16 h with indicated doses of LPS or 25, 50, and 75 μg of membrane proteins derived from CHO-control or CHO-CD154 isolated as previously described (22.McLeish K.R. Klein J.B. Lederer E.D. Head K.Z. Ward R.A. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 407-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For PPARγ activity, macrophages were stimulated for 24 h with vehicle and 25 μm ciglitazone (Biomol Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) or pretreated for 1 h using the PPARγ-specific antagonist GW9662 (a gift from Dr. Peter Tontonoz). Statistical analysis of reporter assays was performed using the Student's t test. Reconstitution of aP2 Expression into aP2-deficient Macrophages— The murine aP2 cDNA was ligated into plasmid pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen), resulting in plasmid pcDNA-aP2. Endotoxin-free pcDNA-aP2 (20 μg) was transfected by electroporation into the aP2−/- macrophage cell line (henceforth referred to as aP2−/-R) and selected by resistance to zeocin. Expression of aP2 by the aP2−/-R cell line was confirmed at the mRNA level (as shown in Fig. 2C, left panel). The levels of aP2 protein, as assessed by Western blot, were similar in the aP2−/-R line as compared with the aP2+/+ macrophage line (data not shown). Analysis of Intracellular Lipids—For quantification of individual lipid species (cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, and free fatty acids), lipids were analyzed as previously described (9.Makowski L. Boord J.B. Maeda K. Babaev V.R. Uysal K.T. Morgan M.A. Parker R.A. Suttles J. Fazio S. Hotamisligil G.S. Linton M.F. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). An analysis of free fatty acids in untreated macrophage cell lines was also performed by Lipomics Technologies (West Sacramento, CA) (23.Watkins S.M. Reifsnyder P.R. Pan H.J. German J.B. Leiter E.H.

Cholesterol Trafficking—Oxidation of LDL and 125I-LDL (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA) was performed using 5 μm CuSO4 for 18–24 h (24.Kunjathoor V.V. Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Moore K.J.

Degradation of modified LDL was assessed as a measure of particle uptake at 37 °C for 24 h using 10 μg/ml 125I-oxLDL in the presence or absence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled oxLDL competitor as described previously (25.Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D.S. Mortensen R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Specific degradation was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity measured in the presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled oxLDL from the total radioactivity and normalized to cellular protein content. For analysis of cholesterol efflux, radiolabeled modified LDL particles were generated in serum-free medium containing 1 μCi/ml 1,2-3H(N)-cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) incubated with 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.2% low endotoxin fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. aP2+/+ and aP2−/- macrophages were loaded with radiolabeled lipoproteins for 24 h and then equilibrated overnight in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% low endotoxin fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin with no lipoproteins (25.Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D.S. Mortensen R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Efflux to apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) (0–15 μg/ml) proceeded for 3 h. Radioactivity of clarified culture supernatants and cellular lysate was measured separately by liquid scintillation. Percent efflux was calculated as counts per minute in [medium/(medium + lysate)], normalized to cellular protein content, and expressed as a percentage relative to aP2+/+ cultured with no apoA1 (100%). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. Analysis of mRNA and Protein Levels—aP2+/+ and aP2−/- macrophage cell lines were untreated or treated with LPS (Escherichia coli serotype O111:B4, Sigma) for the indicated times before harvesting RNA using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RiboQuant® multi-probe RNase protection assay system using probe set mCK2b (BD Biosciences) was used for analysis of cytokine RNA. Standard Northern analysis was performed on untreated macrophage cell lines or with 10 ng/ml IL-4 for 24 h for LXRα image of reconstituted macrophages only. Macrophage proteins were harvested in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.35 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and Calbiochem protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem)). Total protein content of the samples was assessed by micro-BCA assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), and equal amounts of protein per sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed using mouse anti-COX-2 and mouse anti-iNOS (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit anti-ABCA1 (NB 400-105, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), guinea pig anti-CD36 (a gift from Dr. Chistopher K. Glass, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California), mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma), rabbit anti-aP2 (a gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., New York, NY), anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Analysis of IKK and NF-κB Activity—Macrophage lines were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for the indicated times before harvest in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and assay of IKK activity was performed. For a comparison of kinase activity in aP2+/+, aP2−/-, and aP2−/-R, macrophages were treated with LPS for 10 min. IKKα/β was immunoprecipitated using anti-IKKα/β (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). One-third of the immunoprecipitate was analyzed for total IKKα/β content, and the rest was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μg/sample IκBα-GST) to phosphorylate 1–54 amino acids of IκBα-GST substrate (a gift from Ebrahim Zandi, Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of California). Proteins were separated, transferred, and visualized by standard methods. DNA binding activity of NF-κB was determined using the Gelshift Plus Rel Family electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) kit (Geneka Biotechnology, Inc., Montreal, Canada). aP2+/+ and aP2−/- macrophages lines were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 30 min. Nuclear proteins were extracted using a modified Dignam method (26.Dignam, J. D., Lebovitz, R. M., and Roeder, R. G. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 1475–1489Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extract (20 μg) from each sample and a Raji positive control nuclear extract were incubated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled (cold competition) or [γ-32P]ATP-labeled double-stranded DNA containing NF-κBp65 consensus-binding sequence for 20 min. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Assay of Inflammatory Mediators—aP2+/+ and aP2−/- macrophages were treated with LPS, CHO-CD154-transfected cells, or CHO-control cells (18 h for IL-6 and MCP-1 and 6 h for tumor necrosis factor α) before culture supernatants were analyzed by ELISA (OptEIA™, BD Biosciences). Supernatants from macrophage cell lines were evaluated for MCP-1 secretion by ELISA after 0 (unstimulated) or 25 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment for 6 h. For analysis of PGE2 secretion, cells were stimulated with LPS for 24 h, after which supernatants were assayed for PGE2 content via competitive ELISA (Neogen, Lexington, KY). For analysis of nitric oxide production, macrophages were treated with 500 ng/ml LPS and/or 10 units/ml IFNγ for 48 h. Supernatants were assayed for nitrite content by the addition of Greiss reagent as described previously (27.Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar). ELISAs and nitrite assays were analyzed using an E-max Precision microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

In the absence of aP2, macrophages exhibit reduced capacity for foam cell formation (9.Makowski L. Boord J.B. Maeda K. Babaev V.R. Uysal K.T. Morgan M.A. Parker R.A. Suttles J. Fazio S. Hotamisligil G.S. Linton M.F. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). To investigate this phenotype further, we examined the macrophage intracellular lipid milieu in the presence and absence of aP2. Total cholesterol (C) and cholesterol ester (CE) content was decreased substantially in aP2-deficient macrophages as compared with wild type at base line (C, 37.3 versus 45.5; CE, 19.5 versus 28.3 μg/mg, respectively) as well as after acLDL treatment for 72 h (C, 37.2 versus 50.0; CE, 38.5 versus 56.5 μg/mg, respectively). Interestingly, total cellular triglyceride (TG) and non-esterified free fatty acid (FFA) levels were increased in aP2−/- macrophages compared with aP2+/+ controls at base line (TG, 26.5 versus 19.8; FFA, 26.8 versus 16.9 μg/mg, respectively) and after acLDL loading (TG, 37.0 versus 23.3; FFA, 33.8 versus 24.7 μg/mg, respectively). The increase in FFA levels in macrophages is consistent with earlier reports on aP2−/- adipocytes (28.Coe N.R. Simpson M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 967-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, in a separate experiment, reconstitution of aP2−/- macrophages with aP2 reduced the fatty acid content in macrophages toward wild-type levels (aP2+/+, 574; aP2−/-, 1013, and aP2−/-R, 820 nm FFA/109 cells). aP2 Deficiency Enhances Cholesterol Trafficking in Macrophages—To determine the mechanism for aP2-mediated cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, we first examined cholesterol influx by visualizing and quantifying modified LDL (DiI-acLDL) uptake (25.Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D.S. Mortensen R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). aP2+/+, aP2−/-, and aP2−/- macrophages reconstituted with aP2 were loaded for 4 h with fluorescent-labeled acLDL particles. Surprisingly, aP2−/- macrophages internalized more modified LDL particles. The enhanced modified LDL uptake by aP2−/- macrophages was reversed by restoration of aP2 expression, substantiating a role of aP2 in particle uptake (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, thioglycollate-elicited primary aP2−/- macrophages internalized significantly more modified LDL as compared with aP2+/+ cells (p < 0.00001). Similarly, in the macrophage cell lines, aP2 deficiency resulted in a substantial increase in internalization of particles over that of wild type (data not shown). aP2 reconstitution of aP2−/- macrophages completely reversed this alteration in cholesterol uptake compared with aP2−/- cells, demonstrating the specificity of aP2 in this pathway (Fig. 1C). The increased internalization of modified lipoprotein particles by aP2−/- cells appears paradoxical considering the reduced cholesterol and cholesterol ester content of the aP2−/- macrophages and protection of aP2−/- mice against atherosclerosis (9.Makowski L. Boord J.B. Maeda K. Babaev V.R. Uysal K.T. Morgan M.A. Parker R.A. Suttles J. Fazio S. Hotamisligil G.S. Linton M.F. Nat.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, macrophages are equipped with a cholesterol efflux pathway that provides a mechanism to limit foam cell formation. Thus, we considered the possibility that the reduced cholesterol content of aP2−/- macrophages may be due to the acceleration of cholesterol efflux (25.Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D.S. Mortensen R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 29.Venkateswaran A.

Fig. 1D demonstrates that cholesterol efflux from primary thioglycollate-elicited macrophages isolated from aP2−/- mice was increased at base line and upon the addition of apoA1 as compared with macrophages isolated from aP2+/+ mice. The cholesterol efflux rate in the aP2−/- macrophage cell line was also substantially higher than in the aP2+/+ cells (data not shown). The elevated apoA1-mediated efflux capacity in aP2−/- macrophages was abrogated with reconstitution of aP2 (Fig. 1E). Overall, these data demonstrate that aP2-deficient macrophages are protected from excessive cholesterol accumulation, primarily through activation of the cholesterol efflux pathway. The restoration of aP2 expression into aP2−/- macrophages reversed the hyperactivated cholesterol influx and efflux activity, demonstrating a specific link between aP2 expression and cholesterol trafficking in macrophages. The simultaneous increase in modified cholesterol uptake and efflux has also been observed in macrophages exposed to agonists of PPARγ, a key nuclear receptor that initiates the transcription of genes involved in cholesterol trafficking (29.Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12097-12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 30.Akiyama T.E. Sakai S.

Given the ability of aP2 to bind known PPARγ ligands, we postulated that aP2 may act as a negative regulator of PPARγ activity in macrophages. We tested this hypothesis by examining the influence of aP2 on PPARγ transcriptional activity using a PPAR response element (PPRE)-driven reporter. Macrophages were treated with a PPARγ-specific synthetic agonist, ciglitazone, or with 9-cis-retinoic acid, an agonist for RXRα, the binding partner of PPARγ. Both background and agonist-induced PPRE-driven transcriptional activity was significantly higher in the aP2−/- macrophages as compared with wild type (Fig. 2A) with p values of 0.013 and 0.0003 for ciglitazone and retinoic acid, respectively. Agonist-induced reporter activity was inhibited by the irreversible PPARγ-specific antagonist, GW9662 (33.Leesnitzer L.M. Parks D.J. Bledsoe R.K. Cobb J.E. Collins J.L. Consler T.G. Davis R.G. Hull-Ryde E.A. Lenhard J.M. Patel L. Plunket K.D. Shenk J.L. Stimmel J.B. Therapontos C. Wilson T.M. Blanchard S.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6640-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), in both aP2+/+ and aP2−/- macrophages, demonstrating that PPARγ was responsible for the increased reporter activity observed (Fig. 2B). No differences in PPRE reporter activity were seen between aP2+/+ and aP2−/- macrophages transfected with the negative control reporter plasmid, pGST-Luc, or when treated with vehicle alone (data not shown). Treatment with the PPARα agonist WY14643 did not induce reporter activity above background levels in either aP2+/+ or aP2−/- macrophage (data not shown). Activation of PPARγ leads to an increase in scavenger receptor CD36 expression, which mediates internalization of modified LDL particles (11.Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M.

CD36 mRNA expression was dramatically increased in the absence of aP2, consistent with increased uptake of modified LDL particles and PPARγ transcriptional activity in aP2−/- macrophages (Fig. 2C, left panel). Upon stable reconstitution of aP2 in aP2−/- macrophages, the expression of CD36 was reduced to the levels observed in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 2C, right panel). This reduction in CD36 mRNA in the aP2−/-R line is accompanied by a significant decrease in cholesterol influx (Fig. 1C, p < 0.00003), demonstrating that aP2, specifically, plays a regulatory role in"

Here, we report the identification of a small maize protein of 94 amino acids involved in short-range signaling required for pollen tube attraction by the female gametophyte. ZmEA1 is exclusively expressed in the egg apparatus, consisting of the egg cell and two synergids. Chimeric ZmEA1 fused to green fluorescent protein (ZmEA1:GFP) was first visible within the filiform apparatus and later was localized to nucellar cell walls below the micropylar opening of the ovule.

https://openalex.org/W1989602074,"Protein ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome are important mechanisms regulating cell cycle, growth and differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies in cancer therapy suggest that drugs that disrupt the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway induce apoptosis and sensitize malignant cells and tumors to conventional chemotherapy. In this study we addressed the role of phosphorylation of the α-subunit eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2), and its attendant regulation of gene expression, in the cellular stress response to proteasome inhibition. Phosphorylation of eIF2α in mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells subjected to proteasome inhibition leads to a significant reduction in protein synthesis, concomitant with induced expression of the bZIP transcription regulator, ATF4, and its target gene CHOP/GADD153. The primary eIF2α kinase activated by exposure of these fibroblast cells to proteasome inhibition is GCN2 (EIF2AK4), which has a central role in the recognition of cytoplasmic stress signals. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is not effectively induced in MEF cells subjected to proteasome inhibition, with minimal activation of the ER stress sensory proteins, eIF2α kinase PEK (PERK/EIF2AK3), IRE1 protein kinase and the transcription regulator ATF6 following up to 6 h of proteasome inhibitor treatment. Loss of eIF2α phosphorylation thwarts caspase activation and delays apoptosis. Central to this pro-apoptotic function of eIF2α kinases during proteasome inhibition is the transcriptional regulator CHOP, as deletion of CHOP in MEF cells impedes apoptosis.

Precise control of protein turnover is central for the regulation of the cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis. An important mechanism for targeted degradation of regulatory proteins involves covalent linkage of ubiquitin. Ubiquitination of proteins targets their degradation by the 26 S proteasome, a large ATP-dependent protease. Recent advances in cancer therapy suggest that proteasome inhibitors induce apoptosis and sensitize malignant cells and tumors to conventional chemotherapy (1.Voorhees P.M. Dees E.C. O'Neil B.

Clinical trials indicate that proteasome inhibitors may be effective in treatment regimes for both solid and hematological malignancies. We have been interested in the mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells recognize stress signals and regulate programs of gene expression designed to ameliorate cellular damage or induce apoptosis.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3180-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to cellular stress reduces the exchange of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP required to bind and deliver initiatorMet-tRNAiMet to the translation machinery (10.Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The resulting reduction in eIF2 activity lowers global protein synthesis along with induced translation of selected mRNAs. For example, eIF2α phosphorylation enhances the expression of ATF4, a basic zipper transcription activator, via a mechanism involving delayed translation reinitiation at upstream open reading frames located in the 5′-end of the ATF4 mRNA (11.Harding H.P.

Additionally, eIF2α phosphorylation facilitates activation of NF-κB by mechanisms independent of IKK phosphorylation of IκBα (18.Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Scheuner D. Kaufmann R.J.

J. 2005; 385: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). eIF2α kinases work in concert with additional stress-sensing pathways. For example, PEK functions in conjunction with IRE1 and ATF6 to monitor ER stress to elicit a program of gene expression referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (4.Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 21.Kaufman R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 152-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). IRE1 is a type 1 ER transmembrane protein whose protein kinase activity is regulated by a mechanism that shares many features with PEK. Release of the ER chaperone GRP78/BiP from IRE1 leads to autophosphorylation that is thought to contribute to enhanced activity of its C-terminal RNase function that mediates splicing of XBP1 mRNA (22.Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 23.Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The spliced XBP1 mRNA encodes a bZIP transcription activator of a subset of UPR genes required for folding, maturation, and degradation of secretory proteins (25.Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). Activation of the membrane-associated ATF6 also involves dissociation from GRP78, leading to transport of ATF6 from the ER to Golgi (26.Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). ATF6 is then proteolytically cleaved, releasing the transcription factor to be transported into the nucleus where it binds promoters of genes subject to the UPR. Together this collection of bZIP-related transcription factors, ATF4, XBP1, and ATF6, function to coordinate gene expression designed to alleviate ER stress. Given that eIF2α kinases are activated in response to a broad range of stress conditions, many genes linked with the UPR are not necessarily restricted to ER stress. A further source of confusion in the literature is the idea that certain gene products induced by eIF2α kinases can promote survival during cellular stress, whereas others promote cell death. For example, CHOP is linked to enhanced apoptosis and chromosomal translocations involving the structural rearrangement of the CHOP gene are characteristic of myxoid and round cell liposarcomas (27.Crozat A.Y.

Investig. 2002; 109: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the transcriptional regulator NF-κB, which can be activated by eIF2α phosphorylation, has well characterized roles in anti-apoptotic pathways (31.Greten F.R. Karin M. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 32.Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 33.Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). Aberrations in the ER stress response pathway can lead to disease. For example, mutations in PEK/EIF2AK3 lead to Wolcott-Rallison Syndrome (WRS), a autosomal recessive disease associated with neonatal insulin-dependent diabetes, epiphyseal dysplasia, and hepatic and renal complications (34.Delepine M.

Furthermore, expression of poly(Glu) fragments with pathogenic repeat lengths led to aggregates in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells that also activated these ER stress sensors (41.Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). These results were suggested to indicate that impaired proteasome function through pharmacological inhibition, or by accumulation of malfolded protein in the cytoplasm, ultimately block ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The ERAD is important for eviction of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytoplasm and clearance by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Glimcher and co-workers (42.Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Anderson K.C. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9946-99451Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) reported that MG132 treatment of NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells or J558 myeloma cells led to ER stress, as judged by induction of GRP78 and CHOP mRNA, and activation of ER-associated caspase 12. However, the apparent ER stress did not induce XBP1 mRNA splicing by IRE1, leading to the proposal that proteasome inhibitors suppressed certain portions of the UPR despite stress in this secretory organelle. Microarray analyses indicate that treatment of the breast cancer cell line MCF7 with proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin or MG132, induces a collection of genes that includes those subject to eIF2α kinase control (ATF3, CHOP, and asparagine synthase) (43.Zimmermann J. Erdmann D. Lalande I. Grossenbacher R. Noorani N. Furst P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we used mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) deleted for eIF2α kinase genes or containing a homozygous mutation at the eIF2α phosphorylation site (S51A) to study the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in the cellular response to proteasome inhibition. Phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to treatment with MG132 leads to a significant reduction in protein synthesis, concomitant with induced expression of ATF4 and its target gene CHOP. The primary eIF2α kinase activated by exposure of these fibroblast cells to this proteasome inhibitor is GCN2 that recognizes cytoplasmic stress signals. Interestingly, ER stress is not a primary event in MEF cells subjected to proteasome inhibition, with minimal activation of PEK or IRE1 following extended treatments of proteasome inhibitor. Loss of eIF2α phosphorylation thwarts caspase activation and delays apoptosis. We conclude that eIF2α kinases are integral to cellular stress pathways induced by proteasome inhibitors.

PEK-/- PKR-/- MEF cells were obtained from Barbara McGrath and Douglas Cavener (Pennsylvania State University) and were derived from embryos from day 12 to day 14 of gestation from crosses between PEK+/- PKR-/- mice. Genotypes of MEF cells were confirmed by PCR analysis and by immunoblot measurements. MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker), supplemented with 1 mm non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. ER stress in MEF cells was brought about by the addition of 1 μm thapsigargin to the medium followed by incubation for up to 16 h as indicated. Proteasome inhibition was elicited by the addition of 0.1-2 μm MG132 to the medium and incubation for the indicated times. Alternatively, the proteasome inhibitors N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN or MG101) and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone were added to the MEF cells at 25 and 5 μm, respectively, for up to 6 h as indicated. Where specified 20 μm SB203580, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, or 20 μm Z-VAD-FMK, a caspase inhibitor, were added to MEF cells 30 min prior to treatment with 1 μm MG132. MEF cells were subjected to amino acid starvation by culturing cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without leucine (BioWhittaker). Heat shock was elicited by shifting MEF cells from 37 to 42 °C for up to 6 h as indicated. Preparation of Protein Lysates and Immunoblot Analyses—MEF cells were subjected to the indicated stress or no stress and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered solution. Cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm NaF, 17.5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin) and sonication for 30 s. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad protein quantitation kit for detergent lysis according to the manufacturer's directions. For immunoblots, equal amounts of each protein sample were separated in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Low and high range polypeptide markers (Bio-Rad) were used to measure the molecular weight of proteins. Immunoblot analyses were carried out by incubating protein bound filters in TBS-T solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween-20 supplemented with 4% nonfat milk followed by incubation in the same solution with antibody that specifically recognized the indicated protein. ATF3, ATF4, CHOP, HSP70, and GRP78/BiP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, actin monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma, and PEK antibody was previously described (48.Sood R. Porter A.C. Ma K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). ATF3 and ATF4 studies were independently confirmed using ATF4 and ATF3 polyclonal antibody that was prepared from recombinant protein. Immunoblots measuring eIF2α phosphorylation were performed using polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated eIF2α at Ser-51 (Research Genetics or StressGen). Monoclonal antibody that recognizes either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated forms of eIF2α was provided by Dr. Scott Kimball (Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA). Following incubation of the antibody with the filters, the blots were washed three times in TBS-T and the protein-antibody complexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate. Quantitation of visualized bands was carried out by densitometry. Autradiograms shown in the figures are representative of three independent experiments. RNA Isolation and Analyses—Northern analyses were carried out as previously described (49.Schauer S.L. Wang Z. Sonenshein G.E. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 81-86PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from MEF cell treated with 1 μm thapsigargin or 1 μm MG132 for the indicated number of hours using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of total RNA from each sample preparation was separated by electrophoresis using a 1.4% agarose/6% formaldehyde gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining and ultraviolet light. RNA was transferred onto GeneScreen Plus filters (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes specific for the indicated genes, and filters were washed using high stringency conditions and visualized by autoradiography. The probe for CHOP included a 540-bp DNA fragment from the coding region that was provided by Dr. Yanjun Ma (St Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). RT-PCR analysis of XBP1 mRNA splicing by IRE1 was carried out as previously described (50.Iakova P. Wang G.-L. Timchenko L. Michalak M. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Timchenko N.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling Assays—Measurements of translation inhibition in response to treatment with MG132 were carried out as previously described (11.Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Briefly, S/S and A/A MEF cells were grown to 50% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in trans-labeling medium without methionine or cysteine supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Non-stressed MEF cells were then labeled with [35S]Met/Cys express labeling mixture (ICN) for 30 min and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing non-radiolabeled methionine and cysteine. To elicit proteasome inhibition, 1 μm MG132 was added to the cells cultured in trans-labeling medium for between 0.5 and 6 h. Prior to harvesting and lysate preparation, cells were then labeled with [35S]Met/Cys express labeling mixture for 30 min. Equal amounts of total protein from each lysate preparation were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. In parallel, each cell lysate was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The insoluble pellet was measured by scintillation counting to determine the incorporation of [35S]Met/Cys into proteins. Luciferase Assays—To measure ATF6 transcriptional activity, NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells were transiently transfected with ATF6-directed luciferase reporter plasmid provided by Jinshi Shen and Ron Prywes (Columbia University, New York) (51.Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following 40 h of transfection, cells were treated with 1 μm MG132 or 1 μm thapsigargin for up to 8 h or to no stress (0). Transfected cells were analyzed in triplicate with the plasmid that encodes multiple ATF6 elements embedded in a promoter directing firefly luciferase (51.Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a control NIH 3T3 cells were also co-transfected with the reporter plasmid and pCGNATF6, which expresses full-length ATF6 (residues 1-670) or pCGNATF6-(1-373) encoding the cleaved and activated version of ATF6 to confirm the ATF6 dependence for expression of the luciferase reporter as described (51.Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Co-transfections were carried out using ATF6-luciferase reporter plasmid and a Renilla luciferase plasmid serving as an internal control (Promega). Light units of both luciferase activities were assayed for 10 s. Luciferase activity was measured as relative light units (RLU) (Monolight Luminometer model 2010). All of the data were presented as the mean relative luciferase activity as calculated by RLU for the ATF6-directed luciferase divided by the RLU for the internal control construct. Luciferase activity was then normalized to that activity determined for NIH 3T3 cells that were not subjected to stress treatment. Three independent experiments were carried out, and the error bars indicate the S.D. for each relative luciferase activity. ATF4 translation expression was analyzed by using a luciferase reporter containing the 5′-portion of the ATF4 mRNA inserted downstream of a TK promoter that was previously described (12.Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). The ATF4-luciferase reporter was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells and luciferase activity measured as described above. Apoptotic Assays—S/S and A/A MEF cells were exposed to 1 μm MG132 for up to 16 h, and the apoptosis was measured by Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioVision) following the manufacturer's instructions. As indicated, 20 μm SB203580 or 20 μm Z-VAD-FMK were added to MEF cells 30 min prior to treatment with 1 μm MG132. S/S and A/A MEF cells were also incubated with MG132 for 8 h, and then 10 μg/ml cycloheximide were added and the cells were cultured for an additional 8 h. To address the role of CHOP in mediating apoptosis in response to proteasome inhibition, CHOP+/+ and -/- MEF cells were treated with 1 μm MG132 or 1 μm thapsigargin for up to 16 h. Average values and S.D. were derived from three independent experiments. Activation of caspases 3 and 9 was measured by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies specific to each caspase. Proteasome Inhibition Induces eIF2α Phosphorylation—Proteasome inhibition elicits expression of stress-related genes and is linked with activation of the ER stress response (41.Nishitoh H.

We wished to address whether eIF2α phosphorylation facilitates this program of stress gene expression in response to proteasome dysfunction. The well characterized proteasome inhibitor, MG132, was added to MEF cells containing a wildtype version"
https://openalex.org/W2021430529,"Metal membranes play a vital role in hydrogen purification. Defect-free membranes can exhibit effectively infinite selectivity but must also provide high fluxes, resistance to poisoning, long operational lifetimes, and low cost. Alloying offers one route to improve on membranes based on pure metals such as palladium. We show how ab initio calculations and coarse-grained modeling can accurately predict hydrogen fluxes through binary alloy membranes as functions of alloy composition, temperature, and pressure. Our approach, which requires no experimental input apart from knowledge of bulk crystal structures, is demonstrated for palladium-copper alloys, which show nontrivial behavior due to the existence of face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic crystal structures and have the potential to resist sulfur poisoning. The accuracy of our approach is examined by a comparison with extensive experiments using thick foils at elevated temperatures. Our experiments also demonstrate the ability of these membranes to resist poisoning by hydrogen sulfide."
https://openalex.org/W2075470567,"Lupus, a multigenic autoimmune condition in which a breakdown of tolerance results in the development of autoantibodies, leads to a variety of pathologic outcomes. Despite the heterogeneity of factors influencing disease susceptibility, we demonstrate that the partial restoration of inhibitory Fc receptor (FcgRIIB) levels on B cells in lupus-prone mouse strains is sufficient to restore tolerance and prevent autoimmunity. FcgRIIB regulates a common B cell checkpoint in genetically diverse lupus-prone mouse strains, and modest changes in its expression can result in either tolerance or autoimmunity. Therefore, increasing FcgammaRIIB levels on B cells may be an effective way to treat autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2040190285,"Neuronal gene transcription is repressed in non-neuronal cells by the repressor element 1 (RE-1)–silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) complex. To understand how this silencing is achieved, we examined a family of class-C RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatases [small CTD phosphatases (SCPs) 1 to 3], whose expression is restricted to non-neuronal tissues. We show that REST/NRSF recruits SCPs to neuronal genes that contain RE-1 elements, leading to neuronal gene silencing in non-neuronal cells. Phosphatase-inactive forms of SCP interfere with REST/NRSF function and promote neuronal differentiation of P19 stem cells. Likewise, small interfering RNA directed to the single Drosophila SCP unmasks neuronal gene expression in S2 cells. Thus, SCP activity is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulator that acts globally to silence neuronal genes."

https://openalex.org/W2027461959,"The effect of adsorption onto aluminum salt adjuvants on the structure and stability of three model protein antigens was studied using fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies, as well as isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetric techniques.

Besides the pharmaceutical significance of this destabilization, we consider the possibility that this phenomenon may facilitate the presentation of antigens and thus contribute to the adjuvant activity of the aluminum salts. The interaction of proteins with surfaces is a widely recognized phenomenon of both physiological and technological significance. A particularly important example is the binding of protein antigens to aluminum salt adjuvants. Without the use of such adjuvants, proteins are usually only weakly immunogenic. The aluminum salts are currently the only such agents generally approved for use in vaccines for humans (1.Vogel F.R. Powell M.F. Pharm. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 141-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Despite this widespread use, their mechanism of action is still poorly understood. Among a variety of nonmutually exclusive proposed mechanisms, roles as depots for antigen induction of inflammatory responses and delivery of antigen into antigenpresenting cells are commonly proposed, with some evidence for each (2.Lindblad E.B. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 3.Gupta R.K. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1998; 32: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The two most common aluminum salts employed as adjuvants are the phosphate and hydroxide forms. The salts themselves have been well characterized with aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel®) usually found in a crystalline state (4.Johnston C.T. Wang S.L. Hem S.L. J. Pharm. Sci. 2002; 91: 1702-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5.Shirodkar S. Hutchinson R.L. Perry D.L. White J.L. Hem S.L. Pharm. Res. 1990; 7: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas aluminum phosphate exists in an amorphous form (5.Shirodkar S. Hutchinson R.L. Perry D.L. White J.L. Hem S.L. Pharm. Res. 1990; 7: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6.Burrell L.S. Johnston C.T. Schulze D. Klein J. White J.L. Hem S.L. Vaccine. 2000; 19: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The points of zero charge (analogous to the isoelectric point of a macromolecule) are 4.0–5.5 and ∼11 for the phosphate and hydroxide salts, respectively. In general, proteins seem to better adsorb to the oppositely charged salts through simple electrostatic effects (7.Seeber S.J. White J.L. Hem S.L. Vaccine. 1991; 9: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), although apolar and ion displacement interactions may play a role as well (8.Iyer S. Robinett R.S. HogenEsch H. Hem S.L. Vaccine. 2004; 22: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). What happens to the structure and stability of proteins when they are adsorbed onto the surface of the two commonly employed aluminum salts has not been well characterized. When proteins are adsorbed to solid surfaces, highly polar (including charged) interfaces tend to minimally perturb protein structure and stability, although exceptions are known. In contrast, more apolar surfaces often significantly alter the structure and stability of many proteins (9.Steadman B.L. Thompson K.C. Middaugh C.R. Matsuno K. Vrona S. Lawson E.Q. Lewis R.V. Biotechnology and Bioengineering. 1992; 40: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10.Matsuno K. Lewis R.V. Middaugh C.R. Arch. Biochem.

Immunol. 1991; 28: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The effect of the aluminum salts on protein structure and stability is important from several perspectives. For example, to the extent that epitopes are conformational in nature, their retention (or alteration) may be critical for vaccine immunogenicity. The stability of protein antigens is equally important when they are stored for long periods prior to their use. The latter strongly impacts the utility of vaccines for use in the developing world, where shipping under cold conditions can be problematic (13.Brandau D.T. Jones L.S. Wiethoff C.M. Rexroad J. Middaugh C.R. J. Pharm. Sci. 2003; 92: 218-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and in the use of vaccines against potential bioterrorism agents, where storage for long periods in centralized locations may be critical for their effectiveness (14.Fauci A.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 32: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study we have examined the effect of aluminum salts on the structure and stability of three proteins chosen to serve as models of typical protein antigens. Their interaction with both salts was tested and binding isotherms constructed for the better binding surface. The thermodynamics of this interaction were then characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Potential changes in structure of the three proteins were probed by front face fluorescence (to examine tertiary structure) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (to probe potential changes in secondary structure). Their thermal stability was then compared on and off the surface using the same two detection methods. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed for the same purpose. The surprising finding was that the interactions of the proteins with the highly charged aluminum salts generally destabilized the proteins. The practical implications of these results are here discussed, and a potential significance for the mechanism of adjuvant action is briefly considered. Materials—Proteins (lysozyme, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ATR, attenuated total reflectance. ), MOPS, and MOPS sodium salt were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Alhydrogel®, 2%) and aluminum phosphate adjuvant (Adju-Phos®) were purchased from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation (Westbury, NY). Dialysis cassettes (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) were obtained from Pierce. Distilled de-ionized water was used to prepare the buffer. Preparation of Protein Stock Solutions—Protein stock solutions were prepared in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) buffer. Their concentrations were determined using published extinction coefficients and A280 measurements. Binding Isotherms—Protein working solutions in multiple concentrations were prepared at a concentration twice that of the desired final protein concentration. A stock adjuvant solution was prepared by combining the standard aluminum salt suspension with an appropriate volume of 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) buffer, such that the final calculated aluminum concentration was 3.4 mg/ml. The calculation of aluminum concentration was done using data provided by the supplier in the lot specification sheet. Equal volumes of the protein working solution and the adjuvant working solution were combined in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Based on preliminary binding studies, Alhydrogel® was used with BSA and ovalbumin solutions, whereas Adju-Phos® was added to lysozyme solutions. The suspensions were mixed gently by end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 15–30 min. (A preliminary study of the kinetics of adsorption indicated that protein adsorption was complete within this time period.) The samples were then centrifuged at a force of 14,000 × g for 2–5 min. The supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The amount of protein bound was determined by subtracting the amount of protein remaining in solution from the amount introduced initially. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC studies were conducted by titrating protein solutions or buffer into a sample cell containing the adjuvant. Titrations were performed in triplicate using a CSC model 4200 isothermal titration calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corporation, American Fork, Utah). All protein solutions were dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) buffer, and the dialysis buffer was used in the preparation of the adjuvant solutions. The adjuvant stock suspensions were diluted with dialysate buffer to yield the desired aluminum concentration. For lysozyme titrated into Adju-Phos®, two lysozyme solutions were necessary, the concentrations of which were 13 and 10 mg/ml. The corresponding Adju-Phos® concentrations were 1.0 and 0.4 mg of aluminum/ml, respectively. The titration of BSA into Alhydrogel® employed 19 mg/ml BSA and 1 mg of aluminum/ml of Alhydrogel®. Ovalbumin at 13 mg/ml was titrated into 1.8 mg of aluminum/ml of Alhydrogel®. All titrations were conducted at 25 °C. A 10-μl injection volume was employed and the sample equilibrated for 300 s between injections. The adjuvant suspension in the sample cell was stirred at a constant speed of 300 revolutions/min while the sample reached thermal equilibrium prior to titration and during titration of the protein or buffer. The ITC data were analyzed using BindWorks™ software (Calorimetry Sciences Corporation). Prior to fitting the data to appropriate binding isotherms, heats of dilution were subtracted from all protein titration data. For BSA and ovalbumin, the average heat of the buffer titration was subtracted from all heats observed during titration of the protein. The heat of the final injection of lysozyme into Adju-Phos® was used to correct the lysozyme data for dilution heat contributions. The data for each protein/adjuvant system was fit to a model of multiple independent binding sites. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the thermal transition temperatures (Tm) of each protein in solution and adsorbed onto an aluminum salt adjuvant. A high throughput capillary differential scanning calorimeter (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, MA) was used for the measurements. Samples containing protein completely adsorbed onto the surface of the adjuvant were prepared as described above for the protein adsorption study. DSC experiments were performed using lysozyme, ovalbumin, and BSA in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) buffer at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.0 mg/ml protein, respectively. For DSC studies in the presence of adjuvant, 1 mg of aluminum/ml Adju-Phos® and 4 mg of aluminum/ml Alhydrogel® were employed. It was necessary to increase the BSA concentration to 2 mg/ml for DSC investigations of the adsorbed protein, whereas 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and 1.0 mg/ml ovalbumin were sufficient. Samples and reference buffer solutions were loaded in triplicate into a 96-well plate, which was thermostated at 10 °C. An autosampler equipped with a 2.5-ml Hamilton GASTIGHT® syringe was utilized to load the DSC cells and clean the cells between experiments. Samples were mixed by loading and expelling the syringe three times to ensure that the suspensions were well dispersed. A scan rate of 90 °C/hour was used to scan from 10 °C to 90 °C for lysozyme and 10 °C to 100 °C for BSA and ovalbumin. Buffer and adjuvant samples were examined separately to evaluate the independent behavior of each. DSC data were analyzed using Origin version 7.0 software (Origin-Lab Corporation, Northampton, MA). The thermogram for buffer alone was subtracted from the thermograms of the proteins in solution prior to further processing. Similarly, the thermogram of the appropriate adjuvant alone was subtracted from the thermograms of the adsorbed proteins. Lysozyme thermograms were analyzed using a single peak, two-state model. For BSA and ovalbumin, both in solution and in the case of ovalbumin adsorbed to Alhydrogel®, transition temperatures were determined by fitting the data to a two-state model using two peaks. A six-peak model provided the best fit for BSA adsorbed to Alhydrogel®. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectroscopy employing front face sampling geometry was used to probe changes in the tertiary structure of the protein as a function of temperature for each protein in solution, as well as adsorbed to an adjuvant. This geometry was necessary because of the opacity of the adjuvant suspensions. For this purpose, right angle triangular cuvettes were used. Samples of protein adsorbed onto the adjuvant were prepared as described previously for binding isotherms. For all studies, a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml was used. For samples containing adjuvant, the aluminum concentration was 1.7 mg/ml. Samples containing adjuvant were allowed to settle in the cuvettes for ∼16 h at 4 °C to minimize variability due to settling of the adjuvant during the course of the experiment. An excitation wavelength of 280 nm was employed, and emission spectra were recorded from 290 to 400 nm using a QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer equipped with a Peltier thermostated cuvette holder (Photon Technologies International, Lawrenceville, NJ). Data were collected every 1 nm at a scanning rate of 1 nm/s. Full spectra were obtained every 2.5 °C from 10 to 90 °C with 300 s of thermal equilibration at each temperature. The data were processed using Origin version 7.0 software. Initially, an 11-point Savitsky-Golay smoothing function was applied to all spectra. The peak positions were then determined using first derivative analysis. FTIR Spectroscopy—The secondary structure of the proteins in solution and adsorbed onto the surface of the adjuvants was assessed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Samples containing an adjuvant were prepared as described previously for protein adsorption studies. The concentrations of lysozyme, ovalbumin, and BSA in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) buffer employed in solution studies were 17.7, 20.5 and 24.0 mg/ml, respectively. For lysozyme adsorbed to Adju-Phos®, the protein and aluminum concentrations were 2 and 4 mg/ml, respectively. The concentrations of BSA and ovalbumin adsorbed to Alhydrogel® (4 mg/ml aluminum) were 5.8 and 4.4 mg/ml, respectively. The amount of protein adsorbed to the adjuvant was determined by measuring A280 of the supernatant following centrifugation. The supernatant was then removed and discarded. The remaining slurry was smeared uniformly onto a ZnSe attenuated total reflectance (ATR) crystal. An ATR cell using a 45° ZnSe trough plate with volatile liquid cover was employed. Data were collected using 256 scans with a resolution of 4 cm–1 with a Nicolet Magna 560 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an MCT/A detector. A thermal ARK™ temperature controller (Spectra-Tech, Inc., Shelton, CT) was used to vary the temperature every 5 °C from 25 to 75 °C. The samples were equilibrated for 7 min at each temperature. In addition to the samples containing protein, thermal melt spectra were acquired for 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) buffer and adjuvant alone. For spectra of proteins in solution, buffer spectra at each temperature were subtracted using Omnic® version 4.1A software (Nicolet, Madison, WI). In the case of samples containing an adjuvant, spectra of the adjuvant alone at each temperature were subtracted from the spectra of protein adsorbed to the adjuvant. The subtracted data were then base-line corrected and zeroed between 1800 and 2400 cm–1. A Savitsky-Golay smoothing function was applied to each spectrum using 7–13 points, depending on the quality of the data. Smoothed data were copied into Excel, and the ratio of absorbances at two frequencies (see “Results” below) was calculated. Thermodynamics of Protein Adsorption—The amount of each protein that can be adsorbed to selected aluminum salt adjuvants was determined by constructing adsorption isotherms (Fig. 1). In 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) buffer, all proteins adsorbed to the predicted aluminum salt adjuvant (based on the pI of the protein and the points of zero charge of the adjuvant). Lysozyme (pI ∼ 11.0) adsorbed to Adju-Phos®, whereas BSA (pI ∼ 4.9) and ovalbumin (pI ∼ 4.6) adsorbed onto Alhydrogel®. There was no significant adsorption of lysozyme onto Alhydrogel® nor ovalbumin and BSA onto Adju-Phos® under the same conditions (data not shown). The adsorption data were analyzed by linearizing the adsorption isotherms as described previously (Table I) (7.Seeber S.J. White J.L. Hem S.L. Vaccine. 1991; 9: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15.Jendrek S. Little S.F. Hem S. Mitra G. Giardina S. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 3011-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The adsorptive capacity is a measure of the maximum mass of protein adsorbed/mass of aluminum. The adsorptive coefficient describes the strength of the interaction. The adsorptive capacity and adsorptive coefficient of the lysozyme/Adju-Phos® complex was the smallest at 1.4 mg of lysozyme/mg of aluminum and 0.47 ml/mg, respectively. At the other extreme was BSA/Alhydrogel®, having an adsorptive capacity of 2.2 mg of BSA/mg of aluminum and an adsorptive coefficient of 3.1 ml/mg. The adsorptive capacity and coefficient of the ovalbumin/Alhydrogel® system were 1.6 mg/mg and 1.6 ml/mg, respectively. The experimental values for the adsorptive capacities agree well with previously published adsorptive capacities for the same protein/adjuvant combinations in water (7.Seeber S.J. White J.L. Hem S.L. Vaccine. 1991; 9: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16.Iyer S. HogenEsch H. Hem S.L. Pharm. Dev. Technol. 2003; 8: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The experimental adsorptive coefficients were lower than those previously published (7.Seeber S.J. White J.L. Hem S.L. Vaccine. 1991; 9: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16.Iyer S. HogenEsch H. Hem S.L. Pharm. Dev. Technol. 2003; 8: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Iyer et al. (16.Iyer S. HogenEsch H. Hem S.L. Pharm. Dev. Technol. 2003; 8: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), however, have reported variations over several orders of magnitude for adsorptive coefficients for the same combinations of protein and adjuvant.Table ILinearized Langmuir adsorption isotherm analysisProtein (pI)AdjuvantAdsmaxKAdsmg protein/mg aluminumml/mgLysozyme (11.0)Adju-Phos®1.4 ± 0.10.47 ± 0.03Ovalbumin (4.6)Alhydrogel®1.6 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.3BSA (4.9)Alhydrogel®2.2 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab The interactions between the proteins and aluminum salts were also characterized by ITC (Table II). The binding stoichiometry determinations were roughly similar to the adsorptive capacities calculated from the linearized adsorption isotherms.

The interaction between BSA and Alhydrogel® was entropically driven, although being enthalpically unfavorable. The opposite was observed for the binding between ovalbumin and Alhydrogel®. For the lysozyme/Adju-Phos® system, both enthalpy and entropy contributed favorably to the interaction. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC was used to investigate the effect of adsorption on the thermal stability of the proteins. Differences in Tm values and thermograms were observed when the proteins were adsorbed onto the adjuvant in comparison to the protein alone in solution under the same conditions (Table III and Fig. 2). The Tm of lysozyme was decreased by >10 °C (i.e. from ∼73 to ∼59 °C) when the protein was adsorbed onto the surface of Adju-Phos®. In both situations, however, there was only a single transition observed (Fig. 2, A.i. and A.ii.). Although the Tm values for ovalbumin in solution and adsorbed to Alhydrogel® were essentially identical, the transition profile was significantly altered (Table III and Fig. 2, B.i. and B.ii.). The thermograms of both ovalbumin samples were best modeled by two component transitions centered at ∼70 and 78 °C. In the absence of the adjuvant, the 78 °C peak was clearly dominant (Fig. 2B.i.). When the protein was adsorbed onto Alhydrogel®, however, there was a larger contribution from the lower peak (Tm ∼ 70 °C) (Fig. 2B.ii.). The thermodynamic stability of BSA was the most profoundly perturbed by adsorption to an adjuvant (Table III and Fig. 2, C.i. and C.ii.). Unbound BSA had a major transition centered at 78 °C (Fig. 2C.i.). When the protein was adsorbed onto Alhydrogel®, there were multiple transitions present underlying a large, broad peak spanning from ∼22 to beyond 85 °C (Fig. 2C.ii.).Table IIIAverage calorimetric Tm values of the model protein antigens in solution and adsorbed onto aluminum salt adjuvants (n = 3)ProteinAdjuvantTm (average ± S.D.)°CLysozymeNone72.5 ± 0.2Adju-Phos®59.0 ± 0.9OvalbuminNone71.0 ± 0.478.1 ± 0.1Alhydrogel®69.7 ± 0.177.7 ± 0.2BSANone71.4 ± 1.177.7 ± 0.3Alhydrogel®32.9 ± 2.949.1 ± 1.465.4 ± 0.279.0 ± 0.686.3 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Tertiary Structure Stability—Front surface fluorescence spectroscopy was used to assess changes in the tertiary structure of the model protein antigens adsorbed to the aluminum salts. At 10 °C, the position of the emission maximum for lysozyme in solution was at 337.5 nm, indicating that, on average, the tryptophan residues were substantially buried (Fig. 3A.i.). When the protein was adsorbed onto the surface of Adju-Phos® at 10 °C, there was a very small blue shift in the emission maximum. As the temperature was increased, the peak position of the protein in solution remained essentially unchanged up to 65 °C, at which point the peak was significantly red-shifted. In contrast, the fluorescence emission peak position of the adsorbed lysozyme gradually increased from 10 to 50 °C, at which point there was a significant increase in the slope of the change. Overall, the data suggest that the tertiary structure of lysozyme is perturbed upon adsorption to Adju-Phos®, which results in a major decrease in the thermal stability of the protein. These changes were much less evident in the intensity changes of the emission peak (Fig. 3A.ii.). Similar to lysozyme, the tryptophan residues of ovalbumin also existed in a relatively apolar environment when the protein was in solution (emission maximum at 332 nm) (Fig. 3B.i.). When ovalbumin was adsorbed onto the surface of Alhydrogel®, there was, again, a slight blue shift in the fluorescence emission peak position at 10 °C (to 331 nm). In the presence of the adjuvant, the emission peak position remained essentially unchanged between 10 and 90 °C. This would seem to imply that the tertiary structure of ovalbumin is stabilized on the surface of the adjuvant. When the fluorescence intensities at 332 and 331 nm of ovalbumin in the absence and presence of the adjuvant, are compared however as a function of temperature, the opposite conclusion is suggested (Fig. 3B.ii.). The change in slope at ∼75 °C seen for the protein in solution coincided with the transition observed in the emission peak position curve. In contrast, there was a sharp decrease in fluorescence intensity observed at 25 °C for the adsorbed ovalbumin. Thus, surface binding seems to permit a thermally induced event in the bound protein not seen in the protein in solution. BSA in solution possessed an emission maximum at ∼338 nm at 10 °C (Fig. 3C.i.). When BSA was adsorbed onto Alhydrogel®, this peak was blue-shifted to 327 nm and remained at this position from 10–90 °C. With increasing temperature, the fluorescence emission peak of BSA in solution exhibited a blue-shifted transition region above 35 °C. The emission peak of this protein in the post-transition region was near 327 nm, the same position seen for adsorbed BSA at all temperatures. This suggests that the post-transition state of BSA in solution may be similar to the conformational state of the protein adsorbed to Alhydrogel®. Abolition of a transition in the adsorbed protein is seen in the plots of fluorescence intensity versus temperature as well (Fig. 3C.ii.). Secondary Structure Stability—ATR-FTIR was employed to monitor changes in the secondary structure of the model proteins in solution and adsorbed to aluminum salt adjuvants as a function of temperature. Potential alterations to the secondary structure of the protein were monitored in the amide I region (1600–1700 cm–1) of the FTIR spectra. For lysozyme in solution, a shoulder began to appear at ∼1624 cm–1 as the temperature was increased (Fig. 4A). This suggests increased β-sheet structure (relative to α-helix) forming with increasing temperature. When adsorbed to Adju-Phos® (Fig. 4B), the spectrum of lysozyme was significantly altered compared with the solution spectrum. The 1653 cm–1 (α-helix) peak present in the spectra of lysozyme in solution appears to have shifted to ∼1640 cm–1, suggesting an increase in β-sheet structure at the expense of the α-helix upon adsorption. As the temperature increased, a sharper peak began to emerge at ∼1640 cm–1 for the adsorbed protein. At 65 °C, a second peak appeared at ∼1620 cm–1, suggesting the presence of an intermolecular β-sheet due to aggregation. At higher temperatures, this peak dominated the 1640 cm–1 signal. This was the same position at which the shoulder gradually emerges for lysozyme in solution. A plot of the ratio of absorbances at 1620 and 1640 cm–1 as a function of temperature revealed a significant transition for lysozyme adsorbed to Adju-Phos® between 60 and 70 °C (Fig. 4C). For lysozyme in solution, a much more subtle transition occurred over the same range. This approach was found to be superior to deconvolution or the use of derivatives in displaying differences as a function of temperature. The shape of the spectrum of BSA adsorbed to Alhydrogel® (Fig. 5B) was also distinguishable from that of the protein in solution (Fig. 5A). Based on the ratio of the absorbances at 1624 and 1647 cm–1, BSA appears to be less ordered when adsorbed to the adjuvant (Fig. 5C). As the temperature was increased above ∼35 °C, the secondary structure of BSA adsorbed to Alhydrogel® gradually changed, gaining β-sheet content. Major changes in the spectrum of the protein in solution were only seen at higher temperatures (Fig. 5A). Above 70 °C, a shoulder at ∼1624 cm–1 emerged. Based on a plot of the ratio of absorbances versus temperature, actual secondary structure changes of BSA in solution began at ∼65 °C. This result suggests a greater percentage of β-sheet at higher temperatures. The results for ovalbumin were similar to those for BSA, with the spectrum of the adsorbed protein different from that in solution (Fig. 6, A and B). As the temperature increased above 25 °C, the secondary structure of adsorbed ovalbumin gradually changed toward a more α-helical character, with a corresponding loss in β-sheet (Fig. 6, B and C). A change in secondary structure was not observed until ∼75 °C for the protein in solution (Fig. 6, A and C). The change in secondary structure observed at this temperature suggests an increase in β-sheet. As seen for BSA, the data for ovalbumin suggest that the protein becomes conformationally altered when adsorbed to the adjuvant, causing it to become less thermally stable. Although aluminum salts are the most commonly used adjuvants in vaccines, what happens to the antigens when adsorbed to their surfaces has never been fully characterized. An understanding of how adsorption to these salts affects the structure and stability of proteins is essential to their use as vaccines as well as the mechanism of adjuvant-mediated immune stimulation. The adjuvant to which each protein preferentially adsorbed in this study was in agreement with the prediction that the protein with the highest pI (lysozyme) would best adsorb to the salt having the lowest points of zero charge (Adju-Phos®), and vice versa. Although the two acidic proteins have a greater binding affinity for Alhydrogel® than does lysozyme for Adju-Phos®, it appears that ∼1–2 mg of protein can be adsorbed per mg of aluminum, regardless of the protein or adjuvant. This suggests that, although both adjuvants have a similar number of binding sites, there may be more than one mechanism of binding. A calorimetric analysis revealed distinct binding characteristics for each protein-adjuvant system. The interaction between BSA and Alhydrogel® was entropically driven and enthalpically unfavorable. The favorable entropy term suggests a release of water and counter-ions from the surface of the protein and adjuvant upon adsorption, consistent with either electrostatic or apolar interactions (or both) being involved in the binding process. Surprisingly, adsorption of ovalbumin onto Alhydrogel® was enthalpically driven and entropically unfavorable. The simplest interpretation for these results is that protein conformational effects are dominating the characteristic thermodynamic changes produced by the direct electrostatic effects. Lysozyme adsorption onto Adju-Phos® is both enthalpically and entropically favorable, arguing for a variety of contributions to the thermodynamics of the binding process. DSC demonstrated that proteins adsorbed to the surface of aluminum salts have significantly reduced thermal stabilities compared with the proteins in solution. These changes were determined to be irreversible in all cases. The extent to which the proteins were destabilized on the surface varied among the proteins, with the least affected being ovalbumin and the most BSA. To better understand the nature of this destabilization, we used intrinsic Trp fluorescence and ATR-FTIR spectroscopies to see whether the DSC changes reflected alterations in tertiary and secondary structures, respectively. Both methods suggest that extensive perturbation of the structure of the protein was occurring upon interaction with the surfaces of the insoluble salts. The stability of BSA was most affected by adsorption onto an aluminum salt adjuvant. Although the thermogram for BSA in solution can be fit to two components, at least five are necessary to describe the thermogram of the adsorbed protein, with the transitions beginning just above 30 °C. This result combined with the changes in the FTIR spectra at lower temperatures suggests that the relatively invariant fluorescence emission peak position was not due to the adoption of a stable conformation. One possible explanation is that BSA adsorbs onto the adjuvant in such a way that the tryptophan residues remained inaccessible to the solvent throughout the temperature range investigated. A second possible explanation is that BSA microaggregates, resulting in shielding of the Trp of the protein. Both explanations are plausible given that: 1) BSA is a hydrophobic protein, 2) it is subject to self-association (17.Bulone D. Martorana V. San Biagio P.L. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 91: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), 3) the observed blue shift of the protein in solution at intermediate temperatures is consistent with aggregation, and 4) the ITC data are consistent with a role for apolar interactions. The stability of ovalbumin was the least affected by adsorption. Although the Tm values (as determined by DSC) of the protein, both in solution and adsorbed, were essentially identical, FTIR data indicated very different thermal stabilities. Additionally, fluorescence intensity data suggest that adsorption causes the protein to undergo a conformational change at ∼25 °C (Fig. 3B.ii.). Fluorescence peak position data indicate that the change does not result in a dramatic change in the environment of the tryptophan residues of ovalbumin (Fig. 3B.i.). These changes may be the result of a small conformational change of sufficient magnitude to account for an increase in population of the state with the lower Tm when ovalbumin was adsorbed relative to the unbound protein. Significant differences were observed in the stability of lysozyme in solution and adsorbed to Adju-Phos®. FTIR spectra clearly show major structural alterations occurring at temperatures above 65 °C for the protein on the surface (Fig. 4, B and C). The changes in secondary structure were much more subtle for the protein in solution. The presence of the band at 1620 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum of lysozyme adsorbed to Adju-Phos suggests that lysozyme may be aggregating at higher temperatures. A brief study was conducted to determine whether the aggregation of lysozyme was occurring on the surface of the adjuvant, or whether the protein was being desorbed at elevated temperatures followed by aggregation in solution. The study determined that no protein was desorbed from the adjuvant at higher temperatures; therefore, the aggregation must be occurring on the surface. This was also supported by the lack of a 1620 cm–1 band in the FTIR spectrum of lysozyme in solution. Although it seems counterintuitive that the adsorbed protein would tend to aggregate while the protein in solution does not, the structural change that occurred when the protein is adsorbed to the aluminum salt may, in fact, make the protein more susceptible to aggregation. The extent of destabilization of these three proteins on these apparently highly polar surfaces is somewhat surprising (9.Steadman B.L. Thompson K.C. Middaugh C.R. Matsuno K. Vrona S. Lawson E.Q. Lewis R.V. Biotechnology and Bioengineering. 1992; 40: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10.Matsuno K. Lewis R.V. Middaugh C.R. Arch. Biochem.

Immunol. 1991; 28: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). One possibility is that, in optimizing interaction of the polar surface of the protein with that of the adjuvant, structural alterations and subsequent destabilization are induced. Another possibility is that the surface of the aluminum salts is actually somewhat apolar because of charge neutralization by counter-ion binding. Both explanations are consistent with the variable thermodynamics and the complex conformational equilibria observed. A third possibility is that the behavior seen reflects changes in the dynamic behavior of the adsorbed proteins. It seems reasonable to postulate that the distribution of native states is significantly perturbed upon surface localization with certain micro-states trapped by surface contact. The latter possibility is under active investigation in our laboratory. Because stability is necessary for pharmaceuticals, the destabilization observed for protein antigens on the surface of aluminum salt adjuvants raises potential concerns regarding vaccine stability. For example, the structural alteration that occurs when the protein adsorbs to the adjuvant could make the protein more susceptible to chemical alterations such as deamidation and oxidation. In addition, the modified structure may enhance aggregation of the antigen on the surface of the adjuvant, as described above. Therefore, it becomes critical that the long term stability of the antigen be evaluated, not only in solution, but on the surface of the adjuvant as well. An interesting possibility for how this phenomenon may have a positive implication on the vaccine is that the reduced stability of the surface-bound proteins in some way contributes to their enhanced antigenicity. The mechanism by which aluminum salt adjuvants promote a better immune response is not well established. At least three mechanisms are commonly considered (2.Lindblad E.B. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 3.Gupta R.K. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1998; 32: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). One idea is that the formation of a depot at the site of injection allows the antigen to be gradually released, thereby extending the time possible for the antigen to interact with antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. A second proposed mechanism is attributed to the particulate nature of the aluminum salt. Because particles smaller than 10 μm are more easily phagocytosed by macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (18.Gupta R.K. Rost B.E. Relyveld E. Siber G.R. Powell M.F. Newman M.J. Vaccine Design: the Subunit and Adjuvant Approach. Plenum Press, New York1995: 229-248Google Scholar), uptake of the antigen adsorbed to an adjuvant should be increased (relative to antigen in solution), thereby improving the efficiency of antigen presentation. The third suggested mechanism of action is by a direct stimulation of the immune system through enhanced cytokine production. Aluminum salt adjuvants are known to primarily stimulate a humoral response. More specifically, it is believed that this class of adjuvants does so by stimulation of the production of Th2 cytokines. This current work suggests a fourth possibility. Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between protein antigen stability and proteolytic susceptibility. Thai et al. (19.Thai R. Moine G. Desmadril M. Servent D. Tarride J.L. Menez A. Leonetti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50257-50266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) employed cathepsin L and Pronase E to show that, in a series of homologous antigens, the least stable was the most easily degraded and the most antigenic. Enzyme inhibitors eliminated this effect, confirming the relationship between stability and proteolytic susceptibility. Ametani et al. (20.Ametani A. Sakurai T. Katakura Y. Kuhara S. Hirakawa H. Hosoi T. Dosako S. Kaminogawa S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2003; 67: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the less stable variant of β-lactoglobulin was more antigenic. Similarly, the antigenicity of hen egg white lysozyme was found to increase as the stability of the derivatives decreased (21.So T. Ito H.O. Koga T. Watanabe S. Ueda T. Imoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32136-32140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results in all cases suggest that antigen presentation efficiency is inversely related to antigen stability. Thus, an alternative hypothesis for the mechanism of immune stimulation by aluminum salt adjuvants is suggested by this work. The data presented herein demonstrate that protein structure often becomes destabilized upon adsorption to the surface of certain aluminum salts. These physical changes in adsorbed proteins may make them more susceptible to proteolytic processing by the immune system, resulting in enhanced antigen presentation."

Their action is dependent upon activation by bacterial nitroreductase flavoproteins, including the Escherichia coli nitroreductase (NTR). Here we show that the products of reduction of these antibiotics by NTR are the hydroxylamine derivatives. We show that the reduction of nitrosoaromatics is enzyme-catalyzed, with a specificity constant ∼10,000-fold greater than that of the starting nitro compounds. This suggests that the reduction of nitro groups proceeds through two successive, enzyme-mediated reactions and explains why the nitroso intermediates are not observed. The global reaction rate for nitrofurazone determined in this study is over 10-fold higher than that previously reported, suggesting that the enzyme is much more active toward nitroaromatics than previously estimated. Surprisingly, in the crystal structure of the oxidized NTR-nitrofurazone complex, nitrofurazone is oriented with its amide group, rather than the nitro group to be reduced, positioned over the reactive N5 of the FMN cofactor. Free acetate, which acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to NADH, binds in a similar orientation. We infer that the orientation of bound nitrofurazone depends upon the redox state of the enzyme.

Chem. 1951; 191: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.McCalla D.R. Reuvers A. Kaiser C. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 104: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are active against organisms displaying resistance to a broad spectrum of other antibacterial agents. Nitrofurantoin is currently used primarily as an oral antibacterial treatment for genitourinary infections (3.Guay D.R. Drugs. 2001; 61: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and nitrofurazone is used as an atopical antibacterial agent for the treatment of burns and of skin graft patients (4.Rodgers G.L. Mortensen J.E. Fisher M.C. Long S.S. J. Burn Care Rehabil. 1997; 18: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of both of these antibiotics has yet to be fully elucidated. Studies have indicated that the presence of bacterial enzymes capable of reducing nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone is critical for their activation (5.Sisson G. Goodwin A. Raudonikiene A. Hughes N.J. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Berg D.E. Hoffman P.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2116-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6.Whiteway J. Koziarz P. Veall J. Sandhu N. Kumar P. Hoecher B. Lambert I.B. J Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5529-5539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains of bacteria that are sensitive to the nitrofurans have been shown to express a flavoprotein capable of catalyzing the reduction of these drugs (7.McCalla D.R. Voutsinos D. Mut. Res. 1974; 26: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 8.Groenewegen P.E. Breeuwer P. van Helvoort J.M. Langenhoff A.A. de Vries F.P. De Bont J.A.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1599-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since this reductase activity is not present in nitrofurazone-resistant strains of bacteria, it has been concluded that it is this enzyme that converts nitrofurazone to a compound capable of damaging cells. In Escherichia coli, the enzymes responsible for nitrofurazone and nitrofurantoin activation are the type 1 oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases, encoded by the nfnA (nfsA) and the nfnB (nfsB) genes, respectively (9.Bryant D.W. McCalla D.R. Leeksma M. Laneuville P. Can. J. Microbiol. 1981; 27: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The first step of resistance to nitrofurazone is mutation of nfsA. These mutants retain 40% nitrofurazone sensitivity; however, mutants lacking both nfsA and nfsB are nitrofurazone-insensitive, suggesting an important role of nfsB in nitrofurazone activation (6.Whiteway J. Koziarz P. Veall J. Sandhu N. Kumar P. Hoecher B. Lambert I.B. J Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5529-5539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The toxic products formed following reduction of nitrofurazone and nitrofurantoin by bacteria remain unclear. Some studies have indicated that the reaction may proceed by reduction of the nitro group of nitrofurazone or nitrofurantoin, forming a hydroxylamine product. This hydroxylamine product could react both with proteins and with DNA, introducing strand breaks in the latter (2.McCalla D.R. Reuvers A. Kaiser C. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 104: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively it has been suggested that the reaction may involve reduction of the opposite, amide, end of the molecule, generating an amine with liberation of the toxic product, formamide (10.Mathison B.H. Murphy S.E. Shank R.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 127: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The nfsB enzyme (NTR) 1The abbreviations used are: NTR, nitroreductase from E. coli; EIMS, electron impact mass spectrometry; NFZ, nitrofurazone; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is a dimeric protein with 217 amino acids per polypeptide chain and one FMN cofactor per subunit. It is capable of using either NADH or NADPH as reducing equivalents and has a substituted enzyme (“ping-pong”) bi-bi mechanism (11.Anlezark G.M. Melton R.G. Sherwood R.F. Coles B. Friedlos F. Knox R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 2289-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12.Zenno S. Koike H. Tanokura M. Saigo K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). NTR reduces a broad range of nitroaromatic substrates but reduces quinones more rapidly (11.Anlezark G.M. Melton R.G. Sherwood R.F. Coles B. Friedlos F. Knox R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 2289-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12.Zenno S. Koike H. Tanokura M. Saigo K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Whereas the latter involves a two-electron reduction to give a quinol, reduction of nitro groups in general gives hydroxylamines, which requires transfer of four electrons. The two-electron nitroso reduction intermediate has never been observed, and it has not been determined whether the enzyme catalyzes both successive two-electron transfers. We have previously determined the structure of NTR, complexed with the nucleotide analogue nicotinic acid (13.Lovering A.L. Hyde E.I. Searle P.F. White S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Structures of the free oxidized and reduced NTR protein (14.Parkinson G.N. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. J. Med.

Here we report the structure of oxidized NTR complexed with nitrofurazone and the identity of the reaction products. We show that NTR rapidly reduces nitrosoaromatics, supporting the role of the enzyme in catalysis of two successive two-electron transfers. From our results, we infer that nitrofurazone binds in different orientations to the oxidized and reduced enzyme. The cause of this substrate reorientation is discussed in relation to the enzyme structure and implications for related flavoproteins. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Protein Purification—Recombinant nitroreductase was purified as described previously (13.Lovering A.L. Hyde E.I. Searle P.F. White S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was determined from its absorbance at 280 nm, using a molar absorbance of 43,000 m–1 cm–1 per subunit, estimated from its amino acid composition and flavin content (18.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar) or from Bradford assays, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (19.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Substrate Soaks—Native crystals of NTR were grown as described previously (13.Lovering A.L. Hyde E.I. Searle P.F. White S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing polyethylene glycol 4000 (10% w/v), ethylene glycol (25% w/v), 15 mm nicotinic acid, and 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6. Crystals of the NTR-nitrofurazone complex were obtained by transferring native crystals to a stabilizing solution containing 15 mm nitrofurazone (solubilized in Me2SO), 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.6. Similarly, crystals of NTR-acetate complexes were obtained using a soaking solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6. In each case, crystals were soaked in the appropriate solutions for ∼10 min immediately prior to flash cooling to 100 K. Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data were collected at 100 K using beamline ID 14-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). All data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using MOSFLM (20.Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (21.Evans, P. R. (1993) in Data Reduction Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend, on Data Collection and Processing (Sawyer, L., Isaacs, N., and Bailey, S., eds) pp. 114–122Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Model Refinement—The crystals of the NTR nitrofurazone complex and of one of the NTR acetate complexes (NTR-acetate 1) were isomorphous with previously reported NTR-nicotinate crystals (13.Lovering A.L. Hyde E.I. Searle P.F. White S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). NTR structures 1icu.pdb (P21) and 1icr.pdb (P41212) were used as the starting structures to refine the structures of these two complexes, respectively. After removing the nicotinic acid and all waters, the starting structures were refined against the appropriate data sets using the rigid body, simulated annealing, positional, and isotropic B-factor refinement protocols, as implemented in CNS (22.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). After preliminary refinement, difference electron density (Fo – Fc) clearly showed the presence of either NFZ or acetate in each of the active sites. Model adjustment and ligand fitting were done manually using the molecular graphics program Turbo-Frodo (23.Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 86. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) using Sigma A-weighted (24.Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar) Fo – Fc and 2Fo – Fc difference maps as a guide. Water molecules were fitted with the aid of the water-pick protocol in CNS and inspected using molecular graphics. Finally, the structures were refined using the translation and libration correlation parameters and restrained refinement protocol using Refmac5 (25.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar, 26.Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). The isoalloxazine ring of FMN was restrained in two planes about the N5/N10 axis, but the butterfly angle was not constrained. No other noncrystallographic constraints or restraints were applied at any time. An additional crystal form (P21212) was observed in the same crystallization conditions (Table I). The structure of a second acetate complex (NTR-acetate 2) was solved from such a crystal by molecular replacement, using the orthorhombic NTR-nicotinate complex (1icv.pdb (P212121)) (13.Lovering A.L. Hyde E.I. Searle P.F. White S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The structure was initially refined using the program CNS (22.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and then in Refmac5 (25.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) using the same protocols as for the other complexes.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic Studies—Initial steady state kinetic studies were carried out spectrophotometrically by monitoring the initial rate of disappearance of nitrofurazone at 420 nm (ϵ420 nm = 5,590 m–1 cm–1, based on ϵ420 nm = 12,960 m–1 cm–1 (27.Peterson F.J. Mason R.P. Hovsepian J. Holtzman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4009-4014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and nitrofurantoin at 420 nm (ϵ420 nm = 7,970 m–1 cm–1 based on ϵ373 nm = 26,300 M–1 cm–1 (28.McOsker C.C. Fitzpatrick P.M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1994; 33: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)). For 2-nitrofuran, the oxidation of NADH was monitored at 340 nm (29.Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The full kinetic studies on nitrofurazone monitored the reaction at 440 nm, using Δϵ440 880 m–1 cm–1, allowing for absorbance of the product. For nitrotoluene, nitrobenzene, nitrosotoluene, and nitrosobenzene, the rate of NADH oxidation at 360 nm was measured (ϵ360 = 4,240 m–1 cm–1 based on ϵ340 = 6,220 m–1 cm–1 (29.Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). All reactions were performed in quartz cuvettes, with a 0.1–1-cm path length. Assays were performed in 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.0, 4.5% Me2SO. The temperature of each reaction was maintained at 25 ± 1 °C using a circulating water bath, and all solutions were thermally equilibrated to 25 ± 1 °C prior to measurement. All nitro and nitroso compounds were dissolved in 90% (v/v) Me2SO, 10% (v/v) water containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. In all cases, the reaction was initiated by the addition of a small amount of cold enzyme solution to the reaction mix (<40 nm). All data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Sigma Plot 8™ (SPSS) with equal weighting of points. For nitrofurazone and NADH, kinetic data were collected at a range of NADH and nitrofurazone concentrations, and plots of initial velocity (vi) versus substrate concentration were fitted globally to an equation of the following form (30.Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1000: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar), vi=kcat[E][A][B]KmA[B]+KmB[A]+[A][B] (Eq. 1) where [E] represents the enzyme concentration, [A] and [B] are the concentrations of the two substrates, and KmA and KmB are the Michaelis constants for substrate [A] and [B], respectively. For the remaining substrates, plots for each substrate were fitted individually, to an equation of the following form, vi=kcat(app)[E][A]KmA(app)+[A] (Eq. 2) where [A] is the concentration of the variable substrate. In the absence of inhibitor, the following hold true. KmA(app)=KmA[B]KmB+[B] and kcat(app)=kcat[A]KmB+[B] As the kinetic parameters of substrate A vary, depending on those of substrate B, it is not possible to correct for partial saturation, using only a single concentration of substrate B. However, the ratio kcat(app)/KM(app) is equal to the true kcat/Km for that substrate. At low substrate concentrations, the values of kcat/Km can be determined more precisely than either kcat or Km by fitting the equation with kcat/Km as one independent parameter with either kcat or Km as the other. Nonenzymatic Reductions—The rates of nonenzymatic reduction of nitrosobenzene and 2-nitrosotoluene were measured at 60 μm NADH with up to 50 μm nitroso compounds; rates at higher concentrations could not be measured due to fast NADH depletion. The rates obtained were plotted versus the concentration of nitrosoaromatic and fitted to a straight line to obtain the pseudo-first-order rate constants. These were divided by the concentration of NADH to obtain the second-order rate constant. At each concentration of substrate, the rates observed in the absence of enzyme were subtracted from those in its presence, and the differences in rates were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 2). Inhibitor Studies—Assays were monitored as described above, but with the addition of varying concentrations of sodium acetate, acetamide, nicotinic acid, or dicoumarol to the reaction mix. Inhibitor concentrations ranged from 0 to 50 μm for dicoumarol and from 0 to 25 mm for acetate, acetamide, and nicotinic acid. In the case of both acetate and acetamide, the reaction mix also contained 100 mm sodium chloride to reduce the effect of change in ionic strength. The type of inhibition (competitive or uncompetitive) shown by each inhibitor with respect to each substrate was determined from plots of [E]/vi versus 1/[S] at different inhibitor concentrations. The kinetic data for each inhibition concentration were fitted to Equation 2, and KmA(app) was determined as a function of inhibitor concentration. For competitive inhibition, the dissociation constant of the inhibitor, KiA, was determined from a secondary plot of KmA(app) versus inhibitor concentration, fitted to an equation of the form, KmA(app)=KmA ‘[I]KiA+KmA ‘ (Eq. 5) where [I] represents the concentration of the inhibitor, and KiA is the dissociation constant for competitive inhibitor, KmA '=KmA[B]KmB+[B] For uncompetitive inhibition, KiA ' values were calculated from plots of 1/KmA(app) versus [I] for two different concentrations of the fixed substrate, B. These plots were fitted to an equation of the form below, and KiA ' was obtained from the inhibitor concentration at the point of intersection of the two lines (31.Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). 1KmA(app)=KmB[I]KmA[B]KiA+KmB+[B]KmA[B] (Eq. 7) where [I] represents the concentration of the inhibitor, and K′iA is the dissociation constant for uncompetitive inhibition. Purification of the Nitrofurazone and Nitrofurantoin Reaction Products—The products of enzymic reduction of nitrofurazone and nitrofurantoin were isolated using semipreparative HPLC. Nitrofurazone or nitrofurantoin (500 μm) was incubated at room temperature with 1 mm NADH and 5 μm NTR, in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, for 5 min. Following incubation, 100 μl of the reaction mix was injected onto a Technicol C18 reverse phase column (50 × 220 mm). The products were eluted using a 5–50% acetonitrile gradient over a 15-min period at 4 ml/min. The absorbance of the column eluant was monitored at 300 nm throughout. All products eluted were collected from the column, and samples were identified on the basis of UV-visible spectra. Fractions containing the reduction products of nitrofurazone and nitrofurantoin reduction were pooled, rotary-evaporated, and analyzed by electron impact mass spectrometry (EIMS) using a Kratos Profile mass spectrometer. The products of nitrofurazone reduction by NTR were isolated both aerobically and in an atmosphere of nitrogen. For separations conducted under nitrogen, the HPLC solvents were continually sparged with nitrogen for 15 min prior to and throughout each separation. Reaction mixes were sparged continually with nitrogen, and all isolated products were stored in a nitrogen atmosphere. In order to examine the mode of action of NTR with the antibiotic nitrofurazone, we determined the crystal structure of the protein in complex with the antibiotic. Crystals of the complex were obtained by soaking crystals of the NTR-nicotinic acid complex in solution containing nitrofurazone. One molecule of nitrofurazone was clearly observed in each active site of the two dimers in the asymmetric unit. The ligand shows good occupancy with B factors of 17.6–25.4 Å2 in the four sites, slightly higher than those for the protein atoms in the active site. The nitrofurazone molecule adopts an essentially planar conformation. The amide group is over the central ring of FMN, the aliphatic moiety stacks over the two polar rings of the FMN, and the nitrofuran ring projects into a loop formed by residues 68–71 and into solution (Fig. 2, A and C). There are extensive van der Waals contacts between the ligand and the FMN, whereas the C2′ of the nitrofuran ring is in van der Waals contact with Phe70 Cβ. Nitrofurazone makes several hydrogen bonds with the protein, FMN, and ordered water molecules. The amide nitrogen (N4) hydrogen-bonds to the side chain of Glu165; the amide oxygen (O4) bonds with the Thr41 backbone NH and with the FMN ribitol O2*; and N3 (from the aliphatic chain) and O1 (from the nitro group) each hydrogenbond to a bound water molecule. One of these bound water molecules also hydrogen-bonds to the Phe70 backbone amide, hence bridging between the ligand and the protein. The active site of the protein shows only small changes from that of the nicotinic acid complex. In our previous study of the nicotinate complex, we suggested that the two phenylalanine residues, Phe124 and Phe70, play a major role in controlling access to the active site of NTR (13.Lovering A.L. Hyde E.I. Searle P.F. White S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the nitrofurazone complex, the Phe124 side chain, which stacks on the nicotinate ring and is displaced from its position in the free protein, is in a similar position to that in the free protein. In contrast, the Phe70 side chain, which is mobile in the nicotinate complex, has more limited mobility due to the presence of the furan ring in the pocket. The contact between nitrofurazone amide and Glu165 causes the side chain of Glu165 to orient close to the Ser40 side chain. Since the amide group of the nitrofurazone was found above the central ring of the FMN, we also determined the structure of the NTR-acetate complex. Two crystal forms of the acetate complex were obtained, with very similar structures; the root mean square deviation for the Cα positions between the two complexes is 0.39 Å. One acetate molecule is found in each active site, with good occupancy, in a very similar position in the two crystal forms; however, in the orthorhombic crystal form there are two additional acetate molecules bound to each dimer, outside the active site. In the tetrahedral crystal form, the B factor of the bound acetate is 24.01 Å2 for chain A and 28.75 Å2 for chain B, similar to that of the active site residues. The terminal amide of the nitrofurazone and the acetate molecule occupy the same position over the central ring of the flavin. However, the acetate was modeled with its two oxygen atoms facing the bottom of the binding pocket rather than in the same orientation as the amide group. In the orientation modeled, the methyl group points directly into the ring of Phe124 and forms van der Waals contact with Thr41 CE2 (Fig. 2B). This leaves one oxygen to hydrogen-bond to the Thr41 backbone NH and FMN ribityl O2*, with the other oxygen facing toward bulk solvent. The carboxylate group of acetate is in a similar position to that of the nicotinate in the nicotinic acid complex; however, it is rotated about 10° with respect to the FMN cofactor. The Phe124 and Phe70 residues in the acetate complex are similar in orientation to those in the free protein, since the ligand is small. Substrate Specificity—Initial steady-state kinetic assays at constant (750 μm) antibiotic concentration show that both NADH and NADPH support the NTR-catalyzed reduction of nitrofurazone and nitrofurantoin with similar rates and apparent Km values (Table III). Similarly, at 60 μm NADH or NADPH, nitrofurazone and nitrofurantoin have very similar activities. The simple 2-nitrofuran ring is a poorer substrate for NTR than either antibiotic, whereas nitromethane is not reduced by the enzyme.Table IIIKinetic parameters for the reduction of nucleotide and aromatic substrates by NTRVariable subst"
https://openalex.org/W1973365755,"DNA translocases are molecular motors that move rapidly along DNA using adenosine triphosphate as the source of energy. We directly observed the movement of purified FtsK, an Escherichia coli translocase, on single DNA molecules. The protein moves at 5 kilobases per second and against forces up to 60 piconewtons, and locally reverses direction without dissociation. On three natural substrates, independent of its initial binding position, FtsK efficiently translocates over long distances to the terminal region of the E. coli chromosome, as it does in vivo. Our results imply that FtsK is a bidirectional motor that changes direction in response to short, asymmetric directing DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1965718993,"A hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the pseudo-tumoral expansion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), and the RA FLS has therefore been proposed as a therapeutic target. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been described as a pro-apoptotic factor on RA FLSs and, therefore, suggested as a potential drug. Here we report that exposure to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a portion (up to 30%) of RA FLSs within the first 24 h. In the cells that survived, TRAIL induced RA FLS proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal proliferation observed at 0.25 nm. This was blocked by a neutralizing anti-TRAIL antibody. RA FLSs were found to express constitutively TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) on the cell surface. TRAIL-R2 appears to be the main mediator of TRAIL-induced stimulation, as RA FLS proliferation induced by an agonistic anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody was comparable with that induced by TRAIL. TRAIL activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and p38, as well as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway with kinetics similar to those of TNF-α. Moreover, TRAIL-induced RA FLS proliferation was inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitors PD98059, SB203580, and LY294002, confirming the involvement of the ERK, p38, and PI3 kinase/Akt signaling pathways. This dual functionality of TRAIL in stimulating apoptosis and proliferation has important implications for its use in the treatment of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 1The abbreviations used are: RA, rheumatoid arthritis; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; FLS, fibroblast-like synoviocyte; IL, interleukin; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3, phosphatidylinositol 3; RT, reverse transcription; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of joints leading to progressive and irreversible joint destruction. The aggressive front of synovial tissue, called pannus, invades and destroys local articular structure. The pannus is characterized by a synovial hyperplasia that is mainly composed of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) combined with a massive infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages. Both increased proliferation and/or insufficient apoptosis might contribute to the expansion of RA FLSs, and several reports suggest inducing apoptosis of RA FLSs as a therapeutic approach. Intraarticular expression of proinflammatory cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RA (1Pope R.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). An anti-inflammatory role has been suggested for the TNF family member TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) following the observations that the blockade of TRAIL in mice exacerbated autoimmune arthritis and that intraarticular TRAIL gene transfer relieved the symptoms (2Song K. Chen Y. Goke R. Wilmen A. Seidel C. Goke A. Hilliard B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In addition, one report described an increased sensitivity of TRAIL-deficient mice to collagen-induced arthritis (3Lamhamedi-Cherradi S.E. Zheng S.J. Maguschak K.A. Peschon J. Chen Y.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). TRAIL can interact with five different receptors, namely two agonistic receptors called DR4/TRAIL-R1 and DR5/TRAIL-R2 (hereafter referred to as TRAIL-R1 and -R2, respectively), two membrane-anchored decoy receptors designated DcR1/TRAIL-R3 and DcR2/TRAIL-R4 (hereafter referred to as TRAIL-R3, and -R4, respectively), and a soluble decoy receptor known as osteoprotegerin (OPG) (4Baetu T.M. Hiscott J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of OPG as a receptor for TRAIL is unclear, because the affinity for this ligand at physiological temperatures has been described to be very low (5Truneh A. Sharma S. Silverman C. Khandekar S. Reddy M.P. Deen K.C. McLaughlin M.M. Srinivasula S.M. Livi G.P. Marshall L.A. Alnemri E.S. Williams W.V. Doyle M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23319-23325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Notably, the affinities of TRAIL-R3 and -R4 for TRAIL at physiological temperatures are ∼50–100-fold lower than those between TRAIL and its cognate receptors TRAIL-R1 and -R2 (5Truneh A. Sharma S. Silverman C. Khandekar S. Reddy M.P. Deen K.C. McLaughlin M.M. Srinivasula S.M. Livi G.P. Marshall L.A. Alnemri E.S. Williams W.V. Doyle M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23319-23325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The receptors TRAIL-R1 and -R2 contain a cytoplasmic death domain and can induce apoptosis through the activation of caspases upon ligation with a TRAIL ligand (reviewed in Ref. 6Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the binding of TRAIL to these TRAIL receptors can also activate the transcription factor NFκB, which is known to control cell proliferation (7Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Hofmann K. Kataoka T. Holler N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Indeed, although TRAIL is known to induce apoptosis in tumor cells (reviewed in Ref. 6Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), TRAIL has also been shown to promote endothelial cell proliferation (8Secchiero P. Gonelli A. Carnevale E. Milani D. Pandolfi A. Zella D. Zauli G. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on the cellular system, TRAIL is capable of initiating apoptosis or cell survival. The effect of TRAIL on the RA FLS appears to be controversial. Ichikawa et al. described TRAIL-R1 and -R2 expression on primary isolated FLSs from RA patients and reported that an agonistic anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody, as well as cross-linked TRAIL, induces apoptosis on these FLS (9Ichikawa K. Liu W. Fleck M. Zhang H. Zhao L. Ohtsuka T. Wang Z. Liu D. Mountz J.D. Ohtsuki M. Koopman W.J. Kimberly R. Zhou T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been reported by analyzing synovial fluid fibroblasts of RA patients (10Miranda-Carus M.E. Balsa A. Benito-Miguel M. De Ayala C.P. Martin-Mola E. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 2786-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The conclusion that TRAIL induces apoptosis of the RA FLS was challenged previously by Perlman et al., who detected neither the expression of TRAIL-R1 and -R2 nor TRAIL susceptibility on primary isolated FLSs from RA patients (11Perlman H. Nguyen N. Liu H. Eslick J. Esser S. Walsh K. Moore T.L. Pope R.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 3096-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we report for the first time that TRAIL can induce RA FLS proliferation in vitro through MAP kinases and PI3 kinase/Akt activation. Reagents—Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems (Lille, France). Recombinant human IL-1β and recombinant human TRAIL were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Polyclonal goat anti-TRAIL-R1, anti-TRAIL-R2, anti-TRAIL-R4, and mouse anti-TRAIL antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems. Control MOPC2.1 IgG was obtained from Sigma. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-p38 (Thr(P)-180/Tyr(P)-182) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology and BD Biosciences, respectively. The monoclonal mouse anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The rabbit polyclonal anti-NFκB p65 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, Pennsylvania), and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Fibroblast-like Synoviocytes of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients—Fibroblasts were isolated from synovium samples obtained from patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA (revised 1987) who had undergone surgery for synovectomy or total joint replacement surgery (12Arnett F.C. Edworthy S.M. Bloch D.A. McShane D.J. Fries J.F. Cooper N.S. Healey L.A. Kaplan S.R. Liang M.H. Luthra H.S. Medsger Jr., T.A. Mitchell D.M. Neustadt D.H. Pinals R.S. Schaller J.G. Sharp J.T. Wilder R.L. Hunder G.G. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (18640) Google Scholar). Fresh synovial tissues were minced and digested in a solution of dispase (Roche Applied Science), collagenase (Sigma), and DNase (Calbiochem). Synovial fibroblasts were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 UI/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were used at passage 4–10, at which time they were a homogeneous population of fibroblasts. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were passaged by brief trypsinization as described previously (13Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Leibovich S.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR experiments, RA FLSs were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well or in 6 cm-dishes at 4 × 105 cells. Fetal calf serum content of the media was progressively decreased from 10 to 1% with final starvation for 12 h in RPMI and 1% FCS. Cells were stimulated with TNF-α (2 nm), IL-1β (1 nm), or TRAIL (at indicated concentrations). Flow Cytometric Analysis—RA FLSs were harvested with Versene (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and suspended in PBS supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% NaN3. Fifty to one hundred thousand cells were incubated for 20 min on ice in with 0.5 μg of goat anti-TRAIL-R1 antibody, anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody, anti-TRAIL-R4 antibody, or mouse anti-TRAIL antibody. As a negative control, cells were incubated with an isotype control antibody. Cells were then washed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer and incubated for 20 min on ice with the corresponding fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-specie antibody. Viable cells were selected by propidium iodide exclusion, and analysis was performed using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Cell Proliferation Assay—Proliferation was evaluated by measuring DNA synthesis through the incorporation of tritiated [3H]thymidine. FLSs were seeded in 96-well, flat-bottom culture plates at a density of 1 × 10 4 cells/well. Cells were cultured in RPMI with a decreasing concentration of FCS (10 and 5%) and then synchronized for 24 h with RPMI and 1% FCS. FLS were stimulated with various concentrations of TRAIL (0.25–10 nm) or media (RPMI/FCS (1%)) for 72 h. Every condition was tested in quadruplicate. [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added 18 h before the end of the assay. FLSs were lysed using a round of freeze-thaw cycle and then transferred onto a membrane filter using Harvester 96 (TOMTEC, Hamdem, CT). [3H]Thymidine incorporated into DNA was quantified using a scintillation counter 1450 MicroBeta Trilux (Wallac, Freiburg, Germany). For a competition assay, TRAIL at 0.5 nm was pre-incubated (30 min) with anti-TRAIL or MOPC2.1 IgG and added to cells. For experiments with protein kinases inhibitors, FLSs were preincubated for an hour with the specific inhibitors (or the solvent Me2SO alone) and then cultured with or without TRAIL (0.5 nm). Similar results were obtained using either synchronized cells (upon serum deprivation-induced growth arrest) or non-synchronized cells. Detection of Apoptosis—Cells were stimulated with TRAIL at 0.5 nm for indicated time points, and apoptosis was evaluated using annexin V binding and the uptake of TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes, The Netherlands). Briefly, 2–4 × 105 cells of RA FLS were collected and resuspended at 5–10 × 106 cells/ml in annexin V binding buffer. Then, 5–10 × 105 RA FLSs were incubated with 5 μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate at 10 μg/ml (R&D systems) for 15 min at room temperature. Upon the addition of TO-PRO-3 (1:2000), cells were analyzed using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent. Complementary DNA was synthesized by RT with SuperScript™ II RNase H– RT (Invitrogen). cDNA was obtained by RT of 1–4 μg of total mRNA, with oligo(dT)15 at 0.5 μg/μl as the primer, and the reaction was done according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR—cDNA was screened for expression of human TRAIL employing the primers 5′-GTGTACTTTACCAACGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGCTCAGGAATGAATGC-3′ (reverse) generating a 391-bp fragment. The conditions used were 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 25–35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel. RNA amounts varied from 100 to 400 ng for TRAIL and from 5 to 20 ng for β-actin. PCR was performed on ABI PRISM 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France); signals were measured using Kodak 1D image analysis software, and each sample was normalized to β-actin level (with a forward primer of 5′-GCTGCTGACCGAGGCCCCCCTGAAC-3′ and a reverse primer of 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′ generating a 310-bp fragment). Western Blot Analysis—Synovial cells were stimulated, and the reaction was stopped on ice. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm NaP2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% desoxycholate). Cells were harvested with a cell scraper. For some experiments, cell extracts were sonicated and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA (Pierce), equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10 or 12% acrylamide), and immunoblot analysis was done as described previously (14Morel J.C. Park C.C. Zhu K. Kumar P. Ruth J.H. Koch A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34679-34691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using a 1:1 mixture of coumaric acid (50 mm; Sigma) and luminol sodium salt (200 mm; Sigma). Blots were scanned, and densitometric signals were determined using Kodak 1D image analysis software. Data were expressed as arbitrary units after normalization to levels of β-actin. Immunofluorescence Staining—To determine the nuclear translocation of NFκB, RA FLSs were seeded at 2 ×104 cells/well in 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Falcon). Cells were stimulated with TRAIL at 0.5 nm or with IL-1 at 1 nm for 30–120 min, washed with cold PBS, and then fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with PBS and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Unspecific binding was prevented with blocking buffer containing 5% goat serum diluted in PBS. Cells were incubated with the rabbit polyclonal anti-NFκB p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 5 μg/ml or an isotype control for 60 min at room temperature. Cyan3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used at 20 μg/ml for 60 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with mounting media, and the subcellular localization of NFκB was visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical studies were performed with a non-parametric Wilcoxon test (Instat software). p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. TRAIL Induces Initially Apoptosis of RA FLS, but Proliferation of Surviving Cells—To test the effect of TRAIL on RA FLS, cells were co-cultured for 3 days with 0.5 nm TRAIL. The first 24 h of co-culturing with TRAIL resulted in apoptosis of ∼30% of the cells as determined by annexin V staining/TO-PRO-3 uptake (Fig. 1). This technique allows us to distinguish early apoptotic (annexin+/TO-PRO-3–) from late apoptotic cells (annexin+/TO-PRO-3+) (15Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4606) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the highest percentage of early apoptotic cells was observed upon 4 h of TRAIL treatment. At later time points the cells shifted from the early apoptotic gate toward the late apoptotic cell gate. Apoptosis of RA FLS was also obvious in an analysis of forward angle light scatter (FSC; data not shown), because a decrease of FSC is characteristic of apoptotic cell death (15Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4606) Google Scholar). After 24 h of coculturing, ∼70% of RA FLSs were still viable. Similar results were obtained for RA FLSs derived from different patients (data not shown). Apoptotic cell numbers remained unchanged in unstimulated cells throughout the 72-h observation period (Fig. 1, left column). After 72 h of TRAIL exposure, proliferation of RA FLS was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2A). Significant increases in DNA synthesis were observed for all of the concentrations of TRAIL tested, with a maximum proliferation already detectable for 0.25 nm. TRAIL induced a 5-fold increase in RA FLS proliferation similar to that induced by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β (Fig. 2B). Simultaneous addition of TRAIL and IL-1β enhanced proliferation, demonstrating the additive effect of these two cytokines on RA FLS cells (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes extracted from rheumatoid arthritis patients.A, TRAIL induces RA FLS proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. RA FLSs were stimulated for 72 h with the indicated concentrations of TRAIL, and proliferation was assessed using [3H]thymidine incorporation. B, additive effect of TRAIL combined with IL-1β on RA FLS proliferation. Cells were stimulated for 72 h with IL-1β (1 nm), TRAIL (0.5 nm), or the two cytokines combined. Proliferation was evaluated as described for panel A. C, the anti-TRAIL antibody inhibits TRAIL-induced RA FLS proliferation. TRAIL (0.5 nm) was pre-treated with anti-TRAIL antibody (0.5–1 μg/ml) or the control isotype-matched antibody MOPC2.1 IgG (1 μg/ml). Results represent the proliferation of RA FLS after 72 h upon treatment and are expressed as the stimulation index (the ratio of the arithmetic mean of counts per minute from the quadruplicate of stimulated culture to the arithmetic mean of counts per minute from the quadruplicate of non-stimulated culture). Data from the indicated number of patients (n) were averaged and shown as means ± S.E. NS, non-stimulated RA FLSs; asterisks (*), p values of <0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the specificity of TRAIL-induced proliferation, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of a neutralizing anti-TRAIL antibody. This led to an almost complete inhibition of TRAIL-mediated RA FLS proliferation, whereas the isotype control antibody had no effect (Fig. 2C). Treatment with either the anti-TRAIL antibody alone or the control antibody alone did not affect proliferation (data not shown). RA FLSs Express TRAIL mRNA and TRAIL-R1 and -R2 Proteins—We next analyzed the expression of TRAIL and its receptors in RA FLS. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed the up-regulation of TRAIL mRNA expression by TNF-α and IL-1β by ∼2 and 5-fold, respectively, versus unstimulated cells (Fig. 3A). The TRAIL protein could not be detected either in soluble form in conditioned media or on the RA FLS cell surface (data not shown). This finding might be due to the limited sensitivity of the antibodies employed or a low translation efficiency. The expression of different TRAIL receptors on RA FLS was evaluated by flow cytometry. TRAIL-R1 and -R2 on RA FLSs were constitutively expressed, whereas TRAIL-R4 was not detectable (Fig. 3C). Expression of the receptors was unaltered when RA FLSs were treated with IL-1β, TNF-α, or TRAIL (data not shown). TRAIL-R2/DR5 Receptor Mediates TRAIL-induced Proliferation—Treatment of RA FLS with an agonistic anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody induced an ∼5-fold increase in RA FLS proliferation in comparison with untreated cells (Fig. 4). This increase corresponds to the maximal induction observed upon the addition of recombinant TRAIL (Fig. 4), suggesting that TRAIL-R2 mediates TRAIL-induced proliferation to a large extent. TRAIL Activates the Kinases p38, ERK1/2, and Akt but Not NFκB—To determine the intracellular mechanisms involved in TRAIL-induced cell proliferation, we tested the effect of TRAIL on signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, specifically those containing the MAP kinases p38 and ERK1/2 and PI3 kinase/Akt (16Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). RA FLSs were treated with 0.5 nm TRAIL and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting. Activating phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was rapidly induced by TRAIL and persisted up to 60 min, although with a lower intensity in comparison with that of TNF-α (Fig. 5, A and B). Treatment with TRAIL also induced activation of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in a time-dependent manner, with maximum activation occurring between 5 and 10 min (Figs. 5, C and D, and 6). The kinetics and intensities of ERK and Akt phosphorylation were comparable with those induced by TNF-α.Fig. 6TRAIL promotes Akt phosphorylation in the RA FLS.A and B, RA FLSs were treated as described in the Fig. 5 legend to assess Akt activation following TRAIL stimulation using an antibody specific for phosphorylated Akt. NS, non-stimulated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transcription factor NFκB plays a major role in cell survival and can be activated by MAP kinases and Akt (17Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 18Firestein G.S. Manning A.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Upon activation, NFκB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which can be visualized using indirect immunofluorescence (19May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether nuclear accumulation of NFκB could be detected in the RA FLS following TRAIL stimulation. Very little NFκB was in the nucleus in non-stimulated RA FLSs (4.3 ± 0.9%). IL-1β strongly induced its nuclear translocation (97.9 ± 1.1%). In contrast, only 6.7% (±1.2) of NFκB was nuclear upon exposure to TRAIL (Fig. 7, A and B). Western blotting confirmed these observations when NFκB was detectable in the nuclear fraction only upon TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 7C). Thus, the exposure of RA FLS to TRAIL activates the kinases p38 and ERK1/2 and PI3 but not the transcription factor NFκB. Akt, p38, and ERK Control TRAIL-mediated RA FLS Proliferation—To confirm that MAP kinases and PI3 kinase/Akt play a role in TRAIL-induced proliferation, we used the specific inhibitors LY294002 (PI3 kinase), PD98059 (ERK1/2), and SB203580 (p38). RA FLSs were pretreated with the specific inhibitors at different concentrations or with solvent (Me2SO) alone for 1 h and then stimulated with 0.5 nm TRAIL. Under these experimental conditions, cell viability was >90% (14Morel J.C. Park C.C. Zhu K. Kumar P. Ruth J.H. Koch A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34679-34691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. ERK 1/2 inhibition (Fig. 8A) and p38 inhibition (Fig. 8B) significantly diminished TRAIL-induced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Strikingly, the PI3 kinase inhibitor almost completely blocked the proliferation induced by TRAIL, underlining the crucial role played by this pathway (Fig. 8C). The TRAIL ligand/receptor system has raised much interest for cancer therapy, because it appears to kill tumor cells but not normal ones (20Smyth M.J. Takeda K. Hayakawa Y. Peschon J.J. van den Brink M.R. Yagita H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Fibroblast-like synoviocytes play a crucial role in the physiopathology of rheumatoid arthritis, as these cells are involved in inflammation and joint destruction. The pseudo-tumoral proliferation of RA FLS is considered to be the major mechanism for the hyperplasic growth of the RA synovium and can be mimicked by in vitro culturing, because ex vivo RA FLS cells grow in normal medium without requiring additional stimulation. RA FLSs exhibit certain tumor-like features, leading us to investigate the effect of TRAIL on RA FLS survival. Treatment of RA FLSs with TRAIL induced apoptosis within the first 24 h in ∼30% of the cells as detected by TO-PRO-3-uptake, annexin V staining, and decreased forward angle light scatter. Unexpectedly, TRAIL induced RA FLS proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at later culture times, i.e. 72 h. This was inhibited by neutralizing anti-TRAIL antibodies, confirming that cell proliferation is specifically induced by this cytokine. Moreover, combined stimulation with TRAIL and IL-1β had an additive effect on RA FLS proliferation, suggesting two independent mechanisms of stimulation. Further studies are required to analyze whether endogenous TRAIL participates in the pathogenesis of RA patients. The increased levels of TRAIL transcripts detected in RA FLS treated with proinflammatory cytokines argue for fratricide activation, but a contribution of TRAIL derived from synovial T cells is also possible. Our results suggest that TRAIL has two different effects on RA FLS, namely an initial rapid induction of apoptosis that is followed by an increased proliferation of the surviving population. These observations differ from those in the collagen-induced mouse model of arthritis that describes an inhibitory role for TRAIL by blocking the proliferation of synovial cells (2Song K. Chen Y.

This discrepancy could reflect the different pathogenic mechanisms between RA in the joints of patients and the respective mouse model. Furthermore, only one membrane-anchored TRAIL receptor and two soluble decoy receptors have been identified in the mouse (21Schneider P. Olson D. Tardivel A. Browning B. Lugovskoy A. Gong D. Dobles M. Hertig S. Hofmann K. Van Vlijmen H. Hsu Y.M. Burkly L.C. Tschopp J. Zheng T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5444-5454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), indicating differences in the organization of TRAIL signaling between man and mouse. The name TRAIL derives from its capacity to induce apoptosis (22Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1995; 3: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar). However, depending on the cellular system, TRAIL can exert different functions that also include survival, proliferation, and maturation. For example, TRAIL has been shown to promote cell survival and proliferation on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (8Secchiero P. Gonelli A. Carnevale E. Milani D. Pandolfi A. Zella D. Zauli G. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 23Secchiero P. Zerbinati C. Rimondi E. Corallini F. Milani D. Grill V. Forti G. Capitani S. Zauli G. Cell. Mol.

Blood. 2002; 100: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we describe for the first time that TRAIL is able to induce proliferation of RA FLS. A previous study analyzed the effect of TRAIL on RA FLSs for shorter culturing periods, i.e. up to 24 h, and reported the induction of apoptosis (9Ichikawa K. Liu W. Fleck M. Zhang H. Zhao L. Ohtsuka T. Wang Z. Liu D. Mountz J.D. Ohtsuki M. Koopman W.J. Kimberly R. Zhou T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Varying levels of apoptosis were induced by TRAIL on the different RA FLS cultures tested in which a portion of cells survived (9Ichikawa K. Liu W. Fleck M. Zhang H. Zhao L. Ohtsuka T. Wang Z. Liu D. Mountz J.D. Ohtsuki M. Koopman W.J. Kimberly R. Zhou T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These RA FLSs strongly express TRAIL-R2 and were highly susceptible to an agonistic anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody, identifying TRAIL-R2 as the receptor mediating TRAIL-induced apoptosis (9Ichikawa K. Liu W. Fleck M. Zhang H. Zhao L. Ohtsuka T. Wang Z. Liu D. Mountz J.D. Ohtsuki M. Koopman W.J. Kimberly R. Zhou T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, Miranda-Carus et al. analyzed (10Miranda-Carus M.E. Balsa A. Benito-Miguel M. De Ayala C.P. Martin-Mola E. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 2786-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) fibroblasts of 50 RA synovial fluid samples and found that about half of them express functionally active TRAIL-R2. These cells underwent apoptosis when treated in vitro with an agonistic anti TRAIL-R2 antibody (10Miranda-Carus M.E. Balsa A. Benito-Miguel M. De Ayala C.P. Martin-Mola E. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 2786-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although these reports suggested the specific targeting of TRAIL-R2 on RA FLSs as a potential therapeutical approach, Perlman et al. drew the opposite conclusion because they could not detect the expression of TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 or the susceptibility to TRAIL in RA FLSs (11Perlman H. Nguyen N. Liu H. Eslick J. Esser S. Walsh K. Moore T.L. Pope R.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 3096-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for these contradictory observations might be the use of different protocols to isolate and/or culture RA fibroblasts. The results described here suggest two distinct types of modulation of RA fibroblasts by TRAIL. TRAIL induced rapid cytotoxicity in a subset of RA FLSs that was followed by an induction of proliferation in the surviving cells. This proliferative effect appears to be mainly mediated by TRAIL-R2, because an agonistic anti TRAIL-R2 antibody induced proliferation of RA FLS in a similar manner as that of recombinant TRAIL. Therefore, it emerges that TRAIL can promote both proliferation as well as apoptosis, as has been established for other members of the TNF family (26Screaton G. Xu X.N. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For example, Fas ligand/receptor interaction stimulates T cells during the early activation phase, whereas it mediates apoptosis at later phases of T cell activation (27Suzuki I. Fink P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1707-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We show here that TRAIL promotes cell proliferation by activation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 and p38 and the serine/threonine kinase Akt. While this manuscript was under preparation, Myashita et al. reported that TRAIL activates ERK1/2 and Akt in RA FLSs, preventing these cells from undergoing apoptosis (28Miyashita T. Kawakami A. Tamai M. Izumi Y. Mingguo H. Tanaka F. Abiru S. Nakashima K. Iwanaga N. Aratake K. Kamachi M. Arima K. Ida H. Migita K. Origuchi T. Tagashira S. Nishikaku F. Eguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 and PI3 kinase/Akt pathways have been reported to activate NFκB, and, in certain cell types, TRAIL has been reported to activate NFκB via ligation of TRAIL-R1 (29Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30603-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We could, however, detect no activation of NFκB in RA FLSs by TRAIL. Notably, very similar observations were made in a different cellular system (8Secchiero P. Gonelli A. Carnevale E. Milani D. Pandolfi A. Zella D. Zauli G. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) where TRAIL promoted the proliferation of primary human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) by activating the ERK1/2 and Akt but not the NFκB pathways. These data suggest that TRAIL promotes cell growth through an NFκB-independent mechanism. The inhibition of MAP kinases abrogated TRAIL-mediated RA FLS proliferation partially, and the inhibition of PI3 kinase abrogated it completely, confirming that both pathways are essential for RA FLS proliferation. Different regulatory pathways have been proposed to control the sensitivity of RA FLSs toward apoptotic signals. These include altered expression levels of apoptosis inhibitory proteins such as FLIP and Bcl-2 (30Schedel J. Gay R.E. Kuenzler P. Seemayer C. Simmen B. Michel B.A. Gay S. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 1512-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Palao G. Santiago B. Galindo M. Paya M. Ramirez J.C. Pablos J.L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 2803-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the over-activation of MAP and PI3 kinases (18Firestein G.S. Manning A.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 32Zhang H.G. Wang Y. Xie J.F. Liang X. Liu D. Yang P. Hsu H.C. Ray R.B. Mountz J.D. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1555-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These kinases have been shown to be activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-18, which are present at elevated levels in the joints of arthritis patients (17Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 32Zhang H.G. Wang Y. Xie J.F. Liang X. Liu D. Yang P. Hsu H.C. Ray R.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37069-37075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that TRAIL stimulation may contribute to survival/proliferation by inducing Akt and ERK1/2. In accordance with this idea, RA FLS proliferation is enhanced by the combined addition of IL-1β and TRAIL. There is some precedent for TRAIL having both apoptotic and proliferative functions. Treatment of the promyelocytic human HL-60 cell line with TRAIL resulted in rapid cytotoxicity within 6–24 h, followed by progressive maturation of the surviving cells along the monocytic lineage (25Secchiero P. Gonelli A. Mirandola P. Melloni E. Zamai L. Celeghini C. Milani D. Zauli G. Blood. 2002; 100: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The capacity of TRAIL to sequentially induce death and growth signals in one cell type might therefore be a common mode of function. Consequently, the stimulatory effect of TRAIL observed on RA FLS complicates the proposed strategy to use TRAIL for targeting RA FLS. On the other hand, our results suggest Akt is a potential target to block joint destruction in RA.

https://openalex.org/W2026207397,"Previous studies have shown that a Ca2+-dependent nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) is activated as part of a cellular response to low doses of ionizing radiation. Genetic and pharmacological inhibitor studies linked this NO signaling to the radiation-induced activation of ERK1/2. Herein, a mechanism for the radiation-induced activation of Tyr phosphorylation-dependent pathways (e.g. ERK1/2) involving the inhibition of protein-Tyr phosphatases (PTPs) by S-nitrosylation is tested. The basis for this mechanism resides in the redox-sensitive active site Cys in PTPs. These studies also examined oxidative stress induced by low concentrations of H2O2. S-Nitrosylation of total cellular PTP and immunopurified SHP-1 and SHP-2 was detected as protection of PTP enzymatic activity from alkylation by N-ethylmaleimide and reversal by ascorbate. Both radiation and H2O2 protected PTP activity from alkylation by a mechanism reversible by ascorbate and inhibited by NOS inhibitors or expression of a dominant negative mutant of NOS-1. Radiation and H2O2 stimulated a transient increase in cytoplasmic free [Ca2+]. Radiation, H2O2, and the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, also stimulated NOS activity, and this was associated with an enhanced S-nitrosylation of the active site Cys453 determined by isolation of S-nitrosylated wild type but not active site Cys453 → Ser SHP-1 mutant by the “biotin-switch” method. Thus, one consequence of oxidative stimulation of NO generation is S-nitrosylation and inhibition of PTPs critical in cellular signal transduction pathways. These results support the conclusion that a mild oxidative signal is converted to a nitrosative one due to the better redox signaling properties of NO."
https://openalex.org/W1966799726,"Insulin regulates alternative splicing of PKCβII mRNA by phosphorylation of SRp40 via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (Patel, N. A., Chalfant, C. E., Watson, J. E., Wyatt, J. R., Dean, N. M., Eichler, D. C., and Cooper, D. C. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 22648–22654). Transient transfection of constitutively active Akt2 kinase promotes PKCβII exon inclusion. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) RNA-binding proteins regulating the selection of alternatively spliced exons are potential substrates of Akt kinase because many of them contain RXRXX(S/T) motifs. Here we show that Akt2 kinase phosphorylated SRp40 in vivo and in vitro. Mutation of Ser86 on SRp40 blocked in vitro phosphorylation. In control Akt2(+/+) fibroblasts, insulin treatment increased the phosphorylation of endogenous SR proteins, but their phosphorylation state remained unaltered by insulin in fibroblasts from Akt2(-/-) mice. Levels of PKCβII protein were up-regulated by insulin in Akt2(+/+) cells; however, only very low levels of PKCβII were detected in Akt2(-/-) cells and did not change following insulin treatment. Endogenous PKCβI and -βII mRNA levels in Akt2(+/+) and Akt2(-/-) gastrocnemius muscle tissues were compared using quantitative real time PCR. The results indicated a 54% decrease in the expression of PKCβII levels in Akt(-/-), whereas PKCβI levels remained unchanged in both samples. Further, transfection of Akt2(-/-) cells with a PKCβII splicing minigene revealed defective βII exon inclusion. Co-transfection of the mutated SRp40 attenuated βII exon inclusion. This study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence showing Akt2 kinase directly phosphorylated SRp40, thereby connecting the insulin, PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway with phosphorylation of a site on a nuclear splicing protein promoting exon inclusion. This model is upheld in Akt2-deficient mice with insulin resistance leading to diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2042340425,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) modulate immune responses leading to clinically significant beneficial effects in a variety of inflammatory disorders. PUFA effects on T cells have been extensively studied, but their influence on human dendritic cells (DCs), which are the most potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in initiating immune responses, has not been elucidated so far. Here we show that PUFAs of the n-3 and n-6 series (arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acid) affect human monocyte-derived DC differentiation and inhibit their activation by LPS, resulting in altered DC surface molecule expression and diminished cytokine secretion. Furthermore, the potency to stimulate T cells was markedly inhibited in PUFA-treated DCs. The PUFA-mediated block in LPS-induced DC activation is reflected by diminished TNF-α, IL-12p40, CD40, and COX-2 mRNA levels. Strikingly, typical LPS-induced signaling events such as degradation of IκB and activation of NF-κB were not affected by PUFAs, even though DC membrane lipid composition was markedly altered. Arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acid both altered DC prostaglandin production, but inhibitors of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases did not abolish PUFA effects, indicating that the observed PUFA actions on DCs were independent of autoregulation via eicosanoids. These data demonstrate a unique interference with DC activation and function that could significantly contribute to the well known anti-inflammatory effects of PUFAs.

Nutr. 2000; 71: 373S-375SCrossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Most studies elucidating PUFA effects on the adaptive immune response focused on lymphocyte function and cytokine production (3.Blok W.L. Katan M.B. van der Meer J.W. J.

While mechanisms underlying the distinct effects of PUFAs on T cell activation have been elucidated in detail (6.Stulnig T.M. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2003; 132: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), little is known about PUFA effects on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in general and dendritic cells (DCs) as the primary and most potent APCs in particular. DCs are the only APCs capable of initiating immune responses, i.e. activation of naïve T cells (7.Bell D. Young J.W. Banchereau J. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 255-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, DCs constitutively patrol through peripheral tissues and upon stimulation by pathogenic microbial compounds such as LPS DCs are activated to mature into efficient APCs. Mature DCs migrate into lymph nodes to promote T cell-mediated immune responses (8.Guermonprez P. Valladeau J. Zitvogel L. Thery C. Amigorena S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 621-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). In vitro, DCs are generated by differentiation from monocytes e.g. to be used in immunotherapy (9.Woltman A.M. van Kooten C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2003; 73: 428-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10.Romani N. Reider D. Heuer M. Ebner S. Kampgen E. Eibl B. Niederwieser D. Schuler G. J. Immuno. Methods. 1996; 196: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The resulting cells are CD14 negative immature monocyte-derived DCs expressing class II MHC molecules, stimulatory ligands for T cell surface receptors such as B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), and CD40, and endocytic receptors such as the mannose receptor (MR). Activating signals such as pathogenic compounds derived from microorganisms induce maturation of DCs via different toll-like receptors (TLR, Ref. 11.Kaisho T. Akira S. Curr. Mol. Med. 2003; 3: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Upon LPS stimulation, TLR4 associates with the serine/threonine kinase IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 that is subsequently autophosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and thus primed for degradation (12.Noubir S. Hmama Z. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25189-25195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13.Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IRAK-1 dissociates from the receptor complex to induce phosphorylation of MAP kinases such as p38 that mediate activation of NF-κB and subsequent DC maturation characterized by strongly up-regulated surface markers CD40, CD80, CD83, and CD86, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and secretion of inflammatory mediators such as IL-12 and TNF-α (8.Guermonprez P. Valladeau J. Zitvogel L. Thery C. Amigorena S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 621-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). LPS stimulation of DCs also results in activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway that is crucial for DC survival (14.Ardeshna K.M. Pizzey A.R. Devereux S. Khwaja A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Rescigno M. Martino M. Sutherland C.L. Gold M.R. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Here we show that PUFAs affect differentiation of human monocytes-derived DCs and severely interfere with DC functions such as cytokine production and T cell stimulation by blocking their responsiveness to LPS even at low micromolar concentrations. This block is associated with diminished levels of relevant mRNAs. However, degradation of IκB and NF-κB activation remained unaffected by PUFA treatment. Cells and Fatty Acid Treatment—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats obtained from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) and depleted from T cells by sheep erythrocyte rosetting. For DC differentiation, 5 × 105 cells/ml were incubated for 5–7 days in human serum albumin-containing X-Vivo 10 medium (Cambrex Bio Science, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 50 ng/ml (555 international units/ml) GM-CSF (Leucomax, Aesca, Traiskirchen, Austria) and 10 ng/ml IL-4 (Specific activity > 4 × 106 international units/mg, Strathmann Biotec, Hannover, Germany). Serum-free conditions were generally chosen to avoid significant amounts of variable serum fatty acids, and such DCs have been shown to be functionally similar to those differentiated in serum-supplemented media (16.Lyakh L.A.

Experiments were additionally performed in presence of 1 and 10% FCS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) during the activation period, which did not influence the inhibitory effects of PUFAs (data not shown). Palmitic acid (PA, C16:0), oleic acid (OA, C18:1(n-9)), arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4(n-6)), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EA, C20:5(n-3), all Sigma) of highest available quality were added from 10 mm stocks in ethanol to prewarmed X-Vivo 10. The medium was mixed for 1 h to allow binding of fatty acids to albumin prior to addition to cells at indicated concentrations. Solubilization of added fatty acids was confirmed by GC-MS analysis of medium after high speed centrifugation revealing a recovery of >90% of added fatty acids. The fatty acid concentration of the medium without fatty acid supplementation was 15 μm of which 70, 17, and 13% were saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated, respectively (data not shown). The antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, Sigma, Ref. 20.Gavino V.C. Miller J.S. Ikharebha S.O. Milo G.E. Cornwell D.G. J.

The nonspecific inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2, indomethacin (Sigma) was used at 10 μm, the COX-1 and 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitor eicosatetraynoic acid (Sigma) was used at 1 μm, and 5-LOX inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (Calbiochem) at 0.5 μm. Neither treatment affected harvested cell numbers and viability as detected with trypan blue exclusion and propidium iodide staining. Cytokine Production and Cell Surface Marker Expression—Secreted cytokines were measured in cell-free supernatants by sandwich ELISA using matched-pair antibodies and human recombinant standards (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cell surface proteins were stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD40 (Immunotech, Marseille, France), FITC-conjugated anti-HLA-DR, and anti-CD83, and PE-labeled anti-CD80, anti-CD86, and anti-MR (all BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD). Stimulation of T Cells—For assessment of the stimulatory capacity of fatty acid-treated DCs, irradiated (3000 rad, 137Cs source) DCs as stimulator cells were added at increasing cell numbers to 1 × 105 allogeneic T cells in 96-well culture plates in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (total volume, 200 μl/well). After 5 days, cells were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) for 18 h. Cells were harvested on Topcount glass fiber filters (Packard, Meriden, CT), and radioactivity was determined using a microplate scintillation counter (Packard). T cell proliferation was expressed as mean cpm of triplicate cultures. Supernatants from cocultures were obtained 48 h after culture initiation and analyzed for T cell cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ)by sandwich ELISA (Abs from R&D Systems). Analysis of Membrane Fatty Acid Composition—Membrane purification and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were performed essentially as described in Ref. 21.Stulnig T.M. Huber J.

Briefly, cells were washed, swollen in hypotonic buffer (42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) in the presence of protease inhibitors, and mechanically broken. Membranes were pelleted from postnuclear supernatants by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were freeze-dried overnight before addition of 2 ml of methanol (Merck)/benzene (Riedel-de Haën, Seelze, Germany), 4:1 (v/v), including heptadecanoic acid as internal standard. 200 μl of acetyl chloride (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) were added and methanolysis performed by incubation for 60 min at 100 °C under continuous stirring. Fatty acid methyl esters were separated and detected by chromatography on a DB-23 (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) and electron-impact ionization mass spectroscopy. Fatty acid methyl esters of highest available quality (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) were used as standards. Early Signal Transduction—For biochemical analyses, cells were harvested and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml. After stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS for 15–45 min reactions were stopped by addition of ice-cold washing buffer. Cells were pelleted by short centrifugation (12,000 × g for 20 s) and lysed on ice for 30 min in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), phosphatase (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA), and protease inhibitors. Nuclei were removed by short centrifugation. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The following Abs were used for Western blotting: anti-phospho-Akt (BioVision, Mountain View, CA), anti-phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-IκB-α (Calbiochem), anti-IRAK-1, and anti-p38 (both Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Antigens were detected by horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescence was generated by BM chemiluminescence substrate (Roche Applied Science) and quantified on a Lumi-Imager (Roche Applied Science). For intracellular analyses of protein phosphorylation, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained using a kit (Fix and Perm, An der Grub, Kaumberg, Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by flow cytometric analysis. Anti-phospho-p38 and anti-phospho-p42/44 MAPK (Erk-1, -2) rabbit polyclonal Abs, and anti-phospho-JNK and anti-phospho-c-Jun mouse monoclonal Abs were obtained from Cell Signaling. Secondary Alexa Fluor® 488- and PE-labeled Abs were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). NF-κB Activation—NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). DCs were activated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 70 min or left unstimulated in presence of 1% fetal calf serum. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (22.Johnson D.R. Levanat S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 190-192PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides resembling the consensus binding site for NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and CRE (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts (2 μg of protein) were incubated with 120,000 cpm labeled probe in the presence of 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 20 min. This mixture was separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer at pH 8.5. Control experiments to verify the obtained shifted band to be specific for NF-κB, were performed as described (23.Stuhlmeier K.M. Tarn C. Csizmadia V. Bach F.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24.Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). For specific or nonspecific competition, 5 pmol of unlabeled NF-κB or double-stranded CRE oligonucleotides were used, respectively. For assessing NF-κB transcriptional activity, cells were transiently transfected with a NF-κB firefly luciferase reporter construct (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) plus a constitutive Renilla luciferase expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) applying the Nucleofection® technology for hard-to-transfect cells using the appropriate kit (both Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, cells were stimulated for 6 h with 100 ng/ml LPS. Luminescence was detected applying dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as described (25.Zeyda M. Szekeres A.B. Saemann M.D. Geyeregger R. Stockinger H. Zlabinger G.J. Waldhäusl W. Stulnig T.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6033-6039Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To quantify NF-κB activation firefly luciferase light units were divided by Renilla luciferase light units and related to the ratio obtained from samples transfected with Renilla luciferase only. Luminescence from Renilla luciferase was similar in all investigated samples indicating comparable transfection efficiency (not shown). Quantitation of Specific mRNA—Total RNA of fatty acid-treated DCs, stimulated for 4 to 8 h with 100 ng/ml LPS, was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed by Superscript II (Invitrogen) using random hexamer priming. Expression of TNF-α, IL-12, COX-2, and CD40 mRNAs was quantitated and normalized to 18 S RNA using Taqman Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Analyses of Prostanoid Synthesis—DCs were differentiated, treated with fatty acids, and stimulated with LPS for 48 h as described above. To some cultures no IL-4 was added to obtain macrophage-like cells that are not suppressed in phospholipase A2 activity (26.Zelle-Rieser C. Ramoner R. Artner-Dworzak E. Casari A. Bartsch G. Thurnher M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, 50 μm AA was included in indicated cultures for the last 40 h of LPS stimulation to bypass phospholipase A2 activity. Following stimulation, cell-free supernatants were harvested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. After addition of deuterated prostaglandin (PG)E2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as internal standard and BHT the samples were extracted using diisopropylether. The organic phase was evaporated at room temperature after addition of Me2SO. Samples were separated by HPLC on a Luna phenylhexyl column (2 × 150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and detected in MRM-mode using negative electrospray ionization (Sciex API 4000). Calibration was linear in the range of interest (50 pg/ml to 20 ng/ml for PGE2 and 150 pg/ml to 20 ng/ml for PGE3). Quality control samples were prepared in medium with or without supplemented AA. Precision was better than 15%. Statistics—Data are presented in means ± S.E. Comparisons were performed by two-tail unpaired Student's t test and a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PUFAs Affect DC Differentiation and Function—DC surface molecule expression and cytokine production are hallmarks of DC differentiation and activation. To elucidate PUFA effects on these events, isolated human monocytes were differentiated to DCs in the presence of 20 μm of a variety of fatty acids. DCs treated with saturated PA and monounsaturated OA did not differ in any investigated surface molecule expression from cells cultivated in medium with or without addition of solvent (EtOH, 0.2%, v/v, Fig. 1). In PUFA-treated DCs expression of HLA-DR was not altered, while CD40, CD80, and MR expression was reduced by about 50%, irrespective of whether the n-6 PUFA AA or the n-3 PUFA EA was used (Fig. 1). Expression of CD86 tended to be increased in PUFA-treated DCs, but this increase failed to reach statistical significance. Following activation with LPS for 2 days, PUFA-treated DCs completely failed to up-regulate the investigated surface molecules CD40, CD80, CD83, and CD86 (Fig. 2, A and B). The antioxidant BHT had no effect on surface marker expression nor did BHT affect the inhibitory effects of PUFAs even when PUFA were present at only suboptimal concentrations (10 μm) to increase the likelihood to detect possible antioxidant effects (Fig. 2C). This result rules out that PUFA effects are due to generation of lipid free radicals during DC culture. Thus, PUFA treatment leads to moderately altered molecule expression in unstimulated DCs, whereas expression of T cell costimulatory molecules was severely impaired in LPS-activated DCs. In parallel with impaired surface molecule expression, TNF-α and IL-12p40 production of LPS-stimulated DCs treated with either PUFA (AA or EA) was drastically reduced compared with cells treated with PA or OA (Fig. 3A). PUFAs inhibited cytokine secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, the antioxidant BHT by itself had a minor inhibitory effect on DC cytokine production, but did not interfere with the strong inhibitory effects of PUFAs indicating that lipid oxidation is not responsible for these PUFA effects. To test whether PUFAs also affect stimulation of T cells, we performed mixed leukocyte reactions employing DCs as APCs that were differentiated and subsequently activated with LPS (or left unstimulated) in the presence of various fatty acids. When unstimulated DCs were used as stimulators, PUFA-treated DCs showed a tendency to stimulate T cells weaker than cells treated with saturated PA or monounsaturated OA (Fig. 4A, left panel). However, PUFA treatment completely blunted the LPS-induced increase in T cell stimulatory potency resulting in significant inhibition compared with cells treated with saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 4A, right panel). Furthermore, IL-2 and IFN-γ production of T cells stimulated with LPS-stimulated DCs was markedly and significantly inhibited when DCs were treated with PUFAs (AA or EA), compared with PA (Fig. 4B). These data show that PUFAs of the n-3 and n-6 family strongly influence both DC phenotype and function. PUFA Treatment Leads to Altered Membrane Lipid Composition of Human Monocyte-derived DCs—Previous studies showed that PUFA treatment alters T cell membrane lipid composition in vitro and in vivo (21.Stulnig T.M.

Hence, we investigated whether also DCs incorporate exogenous PUFAs into cell membranes leading to altered membrane lipid composition. Membranes of DCs differentiated in presence of 20 μm saturated PA (C16:0), monounsaturated OA (C18:1(n-9)), and polyunsaturated AA (C20:4(n-6)) and EA (C20:5(n-3)), or the solvent EtOH was analyzed by GC-MS. The results summarized in Table I show that DC membranes were enriched in the supplemented unsaturated fatty acid as well as the expected elongation products. In case of AA and EA treatment, enrichment of membrane PUFA was accompanied by a marked increase of the unsaturation index compared with PA.Table IModification of DC membrane fatty acid composition by PUFAs Human DCs were differentiated in the presence of 20 μm of saturated PA, monounsaturated OA, and polyunsaturated AA and EA, or EtOH as solvent control.

Quantitation of mRNA revealed that the reduced levels of secreted TNF-α and IL-12, as well as decreased CD40 surface expression, were related to diminished mRNA expression (Fig. 5). The reduction was particularly pronounced for IL-12p40 mRNA amount, which was inhibited by 90 and 98% after 4 h and 8 h of stimulation, respectively, in PUFA (AA, EA)-treated cells compared with PA-treated cells. The level of TNF-α mRNA was decreased by about 70% at both time points (Fig. 5). CD40 mRNA levels were least affected by PUFAs with a reduction of about 50% detectable after 4 h of stimulation (Fig. 5). Also expression of mRNA for COX-2, the key enzyme of induced eicosanoid synthesis, was inhibited by more than 80% at both time points. Surprisingly, early LPS-induced signaling events such as IRAK degradation and phosphorylation of Akt and p38 were not altered in DCs treated with polyunsaturated AA and EA (Fig. 6A). Degradation of IκB, crucial for nuclear translocation of NF-κB, was also not affected by PUFAs (Fig. 6A). Also phosphorylation of MAP kinases ERK and JNK, as well as the JNK substrate c-Jun was not significantly affected by PUFA-treatment (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, we determined DNA binding of NF-κB to its consensus response element, a correlative of NF-κB activation, by EMSA. In DCs differentiated in the presence of AA or EA, LPS-stimulated DNA binding of NF-κB was comparable to that of PA-treated cells (Fig. 6C). To test the activity of NF-κB, we applied a luciferase reporter system. A high basal NF-κB activity was found in reporter-transfected DCs that was somewhat higher in PUFA-treated compared with PA-treated DCs (Fig. 6D). However, independently of fatty acid treatment, LPS stimulation increased NF-κB activity ∼2-fold independently of fatty acid treatment (Fig. 6D). Thus, PUFAs affect LPS-induced DC cytokine mRNA expression levels without interfering with well known early signaling events and NF-κB activation. PUFA Treatment of DCs Post-differentiation Affects DC Function and Responsiveness to LPS Independently of Early LPS Signaling—To investigate whether PUFAs affect also fully differentiated DCs, or if the effect of PUFAs is restricted to the differentiation period, DCs were differentiated without addition of fatty acids to the culture for 5–7 days. Subsequently, 50 μm of fatty acids were added for 24 h before cells were stimulated with LPS for another 48 h. Alike DCs differentiated in presence of PUFAs, short-term PUFA-treated DCs were markedly inhibited in LPS-induced expression of CD40, while basal CD86 expression was increased (Fig. 7A).

MAN1 has an exposed LEM domain-containing N-terminal region (“MAN1-N”), two transmembrane domains, and an exposed C-terminal domain (“MAN1-C”). Many regions of human MAN1 are homologous to emerin, a LEM domain nuclear protein, loss of which causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). To test the hypothesis that MAN1 function might overlap with emerin, we tested different polypeptide fragments of MAN1 for binding to selected partners of emerin. Our findings support this hypothesis. Blot overlay assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that MAN1-C binds the transcription regulators GCL, Btf, and barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). BAF binding to this region, which has no LEM domain, was notable. Sequence alignments identified a potential BAF-binding motif, characterized by the conserved residues Ser-Arg-Val, in MAN1-C and two other BAF-binding proteins. The other region, MAN1-N, bound directly to BAF, lamin A, and lamin B1, supporting functional overlap with emerin. Unexpectedly, three independent assays showed that MAN1-N also bound directly to emerin. Proposed MAN1-emerin complexes are discussed in the context of EDMD disease mechanisms and potential in vivo functions.

Proposed MAN1-emerin complexes are discussed in the context of EDMD disease mechanisms and potential in vivo functions. The “LEM domain” is a conserved ∼40-residue folded motif that defines a family of nuclear proteins (1.Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M.

Biol. 2004; 56: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar). Vertebrate family members include LAP2β, emerin, and MAN1 at the nuclear inner membrane and LAP2α in the nuclear interior (3.Gruenbaum Y. Margalit A. Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Wilson K.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) plus several uncharacterized human proteins provisionally named LEM2, LEM3, LEM4, and LEM5 (2.Lee K.K. Wilson K.L. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 2004; 56: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar). The only known function of the LEM domain is to bind directly to a conserved chromatin protein, barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) 1The abbreviations used are: BAF, barrier-to-autointegration factor; EDMD, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type. (4.Segura-Totten M. Wilson K.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). LEM domain proteins and BAF are conserved among multicellular animal eukaryotes but absent from yeast and plants. All characterized LEM domain proteins bind to nuclear intermediate filament proteins named lamins (5.Goldman R.D. Gruenbaum Y. Moir R.D. Shumaker D.K. Spann T.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In humans, loss of emerin or dominant mutations in A-type lamins cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) (6.Bengtsson L. Wilson K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 7.Mounkes L. Kozlov S. Burke B. Stewart C.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). EDMD is characterized by early contractures of the Achilles, elbow, and neck tendons, slow degeneration of skeletal muscles, and conduction system defects in the heart that can be fatal. Emerin itself is not essential for viability in either humans or Caenorhabditis elegans (8.Gruenbaum Y. Lee K.K. Liu J. Cohen M. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 923-929PubMed Google Scholar). However, in C. elegans the function of Ce-emerin overlaps with “Ce-MAN1” (9.Liu J. Lee K.K. Segura-Totten M. Neufeld E. Wilson K.L. Gruenbaum Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4598-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the only other membrane-anchored LEM domain protein in C. elegans, which is homologous to human MAN1 but orthologous to human LEM2 (see below). Thus, an understanding of the EDMD disease mechanism will require knowing which functions of human emerin are unique and which overlap with MAN1 or other LEM domain proteins. MAN1 was first identified by autoantibodies from a patient with collagen vascular disease (1.Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). MAN1 localizes to the nuclear inner membrane and has two transmembrane domains, exposing both the N- and C-terminal domains (MAN1-N and MAN1-C, respectively) to the nucleoplasm (10.Wu W. Lin F. Worman H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to MAN1 (911 residues), the human genome also encodes an uncharacterized homologous protein named LEM2 (503 residues, Fig. 1). The LEM domain (Fig. 1, hatched) and three other regions (Fig. 1, shaded as A, C, and D) are conserved between human MAN1 and human LEM2. Domain D (105 residues) in the membrane-proximal half of MAN1-C is 54% identical between MAN1 and human LEM2. Domain A (170 residues) and luminal domain C (131 residues) are conserved to lesser extents. Because human LEM2 and the C. elegans lem-2 gene product (Ce-MAN1 protein) are similar in length (503 and 500 residues, respectively) and both lack domains B and E (apparently unique to human MAN1), we concluded that Ce-MAN1 is orthologous to human LEM2, not human MAN1 as originally thought. Thus, the functional overlap between Ce-emerin and Ce-MAN1 in C. elegans (shared binding to Ce-lamin and Ce-BAF and synthetic lethality in ∼100-cell embryos) (9.Liu J. Lee K.K. Segura-Totten M. Neufeld E. Wilson K.L. Gruenbaum Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4598-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) predicts similar overlap between human emerin, LEM2, and possibly MAN1. However, the possibility of functional overlap between human emerin and human MAN1 had not been tested. In Xenopus embryos, the proposed MAN1 alleles named XMAN1 and SANE (Smad1 antagonistic effector) regulate dorsal-ventral axis determination (3.Gruenbaum Y. Margalit A. Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 428-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of XMAN1 antagonizes signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins by binding directly to Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8, which are downstream effectors of signal transduction pathways triggered when BMP-4 binds its receptor at the plasma membrane (3.Gruenbaum Y. Margalit A. Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Wilson K.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). These results suggest XMAN1 inhibits Smad-dependent changes in gene expression (11.Osada S. Ohmori S.Y. Taira M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1783-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Similar roles are proposed for human MAN1, which binds Smads and regulates signaling downstream of the bone morphogenetic proteins and other members of the transforming growth factor β super-family of proteins (13.Hellemans J.

Our results show that human emerin and MAN1 have extensive functional overlap and unexpectedly revealed direct binding between emerin and MAN1, implicating MAN1 as functionally relevant to the EDMD disease mechanism. Expression and Purification of MAN1-C and Antibody Production—A cDNA encoding the MAN1-C polypeptide (residues 650–910) was PCR-amplified from a HeLa cell cDNA library using forward (5′-GCC TCG AGC GTT ACA TGA AAT ATC GAT GG-3′) and reverse (5′-GCC TCG AGT CAG GAA CTT CCT TGA GAA TT-3′) primers. The resulting 805-bp fragment was digested with XhoI and cloned into the XhoI sites in the pET15b vector (Novagen). After sequence verification, the construct was transformed into E. coli strain BLR(DE3)pLysSpRARE. Transformed cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6, and MAN1-C expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were pelleted at 5,500 × g and resuspended in sonication buffer (SB; 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) plus phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) and pepstatin (1 μg/ml). Cells were disrupted by pulse sonication on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads equilibrated with SB. The column was washed with 10 ml of SB containing 10 mm imidazole, and bound proteins were eluted in SB containing 200 mm imidazole. Purified MAN1-C polypeptide was used as an antigen to generate rat serum 4279 against MAN1-C (Covance, Inc., Denver, PA). Blot Overlay Assays—His-tagged lamin, emerin, MAN1-LEM, and MAN1-C polypeptides were expressed in E. coli (strain BLR(DE3)pLysSpRARE) and either purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose or used as crude bacterial lysates. Purified proteins (lamins, MAN1-C) or crude bacterial lysates (emerin, MAN1-LEM) were resolved on SDS-PAGE (10%) gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell Bioscience), and blocked for 1 h in blot rinse buffer (BRB; 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were then washed twice (5 min each) in BRB at 22–24 °C and incubated overnight with 20 μCi of 35S-labeled probe protein diluted 1:200 into BRB containing 0.1% fetal calf serum (final volume, 3 ml). 35S-Labeled probes were synthesized in eukaryotic (rabbit) coupled transcription/translation extracts (Promega, Madison,WI) as described (15.Mansharamani M. Graham D.R. Monie D. Lee K.K. Hildreth J.E. Siliciano R.F. Wilson K.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13084-13092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Blots were washed twice in BRB, dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Microtiter Assays—Purified recombinant His-tagged prelamin A and lamin B1, BAF, or MAN1-C (2 μg/well) or BSA (as negative control) were adsorbed to microtiter wells overnight at 4 °C as described (15.Mansharamani M. Graham D.R. Monie D. Lee K.K. Hildreth J.E. Siliciano R.F. Wilson K.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13084-13092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in binding buffer (BB; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA). BB containing 3% BSA was then added to block nonspecific binding sites. Wells were not allowed to dry. A 35S-labeled probe (GCL, Btf, BAF, or MAN1 polypeptides) synthesized as described above was added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Each experiment (n = 3–4) was done in triplicate. After three washes with BB, bound proteins were eluted with 5% SDS and quantified by scintillation. Affinity Bead Assays—Purified recombinant human emerin (residues 1–222) and MAN1-C (residues 650–910) were covalently linked to Affi-Gel-10 beads and Affi-Gel-15 beads (Bio-Rad), respectively, per manufacturer's instructions. Beads were washed three times in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Emerin beads were incubated with HeLa cell lysates (1 μg of protein) overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with IP buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling samples in 2× SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using rat anti-MAN1 polyclonal serum 4279 at 1:1000 dilution. MAN1-C beads were incubated with 35S-labeled GCL (500,000 counts) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with IP buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling samples in 2× SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film. The aligned amino acid sequences of human MAN1 and emerin revealed the conserved LEM domain as expected (Fig. 2A, boxed) plus a region (residues 185–385) homologous to the lamin-binding region in emerin (Fig. 2A, underlined) (16.Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three regions appeared unique to MAN1: residues 50–184, residues 386–548, and the C-terminal domain (Fig. 2, A and B). For further study, we focused on the full N terminus (designated MAN1-N), the N terminus minus the LEM domain (NΔLEM), the LEM domain alone (LEM), the potential lamin-binding fragment (MAN1-mid), and the entire C-terminal domain (MAN1-C) as diagrammed in Fig. 2B. Each polypeptide was either expressed in bacteria (MAN1-C) or synthesized and 35S-labeled in eukaryotic transcription-translation extracts (see “Materials and Methods”) for the binding studies below. MAN1 Binds the Globular Tails of Lamins A and B1— Lamins anchor and retain many proteins at the nuclear inner membrane (17.Zastrow M.S. Vlcek S. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The MAN1-N polypeptide is both necessary and sufficient to localize MAN1 at the nuclear envelope in mammalian cells (10.Wu W. Lin F. Worman H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and includes the region similar to the lamin-binding domain of emerin, suggesting MAN1-N might bind lamin(s). We therefore tested the MAN1-N, MAN1-mid, and LEM polypeptides for binding to lamins, specifically the C-terminal tail domains of lamin B1 and prelamin A. Purified recombinant lamin tails (or BSA as a negative control) were immobilized in microtiter wells and probed with 25 pmol of 35S-labeled MAN1-N, 35S-labeled MAN1-mid, or 35S-labeled LEM domain (as a negative control). The LEM domain did not bind significantly to lamins as expected (Fig. 3A, LEM). MAN1-N bound both the prelamin A and lamin B1 tails at levels significantly above the BSA background (Fig. 3A, N). We concluded that human MAN1 can bind directly to both A- and B-type lamins in vitro via the lamin tail domain. The MAN1-mid fragment was insufficient to bind lamins above the BSA background (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the flanking regions in MAN1-N are required for this interaction. To test lamin binding by an independent method, we resolved the lamin tails by SDS-PAGE; they were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to membranes and probed with 35S-labeled MAN1-N (Fig. 3B). As controls, each gel included lysates from bacteria expressing either wild-type (WT) emerin (residues 1–222; Fig. 3B) or a disease-causing emerin mutant (Δ95) that lacks residues 95–99 and fails to bind lamins (16.Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled MAN1-N did not bind the emerin mutant Δ95 but recognized both lamin tails, particularly the B1 tail (Fig. 3B), independently confirming that MAN1 binds directly to both A- and B-type lamins. Surprisingly, MAN1-N also specifically recognized wild-type emerin (Fig. 3B); this interaction was investigated further below (see Fig. 6).Fig. 6MAN1 binds emerin directly. A, purified recombinant human emerin (Em, residues 1–222) or BSA was coupled to Affi-Gel beads and incubated with protein lysates from HeLa cells. Pellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and immunoblotted using the anti-MAN1 serum 4279. B, emerin beads or BSA beads were incubated with 35S-labeled MAN1-N or 35S-labeled BAF and washed; bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The autoradiogram is shown. Asterisk indicates presumed breakdown product of 35S-labeled MAN1-N. C, crude lysates from bacteria expressing either WT or mutant emerin proteins (numbered as described in Ref. 19.Holaska J.M. Lee K.K. Kowalski A.K. Wilson K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6969-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with 35S-labeled MAN1-N. For each autoradiogram, the corresponding Coomassiestained gel is shown to control for the amount of recombinant emerin protein in each lane. Asterisks indicate EDMD disease-causing mutations in emerin. D, schematic diagram of human emerin (top). The LEM domain and transmembrane (TM) domain are indicated.

We therefore tested MAN1 for direct binding to GCL in pulldown assays, focusing on the C-terminal region of MAN1, which binds Smad proteins (see the Introduction). 35S-Labeled GCL was incubated with recombinant MAN1-C conjugated to Affi-Gel beads or BSA-conjugated beads as the negative control. The MAN1-C beads bound GCL significantly above the BSA background (Fig. 4A). The equilibrium binding affinity between MAN1-C and GCL was measured in microtiter assays in which immobilized recombinant MAN1-C (3.18 pmol) was probed with increasing concentrations of 35S-labeled GCL (Fig. 4B, see “Materials and Methods”). Wells containing immobilized BSA served as negative controls and were subtracted to yield the curve shown in Fig. 4B. The affinity of MAN1-C for recombinant GCL in this assay averaged 364 nm (range 211–492 nm, n = 4; 492 nm curve shown in Fig. 4B), about 12-fold weaker than the affinity of emerin for GCL (30 nm, range 20–60 nm) (19.Holaska J.M. Lee K.K. Kowalski A.K. Wilson K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6969-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To test possible binding to Btf, recombinant purified MAN1-C (1 μg) or lysates from bacteria expressing either wild-type emerin (positive control) or the LEM domain of MAN1 (negative control) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 4C, lower panel) or transferred to membranes and probed with 35S-labeled Btf (Fig. 4C, upper panel). 35S-Labeled Btf recognized MAN1-C and wild-type emerin but not the LEM domain (Fig. 4C, upper panel). Microtiter assays showed MAN1-C bound Btf with an equilibrium affinity of 211 nm (range 124–312 nm, n = 3; Fig. 4D). Interestingly, MAN1-C (this work) and emerin (18.Haraguchi T. Holaska J.M. Yamane M. Koujin T. Hashiguchi N. Mori C. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) bind Btf with comparably high affinities of 211 and 100 nm, respectively. Collectively, these findings showed that two emerin-binding transcription regulators (GCL and Btf) can also bind MAN1, strongly supporting the “overlapping functions” model. Because the C-terminal region of MAN1 binds directly to three different gene regulatory proteins (GCL and Btf shown here and Smads as shown by others (3.Gruenbaum Y. Margalit A. Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Wilson K.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar)), we concluded that the C-terminal domain of MAN1 has a general role in gene regulation. Furthermore Btf binding to MAN1 might be specifically relevant to EDMD disease (see “Discussion”). The N- and C-terminal Regions of MAN1 Each Bind BAF—We used microtiter assays to test MAN1 for binding to BAF. Recombinant BAF (10 pmol) or BSA (as a negative control) were immobilized in microtiter wells and incubated with equimolar amounts of each 35S-labeled MAN1 polypeptide. The “mid” fragment did not bind significantly above the BSA background as expected (Fig. 5A). Also as expected, the LEM domain and MAN1-N each bound BAF at levels ∼4-fold above the background binding to BSA-containing wells (Fig. 5A, LEM and N, respectively). The LEM domain was largely responsible for the BAF binding activity of MAN1-N because the NΔLEM signal was reduced to less than 2-fold above background (Fig. 5A, NΔLEM). Interestingly, MAN1-C bound BAF at levels ∼4.8-fold above background (Fig. 5A, C), comparable with the LEM domain. Thus, BAF binds independently to two distinct functional domains of MAN1: the LEM domain and the “gene regulatory” C-terminal domain. We therefore considered the possibility that BAF might have two distinct interaction surfaces for MAN1. To map BAF residues important for binding to MAN1-C, we tested MAN1-C binding to 19 BAF missense mutants previously characterized for their effects on binding to emerin (the LEM domain), DNA (20.Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.K. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21.Harris D. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39671-39677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and histones. 2R. Montes de Oca, K. K. Lee, and K. L. Wilson, submitted for publication. MAN1-C or BSA was immobilized on microtiter wells and probed with each 35S-labeled BAF mutant or wild-type BAF. Ten BAF missense mutants (K6A, K6E, R8E, D9A, G25E, I26A, L46E, G47E, V51E, and W62A) had significantly reduced binding to MAN1-C (Fig. 5B). The remaining mutants bound MAN1-C at least 50% as well as wild-type BAF. The positions of wild-type BAF residues implicated in MAN1-C binding were mapped on the atomic structure of the BAF dimer (22.Umland T.C. Wei S.-Q. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9130-9138Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C). Viewed from the “front” (Fig. 5C, top row), BAF residues critical for binding MAN1-C clustered in two regions: the top “shoulders” (green wild-type residues Lys-6, Arg-8, Asp-9, Gly-25, Ile-26) and the bottom surface of the dimer (green wild-type residues Val-51 and Trp-62). Residues Leu-46 and Gly-47, buried at the dimer interface, are not surface-exposed in the crystal structure and are therefore not shown. Residue Lys-53, which is critical for BAF binding to the LEM domain of emerin (20.Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.K. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), was not essential for BAF binding to MAN1-C; mutant K53A had wild-type binding activity, and K53E reduced binding by ∼50% (shown in blue, Fig. 5C). Residues Lys-6, Arg-8, and Asp-9 were essential to bind MAN1-C but are not essential to bind the LEM domain in emerin (20.Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.K. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mutation P14A slightly but consistently enhanced binding to MAN1-C, but we do not know if this is significant (Fig. 5C, red residue). Thus, BAF may “see” the LEM and C-terminal domains of MAN1 in distinct ways (see “Discussion”). MAN1-C has no LEM domain. We therefore hypothesized that BAF might recognize a novel motif conserved in other BAF-binding proteins that lack LEM domains, such as Crx (and related homeodomain transcription activators (23.Chen S.

Wilson, submitted for publication. Pairwise alignments of MAN1-C with Crx and histone H1.1 revealed one region comprising residues 728–735 (SRVrtetR) in MAN1 (Fig. 5D). This SRV motif was conserved in Crx and H1.1 as the consensus sequence S(R/K)Vx(t/v)x(t/f)(R/K). We propose that this motif might mediate binding to BAF (see “Discussion”). MAN1 Binds Directly to Emerin—To explore possible direct binding between emerin and MAN1, we first used purified recombinant wild-type emerin (residues 1–222) covalently linked to Affi-Gel-10 beads or BSA-linked beads to affinity-purify proteins from HeLa cell lysates. Beads were incubated overnight with HeLa cell lysates and then washed and pelleted. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with immune serum 4279 against human MAN1 (Fig. 6A; see “Materials and Methods”). Endogenous MAN1 has a predicted mass of 100 kDa but migrates on gels at ∼80 kDa (1.Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 10.Wu W. Lin F. Worman H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serum 4279 antibodies detected endogenous MAN1 bound specifically to emerin beads but not BSA beads (Fig. 6A), consistent with the direct binding of MAN1 to emerin seen in blot overlays (Fig. 3B). Direct binding was further tested using emerin or BSA beads incubated with 35S-labeled MAN1-N or wild-type 35S-labeled BAF as the positive control. Both MAN1-N and BAF bound to emerin beads but not BSA beads (Fig. 6B). Based on these three independent assays (blot overlay in Fig. 3B, affinity purification from HeLa cell lysates in Fig. 6A, and radiolabeled proteins in Fig. 6B) we concluded that MAN1-N binds directly to emerin in vitro. The domains in emerin required to bind other partners (BAF, lamin A, transcription repressors, and actin) were previously mapped using a collection of Ala substitution mutations or selected EDMD disease-causing mutations in emerin (16.Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Haraguchi T. Holaska J.M. Yamane M. Koujin T. Hashiguchi N. Mori C.

We used these mutants in blot overlay experiments to map the MAN1-binding region(s) in emerin. Lysates from bacteria expressing wild-type or mutant emerin (residues 1–222) were resolved in duplicate SDS-PAGE gels and either stained with Coomassie Blue to control for protein loading or transferred to membranes and probed with 35S-labeled MAN1-N (Fig. 6C). MAN1-N recognized emerin mutants m11, 3Mutations that start with “m” designate a cluster of Ala substitution mutations; see Ref. 19.Holaska J.M. Lee K.K. Kowalski A.K. Wilson K.L. J. Biol.

Binding was reduced or undetectable to two other disease-causing mutants Δ95 and Q133H and the Ala substitution mutants m45A, m45E, m61, m70, m76, m112, m122, m145, m151, m161, m164, m175, m179, m192, m196, m198, m206, m207, m214, and m217 (Fig. 6C). These results are mapped schematically in Fig. 6D relative to the previously tested binding partners BAF, lamin A, GCL, Btf, and actin. The proposed MAN1-binding region encompassed most of emerin outside the LEM domain, similar to the actin-binding region in emerin. The ability of BAF to bind LEM domains is well established, and we show here that MAN1 is no exception. We further report that BAF also binds the C-terminal domain of MAN1. C-terminal binding involves a number of surface residues in BAF not involved in binding the LEM domain (20.Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.K. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The wild-type BAF residues Lys-6, Arg-8, Asp-9, Gly-25, and Ile-26 (which cluster on the top and “shoulders” of the BAF dimer) and Val-51 and Trp-62 (on the bottom surface) appear critical to bind MAN1-C. In contrast, the BAF residues Lys-6 and Arg-8 are not essential to bind the LEM domain in emerin (20.Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.K. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similarly, Lys-53, which is critical to bind LEM domains, is not essential for MAN1-C. However, the D9A mutation reduces binding to both. Therefore BAF may see the LEM domain and C-terminal region in MAN1 in overlapping but distinct ways. BAF was previously shown in blot overlay assays to bind the C-terminal domain of the C. elegans lem-2 gene product (Ce-MAN1) (9.Liu J. Lee K.K. Segura-Totten M. Neufeld E. Wilson K.L. Gruenbaum Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4598-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Ce-MAN1 and its human ortholog, LEM2, both lack the MAN1-unique “domain E” (Fig. 1), suggesting BAF might recognize domain D, common to all three proteins. Importantly, we identified a motif, S(R/K)Vx(t/v)x(t/f)(R/K) that is conserved in MAN1-C and two unrelated proteins, Crx and histone H1.1, which also lack LEM domains but bind BAF. Crx is a homeodomain transcription activator; its SRV motif (residues 81–88) is located in the BAF- and DNA-binding region of Crx (residues 34–107) (24.Wang X. Xu S. Rivolta C. Li L.Y. Peng G.H. Swain P.K. Sung C.H. Swaroop A. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Chen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43288-43300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The E80A mutation in Crx, which alters a single residue flanking the SRV motif, disrupts Crx binding to BAF in vitro but does not disrupt Crx binding to DNA or Crx-activated gene expression (24.Wang X. Xu S. Rivolta C. Li L.Y. Peng G.H. Swain P.K. Sung C.H. Swaroop A. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Chen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43288-43300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The SRV motif in histone H1.1 (residues 124–131) is located within the minimal region required to bind BAF (residues 108–215).2 It is noteworthy that the SRV motif is also present in domain D, shared by Ce-MAN1 (data not shown) and human MAN1 (see Figs. 1 and 2A), which might account for the binding of Ce-MAN1 to BAF. We are currently mutating the SRV motif in MAN1-C to test its hypothetical role in binding to BAF. Regardless of motif, it is interesting to consider why BAF binds two different regions of MAN1. We speculate that BAF might either (a) bind each domain independently for different purposes or (b) bind simultaneously, bridging the two domains of MAN1 and possibly regulating MAN1 activity. Functional Overlap and Implications of Emerin-MAN1 Complexes—Our results strongly support the hypothesis that human MAN1 and emerin have overlapping functions. MAN1 and emerin interact in vitro with many of the same binding partners, including BAF, A- and B-type lamins, and the transcription regulators GCL and Btf. It will be interesting in the future to determine whether emerin, like MAN1, also binds Smad proteins. Understanding the limits of functional overlap, specifically partners that bind emerin but not MAN1, will require further analysis of additional emerging partners for emerin such as splicing factor YT521-B, actin, and nesprins (25.Wilkinson F.L.

Specifically, MAN1-C binds GCL more weakly than emerin (affinities of 364 and 30 nm, respectively). This difference might be meaningful in vivo, given the presence of competing partners with higher affinity for either emerin or MAN1 (see below). However, MAN1 and emerin have similar strong affinities for Btf (211 and 100 nm, respectively), a transcription regulator. Binding between Btf and emerin appears to be relevant to EDMD disease because the EDMD-causing missense mutation in emerin, S54F, selectively disrupts emerin binding to Btf but not GCL or other tested partners (18.Haraguchi T. Holaska J.M. Yamane M. Koujin T. Hashiguchi N. Mori C. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We are intrigued by the possibility that Btf might have even stronger affinity for joint emerin-MAN1 complexes. Our results predict that emerin and MAN1 can form functional complexes in vivo. Consistent with this idea, MAN1 and emerin are both expressed (detectable at the level of mRNA or protein) in essentially all tissues tested (1.Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L.

Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. J. Biol.

Direct support for the existence of emerin-MAN1 complexes comes from a recent analysis of native emerin-containing complexes purified from HeLa cells. 4J. M. Holaska and K. L. Wilson, unpublished observations. One 500-kDa complex includes emerin, MAN1, lamin A, and BAF, suggesting that supramolecular complexes containing both emerin and MAN1 exist in vivo. MAN1 is also present in at least two other emerin-containing complexes but is undetectable in proposed “architectural” complexes that contain emerin, actin, and spectrin 4J. M. Holaska and K. L. Wilson, unpublished observations. (26.Holaska J.M. Kowalski A.K. Wilson K.L. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E231Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The proposed co-binding of MAN1 and emerin has interesting implications for their in vivo functions. Their interaction may positively or negatively regulate binding to shared or unique partners in vivo and thus regulate multiple downstream pathways. For example, transcription regulators (GCL, Btf) might bind more tightly to emerin-MAN1 complexes than to either protein alone. Alternatively, transcription regulators such as GCL, which binds preferentially to emerin, might disassemble the complex and liberate MAN1 for other functions. A related possibility is that emerin might positively or negatively regulate MAN1 binding to Smads. In this case, loss of emerin might disrupt MAN1-dependent Smad signaling in EDMD patients. Notably, our work showed that the EDMD disease-causing mutations Δ95 and Q133H in emerin each abolished binding to MAN1. Although the Δ95 mutation disrupts binding to all of the partners of emerin (6.Bengtsson L. Wilson K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the Q133H mutation is noteworthy because it selectively abolishes binding to MAN1 (our work) and actin (26.Holaska J.M. Kowalski A.K. Wilson K.L. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E231Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) but no other tested partners in vitro. Future work must aim to understand (a) how interactions between MAN1 and emerin affect their in vivo functions and (b) whether MAN1-emerin interactions regulate the EDMD phenotype.

During mitosis, chromatin fibers are highly condensed to form metaphase chromosomes, which ensure equal segregation of replicated chromosomal DNA into the daughter cells. Despite >1 century of research on metaphase chromosomes, information regarding the higher order structure of metaphase chromosomes is limited, and it is still not clear which proteins are involved in further folding of the chromatin fiber into metaphase chromosomes. To obtain a global view of the chromosomal proteins, we performed proteome analyses on three types of isolated human metaphase chromosomes. We first show the results from comparative proteome analyses of two types of isolated human metaphase chromosomes that have been frequently used in biochemical and morphological analyses. 209 proteins were quantitatively identified and classified into six groups on the basis of their known interphase localization. Furthermore, a list of 107 proteins was obtained from the proteome analyses of highly purified metaphase chromosomes, the majority of which are essential for chromosome structure and function. Based on the information obtained on these proteins and on their localizations during mitosis as assessed by immunostaining, we present a four-layer model of metaphase chromosomes. According to this model, the chromosomal proteins have been newly classified into each of four groups: chromosome coating proteins, chromosome peripheral proteins, chromosome structural proteins, and chromosome fibrous proteins. This analysis represents the first compositional view of human metaphase chromosomes and provides a protein framework for future research on this topic.

Chromosome formation during mitosis ensures the equal and appropriate segregation of genomic information into daughter cells (1Sumner A.T. Chromosomes: Organization and Function. Blackwell Publishing Ltd., Oxford2003: 5-142Google Scholar). This surprisingly well organized process was first precisely described by Flemming in 1882 (2Flemming W. Zellsubstanz, Kern und Zelltheilung. Verlag Vogel, Leipzig, Germany1882Crossref Google Scholar), and its structure has been investigated by numerous researchers. A metaphase chromosome consists of two DNA molecules and chromosomal proteins that are further divided into histones and non-histone proteins (1Sumner A.T. Chromosomes: Organization and Function.

Several studies were also carried out to elucidate the vital role of non-histone proteins in chromosome structure and function. Laemmli and co-workers (9Lewis C.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) carried out pioneering work, and using electron microscopy in combination with extensive biochemical analyses, they suggested the existence of a proteinaceous chromosome scaffold to which the DNA is tethered in a loop formation based on their observation of histone-depleted chromosomes. Two proteins (topoisomerase IIα and SMC2) that constitute the scaffold were discovered through these studies (11Gasser S. Laroche T. Falquet J. Boy de la Tour E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol.

In addition, some specially localized proteins in centromeric and telomeric regions have been reported (21Masumoto H. Masukata H. Muro Y. Nozaki N. Okazaki T. J.

During the last decade, significant progress using mitotic extracts from frog eggs led to the identification of a condensin complex as an essential factor in chromosome condensation (24Hirano T.

Despite the extensive investigation on the chromosomal proteins in the past, a fundamental question remains still unanswered. What is the global protein composition of the chromosome? This situation originates from the experimental difficulty in isolating intact chromosomes in large quantity for protein analyses given that chromosomes are formed only in a short period during the mitotic stage of the whole cell cycle in a few dividing cells. To answer this question, the identity and localization of proteins constituting the chromosomes must be solved. Recent mechanical analyses of chromosomes using micromanipulators also raise questions regarding the scaffold model and would benefit from a list of the constituent proteins of metaphase chromosomes (26Poirier M. Eroglu S. Chatenay D. Marko J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Poirier M. Marko J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15393-15397Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported several isolation methods for human metaphase chromosomes in large quantities after cell cycle synchronization and preliminarily compared them with each other in terms of their morphologies and protein compositions (28Sone T.

In this study, we used comparative proteomics and localization analyses to form a complete view of the chromosome from the protein perspective. We performed proteome analyses on three types of isolated human metaphase chromosomes.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 11-12Google Scholar), were investigated in this study. Second, sucrose gradient (SG) chromosomes, purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC) of PA chromosomes, were prepared (29Uchiyama S. Kobayashi S. Takata H. Ishihara T. Sone T. Matsunaga S. Fukui K. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 107: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Spector D. Goldman R. Leinwamd L. Janssen K. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 49. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 11-12Google Scholar). The proteins extracted from these preparations were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Quantitative information on proteins with molecular masses <100 kDa was obtained by isoelectric focusing (IEF) and radical-free and highly reducing (RFHR) (29Uchiyama S. Kobayashi S. Takata H.

(Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretically separated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Finally, we prepared purified metaphase chromosomes, referred to as Percoll gradient (PG) chromosomes, which were purified by glycerol and Percoll density gradient centrifugation (9Lewis C. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1982; 29: 171-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 32Gasser S. Laemmli U.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the localizations of several representative proteins on the chromosomes were assessed by indirect immunostaining. The identified proteins were newly classified into four groups based on their compositional characterization and localization. Reagents for Proteome Analysis—Water was purified using a Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Digitonin was purchased from Sigma and EMD Biosciences. Water for in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry, acetonitrile, and acetic acid were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Trifluoroacetic acid, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and lysyl endopeptidase were purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Sequence-grade trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C were purchased from Roche. Proteins used for molecular mass references and IPG Buffer pH 4–7 and IPG Buffer pH 6–11 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Isolation of Human Metaphase Chromosomes—PA chromosomes were isolated from a synchronized human cell line (BALL-1) using a PA procedure according to previously published protocols (28Sone T. Iwano M. Kobayashi S. Ishihara T. Hori N. Takata H. Ushiki T. Uchiyama S. Fukui K. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2002; 65: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The PA chromosomes were diluted in PA buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 2 mm EDTA, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm spermine, and 0.5 mm spermidine) and collected by centrifugation at 1750 × g for 10 min. This washing procedure was repeated three times. Although chromosomes maintain their condensed structure with divalent cations such as Ca2+ or Mg2+ (30Spector D. Goldman R. Leinwamd L. Janssen K. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 49. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 11-12Google Scholar, 33Cole A. Theor. Biophys. 1967; 1: 305-375Google Scholar), PA was used in this study to avoid degradation of proteins and nucleic acids and to preserve the native chromosome structure (28Sone T. Iwano M. Kobayashi S. Ishihara T. Hori N. Takata H. Ushiki T. Uchiyama S. Fukui K. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2002; 65: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Spector D. Goldman R. Leinwamd L. Janssen K. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 49. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 11-12Google Scholar). SG chromosomes were prepared by subjecting PA chromosomes to SDGC. PA chromosomes were layered onto a linear 20–60% (w/v) sucrose gradient in PA buffer and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min in a JS-24.38 swinging rotor (Beckman Instruments). Fractions consisting of chromosomes with native morphology were assessed by optical microscopy following 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and were combined together. SG chromosomes were then collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min after dilution of sucrose with PA buffer. Isolated PA and SG chromosomes were stored at –80 °C in PA buffer containing 70% glycerol until used. As indicated in our previous study (29Uchiyama S. Kobayashi S. Takata H. Ishihara T. Sone T. Matsunaga S. Fukui K. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 107: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), synchronization by Colcemid treatment did not have a significant effect on the protein composition of the isolated chromosomes. For PG chromosome isolation, cell culture and synchronization of HeLa S3 cells were performed using the same procedures as in the SG chromosome preparation, except for the concentration of fetal calf serum (10% for BALL-1 cells and 5% for HeLa S3 cells). Isolation was carried out according to the method developed previously by Laemmli and co-workers (9Lewis C. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1982; 29: 171-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 32Gasser S. Laemmli U.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at 20 °C by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min and washed three times at 20 °C. The cells collected were hypotonically swollen in wash buffer (7.5 mm Tris, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm spermine, 0.25 mm spermidine, 1% thiodiglycol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 20 °C. Hereafter, unless stated otherwise, the procedures for PG chromosome isolation were performed at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (15 mm Tris, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1% thiodiglycol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Empigen) on ice using a homogenizer, and the chromosomes were readily released. The lysate was layered over the exponential glycerol gradients, which were spun in a JS-24.38 rotor for 5 min at 200 × g, followed by 15 min at 700 × g. Fractions containing dispersed metaphase chromosomes were placed on a 70% glycerol cushion and spun at 3000 × g for 15 min to recover chromosomes. Chromosomes partially purified by the procedures described above were stored at –20 °C in storage buffer (3.75 mm Tris, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 1% thiodiglycol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Empigen) containing 60% glycerol for further purification by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. The mixture of stored chromosomes and Percoll solution was gently homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 45,440 × g for 30 min in a JS-24.38 rotor. A band containing chromosomes located at a level that was one-fifth the length of the tube measured from the bottom (Fig. S1) was diluted 3-fold in isolation buffer (5 mm Tris, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm spermidine, 1% thiodiglycol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Empigen) and subsequently centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min to collect PG chromosomes. Extraction of Proteins from Isolated Chromosomes—For one-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis, isolated chromosomes were directly suspended and dissolved in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.005% bromophenol blue). For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, proteins were extracted from isolated chromosomes using the acetic acid extraction method described previously (29Uchiyama S. Kobayashi S. Takata H. Ishihara T. Sone T. Matsunaga S. Fukui K. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 107: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 34Hardy S.J. Kurland C. Voynow P. Mora G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Typically, a single extraction experiment using PA chromosomes isolated from 2.8 × 108 BALL-1 cells yielded 500 μg of proteins, whereas PG chromosomes isolated from 2.8 × 108 HeLa S3 cells yielded 44 μg of proteins. The lower amount of proteins extracted from PG chromosomes originated mainly from the decrease in the chromosomes at each purification step. Protein aliquots were lyophilized and stored at –80 °C until further analysis. Electrophoretic Separation of Chromosomal Proteins—For one-dimensional SDS-PAGE using 5–10 or 5–20% gel, Perfect NT gel (DRC Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was used. In addition to conventional IEF two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, RFHR two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was also used for the separation of chromosomal proteins covering a wide range of isoelectric points (29Uchiyama S. Kobayashi S. Takata H. Ishihara T. Sone T. Matsunaga S. Fukui K. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 107: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Wada A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). RFHR two-dimensional gel electrophoresis provides an excellent separation of highly basic proteins. The detailed procedures involved in IEF and RFHR two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analyses were described in our previous study (29Uchiyama S. Kobayashi S. Takata H. Ishihara T. Sone T. Matsunaga S. Fukui K. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 107: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Detection of Proteins—Proteins separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and then quantified using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). In addition, the quantitative information on proteins with a molecular mass lower than ∼100 kDa was mainly obtained from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analyses. Proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were analyzed with ImageMaster 2-D Elite (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of each protein was determined as a ratio to core histone H4, which was well separated from the other core histones. The molar ratios of each protein in relation to histone H4 were calculated from the results obtained with the smallest possible starting amounts of protein to avoid artifactual underestimation resulting from stain saturation of the bands or spots in one-dimensional SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, respectively. Thus, under these conditions, the amount of protein has a linear relationship with the intensity of the corresponding band or spot. The relative amounts of each protein were determined by averaging more than six two-dimensional gel electrophoresis results obtained under the same conditions. In the case that several proteins were identified from a single band, the band intensity was divided by the averaged molecular masses of the identified proteins, which provided the summation of the relative molar ratio of the identified proteins. In-gel Digestion—Pieces of the gel containing proteins of interest were excised for digestion with trypsin, lysyl endopeptidase Lys-C, or endoproteinase Glu-C using the following procedures. Gel pieces obtained from one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were destained by incubation in 1 ml of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50% methanol. For reductive alkylation, gels dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile for 10 min at room temperature were incubated for 30 min at 56 °C in 25 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, followed by replacement of the dithiothreitol solution with 25 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Gel pieces were then dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile and dried for 30 min in a SpeedVac (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA). Dried pieces were rehydrated for 45 min at 4 °C in 5–30 μl of a solution of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 2–3 pmol of trypsin, Lys-C, or Glu-C. After incubation for 16 h at 37 °C, peptides were eluted with 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile for 10 min at room temperature with sonication. The second and third elutions of the peptides were performed under the same conditions. The first, second, and third trifluoroacetic acid solutions were mixed together, followed by reduction of the volume to 5 μl using the SpeedVac. Desalting of the peptides was performed with ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Millipore Corp.). After equilibration with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, peptides were adsorbed to the ZipTip C18 pipette tips, followed by washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and elution with 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—For identification using the peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) method, 1-μl aliquots were deposited on an AnchorChip 384-well target plate (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) followed by deposition of 1 μl of matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Subsequently, the drops were dried up in the atmosphere. The identification of each protein after the enzymatic digestions was carried out by PMF analysis using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Autoflex or Ultraflex, Bruker Daltonik GmbH) and by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis using a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Ultraflex) (35Suckau D. Resemann A. Schuerenberg M. Hufnagel P. Franzen J. Holle A. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In addition, an Esquire electrospray ionization MS/MS system (Bruker Daltonik GmbH) equipped with a liquid chromatography (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) was employed for protein identification. Mass data extracted by Flex analysis (Bruker Daltonik GmbH) for MALDI-TOF/TOF or by Hystar Version 2.3 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH) for electrospray ionization MS/MS were analyzed using Biotools Version 2.2 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH) employing the MASCOT search engine. Most proteins were identified by matching the PMF results with the NCBInr Database. Identification was considered positive when high scores were obtained from both trypsin and Lys-C or Glu-C digestions. In some cases, three to four proteins could be identified by PMF analysis of a single band. Several peptide peaks observed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were further analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS for identification and/or confirmation of proteins. Examples of protein identification are indicated in Fig. S5–S8. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Monoclonal antibodies against β-actin and histone H1 were produced for this study. The production of monoclonal antibodies against these chromosomal proteins was carried out by immunization of mice with the extracted chromosomal proteins. After screening by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, several monoclonal antibodies were obtained. The immunoprecipitated antigen protein was identified by PMF. 2T. Higashi, S. Miyakawa, S.

(Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody against Ki-67 (MIB-1) was purchased from Dako Cytomation (Glostrup, Denmark). Antibody against calreticulin was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland). Indirect fluorescent antibody staining of HeLa cells was performed according to a previously published method (37Maeshima K. Laemmli U.K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells were grown on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Wako) in XBE2 buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm EGTA) for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then treated with 0.5 mg/ml NaBH4 (Wako) in XBE2 buffer for 5 min at room temperature, rinsed twice with XBE2 buffer for 5 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in XBE2 buffer at room temperature. After being washed twice with XBE2 buffer for 5 min, the cells were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Wako) in XBE2 buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies, 1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20 in XBE2 buffer at room temperature for 1 h. After being washed five times with XBE2 buffer for 3 min, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies, 1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20 in XBE2 buffer at room temperature for 1 h. After being washed six times with XBE2 buffer for 3 min, the cells were mounted with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed under a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging fluorescence microscope. Staining of metaphase chromosome spreads was performed according to previously published methods (25Ono T. Losada A. Hirano M. Myers M. Neuwald A. Hirano T.

For preparation of metaphase chromosome spreads, HeLa S3 cells were treated with Colcemid (final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml) for 3 h before harvesting. Mitotic cells, collected by tapping culture dishes, were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and the harvested cells were treated with 75 mm KCl at 1.5–2.0 × 105 cells/ml for 15 min.

The UV spectrum of this nightglow is composed of hydrogen Lyman alpha emission (121.6 nanometers) and the gamma and delta bands of nitric oxide (NO) (190 to 270 nanometers) produced when N and O atoms combine to produce the NO molecule. N and O atoms are produced by extreme UV photodissociation of O2, CO2, and N2 in the dayside upper atmosphere and transported to the night side. The NO emission is brightest in the winter south polar night because of continuous downward transport of air in this region at night during winter and because of freezing at ground level."

Mutagenesis of some, but not all, of the potential κB elements in the 5′ part of the CASR gene led to loss of responsiveness to cytokine. These elements conferred cytokine responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, and in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, NF-κB complexes formed on the same three κB elements.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). By virtue of its ability to sense small changes in circulating calcium concentration and couple this information to intracellular pathways that modify PTH and calcitonin secretion or renal cation handling, the CASR plays an essential role in maintaining mineral ion homeostasis. An inverse sigmoidal curve describes the relationship between extracellular ionized calcium and PTH concentration. The activity and/or expression level of the CASR dictates the extracellular calcium set point, this being defined as the extracellular calcium concentration for half-maximal stimulation of PTH secretion from the parathyroid gland or calcium reabsorption across the kidney tubule.The human CASR gene, located on chromosome 3q13.3-21 (3.Janicic N.

Animal studies indicate that administration of endotoxin, bacteria, and proinflammatory cytokines results in a lowering of ionized calcium concentrations (13.Zaloga G.P. Malcolm D. Chernow B. Holaday J. Circ. Shock. 1988; 24: 143-148PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Boyce B.F. Yates A.J.P. Mundy G.R. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2780-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the hypocalcemia are not known. Several factors may be involved, including decreased secretion of PTH (15.Zaloga G.P. Chernow B. Ann. Intern. Med. 1987; 107: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), although both increased and decreased concentrations of PTH have been reported (16.Lind L. Carlstedt F. Rastad J. Stiernstrom H. Stridsberg M. Ljungren O. Wide L. Larsson A. Hellman P. Ljunghall S. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). There may be resistance to the action of PTH in the kidney and bone, leading to increased urinary calcium excretion and altered bone formation. There is hypomagnesemia and metabolism and function of vitamin D is impaired (15.Zaloga G.P. Chernow B. Ann. Intern. Med. 1987; 107: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It was speculated that the hypomagnesemia contributed to the defective PTH secretion and target organ resistance. However, the hypoparathyroidism is persistent following magnesium repletion in burn-injured children, making this explanation unlikely (17.Klein G.L. Langman C.B. Herndon D.N. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2000; 14: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Calcitonin precursors are increased in the circulation of critically ill patients with sepsis and could contribute to the hypocalcemia (16.Lind L. Carlstedt F. Rastad J. Stiernstrom H. Stridsberg M.

In addition, the serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are markedly increased in patients with burn injury or sepsis and are inversely related to the calcium concentration (16.Lind L. Carlstedt F. Rastad J. Stiernstrom H. Stridsberg M. Ljungren O. Wide L. Larsson A. Hellman P. Ljunghall S. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Serum procalcitonin levels increase after endotoxin injection in normal human subjects (20.Dandona P. Nix D. Wilson M.F. Aljada A. Love J. Assivcot M. Bohuon C. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Care Med. 2000; 28: 3885-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) used a sheep model of burn injury to demonstrate that the hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism that follow severe burn injury are related to up-regulation of parathyroid gland CASR expression. This would be expected to reduce the set point for PTH suppression by extracellular calcium. We hypothesized that the hypocalcemia of critically ill patients is mediated, in part, by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α acting to up-regulate CASR gene transcription in tissues important for calcium homeostasis.Cytokines, like IL-1β and TNF-α, work through NF-κB, which was discovered as a nuclear factor necessary for immunoglobulin κ light chain transcription in B cells (23.Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). NF-κB exists in the cytoplasm of most cells as an inactive form bound to an inhibitor, IκB. Upon receipt of a signal generated by activation of cytokine receptors, IκB is phosphorylated, and NF-κB is released from IκB and translocates to the nucleus to up-regulate specific gene transcription. NF-κB is responsible for the inducible expression of many immune and inflammatory response (and other) proteins (24.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4571) Google Scholar, 25.Wulczyn F.G. Krappman D. Scheidereit C. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 749-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 26.Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).NF-κB is a dimer of members of the Rel family of proteins, which includes p50, p65, and c-Rel. Each one has a conserved NH2-terminal Rel homology domain responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and interaction with IκB family members. Most NF-κB proteins are transcriptionally active, but some combinations are inactive or repressive. Thus, p50/p65, p50/c-Rel, p65/p65, and p65/c-Rel are transcriptional activators, whereas the p50/p50 homodimer is a repressor. Each Rel protein contacts one-half of the DNA binding site, which is a variation on the 10-bp consensus sequence 5′-GGG(T/A)(A/C)TTTCC-3′. A variable COOH-terminal domain found in activating but not in the repressive Rel proteins is probably responsible for transactivation (24.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4571) Google Scholar, 25.Wulczyn F.G. Krappman D. Scheidereit C. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 749-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have shown that IL-1β up-regulates parathyroid, thyroid, and kidney CASR mRNA (and corresponding CASR protein in thyroid and kidney) levels in vivo in the rat and that the proinflammatory cytokine stimulates the endogenous CASR gene transcription in human thyroid and kidney cell lines. In addition, we have shown that IL-1β and TNF-α up-regulate CASR gene transcription via NF-κB and identified functional κB response elements in both promoters of the human CASR gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant IL-1β and TNF-α were from Sigma.

After linearization of the vectors, the antisense probes were in vitro transcribed with T7 polymerase incorporating [α-32P]UTP using a MAXI script kit, and the gel-purified riboprobes were used with an RPA III kit (Ambion Inc.). Each probe (2.5 × 105 cpm) was hybridized overnight with 2-25 μg of total RNA followed by digestion with a ribonuclease A:T1 mix (29.D'Souza-Li L. Canaff L. Janicic N. Cole D.E.C. Hendy G.N. Hum.

Run-on reactions (50 μl) were carried out at 30 °C in 300 mm NH4(SO4)2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm MnCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 29% glycerol, 150 μCi of [32P]UTP, 3000 Ci/mmol (ICN, Mississauga, Canada), and 1.5 mm each of CTP, ATP, and GTP (MBI Fermentas) for 45 min. RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μg of plasmid DNA containing specific gene inserts or no insert were NaOH-denatured and slot-blotted (HybriSlot; Invitrogen) onto Nytran membranes. The gene-specific plasmids were 1) human CASR exon 1A, a 280-bp AseI-StuI fragment cloned in pBluescript II KS; 2) human CASR exon 1B, a 230-bp NotI-StuI fragment cloned in pBluescript II KS; 3) human CASR exon 2, a 227-bp StuI-NcoI fragment cloned in pBluescript II KS; 4) human cyclooxygenase-2, a 488-bp fragment RT-PCR-amplified from HKC RNA (forward primer, 5′-CATCCCTGATCCCCAGGGCTCA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGCACATAATCTTCAATCACAA-3′) TA-cloned into pCR2.1 Topo; 5) human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a 469-bp fragment RT-PCR-amplified from HKC RNA (forward primer, 5′-CCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACATGGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GAGGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTCTG-3′) TA-cloned in pGEM-T; and 6) pUC18. The membranes were hybridized with 2 × 107 cpm 32P-labeled transcripts in 50% formamide; 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 0.75 m NaC1, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 10× Denhardt's solution, and 20 μg/ml single-stranded DNA for a minimum of 40 h. In any single experiment, equal numbers of counts were used for all conditions. Membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film, and quantitation of the relative rates of transcription was achieved by densitometry.Western Blot Analysis of the CASR—Tissues were lysed in triple detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 5 min at 0 °C. The lysates were spun at 1200 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C. Aliquots were electrophoresed through 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were rinsed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, blocked with 5% dried milk powder in TBST for 3 h, and incubated with affinity-purified CASR antibody AS2011, raised against a peptide comprising CASR amino acids 215-235 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. As a control, immunoblotting was carried out as described above with the antibody preadsorbed for 1 h with the peptide (10 μg/ml) against which it was raised. Antibody antigen complexes were detected by chemiluminescence using the Lumi-glo kit (Invitrogen). Membranes were reprobed with a tubulin antibody as a loading control.Human CASR Gene Promoter Constructs—The construction of the P1-luciferase reporter plasmid (designated here as P1-WT) containing the P1 promoter, exon 1A, and the 5′ part of exon 2 to nucleotide -1 (nucleotide +1 is the A of the ATG initiation codon), upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL3 basic, has been described previously (6.Canaff L. Hendy G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30337-30350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The P1-Mut and 1A-Mut constructs were generated by the overlap extension site-specific mutagenesis method (31.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar), using P1-WT as template. For P1-Mut, the primer sets used were as follows: F1 (5′-AGCATTTGCTCAGCTCCTTCTCTA-3′ with an EspI site in boldface type), RM (5′-AGTCAAGGCCCGTTAACTGTATAG-3′ with mutated residues in boldface type to generate product 1), and FM (5′-CTATACAGTTAACGGGCCTTGACT-3′ with mutated residues in boldface type), and R2 (5′-CAAACTGTCAACAGTAGGAAATT-3′ with a HincII site in boldface type to generate product 2). The overlapping fragments were mixed, denatured, and amplified with primers F1 and R2 to generate product 3 that was cleaved with EspI and HincII and cloned into the EspI/HincII-digested P1-WT plasmid to create P1-Mut. For 1A-Mut, the primer sets used were as follows: F1 (5′-AGCATTTGCTCAGCTCCTTCTCTA-3′ with an EspI site in boldface type, RM (5′-CCCTTGCGTCCATGGACAGAACAA-3′ with mutated residues in boldface type to generate product 1), FM (5′-TTGTTCTGTCCATGGACGCAAGGG-3′ with mutated residues in boldface type), and R2 (5′-CACAGCGCGCTGCTTGGAGGCC-3′ with a BssHII site in boldface type to generate product 2). The overlapping fragments were mixed, denatured, and amplified with primers F1 and R2 to generate product 3 that was cleaved with EspI and BssHII and cloned into the EspI/BssHII-digested P1-WT plasmid to create 1A Mut. The P1/1A Mut was created by subcloning the HincII-BssHII fragment from 1A Mut into HincII/BssHII-cleaved P1 Mut.The construction of the P2-luciferase reporter plasmid (designated here as P2-WT) containing the P2 promoter, exon 1B, and the 5′ part of exon 2 to nucleotide -1, upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL3 basic, has been described previously (6.Canaff L. Hendy G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30337-30350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To create the P2-Mut plasmid, the overlap extension method was used with primer sets F1 (5′-GCGCCCTAAGCTTCTTTCCATCG-3′ with a HindIII site in boldface type) and RM (5′-CCGAGCCATTTGTGAACGGCTCTC-3′ with mutated residues in boldface type) to generate product 1 and FM (5′-GAGAGCCGTTCACAAATGGCTCGG-3′ with mutated residues in boldface type) and R2 (5′-AGAGAGCTTAGCTGACTCTTCAG-3′ with an EspI site in boldface type) to generate product 2. The overlapping fragments were mixed, denatured, and amplified with primers F1 and R2 to generate product 3 that was cleaved with HindIII and EspI and cloned into the HindIII/EspI-digested P2-WT to create P2-Mut.To construct the P1-heterologous promoter luciferase reporter plasmids, for SV40 P1 NF-κB WT and SV40 P1 NF-κB Mut, 110-bp products containing an NF-κB element were amplified using P1-WT and P1-Mut as templates with forward primer (5′-atgctGCTAGCCCATTGAAGAAAAGAAATGGAAACT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-tctgaCTCGAGGTGATAACATCTACCTCAGGGGGTCCT-3′), where the nucleotides in boldface type are an NheI or XhoI site, and the lowercase nucleotides are those added to ensure complete restriction enzyme cleavage. The PCR products were digested with NheI and XhoI and cloned into the pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega) upstream of the SV40 promoter to generate constructs SV40 P1 NF-κB WT and SV40 P1 NF-κB Mut. To generate constructs SV40 1A NF-κB WT and SV40 1A NF-κB Mut, 116-bp products containing an NF-κB element were amplified using P1-WT and P1-Mut as templates with forward primer (5′-atgctGCTAGCATTTTCTGTAACAAATGATCCTGCTAA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-tctgaCTCGAGAACACCAAAAATATTATCCCCTTTAA-3′), where the nucleotides in boldface type represent an NheI or XhoI site. The PCR products were digested with NheI and XhoI and cloned into the pGL3-Promoter vector upstream of the SV40 promoter to create constructs SV40 1A NF-κB WT and SV40 1A NF-κB Mut. To construct SV40 P2 NF-κB WT and SV40 P2 NF-κB Mut, 108-bp products containing an NF-κB element were amplified using P2-WT and P2-Mut as templates with forward primer (5′-atgctGCTAGCCAAGGAGTAGGGTCAGGGAAGAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-tctgaCTCGAGAGACGGCGAGCCCCGCGCTTAGGTC-3′), where the nucleotides in boldface type represent an NheI or XhoI site. The PCR products were digested with NheI and XhoI and cloned into the pGL3-Promoter vector upstream of the SV40 promoter to create constructs SV40 P2 NF-κB WT and SV40 P2 NF-κB Mut.To construct SV40 E2 NF-κB WT, a 112-bp product containing a putative NF-κB element was amplified using P2-WT as template with forward primer (5′-atgctGCTAGCTCTGTAGACATGTGTGTCCCCACTGCAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-tctgaCTCGAGGGTTCTGCCGTCTCTCCAGGGCAAGG-3′), where the nucleotides in boldface type represent an NheI or XhoI site. The PCR product was digested with NheI and XhoI and cloned into the pGL3-Promoter vector upstream of the SV40 promoter to create construct SV40 E2 NF-κB WT.Cell Culture—HKC cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. TT cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. All maintenance medium contained 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B.Transfection and Reporter Assay—For transient transfection, cells were trypsinized, plated in 6-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (1-4 × 105 cells/well), and incubated overnight. The next day, cells were transfected with 30 μg/well of Superfect reagent with 1 μg of CASR promoter construct and 0.5 μg of pCH110 per well. The following day, cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight and cultured with or without cytokines for 10 h. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm glycyl-glycine) on ice. Luciferase activity was measured in an EG & G Berthold luminometer using 45 μl of cell lysate and d-luciferin. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity.Nuclear Extracts of HKC Cells—Cells were washed, scraped into 1 ml of PBS, and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were processed in a loose Dounce tissue homogenizer in 2 volumes of buffer (25 mm Tris, pH. 7.9, 0.3 mm DTT, 420 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). Nuclear pellets were obtained by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C); resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT; and Dounce homogenized. After a 20-min centrifugation at 25,000 × g, nuclear extracts (supernatants) were dialyzed for 5 h against 20 nm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT. Protein content was determined, and aliquots were stored at -80 °C.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Two micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated for 20 min on ice in the absence or presence of 10−8m 1,25(OH)2D3 and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) in binding buffer (25 mm Tri"

We discuss the implications of these findings for mechanisms of drug and protein export. To expel drugs and other toxic compounds, Gram-negative bacteria use specialized machinery that guides the compounds across two membranes and over the separating interstitial space, known as the periplasm. One type of such transport machinery is the complex formed by an inner membrane proton antiporter, an outer membrane channel, and a periplasmic protein that consolidates the assembly (1Sharff A. Fanutti C. Shi J. Calladine C. Luisi B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5011-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2Borges-Walmsley M.I. McKeegan K.S. Walmsley A.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 313-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These energy-dependent tripartite pumps extrude actively a variety of noxious compounds from the cytoplasm or inner membrane to the extracellular medium. A number of such pumps have been implicated in multidrug resistance of Gram-negative species, and representative examples that have been well characterized include the Escherichia coli AcrAB-TolC and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa MexAB-OprM assemblies (3Tikhonova E.B. Zgurskaya H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32116-32124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 4Li X.Z. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Advances are being made in understanding the mechanism of multidrug efflux in Gram-negative bacteria at the level of stereochemistry. To date, high resolution crystal structures have become available for the outer membrane components TolC (5Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C.

Based on these structures, several models have been proposed for the organization of the AcrAB-TolC assembly as a representative efflux pump (9Higgins M.K. Bokma E. Koronakis E. Hughes C.

However, the detailed interactions of the components have not been established nor is it clear how the transport of drugs is coupled to proton translocation.Tripartite pumps are likely to contribute to drug resistance of the Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio cholerae, which is the causative agent of the disease cholera. Isolates of V. cholerae have been described that are resistant to chemically diverse antibiotics, such as ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, nitrofurantoin, and erythromycin, as well as to toxic metals like Pb2+ and Zn2+ (12Choudhury P. Kumar R. Indian J. Med. Res. 1996; 104: 148-151PubMed Google Scholar). A putative tripartite pump has been identified from V. cholerae comprising the inner membrane anti-porter VceB, the periplasmic adaptor protein VceA, and the outer membrane channel VceC (13Colmer J.A. Fralick J.A. Hamood A.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the function of this pump in V. cholerea has not been demonstrated, its components were found to collectively complement the multidrug resistance phenotype in E. coli null mutants of TolC, EmrA, and the inner membrane antiporter, EmrB (13Colmer J.A. Fralick J.A. Hamood A.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Among the compounds to which the VceABC proteins confer resistance in that mutant E. coli are the uncoupler cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, the detergent sodium deoxycholate, phenylmercuric acetate, and several antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, nalixidic acid, erythromycin, and rifampicin.The inner membrane component of the V. cholerae efflux pump, VceB, belongs to the major facilitator (MF) 1The abbreviations used are: MF, major facilitator; RND, root nodulation and division; β-DDM, β-dodecyl-maltoside; ABC, ATP-binding cassette.1The abbreviations used are: MF, major facilitator; RND, root nodulation and division; β-DDM, β-dodecyl-maltoside; ABC, ATP-binding cassette. superfamily of proton antiporters. These transmembrane proteins lack the extensive periplasmic domain that characterizes members of the Root Nodulation and Division (RND) superfamily, which includes the AcrB and MexB inner membrane proteins mentioned above (14Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The large periplasmic domains of the RND-based pumps have been proposed to contact directly the other two components of the tripartite pump (11Fernandez-Recio J. Walas F. Federici L. Venkatesh Pratap J. Bavro V.N. Miguel R. Mizuguchi K. Luisi B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and it seems likely that the pumps based on the smaller MF proteins must have a very different quaternary organization with distinctive protein-to-protein interactions and different subunit stoichiometry. Notwithstanding these differences between the MF and RND proteins, the outer membrane and membrane fusion protein components of the MF- and RND-based pumps are likely to be close structural homologues. For instance, VceA and VceC are predicted to belong to the same families as AcrA and TolC, respectively, even though the sequence conservation is very limited (having ∼10% identity).Here, we report the crystal structure of the outer membrane component VceC at 1.8 Å resolution. Although widely divergent in sequence, VceC has a high degree of structural similarity with E. coli TolC and P. aeruginosa OprM. All three proteins form channels that are virtually sealed at the periplasmic end in the “resting state,” but each is stabilized by completely different sets of side chain interactions. In addition, although the outer membrane porin-like domain is completely sealed in VceC and partially sealed in OprM, it is completely open in TolC. Calculations indicate that the exposed periplasmic surface of VceC is physio-chemically distinct from that of TolC, and it is therefore likely that the two proteins form different types of protein-protein interfaces in their respective RND- and MF-type tripartite pumps. This proposal is in accord with the notion that different architectures must underlie the RND- and MF-based pumps. Here, we discuss further the similarities and differences of the TolC, OprM, and VceC channels, and we describe the implications for drug efflux and transmembrane transport of proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The vceC gene (GenBank™ accession number NP_231052) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of the V. cholerae vaccine strain CVD101 (forward primer, 5′-CAT ATG AAA AAT AGC GTT CAA ACG GTA GGT TTG-3′, reverse primer, 5′-CTC GAG AGA TTC TGT TGT TTC AAA ACC GCC GCC-3′), which was shown to have an identical sequence to vceC from V. cholerae strain N16961 (GenBank™ accession number AE004219), and ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). After restriction enzyme digestion of the vector with NdeI and XhoI, the resulting vceC fragment was then ligated into pET21a (Novagen), generating a construct to express the vceC gene with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The construct was transformed into E. coli strain BL21-AI (Invitrogen).Cells were grown in an orbital shaker at 37 °C until the culture reached an absorbance, at 600 nm, of 0.5-0.6 and was then induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 0.02% l-arabinose at 25 °C, overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 units/ml DNaseI, 1 tablet/100 ml protease inhibitor mixture tablet), and lysed by three passages through a Constant System Cell Disrupter (15 Kpsi, model Z-plus 1.1 kW; Constant System). Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 220,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in buffer B (20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm Tris(hydroxypropyl) phosphine (THP)) and then freshly prepared β-dodecyl-maltoside (β-DDM) was added to 2%. The mixture was gently stirred at 4 °C for 1.5 h and centrifuged at 220,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. NaCl was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 500 mm and imidazole (6 m, pH 7.4) to a concentration of 15 mm. Extracted histidine-tagged VceC was purified by affinity chromatography using a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) immobilized with Ni2+ equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm THP, 0.2% β-DDM). The column was washed with 100 mm imidazole added to buffer C. Purified VceC was eluted with 500 mm imidazole, 0.2% β-DDM in buffer B.Buffer exchange of VceC into buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm THP, 0.2% β-DDM) was carried out on a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). The eluate was loaded onto a 6-ml RESOURCE Q ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted with a gradient of 100-400 mm NaCl over 15 column volumes. Fractions containing purified VceC were pooled, diluted 2-fold with buffer D without NaCl, loaded onto the RESOURCE Q column again, and eluted with 300 mm NaCl in the same buffer. N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein revealed that the first amino acid corresponds to residue 43 of the cloned gene.Site-directed Mutagenesis of VceC—The E92C mutation was introduced into VceC using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) with a 37-base PCR primer (sense 5′-CAG CAC TCA CCA TCG TTA TGC ATG GCA ATG GCT CGG C).Crystallization and Data Collection—The protein was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% β-DDM. Prior to crystallization, protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Initial crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of protein sample on a silinated coverslip with 1 μl of a reservoir solution containing 35% v/v 2,4-methyl-pentanediol, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 200 mm NaCl. The coverslip was sealed on a well containing 1.0 ml of the same reservoir solution and equilibrated at 295 K. Crystals appeared after one month and reached a final size of 0.1 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm3. To facilitate the binding of mercury compounds to the protein for phasing, protein carrying the mutation E92C was produced and purified with the same protocol. The mutant protein proved to crystallize more easily and to yield crystals of bigger size (up to 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3). Several additives and detergents were tested in the crystallization trials to improve the diffraction quality of the crystals. The best results were obtained by the hanging drop method under the following condition: a droplet made of 1 μl of protein solution, 1 μl of reservoir solution, and 1 μl of octyl-β-glucoside 245 mm was equilibrated against a reservoir solution made of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol 45% v/v, HEPES 100 mm, pH 7.0, and 200 mm NaCl. Crystals appeared after 2 days and reached their final dimensions after a week. Crystals were directly frozen after looping from the droplet. These crystals belong to the space group P321.Data were collected at the ID14-4 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble). The best data were obtained with a crystal soaked for 24 h with 50 μm phenylmercuribenzoate and frozen. Complete data were collected to the resolution of 1.8 Å. Data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK, respectively (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).

However, the electron density maps calculated with SIRAS phases from the Hg derivative were not of sufficient quality to allow building of the protein model. The structure was instead solved by Molecular Replacement using a polyalanine model of the E. coli TolC protomer (Protein Data Bank accession number 1ek9) (Molrep version 6.2.5 and CNS) (16Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). The best solutions were obtained using data collected in-house on a VceC-E92C crystal (see Table I). The optimal solution yielded a single protomer in the asymmetric unit in which the trimer was correctly generated by crystallographic symmetry. With this asymmetric unit composition, the solvent content of the crystal is 60%. To refine the model we used the 1.8 Å dataset, collected on the VceC-E92C crystal soaked with mercury. Two procedures were followed in parallel. In one case, the model was built by the automated building procedure implemented in ARP/wARP starting with calculated phases from the molecular replacement solution for a polyalanine model (18Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). This provided roughly 80% of the model, which was then completed manually. The second procedure involved manual rebuilding of the original polyalanine model using the ARP/wARP map as a guide. Model building was carried out iteratively using COOT (19Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar) and restrained refinement as implemented in REFMAC5 (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The models from the two procedures converged to virtually the same structure. Density accounting for two partially occupied mercury atoms bound to Cys-92 was found, consistent with the anomalous Fourier calculations. In addition, a molecule of octyl-β-glucoside bridging the β-barrel domains of two symmetry-related molecules could be built. The final model was refined to an R factor of 18.9% and an R-free of 22.1% and contains residues 63-480 of the cloned coding sequence and 315 water molecules. The first 20 and the last 4 residues of the mature protein were not built due to the absence of clear density. In addition, the loop 288-294 in the equatorial domain could not be modeled due to poor density. The final quality of the model is excellent as judged using PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Statistics relative to the refinement and the quality of the model are shown in Table I.Structural superpositions were performed using the program COMPARER (22Zhu Z.Y. Sali A. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The program JOY was used to highlight secondary structure elements in the structural alignment (23Mizuguchi K. Deane C.M. Blundell T.L. Johnson M.S. Overington J.P. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The optimal desolvation areas for VceC and TolC were computed using a variation of the ODA method (24Fernandez-Recio J. Totrov M. Skorodumov C. Abagyan R. Proteins. 2004; 58: 134-143Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar), where the starting points for the generation of optimal surface patches were located at the geometrical center of every surface residue. The program GRASP (25Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5313) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the electrostatic potential surfaces and to prepare Fig. 4. The figures were otherwise prepared using PYMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA), COOT, and ICM (www.molsoft.com). The coordinates and structure factors were deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1YC9).Modeling of the VceC Open State—The sequence of VceC can be split into N- and C-terminal halves that probably arose by gene duplication. The N-terminal repeat (residues 63-286) was aligned with the C-terminal repeat (residues 295-480) using CLUSTAL-X (26Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35206) Google Scholar). The structure of the N-terminal repeat was used as a template for generating a model of the C-terminal repeat, using Modeler version 6.2 (27Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). We generated 15 models and ranked them by energy and violations from ideal geometry. The best model was further validated using Verify3D (28Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK. At this point the model was superimposed to the VceC protomer. As expected the β-barrel domain and the first part of the α-barrel domain were perfectly aligned, whereas the terminal part of helices H7 and H8 adopted an open conformation. A model for the open state of the VceC protomer was obtained by merging the experimental and modeled coordinates.RESULTSOverall Fold—The structure of the 442-residue VceC protein from V. cholerae was solved by molecular replacement using the E. coli TolC structure as a template. The final model accounts for 93% of the mature protein. Missing portions are as follows: (i) the first N-terminal 20 residues, (ii) the last 4 C-terminal residues, and (iii) the loop 288-294 in the “equatorial domain” (which is the outermost group of concentric structural elements that can be seen in Fig. 1b). One VceC protomer occupies the asymmetric unit, and the trimer is generated by the crystallographic 3-fold axis. The VceC trimer has a cannon-like shape with a total length of ∼140 Å, and the general architecture of the protein is similar to that of TolC (Fig. 1a). Two principal domains, a β-domain and an α-domain, are distinguishable in the VceC protomer. The β-barrel domain spans ∼40 Å and is the transmembrane portion of the molecule. This β-domain consists of four anti-parallel β-strands organized in a highly twisted and curved β-sheet. Strands 1-2 and 3-4 are connected by two long extracellular loops consisting of 13 and 10 residues, respectively. The sheer number for these self-closing β-sheets (a metric of strand inclination) is the same for TolC, OprM, and VceC.Fig. 1Structure of the VceC trimer.a, view perpendicular to the molecular 3-fold axis. The repeat found in the protomer sequence is highlighted by the dark and light blue coloring of the front protomer. b, view of the trimer from the cytoplasmic membrane. c, space-filling representation of the trimer from the extracellular space showing the closure of the β-barrel domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The α-barrel domain, which protrudes into the periplasm, is composed of six helices. Two of these helices, helices H3 and H7, extend for the entire length of the domain, whereas helices H2-H4 and H6-H8 stack end-to-end and thus resemble pseudo-continuous helices. The six helices forming the α-barrel domain are connected by several segments, which in VceC are mostly unstructured. We distinguish in this region, which has been referred to in TolC as the equatorial domain, the helix H1 and a short helix 310 (G5) that topologically replaces a β-strand and a helix in TolC. In this region the loop 288-294 could not be modeled due to lack of density.Interestingly, the VceC trimers pack in laminar arrays in the crystal (Fig. 2a). This packing brings the exposed hydrophobic surfaces of the β-barrel together in the same plane and mimics the organization of a planar membrane (commonly referred to as “type I crystal packing”). Within this membrane-like layer, octyl-β-glucoside molecules are found that nestle between two adjacent β-barrel domains. Two such molecules line end-to-end and span the height of the porin-like domain as though they were lipids in the two leaflets of a bilayer membrane (Fig. 2a). The detergent molecules make both hydrophobic interactions with the protein through their aliphatic chains and a number of hydrogen bond interactions via their sugar moieties (Fig. 2b). Perhaps these contacts mimic protein-lipopolysaccharide interactions that occur in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.Fig. 2The packing of VceC in the crystal lattice.a, laminar packing of VceC in sheets that mimic the lipid bilayer. Two octyl-β-glucoside molecules resemble a bilayer and are related by crystallographic symmetry. b, A 2 Fo - Fc electron density map, contoured at 1.5 σ, showing the octyl-β-glucoside molecule at the interface between symmetry-related protomers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The α-barrel domain has a length of ∼100 Å. The internal diameter is 30 Å and is roughly constant from the equatorial domain to the β-barrel domain. From the equatorial domain to the periplasmic periphery, the channel tapers gradually to an almost complete close. Here, a small pore remains with a diameter of roughly 3.5 Å (Fig. 1b). The tapering arises from the superhelical trajectory adopted by the helical pair H7 and H8, which form a coiled-coil that curves toward the symmetry axis.Like TolC and OprM, the VceC protomer contains a structural repeat. This repeat originated through gene duplication that likely occurred well before the divergence among Gram-negative bacteria. In VceC, the N-terminal half of the protein (residues 63-286) and the C-terminal half (residues 295-480) can be aligned with a sequence identity of 19.8% and superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 2.7 Å between related Cα atoms. In the superimposed structures it is evident that the terminal parts of the coiled-coil helical pair, H3-H4, are less curved than the corresponding segments in the H7-H8 pair, underlying the possibility of two alternative conformations for the protomer. This has implications for the opening mechanism of the channel, as will be discussed later.Comparison of VceC, TolC, and OprM—The structure of V. cholerae VceC was superimposed on the structures of E. coli TolC (5Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) and the P. aeruginosa OprM (6Akama H. Kanemaki M. Yoshimura M. Tsukihara T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 52816-52819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the structural alignment between the three proteins is shown in Fig. 3a. The root mean square deviations between aligned Cα range from 2.0 Å between VceC and TolC to 1.7 Å between VceC and OprM. The root mean square deviation between TolC and OprM was found to be 1.8 Å. These values indicate that VceC is structurally closer to OprM than to TolC. Although the overall fold is well conserved in both the β- and α-barrels (Fig. 3, b and c), the sequence identity between structurally aligned segments is very low. Only 8.3% of the aligned 386 residues are identical. It is interesting to note that most of these residues are hydrophobic and play structural roles. Among them we find two prolines located at the abrupt turns between the α-barrel helices and the β-barrel strands. A number of conserved alanines and glycines located at the interface between adjacent helices and leucines play a role in the knobs-into-holes intermeshing between coiled-coiled helices.Fig. 3Structural comparisons of the outer membrane proteins VceC, TolC, and OprM. One protomer of the trimer is shown for clarity. a, structure-based sequence alignment of the three proteins.

We note that these channel interiors are generally electronegative, but they are strikingly so in the case of VceC, which contains two rings of clustered negative charge. The first ring is located near the equatorial domain and is made by residues Glu-397 and Glu-303, which are conserved in OprM but replaced in TolC by a threonine and a serine, respectively (Fig. 3a). Three acidic residues located at the interface between the α- and β-barrels, i.e. Asp-153, Asp-115, and Asp-328, form the second and more prominent ring. None of these residues is conserved in TolC, being replaced by a phenylalanine, a glutamine, and a threonine, respectively (Fig. 3a). These two rings might attract substrates to the channel exit electrostatically. It is thought that the substrate specificity is mainly provided by the inner membrane component, but the charge distribution of the outer membrane component"
https://openalex.org/W1998179705,"We have previously reported that nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATs) play an important role in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation by receptor tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptor agonists, platelet-derived growth factor-BB and thrombin, respectively. To understand the role of NFATs in vascular disease, we have now studied the involvement of these transcription factors in neointima formation in a rat carotid artery balloon injury model. The levels of NFATc1 in injured right common carotid arteries were increased at 72 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks after balloon injury compared with its levels in uninjured left common carotid arteries. Intraperitoneal injection of cyclosporine A (CsA), a pharmacological inhibitor of the calcineurin-NFAT activation pathway, suppressed balloon injury-induced neointima formation by 40%. Similarly, adenoviral-mediated expression of GFPVIVIT, a competent peptide inhibitor of the calcineurin-NFAT activation pathway, in injured arteries also reduced neointima formation by about 40%. Furthermore, CsA and GFPVIVIT attenuated balloon injury-induced neointimal smooth muscle cell proliferation as determined by bromodeoxyuridine staining. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB induced the expression of COX-2 in cultured VSMC in a time- and NFAT-dependent manner. COX-2 expression was also increased in the right common carotid artery in a time-dependent manner after balloon injury as compared with its levels in uninjured left common carotid artery and both CsA and GFPVIVIT negated this response. Together these results for the first time demonstrate that NFATs play a critical role in neointima formation via induction of expression of COX-2.

It is believed that sustained inflammation following vascular injury is a triggering event in the pathogenesis of vessel wall diseases (1Ross R. N. Engl. J.

The dysfunctional endothelial cells and inflammatory cells at the site of vascular injury produce a variety of molecules possessing various biological activities (1Ross R. N. Engl. J.

The availability of these molecules at the site of vascular injury may stimulate VSMC dedifferentiation (9Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

The dedifferentiated VSMC may cease their ability to contract and relax and acquire their embryonic non-contractile synthetic phenotype state. These SMC via their migration from media to intima and multiplication in intima contribute to the progression of lesions such as restenosis after angioplasty (10Regan C.P. Adam P.J. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that inhibition of expression and/or bioactivity of molecules such as peptide growth factors that are produced at the site of vascular injury ameliorate the lesion progression (11Ferns G.A.

Because many molecules are involved in arterial wall lesions, identifying the unifying mechanisms of these substances may eventually lead to development of better therapeutic approaches against these vascular diseases. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATs) are members of a multigene family of transcription factors that belong to the Rel group (13Macian F. Rodriguez C.L. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are named as NFATc1 (also known as NFATc or NFAT2), NFATc2 (also known as NFATp or NFAT1), NFATc3 (also known as NFAT4 or NFATx), and NFATc4 (also known as NFAT3) and each of these molecules appeared to be expressed as several isoforms by alternative splicing (13Macian F.

Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In recent years, an additional member of the NFAT family of transcription factors, namely NFAT5, was cloned and characterized (16Rodriguez C.L. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). NFAT5 differs from the rest of the four members of the NFAT family by its lack of co-operativity with the Fos and Jun proteins (16Rodriguez C.L. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In regard to expression and functional aspects of these transcription factors, earlier studies have reported the presence of NFATc1, NFATc2, and NFATc3 mainly in T cells regulating the expression of cytokine genes such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) (17Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). However, later studies have demonstrated the presence of all five NFAT proteins in non-immune cells as well (13Macian F. Rodriguez C.L. Rao A.

Studies with knock-out mice also established a role for NFATs in non-immune cells as observed from: 1) knock-out mice for NFATc1 failed to develop normal cardiac valves (20De la Pompa J.L.

One of the members of the NFAT family transcription factors, namely NFATc4, was also reported to play an important role in cardiac hypertrophy (25Molkentin J. Lu J-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). In contrast to NFATc1 to NFATc4, NFAT5 was shown to be involved in the regulation of tonicity responsive genes (26Lopez-Rodriguez C. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Lin F. Novobrantseva T.I.

NFATc1 to NFATc4 exist in the cytoplasm as phosphoproteins in resting state and their activation requires dephosphorylation. A calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, known as calcineurin, has been reported to specifically dephosphorylate these NFATs leading to their activation (17Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). In regard to NFAT5, both calcineurin-dependent and -independent mechanisms were reported to be involved in its activation (27Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Jin L. Rakeman A.S. Michino M. Rao A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 28Trama J. Lu Q. Hawley R.G. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4884-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Activated NFATs translocate to the nucleus, bind to consensus DNA sequence GGAAAAT present in the promoter regions of genes as monomers or dimers via their Rel homology domain, and influence their transcription (13Macian F. Rodriguez C.L. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). However, other than the phenotypic observations made from the knock-out mice models (20De la Pompa J.L. Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J. Samper E. Potter J. Wakeham A. Marengere L.

Cell. 2001; 105: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), the functional aspects of NFATs in non-immune cells are largely unclear. Toward understanding the functional role of NFATs in non-immune cells, we have previously reported that their activation is required for RTK and GPCR agonist-induced VSMC migration and proliferation (29Yellaturu C.R.

The present data show for the first time that NFATs play an essential role in neointima formation via their involvement in balloon injury-induced expression of COX-2. Reagents—Aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, sodium deoxycholate, leupeptin, HEPES, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) in situ detection kit (550803) was bought from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Cyclosporin A (CsA) was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal NFATc1 antibodies (MA3-024) were bought from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Rabbit polyclonal COX-2 antibodies (160106) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Recombinant human PDGF-BB was from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Consensus double-stranded NFATc binding oligonucleotides, 5′-CGCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATA-3′ and 3′-GCGGGTTTCTCCTTTTAAACAAAGTAT-5′ (SC-2577), and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (SC-9996) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). T4 polynucleotide kinase and the luciferase assay kit were procured from Promega (Madison, WI). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Cell Culture—VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aorta of 100 to 150-g male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic dissociation as described earlier (29Yellaturu C.R. Ghosh S.K. Rao R.K. Jennings L.K. Hassid A. Rao G.N. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were quiesced by incubating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% calf serum for 72 h and used to perform the experiments unless otherwise stated. Carotid Artery Balloon Injury—All the animal protocols were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations approved by the Internal Animal Care & Use Committee of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Balloon injury was performed essentially as described by us previously (31Zhang C. Yang J. Jennings L.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H659-H666Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats weighing 250–300 g were anesthetized by injecting (via intraperitoneal) ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). Under a stereomicroscope, the right common, external and internal carotid arteries were exposed by a longitudinal midline cervical incision and blood flow was temporarily interrupted by ligation of the common and internal carotid arteries using vessel clips. External carotid artery was ligated permanently. A 2F Fogarty arterial embolectomy catheter was introduced through an arteriotomy in the external carotid artery just below the ligature and advanced to the common carotid artery. To produce carotid artery injury, the balloon was inflated with saline and passed 6 times with rotation from just under the proximal edge of the omohyoid muscle to the carotid bifurcation. After this, the balloon was deflated and the catheter was withdrawn. The external carotid artery was ligated with a 6-0 silk suture and the blood flow restored by removing the clips at the common and internal carotid arteries. After inspection to ascertain adequate pulsation of the common carotid artery, the surgical incision was closed and the rats were allowed to recover from anesthesia in a humidified and warmed chamber for 2 to 4 h. At different time points after balloon injury, the animals were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) and the carotid arteries were collected for RNA and protein isolation, and morphometric analysis. For morphometric analysis, carotid arteries were fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm thick) obtained at equally spaced intervals in the middle of injured and control common carotid artery segments were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The intimal (I) and medial (M) areas were measured using NIH Image 1.62 program and the I/M ratios were calculated. Construction of Adenoviral Vectors—The GFP and GFPVIVIT DNA fragments were excised from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) and pEGFPVIVIT (32Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), respectively, by digestion of the plasmids with SalI and NotI and subcloned into an entry vector, pENTR3C (Invitrogen) producing pENTR3C-GFP and pENTR3C-GFPVIVIT. Both pENTR3C-GFP and pENTR3C-GFPVIVIT were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α and the plasmids were amplified. These plasmids were recombinated with pAd/CMV/V5-DEST as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) producing pAdGFP and pAdGFPVIVIT plasmids and verified by DNA sequencing. The pAdGFP and pAdGFPVIVIT were linearized with PacI and transfected into HEK293A cells. The resulting adenovirus was further amplified by infection of HEK293A cells and purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation (33Berkner K.L. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 616-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AdGFP and AdGFPVIVIT virus were titrated using standard plaque assay (33Berkner K.L. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 616-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Delivery of Adenoviruses into Injured Arteries—After balloon injury, solutions of (100 μl) AdGFP (1010 pfu/ml) or AdGFPVIVIT (1010 pfu/ml) were infused into the ligated segment of the common carotid artery for 30 min. The ligatures and catheter were then removed, the external carotid artery was ligated, and the incision closed. To test the effect of CsA on neointima formation, the drug was injected into the animal intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg/day) for the entire duration of the experiment. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PGDF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm) for 2 h and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (30Liu Z. Dronadula N. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41218-41226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol, and 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled consensus double-stranded NFAT binding oligonucleotide probe for 30 min on ice. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 1× Tris glycine-EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EDTA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (NFATc, 5′-CGCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATA-3′, 3′-GCGGGTTTCTCCTTTTAAACAAAGTAT-5′) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase kit as per the supplier's protocol (Promega). To test the effect of GFPVIVIT on PDGF-BB-induced NFAT-DNA binding activity, cells were first infected with either AdGFP or AdGFPVIVIT and quiesced before they were subjected to treatments with agonists and nuclear extract preparation. Immunohistochemistry—For BrdUrd immunostaining, rats were injected with BrdUrd (30 mg/kg) 24 and 12 h before sacrificing. Carotid arteries were dissected out from the sacrificed animals and the fat tissue was removed. Vessel tissues were then fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut with 5-μm thickness and immunostained with anti-BrdUrd antibodies using the BrdUrd labeling kit (BD Biosciences). Similarly, sections of injured right common carotid artery 2 weeks after balloon injury with and without the indicated regimen were stained with anti-CD45 antibodies to detect inflammation. RT-PCR for COX-2, GAPDH, and NFATc1—Total cellular RNA from VSMC and tissues was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was quantified, and 1 μg of RNA from control and each treatment was used for the RT-PCR. The RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III One-step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture in a total volume of 50 μl consists of 1× reaction buffer, 1 μg of RNA, 0.5 μm each of forward and reverse primers of a specific gene, and 2 μl of SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq polymerase. RT-PCR amplification was carried out in a Gene Amp 2400 System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an initial first strand cDNA synthesis reaction at 55 °C for 30 min. The PCR was performed at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The final extension reaction was carried out at 72 °C for 10 min. Fifteen microliters of the PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining, photographed, and quantified by densitometry. The primers used are as follows: rat COX-2 primers: forward, 5′-AATTCAAGACACTCTATCACTG-3′ and reverse, 5′-AATTGAGGCAGTGTTGATGTACC-3′; rat GAPDH primers: forward, 5′-ATAGACAAGATGGTGAAGGTCGG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCATGAGCCCTTCCACGATGCC-3′; NFATc1 primers: forward, 5′-TCCACGACGTGGAGGTGGAAGACG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGATGGCTGCCACAATGGCAGAGC-3′. The RT-PCR primers for NFATc1 were designed based on the conserved DNA sequences between mouse and human NFATc1 cDNA and the RT-PCR products derived by the use of these primers, and rat aortic smooth muscle cell and tissue RNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and BLAST analysis. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—VSMC were plated evenly onto 100-mm dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At 50–80% confluence, medium was replaced and cells were transfected with 3 μg/dish of pT8NFAT-Luc plasmid (32Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Forty-eight hours after transfection, VSMC were treated with and without PGDF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm) for 6 h and cell lysates were prepared. VSMC lysates were normalized for protein and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and Turner Luminometer (TD-20/20). To test the effect of GFPVIVIT on PDGF-BB-induced NFAT-Luc activity, cells were transfected with pT8NFAT-Luc plasmid and then infected with either AdGFP or AdGFPVIVIT before they were quiesced and subjected to treatments. Western Blot Analysis—Tissues and/or VSMC were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed by thawing in 250 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 20 min on ice, whereas tissues were homogenized in the same buffer. Cell and/or tissue extracts were transferred into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell or tissue extracts containing an equal amount of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—All the experiments were repeated at least three times with similar pattern of results. Data are presented as mean ± S.D., and the treatment effects were analyzed by Student's t test. PDGF-BB Stimulates NFAT-dependent Transcription in VSMC—NFATs are phosphoproteins and exist in the cytoplasm in an inactive state. These transcription factors are activated via their dephosphorylation. Calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase specifically dephosphorylates NFATs leading to their translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (12Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3739-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, they bind as monomers or dimers via their Rel homology domain to a consensus DNA sequence GGAAAAT present in the promoter regions of genes and influence their transcription (24Graef I.A. Chen F. Chen L. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2001; 105: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that the RTK and GPCR agonists, PDGF-BB and thrombin, respectively, cause translocation of NFATs, particularly NFATc1, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in VSMC (29Yellaturu C.R. Ghosh S.K. Rao R.K. Jennings L.K. Hassid A. Rao G.N. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that NFATs are involved in PDGF-BB and thrombin-induced VSMC migration and proliferation (29Yellaturu C.R. Ghosh S.K. Rao R.K. Jennings L.K. Hassid A. Rao G.N. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Liu Z. Dronadula N. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41218-41226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To understand the role of NFATs in vascular wall diseases, we have now tested their involvement in neointima formation after angioplasty. To achieve this goal, we first measured NFAT activity in response to PDGF-BB in VSMC. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm), a potent inhibitor of calcineurin (17Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), for 2 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Nuclear extracts containing an equal amount of protein from control and PDGF-BB-treated VSMC were incubated with 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled consensus double-stranded NFAT binding oligonucleotide probe and the protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel. PDGF-BB increased NFAT-DNA binding activity by 2–3-fold as compared with control (Fig. 1A). CsA significantly blocked the NFAT-DNA binding activity induced by PDGF-BB. NFATc1 to NFATc4 possess a highly conserved calcineurin-binding site PxIxIT in their regulatory domain at the NH2 terminus. Based on this information a peptide, namely VIVIT, that specifically competes with NFATs for binding to calcineurin, was developed (32Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Expression of GFPVIVIT fusion protein in T cells inhibited only calcineurin-sensitive NFAT-dependent but not calcineurin-sensitive NFAT-independent inducible expression of IL-2, IL-3, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor-α, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α by phorbol 12-myristate 1"

To test the hypothesis that it is required for normal acid secretion, NHE4-null mutant (NHE4–/–) mice were prepared by targeted disruption of the NHE4 (Slc9a4) gene. NHE4–/– mice survived and appeared outwardly normal. Analysis of stomach contents revealed that NHE4–/– mice were hypochlorhydric. The reduction in acid secretion was similar in 18-day-old, 9-week-old, and 6-month-old mice, indicating that the hypochlorhydria phenotype did not progress over time, as was observed in mice lacking the NHE2 Na+/H+ exchanger. Histological abnormalities were observed in the gastric mucosa of 9-week-old NHE4–/– mice, including sharply reduced numbers of parietal cells, a loss of mature chief cells, increased numbers of mucous and undifferentiated cells, and an increase in the number of necrotic and apoptotic cells. NHE4–/– parietal cells exhibited limited development of canalicular membranes and a virtual absence of tubulovesicles, and some of the microvilli had centrally bundled actin. We conclude that NHE4, which may normally be coupled with the AE2 Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, is important for normal levels of gastric acid secretion, gastric epithelial cell differentiation, and development of secretory canalicular and tubulovesicular membranes.

Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) 1The abbreviations used are: NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger (the number following NHE designates the specific isoform); AE2, anion exchanger isoform 2; neo gene, neomycin resistance gene; ES cells, embryonic stem cells; NHE4–/– and NHE4+/–, NHE4 homozygous mutant and heterozygous mutant, respectively; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; WT, wild type. isoform 4 is encoded by Slc9a4, a member of the Slc9a gene family, comprising at least 9 genes encoding transporters that catalyze the electroneutral exchange of Na+ and H+ across cell membranes (1.Orlowski J.

NHE4 exhibits a limited tissue distribution, with very high expression in stomach and low levels in kidney, pancreas, salivary glands, and hippocampus (3.Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9331-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but later determined that this result was caused by cross-hybridization of the NHE4 probe with the NHE2 mRNA. In the stomach, NHE4 protein has been localized to the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells lining the gastric glands (7.Pizzonia J.H. Biemesderfer D. Abu-Alfa A.K. Wu M.-S. Exner M. Isenring P. Igarashi P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F510-F517PubMed Google Scholar). Its mRNA is expressed at particularly high levels in parietal and chief cells and at somewhat lower levels in mucous cells (8.Rossmann H. Sonnentag T. Heinzmann A. Seidler B. Bachmann O. Vieillard-Baron D. Gregor M. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G447-G458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In gastric parietal cells, basolateral Na+/H+ exchange is involved in intracellular pH and volume homeostasis and has been proposed to play a critical role in acid secretion (8.Rossmann H. Sonnentag T. Heinzmann A. Seidler B. Bachmann O. Vieillard-Baron D. Gregor M. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G447-G458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Muallem S. Burnham C. Blissard D.

Chem. 1988; 263: 14703-14711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that at least part of this Na+/H+ exchange activity may be coupled with basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchange (11.Bachmann O. Sonnentag T. Siegel W.K. Lamprecht G. Weichert A. Gregor M. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1085-G1093PubMed Google Scholar). If this were the case, it would provide a mechanism for uptake of both Na+ and Cl–, which would contribute to maintenance of cell volume and, in combination with Na+,K+-ATPase activity, maintain the intracellular ion concentrations and membrane potential required for HCl and KCl secretion. Studies using AE2 knockout mice have shown that AE2 is the predominant basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger in gastric parietal cells; AE2-null mutants were achlorhydric and their gastric parietal cells exhibited a severe deficiency in the development of secretory canaliculi (12.Gawenis L.R. Ledoussal C. Judd L.M. Alper S. Stuart-Tilley A. Grisham C. Sanford L.P. Woo A.L. Prasad V.S. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30531-30539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that the loss of AE2 disrupted the electrochemical driving forces for gastric HCl and KCl secretion and suggested that basolateral electrolyte and water uptake might be crucial for the development of mature parietal cells and fully formed secretory canaliculi. Thus, if a portion of the basolateral Na+/H+ exchange in gastric parietal cells is coupled with AE2-mediated Cl−/HCO3− exchange, then some of the phenotypic consequences of Na+/H+ exchanger ablation might be expected to resemble those of AE2 ablation. Three Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms (NHE1, NHE2, and NHE4) are expressed in parietal cells and could, therefore, contribute to coupled Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO3− exchange (8.Rossmann H. Sonnentag T. Heinzmann A. Seidler B. Bachmann O. Vieillard-Baron D. Gregor M. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G447-G458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the basolateral membrane. NHE1 is expressed at relatively low levels in parietal cells (8.Rossmann H. Sonnentag T. Heinzmann A. Seidler B. Bachmann O. Vieillard-Baron D. Gregor M. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G447-G458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and analyses of NHE1 knockout mice indicated that this isoform is not essential for acid secretion (13.Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C.V. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C788-C795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although NHE2 knockout mice exhibited a progressive loss of parietal cells and became achlorhydric upon aging, gastric secretions in young NHE2 knockouts had normal acidity, and even in aged NHE2-null mutants, the few remaining mature parietal cells exhibited an expansion of the secretory canaliculi and appeared to be secreting acid at high rates (14.Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, NHE2 is essential for parietal cell survival but does not appear to be directly involved in gastric acid secretion. These observations, together with previous data indicating that NHE4 regulates parietal cell volume but not intracellular pH (8.Rossmann H. Sonnentag T. Heinzmann A. Seidler B. Bachmann O. Vieillard-Baron D. Gregor M. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G447-G458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are consistent with the hypothesis that coupled Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO3− exchange, involving NHE4 and AE2, with secondary coupling to the Na+,K+-ATPase is the predominant mechanism for electrolyte uptake and maintenance of cell volume and membrane potential during gastric acid secretion. To study the role of NHE4 in acid secretion and parietal cell function, we developed a mouse carrying a targeted disruption of the NHE4 gene. Investigation of acid secretion and gastric gland morphology in NHE4-null mutant mice revealed that they have hypochlorhydria, impaired maturation and/or differentiation of gastric epithelial cells, a reduced number of parietal cells, and a deficiency in secretory membrane development similar in some respects to that occurring in AE2-null mutant mice. Preparation of Targeting Construct and Generation of Mutant Mice—A targeting construct was generated using the pMJKO vector (14.Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and fragments of the mouse NHE4 gene that were generated by digestion of a λ phage genomic clone with SacI. One SacI fragment, extending from intron 1 to codon 106 in exon 2, was inserted 5′ of the neomycin resistance gene (neo gene) in the vector and a second SacI fragment, extending from codon 106 in exon 2 to intron 2, was subcloned between the 3′-end of the neo gene and the promoter of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Targeting of ES cells (129S6/SvEv background) was performed as previously described (14.Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). ES cells were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis of HindIII- or EcoRV-digested DNA using a 5′ probe corresponding to exon 1 and a 3′ probe corresponding to sequences in intron 3, respectively. ES cells in which homologous recombination had occurred were selected for blastocyst-mediated transgenesis and the resulting chimeric mice carrying the targeted ES cell DNA were bred with wild-type Black Swiss female mice (Taconic). The studies described here, as well as those of the AE2-null phenotype (12.Gawenis L.R. Ledoussal C. Judd L.M. Alper S. Stuart-Tilley A. Grisham C. Sanford L.P. Woo A.L. Prasad V.S. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30531-30539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), were performed using mice with a mixed 129S6/SvEv and Black Swiss background. Measurement of Gastric pH and Acid/Base Equivalents—The pH and acid-base content of gastric secretions of NHE4–/– and wild-type mice were measured at 18 days, 9 weeks, and 6 months of age as described previously (14.Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Mice were euthanized 15 min after subcutaneous injection of histamine (2 μg/g body weight) and the intact stomach was removed. The gastric contents, which would include both basal and histamine-stimulated acid-base equivalents, were rinsed into 5 ml of oxygen-saturated normal saline solution at room temperature, degassed, pelleted by centrifugation, and the pH and acid-base equivalents were determined by titration with NaOH. Northern Blot Analysis and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from stomachs of 9-week-old mice using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Total RNA was denatured with glyoxyl, separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Blots were analyzed for expression of mRNAs encoding gastrin, gastric H+,K+-ATPase α- and β-subunits, AE2, NHE4, NHE2, pepsinogen, intrinsic factor, and the L32 ribosomal subunit protein using 32P-labeled cDNA probes (15.Spicer Z.

Blots were analyzed by autoradiography and Phosphorimager analysis using ImageQuant Software version 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The densities of each band were normalized to that of the L32 band (as a loading control), and the fold change in expression in NHE4–/– stomachs relative to that of wild-type controls was determined. For reverse transcriptase-PCR, cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 4 μg of total RNA using the Superscript Preamplification System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PCR of wild-type and NHE4–/– cDNA was carried out using forward (CTTCTAGCTCAGACCCCGATG) and reverse (GTCTCGGCTGCTAAGTAAGACAG) primers designed to amplify sequence between exon 1 and exon 3. The products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose, isolated, and sequenced. Western Blot Analysis—Immunoblots of gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit protein expression were performed on stomach samples from 3 pairs of 9-week-old mice; whole tissue homogenates were prepared as previously described (12.Gawenis L.R. Ledoussal C. Judd L.M. Alper S. Stuart-Tilley A. Grisham C. Sanford L.P. Woo A.L. Prasad V.S. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30531-30539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Samples (20 μg/lane) were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was incubated overnight with a mouse anti-gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit antibody (16.Smolka A.J. Larsen K.A. Hammond C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and an anti-actin antibody (as a loading control) as previously described (12.Gawenis L.R. Ledoussal C. Judd L.M. Alper S. Stuart-Tilley A. Grisham C. Sanford L.P. Woo A.L. Prasad V.S. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

Chemiluminescence of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody was developed using the SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). Following autoradiography, densitometric analysis of bands was carried out using an HP scanner and ImageQuant software (version 5.1). Histology and Electron Microscopy—For hematoxylin- and eosinstained sections, stomachs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. For electron microscopy, stomachs were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Morphometric analysis of the glandular stomach epithelium was performed as previously described (12.Gawenis L.R. Ledoussal C. Judd L.M. Alper S. Stuart-Tilley A. Grisham C. Sanford L.P. Woo A.L.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated, dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assays to detect apoptosis were performed on sections of paraffin-embedded tissues exactly as described previously (14.Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Statistics—When two treatment groups were compared, the analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test assuming equal variances. Data from more than two treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance with a posthoc Tukey's t test. The General Linear Model of SAS (Version 8, Cary, NC) was used for analysis of morphometric data. Probability values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All values are reported as means ± S.E. Generation of NHE4-null Mutant Mice and Gross Phenotype—The targeting procedure inserted the neo gene into exon 2, which spans codons 86–239 and encodes transmembrane domains 3–7 (Fig. 1A). Targeted ES cells (Fig. 1B) were used to generate chimeric male mice that were bred with WT females to obtain heterozygous mice. Breeding of NHE4+/– mice resulted in live offspring of all three genotypes (Fig. 1B) in a normal Mendelian ratio. Among 506 pups, there were 125 wild-type (24.7%), 280 NHE4+/– (55.3%), and 101 NHE4–/– (20.0%) mice. NHE4–/– mice exhibited normal growth and survival compared with wild-type littermates and no gross abnormalities were observed. In addition, both male and female NHE4–/– mice were fertile. Northern blot analysis revealed a reduction in the size of the NHE4 mRNA in NHE4–/– stomachs (Fig. 1C). The mutant transcript was not observed in the NHE4+/– stomachs but was present at significant levels in NHE4–/– stomachs, suggesting both that the mutant transcript is poorly processed or unstable and that the loss of NHE4 causes transcriptional up-regulation of its gene. The smaller size of the mutant mRNA could indicate the use of a cryptic splice site or splicing directly from exon 1 to exon 3, with excision of exon 2 and the neo gene. To distinguish between these possibilities, cDNA from wild-type and NHE4–/– mice was amplified to generate fragments beginning in exon 1 and ending in exon 3. The mutant product was 462 base pairs shorter than the wild-type product (Fig. 2A), and sequence analysis demonstrated that exon 2 and the neo gene had been excised (Fig. 2B). Impaired Gastric Acid Secretion in NHE4-null Mutant Mice—To test the hypothesis that NHE4 is required for normal gastric acid secretion, the pH and amount of acid or base were measured in gastric secretions from wild-type and NHE4–/– mice at 9 weeks of age following stimulation of acid secretion with histamine. In addition, to determine if NHE4–/– mice, like NHE2-null mutants (14.Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), exhibit a progressive loss of acid secretion over time, the measurements were also performed using 18-day-old and 6-month-old pairs. In all age groups, the pH of the gastric secretions was significantly more alkaline in NHE4–/– mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 3, A, C, and E). Consistent with the increased pH of the gastric secretions, the amount of acid in NHE4–/– gastric secretions was significantly reduced as compared with those of wild-type mice (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). Furthermore, there was no difference in either the pH or acid content of gastric secretions among NHE4–/– mice over the range of ages sampled. Northern blot Analysis of Gastrin mRNA and Both Parietal and Chief Cell Markers—Hypergastrinemia and increased gastrin mRNA is associated with both hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria in humans and mice (12.Gawenis L.R.

Consistent with the reduced gastric acid secretion, NHE4–/– mice exhibited significant increases in gastrin mRNA expression (Fig. 4). Expression of gastric H+,K+ ATPase α- and β-subunit mRNAs was reduced to ∼15% of the expression levels in wild-type stomachs, indicating a possible loss of parietal cells or decreased parietal cell maturation. Consistent with this possibility, AE2c mRNA (the smallest AE2 mRNA), which is restricted to parietal cells, was severely decreased, whereas the mRNA corresponding in size to AE2a and AE2b (17.Langhans N.

To determine if there might be a compensatory up-regulation of NHE2 in NHE4-null mutant mice, expression of NHE2 mRNA was measured. However, there was no significant change in NHE2 mRNA expression in NHE4–/– mice as compared with wild-type controls. Changes in expression of the chief cell markers, pepsinogen, and intrinsic factor (20.Maeda M. Asahara S. Nishi T. Mushiake S. Oka T. Shimada S. Chiba T. Tohyama M. Futai M. J. Biochem.

Consistent with these previous studies, pepsinogen, and intrinsic factor were reduced by 94 and 81%, respectively in NHE4–/– stomachs. Immunoblot Analysis of Gastric H+,K+-ATPase—The reduction in mRNA expression for the gastric H+,K+-ATPase subunits suggested either a loss of parietal cells or a decrease in their maturation state. To confirm the reduction in H+,K+-ATPase levels, expression of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit protein was measured by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5A). Expression of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit in NHE4–/– mice was reduced to ∼5% of wild-type levels (Fig. 5B). Analysis of Histopathologic and Ultrastructural Changes in NHE4-null Gastric Mucosa—As compared with wild-type gastric mucosa (Fig. 6A), that of the NHE4 knockout was characterized by glands with an atrophic appearance; the cells did not appear to be stimulated despite the increase in gastrin mRNA expression (Fig. 6, B and C). The glands also had an increase in the amount of interglandular space (Fig. 6, D and E), which, on the basis of its staining characteristics, did not appear to be due to increased collagen. There was only a modest increase in the number of cells between the glands. NHE4 knockout gastric mucosa exhibited trends toward an increased number of cells in the glands and an increased thickness of the glandular epithelium (Table I); however, these were not statistically significant.Table IEpithelial cell populations of gastric glandsWTNHE4−/-p <Enteroendocrine cells (%)0.7 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.40.04Chief cells (%)14.2 ± 2.10.3 ± 0.20.0001Parietal cells (%)32.1 ± 3.52.0 ± 0.40.0001Mucous cells (%)40.1 ± 4.757.7 ± 6.60.035Other cells (%)12.8 ± 1.637.9 ± 6.40.0004Mitotic cells (%)0.08 ± 0.030.50 ± 0.190.026Number of cells/gland130.3 ± 20.0162.5 ± 26.0ns (0.32)aNot significant.Glandular epithelium thickness (μm)360.9 ± 21.5423.1 ± 23.6ns (0.062)aNot significant.a Not significant. Open table in a new tab NHE4–/– gastric glands had significant reductions in the number of readily discernable parietal and chief cells, and there were relative increases in the number of mucous cells (Table I). Among the mucous cells, pit and neck cells appeared normal when viewed by light microscopy and had typical mucous granules, but mucous cells in the base of the oxyntic gland, where chief cells are normally located, often stained blue with PAS/alcian blue (data not shown), indicating a switch from neutral to acidic polysaccharides. There were also increases in the number of enteroendocrine cells and in cells that were classified as “other” due to their relatively undifferentiated appearance. The 18-day-old NHE4–/– mice had significantly more cells that were classified as “other” than in the 9-week- and 6-month-old NHE4–/– mice. Unlike findings in gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit-deficient mice (15.Spicer Z. Miller M.L. Andringa A. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21555-21565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), there was no evidence of ciliated cells in NHE4–/– gastric mucosa. As shown in Fig. 7A, wild-type parietal cells were easily identified and characterized by a readily discernable canalicular network. In contrast, profiles of NHE4–/– parietal cells were small and canalicular development appeared to be impaired (Fig. 7B). Consistent with the retention of some gastric acid secretory capacity, NHE4–/– gastric mucosa did contain a few parietal cells with secretory membranes that appeared relatively normal (Fig. 7C). In NHE4–/– gastric mucosa, there was a modest, but significant, increase in cell death, characterized by both cells with highly vacuolated cytoplasm (necrosis, Fig. 7D) and cells with dense, packed chromatin (apoptosis, Figs. 7E and 8). Consistent with increased necrosis in NHE4–/– gastric glands, there was some evidence of inflammation, particularly eosinophilic infiltration with some tissue basophils/mast cells. The inflammatory cells in the lamina propria were mixed, with mostly plasma cells and small mononuclear cells, lesser numbers of mast cells/tissue basophils, and occasional small mononuclear cells, with eosinophils and neutrophils comprising the remainder of the inflammatory infiltrate.Fig. 8Histological detection of apoptotic cells in NHE4+/+ and NHE4–/– mice.A, TUNEL-positive cells (dark red cells) were relatively rare in NHE4+/+ gastric glands and mainly confined to the surface.

As shown in Fig. 8, the nuclear staining characteristic of DNA fragmentation occurring in cells undergoing apoptosis was observed at a higher frequency in NHE4–/– gastric glands. Light staining of the outermost mucus pit cells on the luminal surface of the stomach was observed at similar frequencies in both wild-type and NHE4–/– stomachs, although these cells did not appear to be apoptotic, as they had normal appearing nuclei and cytoplasm. However, unlike wild-type stomachs, in which TUNEL-positive staining was not observed within the glands, a small number of TUNEL-positive cells were observed throughout the gastric glands of NHE4–/– stomachs, consistent with the presence of apoptotic cells observed by light microscopy. Parietal cell morphology appeared to be altered in NHE4–/– gastric glands when examined by light microscopy and resembled to some degree that which was observed previously in AE2–/– gastric glands (12.Gawenis L.R.

https://openalex.org/W2126304802,"Rho family small G-protein activity is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that stimulate the release of GDP, thus allowing GTP binding. Once activated, Rho proteins control cell signaling through interactions with downstream effector proteins, leading to changes in cytoskeletal organization and gene expression. The ability of Rho family members to modulate the activity of other Rho proteins is also intrinsic to these processes. In this work we show that the Rac/Cdc42hs-regulated protein kinase PAK1 down-regulates the activity of the RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor NET1. Specifically, PAK1 phosphorylates NET1 on three sites in vitro: serines 152, 153, and 538. Replacement of serines 152 and 153 with glutamate residues down-regulates the activity of NET1 as an exchange factor in vitro and its ability to stimulate actin stress fiber formation in cells. Using a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes NET1 phosphorylated on serine 152, we show that PAK1 phosphorylates NET1 on this site in cells and that Rac1 stimulates serine 152 phosphorylation in a PAK1-dependent manner. Furthermore, coexpression of constitutively active PAK1 inhibits the ability of NET1 to stimulate actin polymerization only when serines 152 and 153 are present. These data provide a novel mechanism for the control of RhoA activity by Rac1 through the PAK-dependent phosphorylation of NET1 to reduce its activity as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor.

Rho family small G-proteins control many aspects of cell proliferation, including cytoskeletal organization, gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and cell division (1.Khosravi-Far R.

Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). They do so by acting as molecular switches, cycling between their active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. In their active states, small G-proteins initiate signaling by binding to and activating downstream effector proteins. The Rho family of small G-proteins currently consists of 21 cloned genes, of which RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42hs are the most thoroughly studied (5.Wherlock M. Mellor H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 239-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of Rho family small G-proteins is regulated by three classes of proteins known as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; NET1, neuroepithelioma transforming gene 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; V12Rac1, Rac contain a glycine 12 to valine substition; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β, γ-imidodiphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). GEFs regulate Rho GTPase activation by catalyzing the release of GDP, thus allowing the binding of GTP. GTPase activating proteins inactivate Rho proteins by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activities. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors preferentially bind to the inactive, GDP-bound forms of Rho proteins, thereby sequestering them from their sites of action. In this regulatory scheme it is the GEFs that control small G-protein activation in response to growth factor and mitogen stimulation. The Rho GEF family currently consists of 25 cloned genes and is predicted to contain upwards of 50 family members when fully characterized (7.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem.

Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10699) Google Scholar). Each Rho GEF displays a unique specificity for different Rho family small G-proteins. For example, the Rho GEF Dbl efficiently catalyzes GDP release for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42hs (11.Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Rho GEF Tiam1 specifically catalyzes nucleotide exchange only for Rac1 (12.Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanisms controlling the enzymatic activities of different Rho GEFs are equally diverse. These include binding to phosphoinositides, altered protein-protein interactions, changes in subcellular localization, and site-specific phosphorylation (9.Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 13.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). The Rho GEF Vav, for example, is activated by the combined effects of phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues and the binding of phosphoinositide 3,4,5-phosphate. This relieves the actions of an autoinhibitory domain and stimulates its GDP exchange activity toward Rho proteins (14.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R.

Similarly, the activity of the Rho GEFs Tiam1, Dbl, and FGR are positively regulated by phosphorylation (18.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 19.Kato J. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The neuroepithelioma transforming gene 1 (NET1) is a Rho GEF that was first identified in a screen for transforming genes in NIH 3T3 cell focus formation assays (21.Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar). It contains a negative regulatory domain in its amino terminus, and deletion of this domain creates an oncogenic form of the protein. In addition to transforming NIH 3T3 cells, expression of oncogenic NET1 stimulates actin stress fiber formation, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and serum response factor activation (21.Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently it was demonstrated that wild-type NET1 is localized in the nucleus, and that truncation of the amino terminus results in relocalization of a fraction of the NET1 to the cytoplasm. This was at least partially due to the elimination of two putative nuclear localization signals within the amino terminus (23.Schmidt A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14581-14588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, NET1 activity is regulated at least in part through subcellular localization. No other mechanisms controlling NET1 activity have been described. In this work we show that NET1 is negatively regulated through phosphorylation by the serine/threonine protein kinase PAK1. Specifically, PAK1 phosphorylates the oncogenic form of NET1 (NET1ΔN) on serines 152, 153, and 538 in vitro. Replacement of serines 152 and 153 with glutamate residues, which mimics their phosphorylation, inhibits the GDP exchange activity of NET1 toward RhoA in vitro, as well as the ability of NET1 to stimulate actin stress fiber formation in cells. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes NET1 phosphorylated on serine 152, we show that PAK1 phosphorylates this site in cells and that expression of constitutively active Rac1 stimulates the phosphorylation of NET1 on serine 152 in a PAK-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that PAK specifically down-regulates NET1 activity in cells only when serine 152 is intact. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism for controlling NET1 activity and provide an additional means by which Rac1 controls RhoA activity. Cells, Plasmids, and Recombinant Proteins—HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All NET1 eukaryotic expression constructs were contained in pEFHA (22.Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Full-length mouse NET1 (amino acids 1–595) and NET1ΔN-(122–595) were as described (22.Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). NET1-(156–595), NET1-(156–361), NET1-(362–501), NET1-(502–595), and NET1-(122–155) were created by PCR and sequenced to confirm correct amplification. Replacement of serines 152, 153, 538, and 557 with alanine or glutamic acid residues in any construct were also made by PCR, and the entire cDNA was sequenced to confirm correct amplification. Constitutively active PAK1 (PAK1 L107F) and the PAK1 autoinhibitory domain (amino acids 83–149) were contained in pCMV5M (24.Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For the production of GST fusion proteins, all NET1 cDNAs, as well as RhoA, were subcloned into pGEXKG (Amersham Biosciences). NET1 proteins and RhoA were produced in BL21 DE3 Escherichia coli (Stratagene) after transformation with the appropriate construct. One-liter cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.8, and expression of fusion proteins was stimulated by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 400 μm, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. Cell pellets were then collected by centrifugation and frozen. Cells were lysed and GST-NET1 fusion proteins or GST-RhoA were purified using a glutathione-agarose affinity resin (Sigma) essentially as described (24.Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). GST-RhoA was purified in the presence of 10 μm GDP. GST-PAK1 was purified from E. coli as described (25.Wang J. Frost J.A. Cobb M.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31641-31647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The concentration of each GST fusion protein was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) and confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Proteins were stored at –80 °C for later use. In Vitro Kinase Assays, Antibodies, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—GST-NET1 fusion proteins were phosphorylated in vitro with GST-PAK1 (26.Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)). Proteins were then resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. After drying the gel, phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Radioactive phosphate incorporated into NET1 was determined by scintillation counting of the excised protein bands. Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated NET1 proteins was performed as described (26.Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For production of the anti-phosphoserine 152 (anti-pSer-152) antibody, the peptide NH2-TKRR(pS)SALWSEC-COOH, corresponding to mouse NET1 amino acids 148–159 phosphorylated on serine 152, was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with this conjugate and the blood was recovered as described (Sigma-Genosys). Mouse and rabbit anti-hemagglutinin antibodies and mouse anti-GST were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For analysis of serine 152 phosphorylation by Western blotting, cells were lysed in RIPA plus phosphatase and protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); the DNA was sheared by 10 passages through a 23-gauge needle; and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged NET1 proteins were then immunoprecipitated from soluble lysates using a mouse anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were washed 3 × 1 ml with buffer A (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), followed by washing 1 × 1 ml with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-pSer-152 antibody was used for Western blotting by diluting in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) + 5% nonfat milk and incubating overnight at room temperature. All other antibodies were diluted in TBST + 0.025% nonfat milk and incubated with membranes for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (KPL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with TBST, the membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminesence. Quantification of Western blots was performed by densitometry followed by analysis using NIH Image. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—Exchange factor assays measuring NET1ΔN activity toward GST-RhoA in vitro were performed essentially as described (27.Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-RhoA was loaded with GDP for 5 min at room temperature in GDP loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm GDP, 100 μm AMP-PNP). Loading was terminated by the addition of MgCl2 (10 mm final concentration), followed by 15 min on ice. Aliquots of GDP-bound RhoA (88 pmol) were then mixed with GST or GST-NET1ΔN proteins (10 pmol) in GTP reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm AMP-PNP, 5 μm GTPγS, 10 μCi of [35S]GTPγS) and incubated at 30 °C. At specific times, portions of the reaction were removed (11 pmol of RhoA per time point) and the reaction was stopped by the addition of termination buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). Proteins were collected by filtration through 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose disks. The nitrocellulose was then washed with 15 ml of termination buffer and [35S]GTPγS-bound RhoA was detected by scintillation counting. Microinjection of NET1 Expression Plasmids—NIH 3T3 cells plated on glass coverslips were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.05% fetal bovine serum for 24 h prior to injection. All plasmids were injected into the nuclei of cells at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml as previously described (22.Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 h after injection, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 5 min followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature, and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-HA antibody (monoclonal antibody 12CA5) to detect expression of HA-tagged NET1 proteins. Co-expressed, Myc-tagged PAK L107F was detected using rabbit anti-Myc tag antibody (Invitrogen). Following extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, binding of primary antibodies was detected by incubating with donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies coupled to either fluorescein isothiocyanate or 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid, as indicated. F-actin morphology and accumulation were monitored by co-staining with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted on slides with Gelvatol and imaged with a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Spot CCD camera using fixed exposure times. Images were imported into the OpenLab software package. Relative fluorescence intensities of TRITC-phalloidin-labeled actin in injected and adjacent uninjected cells were recorded on a 0- to 256-bit scale. The fluorescence intensities from 5 to 10 injected, HA-tag expressing cells per experiment are reported as the mean intensity. Characterization of NET1 Phosphorylation by PAK1 in Vitro—To date there have been no descriptions of the biochemical mechanisms controlling the activity of the Rho GEF NET1. Because Rac1 has been reported to down-regulate the activity of RhoA (28.Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 29.Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O.W. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 30.Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we examined whether NET1 activity is regulated through phosphorylation by the Rac1 effector PAK1. We first examined whether PAK1 could phosphorylate NET1 in vitro. For these assays, wild-type NET1 and an amino-terminal truncated, transforming version of NET1 (NET1ΔN, amino acids 122–595) were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins and affinity purified. These proteins were then tested as PAK1 substrates in vitro using recombinant, constitutively active GST-PAK1. As shown in Fig. 1A, GST-PAK1 efficiently phosphorylated both full-length NET1 and NET1ΔN. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that both NET1 proteins were exclusively phosphorylated on serine residues (data not shown). We then constructed a series of deletion mutants to identify the subdomains of NET1 that were phosphorylated by PAK1. Thus, GST fusion proteins corresponding to the Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains (amino acids 156–361 and 362–501, respectively), as well as the amino- and carboxyl-terminal flanking regions (amino acids 122–155 and 502–592, respectively) were produced in bacteria and tested as PAK1 substrates. As shown in Fig. 1B, recombinant PAK1 efficiently phosphorylated flanking regions 122–155 and 502–595, but not the isolated Dbl or pleckstrin homology domains. Thus, in vitro, PAK1 phosphorylates multiple residues of NET1ΔN that are located in two distinct domains. Alignment of the amino acid sequences surrounding a number of published PAK1 substrates demonstrates that PAK1 phosphorylation sites often contain the consensus sequence (R/X)-(R/X)-X-S*-S/Φ, where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid. 2J. A. Frost, unpublished observations. Furthermore, in proteins containing two adjacent serine residues at the P0 and P+1 sites, the first serine is often preferentially phosphorylated. Thus, using this consensus sequence as a guide, we mutated potential PAK1 phosphorylation sites in both NET1-(122–155) and NET1-(156–595) to alanine, expressed these polypeptides as GST fusion proteins in E. coli, and tested them for phosphorylation by GST-PAK1 in vitro. The amino-terminal portion of NET1 contained two potential PAK1 phosphorylation sites, located at serines 152 and 153, with serine 152 predicted to be the preferred site. As shown in Fig. 1C, replacement of serine 152 with alanine reduced the phosphorylation of NET1-(122–155) to 72% of wild-type NET1-(122–155), whereas replacement of serine 153 had no effect. On the other hand, replacement of both serines with alanine (S152A/S153A) completely eliminated phosphorylation by PAK1. Thus, these data indicate that PAK1 phosphorylates NET1-(122–155) mainly on serine 152 in vitro, and that if this site is mutated to alanine, serine 153 will be used as a substrate instead. Phosphorylation of the serine at the P+1 position after mutation of the P0 serine to a non-phosphorylatable residue has been observed previously for the PAK1 substrates MEK1 and Raf-1 (26.Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 31.Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol.

Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We then identified the site phosphorylated by PAK1 in the C terminus of NET1. This sequence also contained two potential PAK1 phosphorylation sites, located at serines 538 and 557. However, substitution of these sites with alanines revealed that only serine 538 was phosphorylated by PAK1 in vitro (Fig. 1D). To confirm that we had identified all of the PAK1 phosphorylation sites in NET1ΔN, we then created a triple alanine mutant of NET1ΔN (S152A/S153A/S538A) and tested it as a substrate for PAK1. As shown in Fig. 1E, NET1ΔN containing the triple serine to alanine alteration was no longer phosphorylated by PAK1. Thus, PAK1 phosphorylates three sites on NET1ΔN in vitro: serines 152, 153, and 538 (Fig. 1F). Replacement of Serines 152 and 153 with Acidic Residues Inhibits the GDP Exchange Activity of NET1ΔN in Vitro—We next tested whether replacement of the PAK1 phosphorylation sites in NET1ΔN with alanine or glutamate residues affected the exchange factor activity of NET1ΔN toward RhoA in vitro. In these experiments, replacement with alanine was expected to be neutral in effect, whereas replacement with negatively charged glutamic acid was expected to mimic phosphorylation by PAK1. We first tested the effect of replacing serines 152 and 153 with alanine or glutamate. As shown in Fig. 2A, wild-type NET1ΔN efficiently catalyzed GTPγS binding by RhoA. In addition, replacing these serines with alanines did not significantly affect NET1ΔN enzymatic activity. However, substitution with glutamates at these sites significantly reduced the ability of NET1ΔN to stimulate GTPγS binding by RhoA. These data suggest that phosphorylation of serines 152 and 153 by PAK1 negatively regulates the ability of NET1ΔN to stimulate GDP exchange for RhoA. We then tested the effect of replacing serine 538 with alanine or glutamate. As shown in Fig. 2B, neither change significantly affected the exchange activity of NET1ΔN. This suggests that phosphorylation of serine 538 by PAK1 does not affect NET1ΔN activity toward RhoA. Lastly, we tested the effects of replacing all three PAK1 phosphorylation sites with alanine or glutamate residues. As shown in Fig. 2C, the triple alanine mutant exhibited the same GEF activity toward RhoA as wild-type NET1ΔN, but the triple glutamate mutant was much less effective at catalyzing GTPγS binding by RhoA. Similar results were observed with recombinant, full-length GST-NET1 (data not shown). Thus, we conclude from these experiments that phosphorylation of either NET1ΔN or full-length NET1 by PAK1 on serines 152 and 153 may negatively regulate NET1 activity toward RhoA, and that phosphorylation of serine 538 is likely to be without effect. Acidic Substitutions at the Amino-terminal PAK1 Phosphorylation Sites Block the Ability of NET1ΔN to Stimulate Actin Stress Fiber Formation—It has been shown that expression of NET1ΔN in cells stimulates F-actin accumulation and stress fiber formation, similar to the effect of expressing constitutively active RhoA (22.Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 cells, the two primary RhoA effectors are thought to be the formin mDia1 and Rho kinase, which nucleate and bundle actin filaments into stress fibers, respectively (33.Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To test whether alteration of the amino-terminal PAK1 phosphorylation sites affected the ability of NET1ΔN to regulate cytoskeletal organization, serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were microinjected with HA epitope-tagged NET1ΔN, or NET1ΔN containing alanine or glutamate substitutions at these sites. Four hours after injection, the cells were fixed and stained by indirect immunofluorescence for expression of NET1ΔN proteins (anti-HA) and filame"
https://openalex.org/W2103535655,"The CYBB gene encodes gp91Phox; a component of the phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase. CYBB transcription is restricted to myeloid cells differentiated beyond the promyelocyte stage. In undifferentiated myeloid cells, the homeodomain (HD) transcription factor HoxA10 represses CYBB transcription via a cis element in the proximal promoter. During myelopoiesis, phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in the HD decreases HoxA10 binding to this CYBB cis element. In the current studies, we found HoxA9 activates CYBB transcription in differentiated myeloid cells via the same cis element. We find HoxA9-mediated CYBB-transcription requires Pbx1 but is inhibited by Meis1. Additionally, phosphorylation of the conserved HD tyrosines increases HoxA9 binding to the CYBB promoter. The HOXA9 gene is involved in leukemia-associated translocations with the gene encoding Nup98, a nucleopore protein. We find expression of a Nup98-hoxA9 fusion protein blocks HoxA9-induced CYBB transcription in differentiating myeloid cells. In comparison to HoxA9, Nup98-hoxA9 has greater binding affinity for the CYBB cis element, but binding is not altered by HD tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, these studies identify CYBB as a common target gene repressed by HoxA10 and activated by HoxA9. These studies also suggest overexpression of Meis1 or Nup98-hoxA9 represses myeloid-specific gene transcription, thereby contributing to differentiation block in leukemogenesis.

These studies also suggest overexpression of Meis1 or Nup98-hoxA9 represses myeloid-specific gene transcription, thereby contributing to differentiation block in leukemogenesis. Hox proteins are homeodomain transcription factors that are highly conserved from Drosophila to human (1.Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliaccio E. Morelli F. Stornaiuolo A. Nitro V. Simeone A. Boncinelli A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10385-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Human HOX genes are arranged in four paralog groups (HoxA–D) on four chromosomes. During definitive hematopoiesis, HOX gene transcription proceeds 3′ to 5′ through each paralog group (1.Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliaccio E. Morelli F. Stornaiuolo A. Nitro V. Simeone A. Boncinelli A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10385-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Therefore, HOX1–4 genes are maximally transcribed in hematopoietic stem cells and HOX7–13 in committed progenitors (2.Sauvageau G. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Hogge D.E. Dragowska W.H. Reid D.S. Largman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12223-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Recent investigations indicate “Abd” HoxA proteins (HoxA7–11) are of particular interest to myelopoiesis and myeloid leukemogenesis. One HoxA protein that has received particular attention is HoxA9. Although few genuine HoxA9 target genes have been identified, much is known about the impact of this protein on myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis. For example, HoxA9 overexpression immortalizes cultured murine bone marrow myeloid cells, but does not block ex vivo differentiation (4.Calvo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M. Kapms M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, HoxA9 overexpression expands the progenitor pool but does not block differentiation in murine bone marrow transplantation experiments (5.Thorsteinsdottir U. Mamo A. Kroon E. Jerome L. Bijl J. Lawrence H.J. Humphries K. Sauvageau G. Blood. 2002; 99: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In such studies, HoxA9 overexpression induces leukemia only inconsistently, after a long latency (5.Thorsteinsdottir U. Mamo A. Kroon E. Jerome L. Bijl J. Lawrence H.J. Humphries K. Sauvageau G. Blood. 2002; 99: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 6.Kroon E. Krosl J. Thorsteindottir U. Banban S. Buchberg A.M. Sauvageau G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3714-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Of interest to the current studies, HoxA9 overexpression in murine myeloid cells does not impair granulocyte-colony stimulating factor- or macrophage-colony stimulating factor-induced expression of gp91Phox, a phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase protein (4.Calvo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M. Kapms M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Gp91Phox is encoded by the CYBB gene, and transcription of this gene is restricted to myeloid cells differentiated beyond the promyelocyte stage (7.Royer-Pokora B. Kunkel L.M. Monaco A.P. Goff S.C. Newburger P.E. Baihner L. Cole F.S. Curnutte J.T. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1986; 322: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 8.Newburger P.E. Dai Q. Whitney C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16171-16177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other investigations associate HoxA9 with myeloid leukemia. For example, HoxA9 overexpression is highly correlated with myeloid phenotype in pediatric leukemia (9.Golub T.R. Slonim D.K. Tamoy P. Huard C. Gassenbeek M. Mesirov J.P. Coller H. Loh M.L. Downing J.R. Caligiuri M.A. Bloomfield C.D. Landr E.S. Science. 1999; 286: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (9261) Google Scholar). Additionally, expression of leukemia-associated MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) fusion proteins increases expression of HoxA7, -9, -10, and Meis1 (also a homeodomain (HD) 1The abbreviations used are: HD, homeodomain; HA, hemagglutinin; IFN, interferon; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase. protein) in human leukemia and murine models (10.Armstrong S.A. Staunton J.E. Silverman L.B. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar, 11.Corral J. Lavenir I. Impey H. Cell. 1996; 85: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). However, MLL fusion proteins also induce leukemia in HoxA9-deficient mice, although the phenotype is “less myeloid” (12.Kumar A.R. Hudson W.A. Chen W. Nishiuchi R. Yao Q. Kersey J.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The HOXA9 gene is itself involved in leukemia-associated translocations. For example, translocations involving HOXA9 and the gene encoding the nucleopore protein Nup98 occur in some myeloid leukemias (13.Borrow J. Shearman A.M. Stanton V.P. Becher R. Collins T. Williams A.J. Dube I. Katz F. Kwong Y.L. Morris C. Ohuashiki K. Toyama K. Rowley J. Housman D.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These leukemias express a fusion protein with N-terminal Nup98 domains and the HoxA9 HD. Nup98-HoxA9 overexpression rapidly induces leukemia in murine bone marrow transplantation experiments (14.Kroon E. Thorsteinsdottir U. Mayotte N. Nakamura T. Sauvageau G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In microarray experiments, differences in gene expression were identified in myeloid leukemia cell lines overexpressing HoxA9 versus Nup98-A9 (3.Ghannam G. Takeda A. Camarata T. Maoore M.A. Viale A. Yaseen N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 866-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results suggest HoxA9 and Nup98-hoxA9 either interact with different target genes, exhibit differential impact on myelopoiesis (and therefore secondarily on gene expression), or both. HoxA9 binds DNA as a multiprotein complex with Pbx and/or Meis HD proteins. A DNA-binding site consensus sequence has been derived for HoxA9/Pbx, but few genuine target genes have been identified (15.Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Function of DNA-bound HoxA9/Pbx may vary during differentiation, because Pbx proteins interact with either co-repressors or co-activators in a signal-dependant manner (16.Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.-J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). HoxA9 also partners with Meis1 to bind DNA, with and without Pbx1 (17.Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Kwong A. Komuves L.G. Lawrence H.J. Largman D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3051-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HoxA9 plus Meis1 (but not HoxA9 plus Pbx1) rapidly induces myeloid leukemia in murine bone marrow transplantation experiments (6.Kroon E. Krosl J. Thorsteindottir U. Banban S. Buchberg A.M. Sauvageau G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3714-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HoxA9 plus Meis1 also blocks ex vivo cytokine-induced myeloid differentiation (18.Calvo K.R. Koepfler P.S. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M.P. Kamps M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13120-13125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Of interest to the current studies, this includes blocked induction of gp91Phox expression in differentiating cells (18.Calvo K.R. Koepfler P.S. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M.P. Kamps M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13120-13125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HoxA9 and -10 are similarly expressed during myeloid differentiation and in myeloid leukemia (2.Sauvageau G. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Hogge D.E. Dragowska W.H. Reid D.S. Largman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12223-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Additionally, both interact with Pbx proteins and recognize similar DNA-binding consensus sequences (15.Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We previously found HoxA10 represses transcription of the CYBB gene via a cis element homologous to the Hox/Pbx-DNA binding consensus (19.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HoxA10 repression of the CYBB gene is Pbx1-independent and occurs in undifferentiated myeloid cells (20.Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrijec J. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47792-47802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). During differentiation, phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in the HoxA10 HD decreases HoxA10 interaction with the CYBB cis element, decreasing repression (21.Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although conserved through the HD and Pbx interaction domains, HoxA9 and -10 proteins are otherwise divergent. Perhaps consistent with this, overexpressed HoxA10 induces myeloid leukemia in a Meis1-independent manner in murine bone marrow transplantation experiments (22.Thorsteinsdottir U. Sauvageau G. Hough M.R. Dragowska W. Lansdorp P.M. Lawrence H.J. Largman E. Humphries R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). One mechanism contributing to leukemogenesis is the HoxA10 differentiation block due to repression of myeloid specific genes (i.e. the CYBB gene). However, repression activity is abrogated by cytokine-induced HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggests that differentiation block by overexpressed HoxA10 would require additional mutations in cytokine signaling pathways. Consistent with this, leukemia induction due to HoxA10 overexpression has a latency of several months in murine bone marrow transplantation experiments (22.Thorsteinsdottir U. Sauvageau G. Hough M.R. Dragowska W. Lansdorp P.M. Lawrence H.J. Largman E. Humphries R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Although this latency is longer than in experiments with Nup98-A9 or Meis1 plus HoxA9 overexpression, it is rapid and reproducible in comparison to HoxA9-induced leukemia (6.Kroon E. Krosl J. Thorsteindottir U. Banban S. Buchberg A.M. Sauvageau G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3714-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Based on these results, the current studies investigate whether CYBB is a HoxA9 target gene. The first goal of these investigations is to determine whether HoxA9 and HoxA10 have redundant function with respect to regulation of myeloid-specific gene transcription during differentiation. Because of specific structural similarities and differences between HoxA9 and HoxA10, the second goal of these studies is to determine whether HD tyrosine phosphorylation similarly regulates DNA-binding affinity of the two proteins. Also, any model of HoxA9 function must address differences between HoxA9 and Nup98-A9, and the role of Meis1 in modulating HoxA9 activity. Our third goal is to address these issues in the context of CYBB gene regulation. Plasmids and PCR Mutagenesis—An HA-tagged HoxA9 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Corey Largman (University of California Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA), and subcloned into the pcDNAamp vector (HA-HoxA9/pcDNAamp). HoxA9 (not tagged) was obtained by PCR, and also subcloned into the pcDNAamp vector (HoxA9/pcDNAamp). The cDNA for Nup98 and Nup98a-A9 were obtained from Dr. Nabel Yaseen (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). These cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNAamp vector with and without HA epitope tags. The cDNA for Pbx1a was obtained from M. Cleary (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and subcloned into the pSRα vector, as previously described (19.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cDNA for Meis1b was obtained from Dr. Jeffrey Lawrence (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and subcloned into the pSRα vector. A HoxA9 cDNA sequence with point mutation of two residues in the Pbx interaction domain (residues 198 and 199 mutated to alanine, referred to as 198/199 HoxA9) or the two tyrosine residues in the homeodomain (tyrosines 212 and 225 to phenylalanine, referred to as Y212F/Y225F HoxA9) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Clontech QuikChange protocol. These mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNAamp vector for in vitro translation and transfection experiments. Mutant cDNAs were sequenced to verify that no unintended mutations had been introduced. Reporter gene assays were performed with a promoter/reporter construct with 450 bp of the promoter from the gene encoding gp91Phox (the CYBB gene) in the pCATE vector (Promega). This construct has differentiation-inducible reporter activity, as previously described (20.Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrijec J. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47792-47802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21.Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For other assays, an artificial promoter construct was generated with four copies of a CYBB cis element homologous to the Hox/Pbx binding consensus linked to a minimal promoter and a CAT reporter was used (the pTATACAT vector) (23.Scholer H.R. Balling R. Hazopoulos A.K. Suzuki N. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This construct is referred to as cybbTATACAT and has been previously described (19.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20.Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrijec J. Eklund E.A. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Core Facility of the University of Alabama, Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, or the Core Facility of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University. Oligonucleotides: derived consensus sequence for HoxA10/Pbx binding (dsA10); 5′-tgcgatgatttatgaccgc-3′, the Hox/Pbx-binding sequence from the CYBB promoter (–106 to –125 bp) (dscybb) (25.Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 5′-ccaatgattattagccaatt-3′. In these oligonucleotides, the Hox core is in boldface, the Pbx core is in italics, and ccaat boxes are underlined. Oligonucleotide nucleotides used in PCR for chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were designed to flank the Hox/Pbx binding CYBB cis element: 5′ PCR oligonucleotide (–133 to –106); 5′-tcagttgaccaatgattattagccaatt-3′,3′ PCR oligonucleotide (–6 to –32); and 5′-ctatgcttcttcttccaatgaccaaat-3′. Myeloid Cell Line Culture—The human myelomonocytic cell line U937 (26.Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Andrew Kraft (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Cells were maintained and differentiated as described previously (19.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). U937 cells were differentiated for 48 h with 500 units/ml human recombinant IFNγ (Roche Applied Science). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extract proteins were prepared by the method of Dignam (27.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 1475-1479Crossref Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with protease inhibitors (as described) (28.Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides probes were prepared, and EMSA and antibody supershift assays were performed as described (19.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Antibody to HoxA9, Pbx1a, Meis1, and HA epitope tag were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The HoxA9 antibody recognizes a peptide present in Nup98-hoxA9 but is not cross-reactive with other Hox proteins. In Vitro Translated Proteins—In vitro transcribed HoxA9, Y212F/Y225F HoxA9, and Nup98-A9 mRNA were generated from linearized template DNA using the Riboprobe System, according to manufacture's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). In vitro translated proteins were generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Control lysates were generated in similar reactions in the absence of input RNA. In vitro translated proteins were tyrosine de-phosphorylated with Yop protein tyrosine phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Proteins (10 μl of in vitro translated protein) were incubated 30 min at 30 °C, in a 20-μl reaction volume with 50 units of Yop and 1× reaction buffer. Control proteins were incubated similarly in 1× reaction buffer without Yop. De-phosphorylation of [35S]methionine-labeled, in vitro translated proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of anti-phospho tyrosine immunoprecipitated proteins, as previously described (21.Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). EMSA with in vitro translated proteins was performed as described (21.Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The amounts of in vitro translated proteins in DNA binding reactions were equalized by SDS-PAGE of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Cells were transfected by electroporation as described (21.Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). U937 cells (32 × 106 per sample) were transfected with 50 μg of 450pCATE or pCATE (see above); 60 μg of pcDNAamp, wild type or mutant HoxA9/pcDNAmp, or Nup98-A9/pcDNAamp; 30 μg of pSRα, Pbx1a/pSRα, or Meis1b/pSRα; and 15 μg of p-CMVβ-gal (to normalize for transfection efficiency). In other experiments, cells were transfected with the artificial promoter constructs 70 μg of cybbTATACAT, or control TATACAT (see above); 60 μg of pcDNAamp, wild type or mutant HoxA9/pcDNAmp, Nup98-A9/pcDNAamp, or Nup98 fragment/pcDNAamp; 30 μg of pSRα, Pbx1a/pSRα, or Meis1b/pSRα; and 15 μg of p-CMVβ-gal (to normalize for transfection efficiency). Transfectants were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 followed by 48 h with or without IFNγ (500 units/ml). Preparation of cell extracts, β-galactosidase and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CATs) assays were performed as described (29.Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 30.Sambrook H. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To generate lines stably expressing HoxA9 or Nup98-hoxA9, U937 cells were transfected with the mammalian expression vector pcDNAamp with HoxA9 or Nup98-hoxA9 with and without an HA-epitope tag or empty vector control plus the pSRα vector (for antibiotic selection). Cells were transfected and selected in G418 as previously described (28.Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were analyzed for HoxA9 or Nup98-hoxA9 overexpression by Western blot. Each experiment was repeated with two or three different transfectant pools and representative results are shown. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation was performed with 300 μg of nuclear proteins from U937 cells. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HoxA9 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or irrelevant rabbit anti-mouse antibody. Proteins were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with 2 μl of HoxA9 antibody or 2 μl of control rabbit antibody followed with 1-h incubation with 30 μlof50% Staphylococcus protein A-Sepharose bead slurry, as described (21.Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots were probed with anti-HoxA9 or anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence, according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Stably transfected U937 cells were cultured with or without IFNγ for 48 h. Cells for chromatin immunoprecipitation were incubated with formaldehyde prior to lysis, and lysates were sonicated to generate chromatin fragments with an average size of 2.0 kb, as described (31.Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Lysates underwent one round of immunoprecipitation with antibody to HoxA9, Meis1, or HA-epitope tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as indicated under “Results.” Control immunoprecipitation was performed with an irrelevant glutathione S-transferase antibody, as described (31.Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated chromatin was analyzed by PCR for antibody-specific co-precipitation of the Hox/Pbx binding cis element in the CYBB gene. Input chromatin was a positive control and chromatin precipitated by glutathione S-transferase antibody was a negative control. PCR products were analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The identity of the PCR product was verified by subcloning into a plasmid vector followed by dideoxy sequencing. HoxA9 Overexpression Increases CYBB Transcription in Differentiating U937 Myeloid Cells—Previously, we found HoxA10 represses CYBB transcription in undifferentiated U937 myeloid cells (19.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This repression requires HoxA10 interaction with a CYBB cis element homologous to the derived Hox/Pbx DNA-binding consensus sequence (referred to as the Hox/Pbx consensus-like CYBB cis element). U937 myeloid leukemia cells represent a pro-monocyte stage of differentiation and express very low levels of gp91Phox. IFNγ differentiation increases CYBB transcription and gp91Phox expression in these cells (19.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, HoxA10 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during U937 differentiation (19.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, because tyrosine phosphorylation decreases HoxA10 binding affinity for the CYBB cis element, IFNγ treatment decreases HoxA10 repression activity. Because the DNA-binding consensus sequences for HoxA9 and HoxA10 are similar, the current studies investigated the impact of HoxA9 on endogenous gp91Phox mRNA abundance and CYBB promoter activity. For these studies, U937 cells were stably transfected with a vector to express HoxA9 or empty vector control. Transfectant pools were selected (instead of clones) to compensate for potential integration site effects and three independent pools were studied. In initial experiments, we analyzed HoxA9 protein expression in these transfectants. Consistent with previous reports (32.Pinsonneault J. Florence B. Vaessin H. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2032-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found little HoxA9 expression in control U937 transfectants. In contrast, HoxA9 protein abundance was increased in stable transfectants with HoxA9 expression vector (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we investigated the impact of HoxA9 overexpression on gp91Phox mRNA abundance in U937 cells, with and without IFNγ differentiation. Total cellular RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot for gp91Phox message (Fig. 1B). We found HoxA9 overexpression does not alter gp91Phox expression in undifferentiated U937 cell in comparison to control transfectants. In contrast, overexpression of HoxA9 in IFNγ-treated cells increases gp91Phox expression in comparison to similarly treated control U937 transfectants. To determine whether this increase in gp91Phox mRNA represents increased CYBB transcription, the impact of HoxA9 on CYBB promoter activity was determined. U937 cells were transfected with a CAT reporter construct with 450 bp of the proximal CYBB promoter (previously described) (20.Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrijec J. Eklund E.A. J. Biol.

This 450 bp has IFNγ-inducible promoter activity and includes the Hox/Pbx consensus-like cis element, discussed above. U937 cells were co-transfected with vectors to overexpress various combinations of HoxA9 and Pbx1a. Transfectants were analyzed for reporter expression with and without IFNγ differentiation. In undifferentiated U937 transfectants, overexpression of HoxA9 did not alter CYBB promoter activity, with or without Pbx1a co-overexpression (Fig. 1C). Consistent with our previous results (24.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IFNγ increased CYBB promoter activity in U937 cells (Fig. 1C). In addition, HoxA9 overexpression induced a significant increase in CYBB promoter activity in differentiated transfectants (n = 7, p < 0.001). This HoxA9-transcriptional effect was significantly augmented by co-overexpression of Pbx1a in IFNγ-treated transfectants (n = 7, p < 0.001). Nup98-HoxA9 Blocks Induction of CYBB Transcription during U937 Differentiation—Overexpression of the Nup98-hoxA9 leukemia-associated fusion protein induces acute myeloid leukemia in murine bone marrow transplantation experiments (19.Eklund E.A.

The activity of Ras is up-regulated by cellular agents, including both protein (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and redox-active agents (nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion radical ( O2·¯)). We have recently elucidated the mechanism by which NO promotes guanine nucleotide dissociation of redox-active NKCD motif-containing Ras and Ras-related GTPases. In this study, we show that guanine nucleotide dissociation is enhanced upon exposure of the redox-active GTPases, Ras and Rap1A, to O2·¯ and provide evidence for the efficient guanine nucleotide reassociation in the presence of the radical quenching agent ascorbate to complete guanine nucleotide exchange. In vivo, guanine nucleotide reassociation is necessary to populate Ras in its biologically active GTP-bound form after the dissociation of GDP. We further show that treatment of the redox-active GTPases with O2·¯ releases GDP in form of an unstable the oxygenated GDP adduct, putatively assigned as 5-oxo-GDP. 5-Oxo-GDP was not produced from either the C118S or the F28L Ras variants upon the treatment of O2·¯, supporting the involvement of residues Cys118 and Phe28 in O2·¯−mediated Ras guanine nucleotide dissociation. These results indicate that the mechanism of O2·¯−mediated Ras guanine nucleotide dissociation is similar to that of NO/O2-mediated Ras guanine nucleotide dissociation.

The p21Ras proto-oncoprotein (Ras) is a founding member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases and plays an important role in a number of biological processes involved in cellular growth control, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (1.Campbell S.L.

Ras cycles between an inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound form to modulate association with regulators and downstream targets. High affinity interactions with downstream effectors are achieved via interaction with GTP-bound Ras rather than the GDP-bound form of Ras, which in turn leads to effector activation, stimulation of downstream signaling pathways, and a plethora of biological responses (3.Downward J.

Given the importance of Ras in various growth control processes, the population of Ras in its biologically active GTP-bound or inactive GDP-bound form is critically regulated by cellular factors. For example, the intrinsically slow rate of Ras guanine nucleotide dissociation and GTP hydrolysis is modulated by regulatory proteins and free radicals. GTPase-activating proteins down-regulate Ras activity by stimulating the intrinsically slow rate of GTP hydrolysis to populate Ras in its inactive GDP-bound form, whereas guanine nucleotide exchange factors, reactive nitrogen species, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; NO, nitric oxide; WT, wild type; GNE, guanine nucleotide exchange; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; AIm-DP, 5-amino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; AOn-DP, 5-amino-oxazolone ribose diphosphate; DIm-DP, 5-diamino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; IIm-DP, 5-imino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; NIm-DP, 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole; Mant, N-methylanthraniloyl.

NO is the best characterized redox modulator of Ras activity as NO has been shown to promote Ras GDP dissociation in vitro, GTP binding to Ras in vivo, and stimulation of pathways downstream of Ras (9.Baker T.

Our recent studies indicated that ·NO2, a reaction product of NO with O2, reacts with the Ras Cys118 thiol to produce a Ras Cys118-thiyl radical (Ras-S118·) intermediate (22.Heo J. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2314-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Once generated, Ras-S118· induces a series of radical reactions involving the Phe28 side chain and the Ras-bound GDP base to cause the conversion of Ras-bound GDP into a Ras-bound GDP neutral radical (G·-DP) (23.Heo J. Prutzman K.C. Mocanu V. Campbell S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1423-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ras-bound G·-DP further reacts with an additional ·NO2 to produce a GDP-NO2 adduct, 5-nitro-GDP. 5-Nitro-GDP can then be degraded into NIm-DP by decarboxylation of the 5-nitro-GDP C6 atom. This NO/O2-mediated radical-based process perturbs Ras GDP binding interactions, resulting in the dissociation of GDP from Ras in the form of 5-nitro-GDP (23.Heo J. Prutzman K.C. Mocanu V. Campbell S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1423-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to NO, ROS have also been shown to activate GNE on Ras and Ras-related GTPases (8.Adachi T.

Early evidence for ROS-mediated activation of Ras was obtained in studies in which various oxidative agents (i.e. H2O2 and hemin) could enhance GNE on Ras in vitro and enhance Ras-mediated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity in Jurkat cells (15.Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of NF-κB activity by these oxidative agents was blocked by expression of a dominant negative Ras mutant, suggesting that direct activation of Ras may be a central mechanism by which a variety of oxidative redox-stress stimuli transmit their signals to the nucleus (15.Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Recently, Adachi et al. (8.Adachi T. Pimentel D.R.

Notably, the redox potential of O2·¯ (E7 = ∼0.9 versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) is higher than that of thiyl radical (R-S·.)(E7 =∼0.8 V versus NHE) (34.Buettner G.R. Arch. Biochem.

For example, a constitutively active oncogenic Ras variant was observed to up-regulate expression of the NADPH homologue, Nox1 (17.Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Conversely, this study also showed that small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of Nox1 expression blocked transforming phenotypes (anchorage-independent growth, morphological changes, and production of tumors in athymic mice) associated with Ras up-regulation (16.Mitsushita J. Lambeth J.D. Kamata T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting that the production of O2·¯ by Nox1 is required for oncogenic Ras transformation. Similarly, it has been shown that Ras-triggered cell growth can be blocked by suppression of O2·¯ production from NADPH oxidase (18.Chuang J.I. Chang T.Y. Liu H.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the redox-active NKCD motif-containing Rap1A, a member of the Ras subclass of GTPases, has been observed to colocalize with NADPH oxidase (40.Leusen J.H. Verhoeven A.J. Roos D. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: d72-d90PubMed Google Scholar). Although Ras and Rap proteins commonly regulate activation of the MAP kinase cascade in some cell types (41.Stork P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), they regulate distinct cellular effectors. In fact, Rap GTPases are best characterized as critical regulators of integrin-mediated cell adhesion; however, their mechanism of action is poorly understood (42.Kinbara K. Goldfinger L.E. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 767-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Since the redox-active Rap1A GTPase colocalizes with NADPH oxidase (40.Leusen J.H. Verhoeven A.J. Roos D. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: d72-d90PubMed Google Scholar) and is sensitive to NO (19.Saavedra A.P. Tsygankova O.M. Prendergast G.V. Dworet J.H. Cheng G. Meinkoth J.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20.Mittar D. Sehajpal P.K. Lander H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it is possible that Rap1A activity may also be regulated by O2·¯ produced from NADPH oxidase. Although these in vivo results support the intriguing possibility that O2·¯ mediates regulation of Ras and Ras-related GTPase activities, direct modulation has not been demonstrated. Results from this study demonstrate that O2·¯ facilitates guanine nucleotide dissociation from Ras as well as Rap1A. We also provide evidence that the molecular mechanism of O2·¯−mediated guanine nucleotide dissociation is similar to that of the NO/O2-mediated guanine nucleotide dissociation. Preparation of Chemicals—The chemicals used for all experiments were of the highest grade unless otherwise noted. Radiolabeled GDP ([3H]GDP) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The radiolabeled GDP was diluted with unlabeled guanine nucleotide prior to use, giving ∼1,000 dpm/μm GDP. Uniformly enriched [13C-15N]GDP (95%) was obtained from Martek. Preparation of Protein Samples—Human H-Ras-(1–166), Ras F28L, Ras C118S, and Rap1A-(1–184) were expressed and purified as described previously (44.Campbell-Burk S.L. Carpenter J.W.

The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (46.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Xanthine oxidase was purchased from Sigma. Bovine liver catalase (40,000 units/mg) and bovine liver superoxide dismutase (50,000 units/mg, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase) were purchased from Sigma and further purified using a size-exclusion column (Sephacryl S-100, 2.5 × 60 cm) prior to use. Generation and Quantification of O2·¯—Xanthine oxidase was used to generate O2·¯. All kinetic assays and mass spectrometry (MS) sample preparations were performed in serum-stoppered sealed cuvettes and vials to avoid diffusion of xanthine oxidase produced O2·¯ into the open atmosphere. To prevent the transition metal-mediated conversion of the O2·¯ radical into H2O2 and OH· (47.Khan A.U. Kasha M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12365-12367Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), all buffers used for kinetic and biochemical assays were passed through a metal-chelating Bio-Rad Chelex-100 cation exchange column (48.Heo J. Staples C.R. Halbleib C.M. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7956-7963Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and EDTA (0.5 mm) was added to the buffers prior to performing the experiments, unless otherwise noted. The rate of O2·¯ production by xanthine oxidase (XOk) was determined by employing a methylene blue-coupled assay. Briefly, various amounts of xanthine oxidase were added to assay buffer containing 0.5 μm oxidized methylene blue, 10 mm xanthine, 20 mm GDP, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EDTA in ammonium acetate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5). The decrease in absorbance at 500 nm monitored over time (0–10 s) using a Shimadzu UV-2501 spectrophotometer corresponds to reduction of oxidized methylene blue due to coupling with xanthine oxidase-mediated oxidation of xanthine to uric acid. It has been reported that xanthine oxidase produces ∼30% O2·¯ and ∼70% H2O2/enzyme turnover in the presence of its substrates O2 and xanthine (49.Hodges G.R. Young M.J. Paul T. Ingold K.U. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Given these values (49.Hodges G.R. Young M.J. Paul T. Ingold K.U. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the total amount of O2·¯ produced by xanthine oxidase for a given time t can be approximated following Equation 1. [O2·¯]≈0.3×XOk×t (Eq. 1) Kinetic Measurements of Guanine Nucleotide Exchange on Ras and Rap1A—Excess amounts of xanthine oxidase, its substrate xanthine, or catalase do not interfere with either the fluorescence intensity of the mant-labeled 2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)guanosine 5′-diphosphate (mant-GDP) or the GDP binding properties of Ras and Rap1A. Therefore, we employed a mant-GDP fluorescence assay (50, to conduct kinetics. 51) studies of O2·¯−mediated Ras and Rap1A guanine nucleotide dissociation. Wild-type (WT) Ras, the Ras variants C118S and F28L, and Rap1A were preloaded with mant-GDP as described previously (50.Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 51.Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7420-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A standard assay mixture for the fluorescence measurements consisted of 10 mm xanthine, 20 mm GDP, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EDTA in ammonium acetate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5). Once the GTPases was loaded with mant-GDP, xanthine oxidase was added, and the dissociation of mant-GDP from the GTPase was measured as a change in the fluorescence intensity over time using a LS50B PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorimeter. Apparent second-order rates of O2·¯−mediated Ras and Rap1A GDP dissociation (app O2·¯koff) were determined by fitting the data to a simple exponential decay. We also employed 3H-radiolabeled GDP to assess the rates of Ras GDP dissociation and association in the presence of O2·¯. To measure the rate of O2·¯−mediated Ras GDP dissociation, [3H]GDP-preloaded Ras was treated with O2·¯ in the presence of free unlabeled GDP, and the dissociation of [3H]GDP from Ras was measured as a change in Ras radioactivity over time using Beckman-Coulter scintillation counter. To assess the rate of O2·¯−mediated Ras GDP association in the absence and presence of ascorbate, ascorbate was added at time t to the O2·¯−treated sample followed by the addition of excess free [3H]GDP. Apparent rates of O2·¯−mediated GDP dissociation (app O2·¯koff) and GDP association (app O2·¯kon) of Ras were determined by fitting the data to a simple exponential decay and exponential association, respectively. As xanthine oxidase can continuously produce O2·¯ with time, the concen tration of O2·¯ produced by xanthine oxidase is not fixed during the process of O2·¯−mediated GTPase GNE. However, the true first-order constant for rate GDP dissociation of O2·¯−mediated Ras and Rap1A (true O2·¯koff) can be determined by compensating the experimentally measured app O2·¯koff according to Equation 2 (52.McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2782-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 53.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. A Wiley-Interscience, New York1993: 85-89Google Scholar). trueO2·¯koff=( appO2·¯koff+XOpseudok)/[O2·¯] (Eq. 2) where XO pseudok represents the pseudo-zero-order rate of xanthine oxidase produced by O2·¯. To determine the dissociation constant for Ras GDP in the presence of O2·¯( O2·¯KD), fluorescent-based measurements were employed. Xanthine oxidase was incubated for a given time t prior to the addition of Ras. The amount of O2·¯ that accumulated over a given time t was estimated using Equation 1. The initial first-order rates of O2·¯−mediated Ras GDP dissociation (initial O2·¯koff) were fit to a single exponential decay to eliminate contributions of O2·¯ (continuously produced by the enzymatic action of xanthine oxidase during the assay time period) on O2·¯−mediated Ras guanine nucleotide dissociation. This approach avoids the conversion of apparent. kinetic values into true values (Equation 2). The estimated initial O2·¯koff values were then plotted against the concentration of O2·¯, and O2·¯KD was determined by fitting the plot to a simple hyperbola. The estimated O2·¯KD value and true O2·¯koff can be used to determine the value of true O2·¯kon using Equation 3. O2·¯KD=trueO2·¯koff/trueO2·¯kon (Eq. 3) Preparation of Ras and Rap1A-released Nucleotide Nitration Product—An aliquot of Ras or Rap1A protein was introduced into the xanthine oxidase-containing assay solution, and the mixture was incubated for 300 s. The Ras or Rap1A-released nucleotide oxygenation product(s) was separated from Ras or Rap1A protein using a centricon (10-kDa cut off, Millipore). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Ras or Rap1A-released nucleotide oxygenation product(s) was acidified with formic acid prior to sample application since MS analysis requires the samples to be positively charged. Thus, only charged ions (i.e. [M+H]+) were observed so that the molecular masses determined by MS are 1 Da higher than the molecular masses for the same chemicals at neutral pH (i.e. pH 7.5). Briefly, an aliquot of the sample was dissolved in 50% methanol:0.1% formic acid and analyzed within 30 min by nanospray mass spectrometry on an ABI QSTAR-Pulsar QTOF MS spectrometer with a nanoelectrospray source (Applied Biosystems Division, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sample (∼1 μl) was loaded into a Protana distal coated nanospray needle (Protana, Odense, Denmark), and spectra were acquired over a mass range of 400–500 in MS mode.

In eukaryotes the DNA is packed into nucleosomes consisting of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of small basic histone proteins (1Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B-C. Love W.E.

The nucleosome constitutes the basic repeating unit of chromatin, and formation of a regularly spaced nucleosome chain during chromatin assembly is a prerequisite to maintain the biological activity of chromatin. This requires ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factors as well as so-called histone chaperones (5Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys.

This activity appears essential to cell viability, because simple mixing of histones and DNA in vitro at physiological salt concentrations leads to the rapid formation of poorly defined insoluble aggregates (11Nakagawa T.

NAP1 is highly acidic, which is likely to mediate its interaction with the positively charged histone proteins. It is thought to function in large chromosomal domains rather than at local restricted sites (5Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and in yeast loss of NAP1 leads to an altered gene expression of about 10% of the genome (15Ohkuni K. Shirahige K. Kikuchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NAP1 is present at micromolar concentrations throughout the cell cycle, and an increase of the NAP1 concentration during S-phase has been reported for some NAP1 homologues in higher eukaryotes (16Dong A.

Several studies focused on the determination of the association state of NAP1, which in yeast has a monomer molecular mass of 47.9 kDa. By gel filtration or gradient centrifugation very different molecular masses ranging from 120 to 600 kDa and sedimentation coefficients from 1.5 S up to 7 S were reported. In a recent study it was concluded based on analytical ultracentrifugation experiments that yNAP1 exists as complex mixture of species with s values between 4.5 and 12 S at physiological salt concentrations (75 and 150 mm NaCl). In the presence of 500 mm NaCl concentration a 4.5 S NAP1 dimer was identified (26McBryant S.J. Peersen O.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10592-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It appears that upon mixing NAP1 with histones distinct complexes are formed, which sediment around 5–6 S, 8 S, and 10–12 S, respectively (13Ishimi Y. Hirosumi J. Sato W. Sugasawa K. Yokota S. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Ishimi Y. Sato W. Kojima M. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Cell Struct.

Within the 12 S complex all four histones cosedimented in nearly equal amounts, and upon addition of DNA nucleosomes were formed. The 5–6 S complex was assigned to a NAP1 complex with the H2A·H2B dimer and the 8 S complex to a complex that contains NAP1 and the (H3·H4)2 tetramer (13Ishimi Y. Hirosumi J. Sato W. Sugasawa K.

Hence, the biologically highly relevant interaction of NAP1 with histones appears to be tightly connected to the NAP1 association state. In particular, the nature of the different NAP1 complexes observed previously at physiological ionic strength and their relation to specific NAP1 activities remain to be elucidated.Here, we have used analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) to determine the different association states of NAP1 on its own and in complexes with histones. AUC is very useful for the identification of the oligomeric state and the stoichiometry of proteins, and to characterize their thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties in solution (27Laue T.M. Stafford 3rd., W.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 28Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence of the equilibrium between different NAP1 species was quantified in terms of the corresponding dissociation constants. At physiological protein and salt concentrations the dominating species were the NAP1 dimer and octamer, which were also the association states found to interact with histones. Based on these results and estimates of the intracellular concentration of NAP1 we propose a model, in which the transport/exchange of H2A·H2B dimers in G1 and G2 phase is mediated by NAP1 dimers. The accumulation of NAP1 in the nucleus during S phase induces the association of NAP1 into an octamer complex. This species has eight histone binding sites so that it could act as a carrier for multiple histone dimers as required for the de novo assembly of nucleosomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of NAP1—Yeast NAP1 was expressed from plasmid pET28-yNAP1 from Toshio Tsukiyama with a N-terminal His tag. The plasmid corresponds to Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAP1 with a T7 tag cloned into the NdeI site of pET28a. The His tag is followed by a thrombin cleavage site. The expressed NAP1 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 52.4 kDa with the His tag and 49.5 kDa after thrombin cleavage. Protein overexpression from pET28-yNAP1 was in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) carrying the pLysS plasmid. For purification, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0. 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Pefabloc), sonicated, and centrifuged. Nickel-agarose beads were equilibrated with lysis buffer and added to the supernatant after supplementing MgCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mm. Binding was allowed for 3–4 h at 4 °C, and beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Pefabloc). Elution was conducted with washing buffer supplemented with 0.5 m imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm M KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA). The protein was further purified on a Mono-Q column and eluted with a KCl gradient from 0.1 to 1 m in buffer A. Fractions were checked on SDS-PAGE, and NAP1-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A. DNase activity was tested by incubating NAP1 with supercoiled plasmid DNA over 2 days. For some experiments the His tag was removed by binding purified NAP1 to nickel-agarose and incubating with biotin-tagged thrombin for 2 h at 20 °C using the thrombin cleavage kit according to the specifications given by the manufacturer (Novagen, Madison, WI). Thrombin was subsequently removed with streptavidin beads. Using the program SEDNTERP 2J. Philo, D. Hayes, and T. Laue, available at www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm. (29Laue T.M. Shah B.D.

A reducing agent was removed by repeated concentration and dilution of histone proteins in freshly degassed labeling buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EDTA) using Vivaspin 20 concentrators (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). Labeling was carried out at a histone monomer concentration of ∼60 μm with a 1.5 times molar excess of Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands) for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubating for 30 min on ice. Labeled histone complexes were then purified from misfolded histone and free dye using BioRex 70 resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH) as described before (32Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8959-8964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Concentration of labeled histones and labeling efficiency were assessed by absorbance spectroscopy using an excitation coefficient of ϵ496 = 72,000 m–1·cm–1 for the Alexa 488 label (34Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 9th Ed. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR2004: 20-36Google Scholar) and the published values for the histones at a wavelength of 276 nm (30Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) after subtracting the contribution of Alexa 488 at this wavelength. A labeling efficiency of 70% was routinely reached for H2A12C and 50% for H4K5C, and the labeled histones behaved identically to the wild type in terms of association state. Agarose gel electrophoresis of NAP1 complexes with labeled histones was conducted on 1% agarose gels in 0.11× TBE (10 mm Tris, 10 mm boric acid, 0.22 mm EDTA) supplemented with 10 mm KCl. NAP1 and histones were mixed prior to loading in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl and incubated for at least 10 min at room temperature. Bands were visualized by illumination with a UV-light box at 302 nm and detection by using a charge-coupled device camera.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was carried out at 20 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60 Ti rotor. The partial specific volume v¯ at this temperature was determined from the amino acid composition to be 0.726 ml·g–1 for NAP1, 0.746 ml·g–1 for the histones, and 0.730 ml·g–1 for the NAP1-histone complexes using the program SEDNTERP version 1.05 2J. Philo, D. Hayes, and T. Laue, available at www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm. (29Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Hydration values of 0.44 g of H2O per g of NAP1, 0.39 g of H2O per g of histone, and 0.43 g of H2O per g of NAP1·histone complex were calculated as described previously (35Rippe K. Mücke N. Schulz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 915-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proteins were dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol and 10 or 100 mm KCl prior to analysis. The density ρ of the buffer was 1.0133 g·ml–1 (10 mm KCl) and 1.0176 g·ml–1 (100 mm KCl), and the viscosity η was 1.1680 mPa·s (10 mm KCl) and 1.1667 mPa·s (100 mm KCl) at 20 °C as calculated with SEDNTERP.Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation runs were performed with NAP1 concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 32 μm and at speeds of 5,000, 7,000, and 10,000 rpm and for some runs also at 3,000 and 15,000 rpm. The NAP1-H2Af·H2B complexes were studied with 3 μm H2Af·H2B dimer (6 μm histone monomer) and 6 μm NAP1. In addition, experiments were conducted, in which the NAP1 concentration was varied from 3 to 12 μm. NAP1 and H3·H4f were mixed at a 1:1 monomer ratio using 8.6 μm H3·H4f dimer and 17.3 μm NAP1. Equilibrium was obtained after 24–30 h as judged from a comparison of scans recorded at intervals of 4 h. Absorbance data were collected at 230 and 280 nm by averaging 10 scans with radial increments of 0.001 cm in step mode. Absorbance values above 1.3 were not included in the analysis. The sedimentation equilibrium data were analyzed by global fitting of all data sets of a given sample with the software UltraScan version 6.2 (www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu) from Borries Demeler. A monomer-dimer, dimer-octamer, or dimer-octamer-hexadecamer model was used as described in the text. Other models that involved a NAP1 dimer as basic building block and included tetramers or hexamers were also tested but did not lead to good fits. All fits derived according to Reactions 1, 2, 3, 4 had a fit quality of 35% or higher, with a value of >30% being considered as an adequate model for the data.Analytical sedimentation velocity studies were conducted at 20 °C and at 35,000 and 42,000 rpm in epon double-sector cells and in the same buffer used for the equilibrium runs. The NAP1 concentration was between 1 and 4 μm for the analysis of NAP1 complexes. For experiments with histones 3 μm H2A·H2B dimer (6 μm histone monomer) and 6 μm NAP1 monomer or 20 μm NAP1 and 10 μm H3·H4f dimer (20 μm histone monomer) were used. Data were collected at 230, 280, or 496 nm using a spacing of 0.03 cm in a continuous scan mode. A global analysis of the sedimentation velocity experiments was conducted with the program SEDPHAT version 2.0 (www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com) (36Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The local residual mean square deviation was between 0.006 and 0.011 for single and global fits. The same models as in the equilibrium runs were used with an instantaneous equilibrium between different association states corresponding to kinetic off-rate constants that are equal or faster than 0.1/s.RESULTSNAP1 Associates into Dimer, Octamer, and Hexadecamer— Yeast NAP1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by His tag affinity and ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1A). A contaminating DNase activity present in the eluate from the nickel-chelating resin was removed by a second chromatography step on a Mono-Q ion exchange column. After the final purification step the protein was more than 95% pure and the preparation had no detectable DNase activity as tested by incubation with supercoiled plasmid substrate at 37 °C over several days and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). For some AUC experiments the His tag of NAP1 was removed by thrombin digestion to test if the tag effects the association state. The His tag was cut off quantitatively under appropriate conditions with hardly any additional degradation of the protein (Fig. 1B). NAP1 preparations equivalent to those obtained after 6–22 h of digestion were used in subsequent AUC experiments.Binding of NAP1 to histones was studied with histone H2A·H2B and H3·H4 complexes that were reconstituted from overexpressed and purified recombinant histones (30Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The heterodimer/tetramer complexes were prepared with the fluorescent dye Alexa 488 covalently attached to either H2A or to H4 in a site-specific manner (see “Experimental Procedures”). These labeled H2Af or H4f histones displayed an additional absorbance maximum at 496 nm and a fluorescence maximum at about 520 nm allowing specific detection of NAP1-histone complexes by absorbance and fluorescence measurements. Fig. 1C shows a Coomassie-stained SDS-gel with the purified histone H2Af·H2B and H3·H4f complexes and a reconstituted histone octamer preparation as a reference. The SDS-gel demonstrates that the histone preparations are highly purified and that H2Af and the H4f displayed the expected fluorescence signal upon excitation of the Alexa 488 fluorophore. The recombinant histones H2A und H2B from X. laevis have a very similar mobility under standard electrophoretic conditions and are hardly separated (37Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).The association states of NAP1 in absence of histones were determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Typical data sets are displayed in Fig. 2(A and B), and the results are summarized in Table I. Initial runs at approximately physiological salt concentrations (100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2) revealed a complex multispecies equilibrium. To identify the basic building blocks of the NAP1 multimers the salt concentration was varied from 10 mm to 1 m KCl. At 10 mm KCl an excellent fit of the data was obtained over a concentration range from 0.5 to 13.4 μm NAP1 with a monomer-dimer model and a monomer molecular mass constrained to 51.3 kDa as calculated from the amino acid composition (Fig. 2A) according to Reaction 1. 2NAP1⇄(NAP1)2 Reaction 1 A dissociation constant of Kd1–2 = 0.2 × 10–6 m was determined. At NAP1 concentrations well above the dissociation constant (measurements at 6.7, 8.1, and 13.4 μm) the data could be described well with a single component fit. A molecular mass of 104 ± 4 kDa was obtained with the molecular mass being the only fit parameter and using the calculated values for the partial specific volume v¯=0.726 ml·g−1 of NAP1 and a buffer density of ρ = 1.0133 g·ml–1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). This result is in excellent agreement with the calculated value of 102.7 kDa for the NAP1 dimer. Thus, NAP1 forms a dimer in low salt buffer, which is the building block for the oligomers formed at physiological salt concentrations. This finding confirms a previous study, in which the NAP1 dimer was identified as the basic association state (26McBryant S.J. Peersen O.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10592-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the molecular mass of the NAP1 dimer of 102.7 kDa was used in further experiments as a fixed parameter to determine the higher association states at physiological buffer conditions and in complexes with histones.Fig. 2Analytical ultracentrifugation of NAP1. The left panel shows the experimental data and the fitted curves in dependence of the radial position. On the right the residuals of the fits are plotted. Equilibrium centrifugation experiments were carried out at 20 °C and at 5,000, 7,000, and 10,000 rpm as shown in A and B. Representative sedimentation velocity runs conducted at 35,000 rpm (C) and 42,000 rpm (D) are shown with every fifth scan being included in the plot. A and C, NAP1 in buffer containing 10 mm KCl was fitted with a monomer-dimer equilibrium (Reaction 1) with the molecular mass of the monomer fixed at 51.3 kDa.

https://openalex.org/W2058595731,"We describe a novel Drosophila gene, dtl (Drosophila Tat-like), which encodes a 60-kDa protein with RNA binding activity and a methyltransferase (MTase) domain. Dtl has an essential role in Drosophila development. The homologs of DTL recently described include PIMT (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein with a methyltransferase domain), an RNA-binding protein that interacts with and enhances the nuclear receptor coactivator function, and TGS1, the methyltransferase involved in the formation of the 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (m3G) cap of non-coding small RNAs. DTL is expressed throughout all of the developmental stages of Drosophila. The dtl mRNA has two ORFs (uORF and dORF). The product of dORF is the 60-kDa PIMT/TGS1 homolog protein that is translated from an internal AUG located 538 bp downstream from the 5′ end of the message. This product of dtl is responsible for the formation of the m3G cap of small RNAs of Drosophila. Trimethylguanosine synthase activity is essential in Drosophila. The deletion in the dORF or point mutation in the putative MTase active site results in a reduced pool of m3G cap-containing RNAs and lethality in the early pupa stage. The 5′ region of the dtl message also has the coding capacity (uORF) for a 178 amino acid protein. For complete rescue of the lethal phenotype of dtl mutants, the presence of the entire dtl transcription unit is required. Transgenes that carry mutations within the uORF restore the MTase activity but result in only partial rescue of the lethal phenotype. Interestingly, two transgenes bearing a mutation in uORF or dORF in trans can result in complete rescue.

(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein with a methyltransferase domain), was recently identified in mammalian cells and described as a component of a transcriptional coactivator complex that enhances the nuclear receptor coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein function (1.Zhu Y.

The RNA-binding domain of the 852 amino acid PIMT was mapped to its N-terminal domain, which contains the GXXGXXI sequence often present in the K homology domain of RNA-binding proteins. Another characteristic of PIMT is the presence of a MTase domain at its C terminus. Indeed, PIMT bound AdoMet; however, a truncated version of the protein that lacked the putative MTase but contained the RNA-binding domain still had the ability to enhance the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors (1.Zhu Y.

A homolog of PIMT has been described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the product of the YPL157w gene, an AdoMet-dependent MTase (3.Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonne R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In yeasts, YPL157w is not essential. Its deletion affects splicing and results in a cold-sensitive phenotype. By analyzing the effects of mutations in the conserved MTase domain of the encoded protein, Mouaikel et al. (3.Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonne R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the gene is essential for the formation of the 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (m3G) 5′-cap structure of snRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs and designated the protein trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1). TGS1 homologs have been identified in a number of organisms, all of them sharing the conserved sequence motifs of MTases (4.Mouaikel J. Bujnicki J.M. Tazi J. Bordonne R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4899-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The MTase domain, however, comprises only the ∼220 amino acid long C-terminal regions of the proteins, and as compared with the 315 amino acid yeast protein, the TGS1 homologs of higher eukaryotes possess an additional extended N-terminal region. Here, we describe the Drosophila melanogaster TGS1, which we identified on the basis of its affinity to bind RNA. D. melanogaster TGS1 is translated via an internal translation start site from an RNA, which has coding capacity for two polypeptides. We present genetic evidence that tgs1 is an essential gene in Drosophila and that its mutation compromises RNA m3G cap formation. Identification of the tgs1 mutation in Drosophila opens up the possibility of a detailed analysis of the complex function(s) in which TGS1/PIMT participates in higher eukaryotes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant DNA Constructions—All of the reagents used for recombinant DNA work were from Sigma or Promega unless otherwise indicated. Restriction endonucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes used for recombinant constructions were from Fermentas, whereas radioactive preparations were from Izotop Ltd. (Budapest, Hungary). Full-length cDNA clones of dtl were isolated from a D. melanogaster embryonic cDNA library using as hybridization probe a cDNA fragment recovered in the screen described below. Several independent cDNA clones were sequenced to establish the structure of the dtl message as depicted in Fig. 1. The corresponding genomic region was isolated from a λFixII genomic library through consecutive hybridization steps with 32P-labeled cDNA probes.To generate fragments encompassing the upstream or the downstream open reading frames (ORFs) (uORF and dORF, respectively) of dtl by PCR amplification, the following primers were used (numbers are according to the dtl cDNA): DTLuF, 5′-ATGGTACCCGCCGCCACCATGTCCCTGGTGCCAG-3′ (ATG underlined at +80); DTLdF, 5′-ATGGTACCCGCCGCCACCATGAACACACACCACCTG-3′ (ATG underlined at +613); and DTLudR, 5′-CTGCCAGAATTCTTTCC-3′ (the EcoRI site underlined is at +739).The plasmids pET3a-DTL, pET3a-DTLu, and pET3a-DTLd were constructed in order to express DTL proteins in bacteria. For this reason, the dtl cDNA and two subfragments containing either the uORF or the dORF (encompassing the regions from nucleotides +80 to +739 and from +613 to +2008) were inserted into pET3a (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were produced in BL21(DE3) cells following isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction according to standard protocols.For the construction of DTL-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusions, dtl genomic DNA fragments were inserted in front of the gene encoding the EGFP in plasmids pEGFP-N3 and pEGFP-N1 (Promega). Plasmids pDTLu-EGFP and pDTLus-EGFP both contain the region from +80 (the second ATG of dtl mRNA, see Figs. 1 and 4) to +739 inserted in front of EGFP (the numbers indicate the position of the A of ATGs unless otherwise indicated). The reading frames (RFs) of dORF and of EGFP in pDTLu-EGFP are in phase. pDTLus-EGFP was constructed from pDTLu-EGFP by filling up the BssHII site at nucleotide 502, which resulted in a +1 shift in the RF, such that in pDTLus-EGFP the RF from +80 to the end of EGFP is open. pDTLd-EGFP carries the region from +614 (from the seventh ATG of dtl mRNA) to +739 inserted between the cytomegalovirus promoter and EGFP-coding region, such that the RF of dORF and EGFP are in phase. In pDTLud-EGFP, a fragment encompassing the region from +80 to +502 is inserted in front of the EGFP, such that the phase of EGFP is the same as in uORF. In pDTL-EGFP, the dtl-coding region from nucleotide +80 to +1803 is inserted in-frame in front of the EGFP-coding region. The structures of the plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. Details on the constructions are available upon request.Fig. 4Expression of dtl uORF-EGFP and dORF-EGFP fusion proteins in HeLa cells.A, schematic structures of the two ORFs of dtl and the dtl-EGFP fusions used.

Martin S.S. Frankel A.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this modified version of the screen, the combinatorial peptide library of the N-expresser plasmid of the original screening system was replaced by a cDNA library prepared by hexameric random primers from Drosophila embryonic poly(A)+ mRNA (the average chain length of the cDNAs was 300–400 bp). This N-expresser plasmid library was cotransfected with the N-reporter plasmid described by Hamada et al. (5.Hamada K. Martin S.S. Frankel A.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) in which the HIV TAR sequence was fused to the N-terminal end of the lacZ gene. Colonies with the strongest β-galactosidase activity were selected, and the Drosophila cDNA segment they carried was recovered and sequenced. The cDNAs we selected represented an as yet unidentified Drosophila gene that we designated dtl (Drosophila Tat-like).Fly Stocks, Generation, and Rescue of dtl Mutants—Fly stocks were maintained at 25 °C on standard food. The line l(3)S096713 (967) was identified in the Szeged Drosophila Stock Center, and the position of the P-element insertion was determined by nucleotide sequencing following plasmid rescue. Deficiency 189 (d189) was isolated by identifying improper excision after remobilization of the P-element present in l(3)S096713. The P-element was mobilized by the p(Δ2–3) transposase source, and mutations were isolated by scoring for loss of the “mini-white” marker. Imprecise excision lines were identified by genetic crosses based on their phenotype over Df(3R)P14 and further analyzed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA from hemizygotes and by PCR using primers derived from the 31-bp terminal inverted repeat sequence of the P-element and flanking genomic sequences. Finally, the breakpoints of the deletion were determined by sequencing. To generate dtl transgene, a 4.6-kb genomic fragment corresponding to the region between –926 and +3700 (with respect to the transcription initiation site of dtl) was inserted into the CaSpeR4 vector (pCaSpeR-DTL) (6.Thummel C.S.

Modified versions of the above plasmid, pCaSpeR-DTLum and pCaSpeR-DTLdm (Fig. 1), were constructed by inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide (CTAGTCTAGACTAG) with stop codons (underlined) in all three reading frames at position +502 and by deleting the region between +871 and +1868, respectively. For the construction of dtl transgene with a single amino acid change in the MTase active center (pCaSpeR-DTLS423R), a G to C point mutation resulting in a Ser to Arg amino acid change at amino acid position 423 was generated in pCaSpeR-DTL by PCR using the mutagenic primers 5′-TTTCCTGAGGCCTCCGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACGGAGGCCTCAAGGAAA-3′ in combination with external primers. The mutation generated a new StuI restriction site (AGGCCT), which was used to verify the construct and the cDNA synthesized on it, following RT-PCR. Transformants were made by P-element-mediated germ-line transformation of w1118 host embryos using helper plasmid pΔ2–3 as described by Spradling (7.Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 175-198Google Scholar). Independent mini white+ transformant lines carrying single insertions were isolated, and the insertions were localized to chromosomes by using balancers. From each construct, at least two independent transformed lines were established and used in this work. To analyze the dtl phenotype, y w; d189/TM3,Sb Ser y+ females were crossed to yw; P967/TM3, Sb Ser y+ males. To determine the lethal phase, the numbers of animals reaching the second or third instar or pupal stage were recorded. d189/P967 animals and their siblings carrying the TM3 balancer were separated based on the y and y+ markers. The development of dtl mutant and control siblings was followed, and the time needed for 50% of the animals to molt to the next instar was taken as characteristic. At least five independent experiments, each involving 30–60 animals, were performed.Immunological Techniques—The DTL protein and its derivatives were expressed in bacteria. For antibody production, the fragment of the dtl cDNA corresponding to the region from +1243 to + 1612 (encoding amino acids 236–357 of DTLd) was generated by NcoI digestion and inserted in-frame into pET3a to obtain pET3a-DTLnn. The truncated DTL protein expressed in pET3a-DTLnn-containing Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells was isolated from inclusion bodies, refolded, and injected into rabbits. Antibodies were purified on a protein A-Sepharose affinity column. Protein electrophoresis was performed according to standard protocol. After the transfer of proteins by electroblotting, the membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated overnight with primary antibody diluted in TBST. Membranes were washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (DACO), washed again extensively, and developed using the ECL (Amersham Biosciences) kit by following the manufacturer's recommendations.Anti-m3G monoclonal antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene) was used to detect the m3G cap in Drosophila tissues by immunostaining and for immunoprecipitation. For immunostaining, larvae in various stages of development were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 10% formaldehyde, 1 mm EGTA solution. Treatment with anti-m3G primary antibody at 4 °C was followed by anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (DACO) for 2 h at room temperature.For immunoprecipitation, 10 μg of total RNA samples isolated from wild-type and dtl mutant L3 larvae, as indicated in Fig. 6, were incubated with protein A-Sepharose-bound m3G-specific monoclonal antibody, collected, washed, and treated with proteinase K. Supernatants were treated similarly without washes. Proteinase K-treated supernatants and precipitates were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. For Northern hybridization, immunoprecipitated and control RNA samples were separated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, blotted to nylon membrane by capillary transfer, and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes.Fig. 6The lack of dtl function results in a decrease of m3G cap-containing RNA pool.A, detection of m3G cap-containing RNAs by m G-specific monoclonal antibody (Ab-1) in dissected third instar larva.

The amplified products were cloned into pTZ vector, and probes were synthetized by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP.Tissue Culture and Transfections—To assess DTL expression in eukaryotic cells, plasmids carrying DTL-EGFP fusions were transfected into HeLa cells. 3–5 μg of purified DNA was transfected from each plasmid into 106 cells by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, as described previously (8.Kingston R.E. Asubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 9.1.1-9.6.3Google Scholar). 40 h after transfection, cells were harvested, observed under a microscope, and divided into two fractions. One fraction was sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter to estimate the transfection efficiency and green fluorescent protein expression. The other fraction was lysed, the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, and the proteins were analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blots were developed with a green fluorescent protein-specific antibody (a generous gift of Dr. Ferenc Nagy). Blots were developed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended and exposed to x-ray films.RESULTSDTL Is the Drosophila Homolog of PIMT/Tgs1—In a screen developed for the identification of RNA-binding proteins (5.Hamada K. Martin S.S. Frankel A.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we recovered several independent clones of a Drosophila cDNA fragment encoding peptides able to bind to the HIV TAR region. Subsequent nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the identified cDNAs represented fragments of an as yet unidentified Drosophila gene that we designated dtl. To learn more about dtl, we isolated further cDNA and genomic clones, sequenced them, and carried out in silico searches to identify dtl-related sequences in databases. These analyses revealed that dtl is a unique gene in the D. melanogaster genome located in the 90F region of the cytological map. According to the FlyBase annotation (CG31241), the dtl message has an unusually long 5′-untranslated region and gives rise to a 491 amino acid protein product (Fig. 1). Using primer extension and the RACE technique to clone cDNA fragments containing the 5′ end of the dtl message, we mapped the transcription start site of dtl (9.Pápai, G., Komonyi, O., Tóth, Z. S., Pankotai, T., Muratoglu, S., Udvardy, A., and Boros, I. (2005) Gene (Amst.), in pressGoogle Scholar). Northern blots demonstrated that dtl gives rise to a single mRNA of 2600 nucleotides, which can be detected in every stage of Drosophila development (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Detection of dtl transcript by Northern blots. Total cellular RNA isolated from adult females (lane 1), adult males (lane 2), late pupa (lane 3), middle pupa (lane 4), early pupa (lane 5), late third instar larva (lane 6), early third instar larva (lane 7), second instar larva (lane 8), first instar larva (lane 9), and embryos (lane 10) were separated on denaturing gel, blotted onto nylon membrane and hybridized with 32P-labeled dtl cDNA. On the blot shown in the upper panel, the hybridization probe was a cDNA fragment corresponding to the region of dtl from +51 to +739. In the middle panel, hybridization with a cDNA fragment from the downstream ORF of dtl (from +739 to +2000) is shown. Bottom panel, hybridization control with ras2 cDNA. nt, nucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DTL Is Translated via an Internal Initiation Mechanism— The structure of the dtl message, as deduced from a comparison of cDNA clones and genomic sequences, is unusual in that the RNA product synthesized from it has two ORFs (Fig. 1A). The promoter-proximal one, uORF, starts at the second ATG, 80 bp downstream from the transcription start site (TSS), and has a coding capacity for a 178 amino acid polypeptide. The putative protein-encoded, DTLu (Fig. 1C), has no other homologs in the databases with the exception of putative proteins of Drosophila species. Its most prominent feature is the presence of Leu residues in a periodical repeat arrangement resembling that seen in leucine zippers. Indeed, the 20-kDa protein product of this ORF forms dimers when expressed in bacteria (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). The distal ORF of dtl, dORF, has a coding capacity for a 491 amino acid protein. This ORF starts at the fifth ATG, 538 nucleotides downstream from the transcription initiation site (Fig. 1A). DTLd, the putative polypeptide encoded by dORF, contains an Arg-rich region and amino acid blocks, characteristic of MTases. The two ORFs of the dtl message have a 76-bp overlap. At nucleotides from +614 to +616 (with respect to the TSS), a UGA stop codon closing the uORF overlaps with an AUG, the second in-frame in dORF (AUGA) (Fig. 1A). Consequently, depending on the translation initiation site(s) used, the message can give rise to protein product(s) in several ways (Fig. 1A). Firstly, a –1 slip of the ribosome at the overlap could result in a 644 amino acid product encompassing both ORFs. Secondly, translation reinitiation could result in two separate proteins of 178 and 466–491 amino acids. Thirdly, internal translation initiation could result in a protein of 491 or 466 amino acids. To test experimentally which translation initiation is used in vivo, we expressed the dtl cDNA in bacteria and generated DTL-EGFP fusions to study their expression in eukaryotic cells. Both dtl ORFs directed protein expression when inserted into bacterial expression vectors (Fig. 3). The full-length dtl cDNA directed the synthesis of proteins of 20 and 60 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 8). The molecular weights of these proteins suggested that they correspond to products of the uORF and dORF. Indeed, antibodies specific for DTLu (lanes 3–5) and DTLd (lanes 6–8) recognized these proteins specifically. It was noteworthy that no product resulting from the cotranslation of the two ORFs was detected (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 8).Fig. 3Expression of DTL proteins in E. coli. Western blots of protein extracts prepared from E. coli transformed with pET3a-DTLu (lanes 1–3 and 6), pET3a-DTLd (lanes 4 and 7), and pET3a-DTL (lanes 5 and 8). The same samples were loaded onto lanes 1 and 2 following treatment according to the standard protocol (lane 1) or without denaturing (lane 2) to detect protein dimer formation. Blots with lanes 1–2 and 3–5 were developed with antibodies specific for DTLu (α-DTLu). Lanes 6–8 were developed with DTLd-specific polyclonal antibody (α-DTLd). Estimated molecular weights and bands corresponding to DTLu, DTLd, and the dimer of DTLu are labeled. Asterisks indicate the positions of nonspecifically interacting bacterial proteins. The protein expressed from pET3a-DTLd is shorter and more extensively degraded than the protein translated from the full-length cDNA (compare lanes 7 and 8). Note that blots with lanes 1–2 and 3–8 represent different gels of 12 and 10% acrylamide, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether translation initiated at an ATG in the uORF can proceed into dORF in eukaryotic cells, a fragment corresponding to the +80 to +739 region of dtl was inserted in front of the EGFP-coding region to generate plasmid pDTLu-EGFP (Fig. 4A). The reading frames of dORF and of EGFP in pDTLu-EGFP are in phase. To test whether initiation can take place at the overlapping start/stop codons at 613, another construct, pDTLd-EGFP, was produced containing the region from +614 to +739 in front of the EGFP-coding region (Fig. 4A). In this plasmid, the RF of dORF is in phase with the EGFP. Western blots of extracts of HeLa cells transfected with either pDTLd-EGFP or pDTLu-EGFP and developed by EGFP-specific antibodies showed that pDTLu-EGFP directed the production of a fusion protein ∼4–6 kDa larger than EGFP and EGFP, whereas pDTLd-EGFP directed only EGFP production (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). This result suggested that, as in bacteria, translation initiation in eukaryotic cells also started at the ATG located at the start of dORF (at +538) and that no fusion product of uORF-dORF-EGFP was produced. To test whether translation occurring on the uORF had any effect on the translation of dORF, we constructed additional EGFP fusions. In pDTLud-EGFP, the EGFP-coding region was fused in phase to the region coding for the N-terminal part of uORF at position 502. This plasmid has the ATG opening the uORF of dtl but lacks the ATG at the start of the dORF. In pDTLus-EGFP, the reading frame within the uORF was altered by the insertion of four nucleotides at position +502. Consequently, in this last construct, the ATG at +80 opens a reading frame extending to the end of the EGFP-coding region. HeLa cells transfected with pDTLud-EGFP produced no fusion protein but EGFP. In contrast, in extracts of pDTLus-EGFP-transfected cells, we detected proteins identical to those seen in pDTLu-EGFP, e.g. EGFP and a 4–6-kDa larger fusion protein. These results led us to conclude that translation of the dtl message starts at an internal translation initiation site located at 538 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the message. Accordingly, the maj"
https://openalex.org/W2002313778,"The cell type-specific alternative splicing of FGFR2 pre-mRNA results in the mutually exclusive use of exons IIIb and IIIc, which leads to critically important differences in receptor function. The choice of exon IIIc in mesenchymal cells involves activation of this exon and repression of exon IIIb. This repression is mediated by the function of upstream and downstream intronic splicing silencers (UISS and DISS). Here we present a detailed characterization of the determinants of silencing function within UISS and DISS. We used a systematic mutational analysis, introducing deletions and substitutions to define discrete elements within these two silencers of exon IIIb. We show that UISS requires polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)-binding sites, which define the UISS1 sub-element, and an eight nucleotide sequence 5′-GCAGCACC-3′ (UISS2) that is also required. Even though UISS2 does not bind PTB, the full UISS can be replaced with a synthetic silencer designed to provide optimal PTB binding. DISS is composed of a 5′-conserved sub-element (5′-CE) and two regions that contain multiple PTB sites and are functionally redundant (DISS1 and DISS2). DISS1 and DISS2 are separated by the activator sequence IAS2, and together these opposing elements form the intronic control element. Deletion of DISS in the FGFR2 exon IIIb context resulted in the near full inclusion of exon IIIb, and insertion of this silencer downstream of a heterologous exon with a weak 5′ splice site was capable of repressing exon inclusion. Extensive deletion analysis demonstrated that the majority of silencing activity could be mapped to the conserved octamer CUCGGUGC within the 5′CE. Replacement of 5′CE and DISS1 with PTB-binding elements failed to restore repression of exon IIIb. We tested the importance of the relative position of the silencers and of the subelements within each silencer. Whereas UISS1, UISS2, DISS1, and DISS2 appear somewhat malleable, the 5′CE is rigid in terms of relative position and redundancy. Our data defined elements of function within the ISSs flanking exon IIIb and suggested that silencing of this exon is mediated by multiple trans-acting factors.

Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Two variants of the Ig-III domain, with different carboxyl-terminal halves, are produced by alternative inclusion of exon IIIb or exon IIIc (2.Champion-Arnaud P. Ronsin C. Gilbert E. Gesnel M.C.

These variants have remarkably different ligand specificity and cell type distribution; FGFR2(IIIb) binds FGF10 and FGF7 and is expressed in epithelial cells, whereas FGFR2(IIIc) binds FGF2 and is the predominant isoform in mesenchymal cells (6.Orr-Urtreger A.

Proper cell type-specific expression of each isoform is required for the FGF/FGFR2 signaling that governs epithelial-mesenchymal interactions required for organogenesis in mouse embryos (8.De Moerlooze L.

Moreover, mutations that alter the ligand specificity of FGFR2(IIIc) or those that lead to inappropriate expression of exon IIIb in the mesenchyme have been linked to several developmental syndromes in humans (9.Hajihosseini M.K.

The physiological importance of FGFR2 isoform choice is underscored by the switch from FGFR2(IIIb) to FGFR2(IIIc) during progression of prostate carcinomas (7.Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 13.Carstens R.P. Eaton J.V. Krigman H.R. Walther P.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3059-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), where the loss of FGFR2(IIIb) appears to be required for this progression (14.Yasumoto H. Matsubara A. Mutaguchi K. Usui T. McKeehan W.L. Prostate. 2004; 61: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mutually exclusive incorporation of exon IIIb or exon IIIc into FGFR2 mRNA is regulated by the complex interplay of cis-acting elements in the FGFR2 pre-mRNA and trans-acting factors. To study the mechanism of regulation, we have employed two cell lines derived from Dunning rat prostate tumors. The DT3 cell line is a well differentiated carcinoma and expresses FGFR2(IIIb) mRNA exclusively, whereas the AT3 cell line is poorly differentiated and solely expresses FGFR2(IIIc) (7.Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We have also used human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells, although of uncertain cell type provenance include exon IIIc exclusively (15.Yeakley J.M. Fan J.B. Doucet D. Luo L. Wickham E. Ye Z.

Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Regulation of exon choice depends on both activation and silencing of the appropriate exon. Silencing of exon IIIb is facilitated by the presence of weak flanking splice sites and an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) in exon IIIb (17.Del Gatto F. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2017-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Silencing absolutely requires two complex intronic splicing silencers (ISSs) that flank exon IIIb, the upstream ISS (UISS) and the downstream ISS (DISS) (Fig. 1A) (16.Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18.Carstens R.P. Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7388-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). UISS was shown previously to be composed of two regions, UISS1 and UISS2, both required for full UISS activity (18.Carstens R.P. Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7388-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). DISS is embedded within the intronic control element (ICE), which also contains sequences responsible for cell type-specific activation of exon IIIb (Fig. 1A) (16.Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The characterization of the critical cis-acting elements within UISS and ICE is the focus of this paper. Although the precise mechanism of exon IIIb silencing is not understood, some of the trans-acting factors that mediate silencing have been identified. The ESS functions to recruit hnRNP A1 to exon IIIb, thereby repressing its inclusion (19.Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), whereas UISS and ICE silence exon IIIb in part by binding the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) (16.Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18.Carstens R.P. Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7388-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As the experiments described below suggest, other unidentified trans-acting factors are likely important in silencing exon IIIb. The silencing of exon IIIb is countered in epithelial cells by the cell type-specific cis-acting elements IAS2 and ISAR (20.Del Gatto F. Plet A. Gesnel M.C. Fort C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5106-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21.Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). IAS2 and a portion of ISAR activate exon IIIb inclusion by creating a stem that approximates a GCAUG element downstream of ISAR to the vicinity of DISS (20.Del Gatto F. Plet A. Gesnel M.C. Fort C.

Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26.Wagner E.J. Baines A. Albrecht T. Brazas R.M. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 257: 29-46PubMed Google Scholar); hence these elements are known as intronic splicing activators and repressors (ISARs) (reviewed in Ref. 27.Garcia-Blanco M.A. Baraniak A.P. Lasda E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Here we present a detailed characterization of the determinants of silencing function within UISS and DISS. We used a systematic mutational analysis, introducing deletions and substitutions to define discrete elements within these two silencers of exon IIIb. Previously, we had determined that UISS contained two important regions, UISS1 and UISS2. Here we show that an 8-nucleotide sequence 5′-GCAGCACC-3′ at the 3′ end of the UISS2 is required for silencing. UISS1 binds PTB but UISS2 does not; however, UISS function can be replaced with a synthetic silencer designed to provide optimal PTB binding. DISS is composed of a 5′-conserved sub-element (5′CE) and two regions that contain multiple PTB sites and are functionally redundant (DISS1 and DISS2). DISS1 and DISS2 are separated by the activator sequence IAS2, and together these opposing elements form ICE. Deletion of DISS in the FGFR2 exon IIIb context resulted in the near full inclusion of exon IIIb, and insertion of this silencer downstream of a heterologous exon with a weak 5′ splice site was capable of repressing exon inclusion. Extensive deletion analysis demonstrated that although the PTB-binding sites within DISS were required for full repression, the majority of silencing activity could be mapped to the conserved octamer CUCGGUGC within the 5′CE. Substitution of any position within this octamer resulted in a dramatic reduction in IIIb repression with the antepenultimate U being acutely critical. Replacement of 5′CE and DISS1 with a synthetic silencer with consensus PTB-binding elements failed to restore repression of exon IIIb. Additionally, we tested the importance of the relative position of the silencers and of the sub-elements within each silencer. Whereas UISS1, UISS2, DISS1, and DISS2 appear somewhat malleable, the 5′CE is rigid in terms of relative position and redundancy. Our data defined elements of function within the ISSs flanking exon IIIb and suggested that silencing of this exon is mediated by multiple trans-acting factors. Plasmid Construction—All plasmids were constructed by using standard PCRs with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and were cloned by using standard cloning techniques. In all cases, plasmids were sequenced to confirm identity. Oligonucleotide sequences will be provided upon request. All forward UISS deletion mutants described in Fig. 2 were cloned by digesting PCR fragments with SpeI and XhoI followed by ligation to the pI12 splicing construct digested with XbaI and XhoI. The plasmid pI12 was previously described as pI-11 (21.Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Reverse UISS deletions were cloned by digesting PCR fragments with EcoRI and NotI followed by ligation to pI12-ΔUISS-Not/Xho digested with NotI and EcoRI. The pI12DE (28.Wagner E.J. Curtis M.L. Robson N.D. Baraniak A.P. Eis P.S. Garcia-Blanco M.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) mutants described in Fig. 3 were created using site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu turbo (Stratagene). The ICE deletions described in Fig. 5 were created by digesting PCR fragments with SpeI and either ClaI or XhoI followed by ligation into the pI12 splicing construct. pI12IIIb-ΔICE(blue) was created by digesting pI12IIIb-ΔICE with ClaI and XhoI followed by ligation to a PCR product derived from the pBluescriptSK+ vector (Stratagene). Heterologous exons described in Fig. 5 were created by cloning a PCR fragment containing exon 8 of rat FGFR3 as well as flanking intronic sequence into the NotI and ClaI sites of pI12 splicing construct. The chicken cardiac troponin T exon 5 (a gift of T. Cooper, Baylor College of Medicine) was cloned in the same fashion. A UISS PCR fragment was cloned upstream of either heterologous exon into the XbaI and ClaI sites, and the ICE was cloned downstream using the NotI and XhoI sites within the pI12 splicing construct. The reverse ICE deletions in Fig. 6 were cloned by digesting PCR fragments with XhoI and SpeI and cloning into the XbaI and XhoI sites of pI12. The forward ICE deletions were cloned through digestion of PCR fragments with ClaI and XhoI followed by insertion into pI12IIIb-ΔICE. The pI12IIIb mutations A to G and mutations A/B of Fig. 7 were created by digestion of PCR fragments containing mutations with EcoRI and XbaI followed by insertion into pI12. pI12IIIb mutations A1 to B5 of Fig. 8 were cloned by digesting PCR fragments with XbaI and EcoRI followed by ligation into pI12. The remaining ICE sequence 3′ of the mutations was cloned by digestion of a PCR product containing ICE with XbaI and XhoI followed by insertion into each of the pI12IIIb A1 to B5 mutants previously digested with XbaI and XhoI. pI12DE mt.A3, pI12DE mt.B1, and pI12DE mt.B5 were generated by digesting parental pI12IIIb mutant constructs with XbaI and XhoI followed by insertion of a genomic fragment containing the remainder of intron 8, exon IIIc, and part of intron 9. The junction XbaI site is endogenous to the FGFR2 gene, and thus no additional sequences were introduced. In Fig. 9, mutations upstream of exon IIIb were derived from vector pI12DE-BsmBI (map provided upon request) that had the UISS elements flanked by BsmBI sites in opposite orientations such that the resulting digest with BsmBI removed a fragment containing both the UISS elements and the introduced BsmBI sites. Mutations downstream of exon IIIb were derived from vector pI12DE-AarI (map provided upon request) that had the 5′CE and DISS1 elements flanked by AarI sites in opposite orientations such that the resulting digest with AarI removed a fragment containing the 5′CE, DISS1, and the introduced AarI sites. The previously described digests removed the endogenous FGFR2 sequence from 147 bases to 43 bases upstream of exon IIIb and 169 bases to 69 bases downstream of exon IIIb, respectively. pI12DE-UISS2/1 was constructed by digesting pI12DE-BsmBI with BsmBI and using annealed oligos to clone in the UISS2/UISS1 sequence. pI12DE-DISS1/CE was constructed by digesting pI12DE-AarI with AarI and using annealed oligos to clone in the DISS1/CE sequence (DISS1 and the 5′-conserved element of ICE). The pI12DE-D/U was made in a vector that contained both the previously described BsmBI sites upstream of exon IIIb and the AarI sites downstream of exon IIIb. This vector was digested with BsmBI and annealed oligos were used to clone in the CE/DISS1 sequence. Sequentially, the vector was also digested with AarI, and annealed oligos were used to clone in the UISS1/UISS2 sequence. The construct pI12DE-UISS→ PTB was cloned by digesting pI12DE-BsmBI with BsmBI and using annealed oligos to clone in the PTB-binding sequence (see sequence in Fig. 9C). For construct pI12DE-CE/DISS1→ PTB, the same annealed oligos were cloned into vector pI12DE-AarI digested with AarI.Fig. 3The determinants of specificity of UISS2.

Charged amino acids were mutated to neutral or reverse charge by directed mutagenesis to generate 21 mutants. Recombinant wild-type or mutant Nox2 were expressed in the X-CGD PLB-985 cell model. K195A/E, R198E, R199E, and RR198199QQ/AA mutations in the D-loop of Nox2 totally abolished oxidase activity. However, these D-loop mutants demonstrated normal p47phox translocation and iodonitrotetrazolium (INT) reductase activity, suggesting that charged amino acids of this region are essential for electron transfer from FAD to oxygen. Replacement of Nox2 D-loop with its homolog of Nox1, Nox3, or Nox4 was fully functional.

Furthermore, mutations in Nox2 found in X+CGD cases (C369R, G408E, E568K, and H303N/P304R) have been reported to abolish the oxidase assembly (36Leusen J.H. Meischl C. Eppink M.H.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) had predicted a three-dimensional structure of Nox2 using ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase as template and proposed that an α-helical loop 491FAVHHDEEKDVITG504 covers the cleft in which NADPH binds. During oxidase activation, access of NADPH into the binding site could potentially be regulated by interaction of this loop with cytosolic oxidase factors. However, there were conflicting results for the role of this potential α-helical loop. Leusen and co-workers found that cytosolic factors p47phox and p67phox did not translocate to the plasma membrane of phagocytes from an X+CGD case because of the D500G missense mutation located in this sequence of gp91phox. In addition, a peptide mimicking 491–504 residues of Nox2 inhibited the translocation of p47phox and p67phox to the membrane (30Leusen J.H. de Boer M. Bolscher B.G. Hilarius P.M. Weening R.S. Ochs H.D. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2120-2126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in another X+CGD case consisting of a Δ488–497 gp91phox deletion in the α-helical loop, translocation of p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane occurred normally (40Yu L. Cross A.R. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 2497-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Dinauer and co-workers have studied the role of a second cytosolic region of Nox2, the B loop, on oxidase activity (35Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. Yu L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10451-10457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). They found that two Arg at positions 91 and 92 were essential for NADPH oxidase activity and assembly. However, the role of the second intracytosolic polybasic loop of Nox2, the D-loop 191TSSTKTIRRS200, has never been elucidated. Recently, large homologs of gp91phox, called Nox and Duox, have been identified. They are present in various tissues of nonphagocytic cells and can generate low amounts of O2˙−, suggested to be involved in cell signaling, host defense, hypoxia response, and also as proton transport (41Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The family contains seven members in humans. Nox1, Nox3, and Nox4 resemble Nox2 in that they consist of six α-helix transmembrane regions in the N-terminal, with two intracytosolic loops (B and D-loops) and a cytosolic C-terminal tail containing the putative binding sites for FAD and NADPH (42Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). A recent study indicates that p51 and p41 (homolog of p67phox and p47phox, respectively) regulate Nox1 to generate O2˙− (43Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol.

This suggests that Nox proteins need some cytosolic components to be activated or regulated. Meanwhile, the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of Nox2 homologs has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of two regions of Nox2, the intracytosolic D-loop 191TSSTKTIRRS200 and the C-terminal α-helical loop 484DESQANHFAVHHDEEKD500, on oxidase activity and assembly by means of the mutagenesis approach in the X-CGD PLB-985 cell model (37Stasia M.J. Lardy B. Maturana A. Rousseau P. Martel C. Bordigoni P. Demaurex N. Morel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1586: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Results suggest that these two regions are critical for NADPH oxidase activity, especially the charged amino acids Arg195, Arg198, Arg199, Asp484, and Asp500. The D-loop of Nox2 is probably involved in electron transfer from FAD to oxygen independently of cytosolic factor translocation, whereas the C-terminal α-helical loop is crucial for the assembly of oxidase and electron transfer from NADPH to FAD. Chimeric Nox2 proteins containing the D-loop of Nox1/3/4 support NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting that this region should play a similar role on Nox analog activation. Finally, two “super-mutants” of the D-loop of Nox2, with a significant increase in oxidase activity, were obtained, suggesting that the R199Q and D-loopNox4 mutations optimize the NADPH oxidase activation process. Materials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), dimethylformamide (DMF), diisopropylfluorophosphate, and horseradish peroxidase, cytochrome c (horse heart, type VI), and latex beads were obtained from Sigma. TaqDNA polymerase, ATP, GTPγS, and NADPH were from Roche Applied Science. Endofree Plasmid Maxi Kit was purchased from Qiagen. The Sephaglas kit and molecular weight markers for SDS-PAGE were from Amersham Biosciences. Nitrocellulose sheets for Western blotting were purchased from Bio-Rad. G418 was purchased from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibodies 449 and 48 were kindly provided by Dr. D. Roos (Sanquin Research at CLB, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Polyclonal antibody anti-p47phox (rabbit antiserum) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (New York, NY). Monoclonal antibody specific for gp91phox, 7D5 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Nakamura (Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan). Fetal bovine serum and RPMI 1640 were from Invitrogen. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of Recombinant gp91phox in X-CGD PLB-985 Cell Line—Mutations were introduced into the wild-type (WT) Nox2 cDNA in pBluescript II KS(+) vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of WT and the mutated gp91phox cDNA were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). The WT or mutant Nox2 cDNA were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEF-PGKneo as previously described (37Stasia M.J. Lardy B. Maturana A. Rousseau P. Martel C. Bordigoni P. Demaurex N. Morel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1586: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pEF-PGKneo constructs were electroporated into X-CGD PLB-985 cells in which the gp91phox gene was disrupted by gene targeting, resulting in the absence of Nox2 expression and NADPH oxidase activity as previously described (37Stasia M.J.

Cell Culture and Granulocyte Differentiation—WT, X-CGD, and transfected PLB-985 cells expressing WT or the mutant were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After selection, 0.5 mg/ml G418 was added to maintain the selection pressure. PLB-985 cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were exposed to 0.5% DMF for 5–7 days, providing granulocytic differentiation as described previously (38Bionda C. Li X.J. Bruggen R.V. Eppink M. Roos D. Morel F. Stasia M.J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 115: 418-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Analysis of Nox2 Protein Expression—PLB-985 cells (5 × 105) were incubated with 10 μg/ml of mAb 7D5 directed against Nox2 or control monoclonal IgG1 (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Then the cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-labeled goat-F(ab′)2 fragment anti-mouse-Ig (Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France). Finally, flow cytometry analysis (FACS) was performed (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) (48Stasia M.J. Brion J.P. Boutonnat J. Morel F. J. Infect Dis. 2003; 188: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sorting of 7D5-positive PLB-985 cells was done on a FACSVantage Diva (BD Biosciences) instrument at a sheath pressure of 12 p.s.i. with a 70-μm nozzle. Cells were collected into phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and routinely contained >97% of 7D5-positive cells. Viability after sorting was >95%. After centrifugation of the cell suspension, the cell pellet was resuspended in culture medium. The expression of recombinant Nox2 was also examined by Western blot using monoclonal antibody 48 developed with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (49Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher G.J.M. Meerhof L. van Zwieten R. Keijer J. Weening R.S. Roos D. Blood. 1989; 73: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WT or mutant Nox2 expression was further detected indirectly by cytochrome b558 differential spectral analysis. A molecular extinction coefficient of ∑426 nm = 106 mm–1 × cm–1 for the Soret band was used for calculations (50Batot G. Paclet M.H. Doussière J. Vergnaud S. Martel C. Vignais P.V. Morel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 406: 188-202Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All experiments were done in triplicate. Cytosol and Membrane Fraction Preparation from Transfected PLB-985 Cell Lines—108 PLB-985 cells were treated with 3 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate for 15 min on ice and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, and 10 μm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was withdrawn and centrifuged at 152,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. This high speed supernatant was referred to as the cytosol, and the pellet consisting of crude membranes was resuspended in the same buffer, as described before (51Berthier S. Paclet M.H. Lerouge S.

Measurement of NADPH Oxidase Activity in Intact Cells—H2O2 production was measured as described previously (38Bionda C. Li X.J. Bruggen R.V. Eppink M. Roos D. Morel F. Stasia M.J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 115: 418-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For each well in a 96-well plate, 5 × 105 granulocytic differentiated PLB-985 cells in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.9 mm Ca2+ and 0.5 mm Mg2+ was mixed with 20 mm glucose, 20 μm luminol, and 10 units/ml horseradish peroxidase. We added 80 ng/ml PMA to initiate the reaction. Luminescence was recorded every 30 s for a total of 90 min at 37 °C using a Luminoscan® luminometer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). In some experiments, PMA was replaced by 4 × 10–7m fMLP. Detection of NADPH Oxidase Activity in a Broken Cell System— NADPH oxidase activity in vitro was measured in a homologous BCS using previously described protocols (52Cohen-Tanugi L. Morel F. Pilloud-Dagher M.C. Seigneurin J.M. François P. Bost M. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma membranes obtained from transgenic PLB-985 cells and cytosol of control human neutrophils were added to a reaction mixture containing 20 mm glucose, 20 μm GTPγS, 5 mm MgCl2, and arachidonic acid in a final volume of 100 μl. After incubation for 10 min at 25 °C, the oxidase activation was initiated in the presence of 100 μm cytochrome c and 150 μm NADPH. The specificity of the O2˙− production was checked by adding 50 μg/ml superoxide dismutase to stop the kinetic reduction. Iodonitrotetrazolium Reductase Activity—Diaphorase activity was measured under the same BCS assay conditions, except that the 100 μm cytochrome c was replaced by 50 μm INT (53Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448-21454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of in Vivo p47phox Translocation—In vivo p47phox translocation was detected by confocal microscopy analysis according to (38Bionda C. Li X.J. Bruggen R.V. Eppink M. Roos D. Morel F. Stasia M.J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 115: 418-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with little modified. The 5 × 105 differentiated PLB-985 cells deposited on coverslips were activated with PMA-treated latex beads (3 μm in diameter) at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After extensive washing, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the diluted polyclonal anti-p47phox (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). After washing, cells were incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing a 2-μg/ml Alexa Fluor® 488 F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h. Finally, PLB-985 cells were stained with 3 μm TO-PRO 3 iodide for 10 min to visualize the nuclei. Cells were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope and analyzed with Leica confocal software (Heidelberg, Germany). In some experiments, a 10 μg/ml mAb 7D5 and a 4-μg/ml Alexa Fluor® 546 F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (Molecular Probes) were added to the system as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively, to detect Nox2. Analysis of Translocation of p47phox in Vitro—In vitro p47phox translocation to the plasma membrane was measured using a classic protocol (37Stasia M.J. Lardy B. Maturana A. Rousseau P. Martel C. Bordigoni P. Demaurex N. Morel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1586: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes purified from PLB-985 cells (100 μg) were preincubated with human neutrophil cytosol (1,000 μg) for 2 min at 30 °C and activated with (+) or without 100 μm SDS and 20 μm GTPγS for 15 min at 30 °C. Membranes were collected between the 45 and 20% (w/v) sucrose layers after centrifugation (30,000 rpm × 1 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman) at 18 °C) and analyzed using immunoblotting with anti-peptide polyclonal antibody directed against p47phox (24Vergnaud S. Paclet M.H. El Benna J. Pocidalo M.A. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein Determination—Protein content was estimated using the Bradford assay (54Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) or the Pierce® method (55Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18645) Google Scholar). To further understand the role of the D-loop (191TSSTKTIRRS200) and the C-terminal (484DESQANHFAVHHDEEKD500) in Nox2 upon oxidase activation, homologous sequence analysis in the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family was done (Fig. 1). The D-loop is a polybasic region, containing Lys195, Arg198, and Arg199, which are conserved in the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family. In the C-terminal, the charged amino acids encompassing residues 484–500 are also highly conserved in this family, especially Asp484, His490, Asp 496, and Asp500. We postulated that charged amino acids within these two domains might be important for the active conformation of Nox2 and/or for further binding with cytosolic factors. Hence charged amino acid residues were replaced with neutral or reverse-charged residues by site-directed mutagenesis to alter the local electrostatic charge within these two regions (Fig. 2). To further elucidate the function of the D-loop in the Nox family, the D-loop of Nox2 was replaced with the same region of their homologs Nox1, Nox3, and Nox4. Twelve mutants of the D-loop (Fig. 2A) and eight of the α-helical loop in the C-terminal of Nox2 (Fig. 2B) were generated by directed mutagenesis and stably transfected in X-CGD PLB-985 cells, which lack endogenous Nox2 expression because of gene targeting (56Zhen L.

We also produced two mutants known to disturb cytosolic factor translocation to the plasma membrane, the D500G mutant, which had reproduced a human X+CGD case (30Leusen J.H. de Boer M. Bolscher B.G. Hilarius P.M. Weening R.S. Ochs H.D. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Clin.

https://openalex.org/W2058006951,"A photosystem I (PS I) complex containing plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9) but devoid of FX, FB, and FA was isolated and characterized from a mutant strain of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 in which the menB and rubA genes were insertionally inactivated. In isolated PS I trimers, the decay of P700+ measured in the near-IR and the decay of A1– measured in the near-UV were found to be biphasic, with (averaged) room temperature lifetimes of 12 and 350 μs. The decay-associated spectra of both kinetic phases are characteristic of the oxidized minus reduced difference spectrum of a semiquinone, consistent with charge recombination between P700+ and PQ-9–. The amplitude of the flash-induced absorbance changes in both the near-IR and the near-UV show that approximately one-half of the A1 binding sites are either empty or nonfunctional. A spin-polarized chlorophyll triplet is observed by time-resolved EPR, and it is attributed to the 3P700 product of P700+A0− charge recombination via the T0 spin level in those PS I complexes that do not contain a functional quinone. In those A1 sites that are occupied, the P700+Q– polarization pattern indicates that PQ-9 is oriented in a similar manner to that in the menB mutant. When excess 9,10-anthraquinone is added in vitro, it displaces PQ-9 and occupies the A1 binding site more readily than in the menB mutant. This can be explained by a greater accessibility to the A1 site in the menB rubA mutant due to the absence of FX and the stromal ridge polypeptides. The relatively low binding affinity of 9,10-anthraquinone allows it to be readily removed from the A1 site by washing. However, all A1 sites are shown to bind napthoquinones with high affinity and thus are proven to be functionally competent in quinone binding. The ability to readily displace PQ-9 from the A1 site makes the menB rubA mutant ideal for introducing novel quinones, particularly anthraquinones, into PS I.

The ability to readily displace PQ-9 from the A1 site makes the menB rubA mutant ideal for introducing novel quinones, particularly anthraquinones, into PS I. Photosystem I is a multisubunit, pigment-protein complex that is found in the membranes of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria and that mediates the light-induced transfer of electrons from plastocyanin/cytochrome c6 to ferredoxin/flavodoxin. According to current understanding, light-induced charge separation results in the oxidation of the primary electron donor P700 (E′m +430 mV), a chlorophyll a/a′ heterodimer located on the luminal (inner) side of the membrane, and the reduction of the primary electron acceptor A0 (E′m approximately –1000 mV), a chlorophyll a monomer located in the interior of the membrane. The electron is passed to A1 (E′m approximately –800 mV), an alkyl-substituted menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthalenedione); to FX (E′m –705 mV), an interpolypeptide (4Fe-4S) cluster; and finally to FA (E′m –520 mV) and FB (E′m –580 mV), which are (4Fe-4S) clusters bound to the extrinsic subunit PsaC located on the stromal (cytoplasmic) side of the membrane. In most organisms, including Synechocystis sp.

Our approach to studying structural and functional relationships involving A1 is to replace the native quinone in PS I with quinones that have different thermodynamic and structural properties but are still able to mediate electron transfer from A0 to the Fe/S clusters. The replacement of the quinone can be accomplished either in vitro using chemical extraction and reconstitution protocols (3.Itoh S. Iwaki M. Ikegami I. Biochim. Biophys.

In the absence of PhQ, PS I recruits plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9), which is normally associated with PS II, into the A1 site. When present in the quinone binding site of PS II, PQ-9 has a midpoint potential of 68 mV (9.Golbeck J.H. Kok B. Biochim. Biophys.

We isolated PS I complexes from the resulting menB rubA mutant and evaluated the kinetics of charge recombination between P700+ and PQ-9–. The structural and functional properties of PQ-9 correspond to those in the menB mutant. We additionally show that these PS I complexes can reversibly incorporate 9,10-anthraquinone into the A1 binding site more efficiently than in the menB mutant. Construction of the menB and menB rubA Mutants—The menB mutant was constructed in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as described previously (6.Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R.

A DNA fragment containing the menB gene was cloned and sequenced from the genome of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (GenBank™ accession number AY563042). This menB gene was identified by the high sequence similarity (89%) of its product with that of sll1127 (menB) of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The accC1 gene, which was derived from plasmid pMS266 after restriction digestion with PstI and which confers gentamicin resistance, was inserted into the unique PstI site of the menB coding region. This construct was used to transform cells of the kanamycin-resistant rubA mutant of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 as described in Ref. 14.Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M.

Full segregation of the menB::aacC1 and menB alleles was verified by PCR analysis. Preparation of PS I Complexes—Cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 or Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 were broken using a French pressure cell operated at 4 °C at 120 megapascals. Thylakoid membranes were solubilized using n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (β-DM), and PS I trimers were isolated by sucrose density ultracentrifugation according to previously published procedures (14.Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20343-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Quinone and Chlorophyll Analysis—Quinones were extracted from 20 μl of a solution of PS I complexes with 400 μl of acetone/methanol (7:2, v/v) by vigorous vortexing for 3 min. After centrifugation and filtration through a PTFE filter membrane with a 0.2-μm pore size (Whatman International Ltd., Maldstone, UK), the extract in the organic solvent phase was injected directly into an Agilent Technology 1100 series HPLC system equipped with a reverse-phase SUPELCO Discovery® C18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Separation and elution were performed with a linear gradient of solvent A (100% methanol) and B (100% isopropyl alcohol) according to the following protocol: 80%:20% (v/v) solvent A/B for 10 min, a linear gradient from 80%:20% (v/v) to 20%:80% (v/v) of solvent A/B in 30 min, and 20%:80% (v/v) solvent A/B for 5 min. The flow rate was 0.75 ml min–1. Detection of eluates was performed with a diode array detector (Agilent 1100 series). MQ-4 and PQ-9 were quantified using extinction coefficients of 18.9 mm–1 cm–1 at 270 nm (16.Dunphy P.J. Brodie A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 407-461Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and 15.2 mm–1 cm–1 at 254 nm (17.Dilley R.A. Crane F. Anal. Biochem. 1963; 5: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), respectively. The HPLC assignments were confirmed by mass spectrometry using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization with a Perspective Biosystems Mariner time-of-flight mass spectrometer operated in the negative ion mode. Chlorophylls and carotenoids were extracted from whole cells with 100% methanol and from thylakoids with 80% (v/v) acetone. The optical density was measured using a Cary 14 spectrophotometer, and the chlorophyll concentration was calculated according to MacKinney (18.MacKinney G. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 140: 315-322Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and Lichtenthaler (19.Lichtenthaler H.K. in.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9395) Google Scholar). Anthraquinone Exchange into the menB and menB rubA Mutants—A 100-fold molar excess of 9,10-anthraquinone (10 μl of 0.034 m 9,10-anthraquinone in Me2SO) was added to PS I complexes (150 μl in Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.3 containing 0.2% Triton X-100) isolated from the menB and menB rubA mutant strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, respectively. The incubation was carried out at room temperature (2–4 h) with vigorous stirring. In an additional step, the PS I complexes were washed twice by ultrafiltration with 150 μl of buffer solution to remove the excess 9,10-anthraquinone as well as exchanged PQ-9. The washed PS I complexes were resuspended in 150 μl of buffer and stored at –80 °C. Time-resolved Optical Spectroscopy in the Near-IR—Optical studies in the near-IR were conducted using a laboratory-built, time-resolved spectrophotometer. The high frequency roll-off amplifier described in Ref. 20.Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys.

A tunable titanium-sapphire laser (Schwartz Electro-Optics, Orlando, FL) was pumped at 532 nm by using a 5-watt, frequency-doubled CW YAG laser (Millenia® Series; Spectra Physics) and provided the 820-nm measuring beam. The actinic flash was provided by a frequency-doubled, Nd-YAG laser (Quanta-Ray DCR-11, Spectra Physics). For most studies, the excitation flash intensity was adjusted to ∼2 mJ cm–2, which is just sufficient to saturate P700 under the conditions employed. For studies of the dependence of the signal intensity on the excitation flash energy, the energy was varied from 1 mJ cm–2 to 80 mJ cm–2. The flash energy was adjusted by the timing of the Q-switch and by the use of neutral density filters. PS I complexes were diluted under anaerobic conditions with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml Chl (∼0.5 μm P700). Sodium ascorbate and 1,6-dichlorophenolindophenol were added to final concentrations of 2 mm and 5 μm, respectively. β-DM was added to a final concentration of 0.04% (w/v) to reduce light scattering. A differential extinction coefficient of 8000 m–1 cm–1 at 820 nm was used for calculations of P700+/P700 concentration. Time-resolved Optical Spectroscopy in the Visible—Optical studies in the visible wavelength range were conducted using a laboratory-built, pump-probe spectrometer described in Ref. 21.Cohen R.O. Shen G. Golbeck J.H. Xu W. Chitnis P.R. Valieva A.I. van der Est A. Pushkar Y. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4741-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. Measuring flashes were supplied by a xenon lamp and selected by a ¾ meter monochrometer incorporating a 10-cm × 10-cm interference grating blazed at 350 nm. The bandwidth of the measuring flash was 5 nm, and the data were recorded in 5-nm intervals from 400 to 600 nm. Excitation flashes were provided by a Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser (Brilliant®, Quantel S. A., Les Ulis Cedex, France) equipped with an optical parametric oscillator (Vibrant Arrow 355, type II crystal) tuned to 685 nm. The photodiodes were protected with cyan subtractive dichroic filters (Edmund H52-536). The sample was placed in a 10 × 10-mm quartz cuvette perpendicular to the direction of the excitation flash. An identical sample was placed in a 10 × 10-mm quartz cuvette in the reference beam. Each data point represents the average of 16 measurements taken at a flash spacing of 20 s. An extinction coefficient of 242,000 m–1 cm–1 at 515 nm is used for calculations of 3Car/1Car concentration (22.Bensasson R. Land E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 325: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It should be noted that this value is taken from pulse radiolysis measurements of β-carotene in hexane, and hence the extinction coefficient of 3Car/1Car in PS I may differ considerably. Time-resolved Optical Spectroscopy in the Near-UV—Optical studies in the UV were conducted using a pulse probe spectrometer described in Ref. 23.Diner B.A. McIntosh L. Photosynthesis: Molecular Biology of Energy Capture. 297. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1998: 337-360Google Scholar. The monochromator slit was fixed at 4 mm, equivalent to a bandwidth of 8 nm. Excitation flashes were provided by a xenon flashlamp filtered by Schott and Kodak Wratten 34 filters. The photodiodes were protected with Corion Solar Blind UV-transmitting filters. The optical path length of the cuvette was 1 cm. Each data point represents the average of eight measurements, taken with a flash spacing of 20 s. A background measurement was obtained similarly, except that the sample was shielded from the detecting flash to allow for correction of the actinic flash artifact. The absorbance shown represents the difference between the two measurements. The differential extinction coefficient of PQ-9–/PQ-9 at the peak in the UV is reported as 13,000 m–1 cm–1 in solution (22.Bensasson R. Land E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 325: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Multiexponential fits of the optical kinetic data were performed using the Marquardt algorithm in Igor Pro version 3.14 (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) running on a Macintosh computer. For global analyses in the visible region, individual kinetics were analyzed first. The results of these analyses were used for fitting the whole set of data to global lifetimes, and the best solution was chosen based on the analysis of χ2, standard errors of the parameters, and the residuals. In several instances, several closely spaced kinetic components were required to fit the data at the longer times. A stretched multiexponential fitting routine was employed in such cases (24.Vassiliev I.R. Antonkine M.L. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); the stretch parameter, βi, assumes a value between 0 and 1. This equation represents a robust solution of a general equation for kinetics with a distributed time constant; in the case when βi = 1, the equation turns into a sum of simple exponentials. CW EPR Spectroscopy of the Mutant PS I Complexes at X-Band— EPR spectra of PS I complexes isolated from the wild type, the menB mutant, and the menB rubA mutant were obtained using a Bruker ECS-106 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford temperature controller and cryostat. The instrument conditions for F–A and F–B were as follows: microwave power, 20 milliwatts; temperature, 15 K; and modulation amplitude, 10 G. The sample was suspended to 0.6 mg/ml Chl in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.3, containing 10 mm sodium ascorbate and 30 μm 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol. The instrument conditions for F–X were as follows: microwave power, 80 milliwatts; temperature, 6 K; and modulation amplitude, 32 G. The sample was suspended to 0.6 mg/ml Chl in 100 mm glycine buffer, pH 10.0, containing 10 mm sodium hydrosulfite. Transient EPR Spectroscopy at X-band and Q-Band—Low temperature, X-band (9-GHz) transient EPR experiments were performed with a laboratory-built spectrometer using a Bruker ER046 XK-T microwave bridge equipped with an ER-4118X-MD-5W1 dielectric ring resonator and using an Oxford CF935 helium gas flow cryostat (25.van der Est A. Hager-Braun C. Leibl W. Hauska G. Stehlik D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The loaded Q value for this dielectric ring resonator was about 3000, equivalent to a rise time of τr = Q/(2π *νmw) ≈ 50 ns. Q-band (35-GHz) transient EPR spectra of the samples were measured with the same set-up except that a Bruker ER 056 QMV microwave bridge, equipped with a home-built cylindrical resonator, was used. All samples contained 1 mm sodium ascorbate as an external electron donor and were frozen in the dark. The samples were illuminated using a Spectra Physics Nd-YAG laser system operating at the second harmonic (533 nm) and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. Construction of the menB rubA Mutant in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002—The menB gene of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was inactivated by inserting the aacC1 gene, conferring gentamicin resistance, from plasmid pMS266 into the unique PstI site within the coding sequence of the gene (Fig. 1, a and b). After transformation of this construction into the rubA mutant of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, segregation of the menB::aacC1 and menB alleles in the rubA mutant strain was analyzed by PCR. As expected for the parental strain (Fig. 1a), the PCR using the designed primers resulted in a product of 1.0 kb (Fig. 1c, lane 1). In the transformed rubA strain, however, the 1.0-kb product is absent, and a new product of 2.1 kb was detected (Fig. 1c, lane 2). The difference in the sizes of the PCR products from the parental and transformant strains corresponds to the size of the inserted 1.1-kb gentamicin resistance cartridge (Fig. 1, a and b). The data show that the transformed rubA mutant strain is homozygous for the menB::aacC1 allele. HPLC Pigment Analysis of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002— Authentic PhQ and PQ-9 elute at 22 and 36 min, respectively, using the HPLC protocol described under “Materials and Methods.” When the pigment extracts from whole cells and PS I complexes from wild-type Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 were analyzed, no UV-absorbing compounds were detected at 22 min. Further examination of the chromatogram led to the discovery of a new peak eluting at 14 min that showed an intense UV absorption with maxima at 248, 263, 270, and 332 nm. The spectrum is consistent with a 1,4-naphthoquinoid compound having alkyl substitutions at the C2 and C3 positions (16.Dunphy P.J. Brodie A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 407-461Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopic analysis showed that the compound has an m/z of 444 as opposed to an m/z of 450 for PhQ. This difference is most easily explained by the presence of a geranylgeranyl tail with four fully unsaturated isoprenoid units, which is characteristic of MQ-4. Thus, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 probably synthesizes 2-methyl-3-all-trans-tetraisoprenyl-1,4-naphthalenedione (MQ-4) instead of 2-methyl-3-(3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecenyl)-1,4-naphthalenedione (PhQ). The transient EPR spectra of wild-type PS I complexes isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 were identical at both X- and Q-bands, indicating that the difference in the degree of unsaturation of the C3 tail has no detectable influence on the orientation of the 1,4-naphthalenedione head group in the A1 site (data not shown). When the pigment extracts from whole cells of the menB rubA mutant were analyzed, no UV-absorbing material eluted at 14 min. This indicates that the menB homolog indeed encodes 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoate synthase in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and that it is required for the synthesis of MQ-4. The absence of MQ-4 was confirmed in pigment extracts from PS I complexes; however, a peak appeared at 36 min with an m/z of 748 characteristic of PQ-9. This observation is in agreement with a previous study in which the interruption of PhQ biosynthesis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 results in the incorporation of PQ-9 into the PS I (6.Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R. Beauparlant S. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Jones A.D. Golbeck J.H. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol.

These results indicate that the interruption of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate synthase in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 similarly results in the incorporation of PQ-9 into PS I. Low Temperature CW EPR Spectroscopy in PS I Complexes from the menB rubA Mutant—The FX, FA, and FB iron-sulfur clusters were not detected in PS I complexes isolated from the menB rubA mutant when measured by low temperature CW X-band EPR spectroscopy (data not shown). The iron-sulfur clusters were similarly not detected when PS I complexes were treated with sodium hydrosulfite at pH 10.0 in an attempt to reduce FA− and FB−; additionally, no spectrum was obtained by illuminating the same sample during freezing in an attempt to photoaccumulate FX−. These results are identical to those for PS I complexes isolated from the rubA mutant and indicate that all three (4Fe-4S) clusters are missing from the PS I complexes of the menB rubA mutant as expected (13.Shen G. Antonkine M.L. van der Est A. Vassiliev I.R. Brettel K. Bittl R. Zech S.G. Zhao J. Stehlik D. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol.

Flash-induced Absorbance Changes in the Near-IR and UV Regions—Fig. 2 (top) shows decay kinetics measured at 820 nm in PS I complexes isolated from the menB rubA mutant. Under the conditions employed, the absorbance change after a saturating flash corresponds primarily to the decay of P700+. The best fit to the data results in kinetic phases with lifetimes (stretch parameters) of 1.9 μs (0.92), 10.3 μs (0.97), and 315 μs (0.74). The longest kinetic phase represents the major component to the overall signal amplitude (∼75%), and the stretch parameter indicates that this value encompasses a broader distribution of lifetimes than the faster components. Fig. 2 (bottom) shows decay kinetics measured at 315 nm in PS I complexes isolated from the menB rubA mutant. In this spectral region, the flash-induced absorbance change corresponds primarily to the decay of PQ-9–. The best fit to the data results in kinetic phases with lifetimes (stretch parameters) of 15 μs (1.00), 392 μs (1.00), and a long lived residual. (Due to the time resolution of the spectrometer, it could not be determined whether the 1.9-μs kinetic phase measured in the near-IR is also present in the near-UV.) The similarity in the lifetimes of the two slower kinetic components in the near-IR and near-UV suggests that these two kinetic phases can be assigned to the same process, namely charge recombination between P700+ and PQ-9–. The total absorbance change (excluding the unassigned 1.9-μs component) in the near-IR (Fig. 2, top) corresponds to 223 nm P700+, which is equivalent to 251 Chl/P700 given that the total Chl a content in the sample was 56 μm (50 μg/ml Chl a). Similarly, the total absorption change in the near-UV (Fig. 2, bottom) corresponds to 46 nm PQ-9–, which is equivalent to 239 Chl/P700, given that the total Chl a content in the sample was 11 μm"
https://openalex.org/W2028417446,"Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor important for various cellular events such as inflammation, immune response, proliferation, and apoptosis. In this study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the N-terminal domain of the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-κB as bait and isolated centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CPAP) as a candidate for a RelA-associating partner. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Western blotting also showed association of CPAP with RelA. When overexpressed, CPAP enhanced NF-κB-dependent transcription induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Reduction of the protein level of endogenous CPAP by RNA interference resulted in decreased activation of NF-κB by TNFα. After treatment with TNFα, a portion of CPAP was observed to accumulate in the nucleus, although CPAP was found primarily in the cytoplasm without any stimulation. Moreover, CPAP was observed in a complex recruited to the transcriptional promoter region containing the NF-κB-binding motif. One hybrid assay showed that CPAP has the potential to activate gene expression when tethered to the transcriptional promoter. These data suggest that CPAP functions as a coactivator of NF-κB-mediated transcription. Since a physiological interaction between CPAP and the coactivator p300/CREB-binding protein was also observed and synergistic activation of NF-κB-mediated transcription was achieved by these proteins, CPAP-dependent transcriptional activation is likely to include p300/CREB-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W2087355924,"The oligopeptide transporter 1, PepT1, is a member of the Slc15 family of 12 membrane-spanning domain transporters; PepT1 has proton/peptide cotransport activity and is selectively expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, where it is responsible for the nutritional absorption of di- and tri-peptides. Here, a novel PepT1 gene product has been identified in the rat pineal gland, termed pgPepT1. It encodes a 150-amino acid protein encompassing the C-terminal 3 membrane-spanning domains of intestinal PepT1 protein, with 3 additional N-terminal residues. Expression of pgPepT1 appears to be restricted to the pineal gland and follows a marked circadian pattern with >100-fold higher levels of mRNA occurring at night; this is accompanied by an accumulation of membrane-associated pgPepT1 protein ( approximately 16 kDa). The daily rhythm in pgPepT1 mRNA is regulated by the well described neural pathway that controls pineal melatonin production. This includes the retina, the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, central structures, and projections from the superior cervical ganglia; activation of this pathway results in the release of norepinephrine. Here it was found that pgPepT1 expression is mediated by a norepinephrine-->cyclic AMP mechanism that activates an alternative promoter located in intron 20 of the gene. pgPepT1 protein was found to have transporter-modulator activity; it could contribute to circadian changes in pineal function through this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2141002162,"Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is an important modulator of high density lipoprotein cholesterol in humans and thus considered to be a therapeutic target for preventing cardiovascular disease. The gene encoding CETP has been shown to be highly variable, with multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms responsible for altering both its transcription and sequence. Examining nine missense variants of CETP, we found some had significant associations with CETP mass and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Two variants, Pro-373 and Gln-451, appear to be more stable in vivo, an observation mirrored by partial proteolysis studies performed in vitro. Because these naturally occurring variant proteins are potentially present in clinical populations that will be treated with CETP inhibitors, all commonly occurring haplotypes were tested to determine whether the proteins they encode could be inhibited by torcetrapib, a compound currently in clinical trials in combination with atorvastatin. Torcetrapib behaved similarly with all variants, with no significant differences in inhibition.

Despite tremendous advances in lifestyle interventions and drug treatments, cardiovascular disease remains the most significant cause of mortality in the developed world. Statins have provided physicians with an effective means for reducing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL-C, low density lipoprotein cholesterol; HDL-C, high density lipoprotein cholesterol; CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; ACCESS, Atorvastatin Comparative Cholesterol Efficacy and Safety Study.1The abbreviations used are: LDL-C, low density lipoprotein cholesterol; HDL-C, high density lipoprotein cholesterol; CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; ACCESS, Atorvastatin Comparative Cholesterol Efficacy and Safety Study. and preventing cardiovascular disease, providing substantial public health benefits (1Gresser U. Gathof B.S. Eur. J. Med. Res. 2004; 9: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). However, even those with low LDL-C remain potentially at risk for disease. High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has been identified as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (2Gotto A.M. Brinton E.A. J. Am. Coll. Card. 2004; 43: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), but well tolerated therapies capable of substantially raising HDL-C are not currently available. The candidate therapy that is currently in the most advanced state of development is cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition with results for JTT-705 and torcetrapib reported in the literature (3de Grooth G.J. Kuivenhoven J.A. Stalenhoef A.F.H. de Graaf J. Zwinderman A.H. Posma J.L. van Tol A. Kastelein J.J.P. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 4Clark R.W.

Biol. 2004; 24: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The potential benefits for such a therapy are reinforced by the scope of clinical trials currently underway to test the impact of CETP inhibitors on disease. The role of CETP in lipid transfer and reverse cholesterol transport has been extensively studied in a variety of systems (5Barter P.J. Brewer Jr., H.B. Chapman M.J. Hennekens C.H. Rader D.J. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 6Boekholdt S.M. Kuivenhoven J.A. Hovingh G.K. Jukema J.W. Kastelein J.J.P. van Tol A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, the naturally occurring variability of CETP has made it one of the more exhaustively studied genes in multiple human populations (7Boekholdt S.M. Thompson J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1080-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Much effort has been directed at variants in the promoter and 5′-region of the gene. In this region, there is high linkage disequilibrium among several common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been extensively studied for their effect on CETP transcription and mass (8Thompson J.F. Lira M.E. Durham L.K. Clark R.W. Bamberger M.J. Milos P.M. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 167: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When the studies are sufficiently large, the SNPs associated with lower transcription and lower CETP mass are also associated with higher HDL-C. There may be more than one causal polymorphism in the promoter region with at least two likely candidates (9Dachet C. Poirier O. Cambien F. Chapman M.J. Rouis M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Lira M.E. Lloyd D.B. Hallowell S. Milos P.M. Thompson J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1684: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Numerous amino acid variations have also been observed in CETP, occurring primarily in the 3′-half of the gene. The most common missense variation, I405V, has been extensively studied; less common missense variations like A373P, R451Q, and the Asian-specific D442G have been studied to varying degrees. Less common missense SNPs reported in the literature are not well characterized with respect to either frequency or function. These variations could potentially have a profound effect on CETP function, and hence HDL-C levels, so they merit more detailed study both in human populations as well as in vitro. We have characterized nine different missense SNPs in large clinical populations and also expressed the resultant proteins in vitro to allow a better understanding of how these variations may affect HDL-C and cardiovascular disease. Clinical Trials—The ACCESS (Atorvastatin Comparative Cholesterol Efficacy and Safety Study) clinical trial from which 2913 DNA samples were genotyped has been described previously (11Ballantyne C.M. Andrews T.C. Hsia J.A. Kramer J.H. Shear C. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 265-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Data from two smaller Phase II clinical trials in which torcetrapib was examined were also used because of the availability of baseline CETP mass measurements. In all trials, whole blood from subjects participating was obtained with appropriate institutional review and appropriate informed consent documentation that defined the study design and provided an assessment of the risks and benefits associated with study participation. DNA preparation was as described previously (8Thompson J.F. Lira M.E. Durham L.K. Clark R.W. Bamberger M.J. Milos P.M. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 167: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Taq-Man assays obtained from ABI were used for all genotyping except for I405V and R451Q, which were analyzed by fluorescence polarization as described previously (8Thompson J.F. Lira M.E. Durham L.K. Clark R.W. Bamberger M.J. Milos P.M. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 167: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In Vitro Methods—Wild type CETP was cloned via PCR amplification of cDNA from HepG2 cells and inserted into a modified version of pSecTag2/Hygro (Invitrogen) that produces amino-terminal His6 and V5 tags. CETP missense SNPs were engineered by overlapping PCR using primers containing single base pair mutations. Expression constructs were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293S cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). HEK293S cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (certified, Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide. Approximately 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with 293 SFM II serum-free medium (Invitrogen), collected 24 h later, and concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 filter units (Millipore). Purification of His-tagged proteins was performed using TALON metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences). Proteolysis studies were carried out using 1 μg of purified protein and 0.125 μg of chymotrypsin. Digestions were incubated at 37 °C for 5, 20, and 40 min, electrophoresed on a 4–12% (w/v) bisacrylamide Nu-Page gel (Invitrogen), and then silver stained (SilverSnap kit; Pierce). Automated Edman sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer, Model 494. Data were collected and analyzed using the Applied Biosystems Model 610A software. CETP Assays—Bodipy-cholesterol ester substrate was generated using 7 mg of phosphatidyl choline, 0.75 mg of triolein (Avanti Polar Lipids), and 3 mg of BODIPY-CE (Molecular Probes) by drying and vacuum desiccating at 60 °C. Lipids were solubilized at 65 °C in phosphate-buffered saline by sonication (at 25% of full power setting) with a microtip Misonix ultrasonic processor for 2 min under a stream of nitrogen. The preparation was cooled to 45 °C, and 5 mg of apolipoprotein A-1 (Biodesign) added. The preparation was resonicated (at 25% of full power) for 20 min at 45 °C, pausing after each minute to cool the probe. The sonicate was spun for 30 min at 3000 × g, adjusted to 1.12 g/ml using sodium bromide, and layered below a solution of 1.10 g/ml sodium bromide. After spinning for 48 h at 100,000 × g, the unincorporated protein and small dense particles were discarded. The remainder was collected and dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline/0.02% (w/v) azide. The activity of each CETP isoform was analyzed with a BODIPY-CE assay. 10 μl of concentrated medium was combined with HDL (80 μl of a 160-fold dilution in phosphate-buffered saline; Biomedical Technologies, Inc.) and inhibitor (0.5 μl of Me2SO stock) in a black 96-well plate and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. After addition of BODIPY-CE (10 μl of a 4-fold dilution in phosphate-buffered saline), the plate was read in a PerkinElmer Victor plate reader (excitation 485 nm, emission 520 nm), incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and read again. Baseline fluorescent values were subtracted from the 1-h values; data were plotted as percent Me2SO control, and IC50 values were estimated using linear regression with the LabStats program. IC50s thus determined were compared using analysis of variance. Three separate clinical populations comprising a total of 3560 individuals were examined for frequency of missense SNPs. All populations were recruited as part of Pfizer-sponsored drug trials and were of mixed ethnicity, although primarily Caucasian. The first population, from the ACCESS project, has been described (11Ballantyne C.M. Andrews T.C. Hsia J.A. Kramer J.H. Shear C. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 265-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and was at risk for cardiovascular disease with high LDL-C levels and an average age of 61 years. The other populations were similarly recruited but not selected for cardiovascular risk factors or LDL-C levels. Patients in these trials were younger (average age of 49 and 52) than the ACCESS population. Although the ACCESS population was larger, the other populations had measurements of CETP mass as well as HDL-C levels. Comparison of demographic information for the individual populations is shown in Table I.Table IDemographicsACCESSS.D.CETP1S.D.CETP2S.D.African Americans1782317Asians3761Caucasians2599340219Other992813Men1770234158Women114316392Age (yrs)61.310.652.09.049.510.2CAD56%0%0%BMI28.75.128.43.728.53.6LDL-C (mg/dl)172.831.1178.536.3178.233.4HDL-C (mg/dl)48.111.246.212.646.511.8TG (mg/dl)182.368.0183.989.8183.090.5 Open table in a new tab Missense SNPs chosen for analysis included all those described in the literature with variations outside of the signal sequence and not clearly shown to be completely deficient in CETP transfer activity.

I405V and R451Q had been genotyped previously in the ACCESS population using fluorescence polarization technology as described (8Thompson J.F. Lira M.E. Durham L.K. Clark R.W. Bamberger M.J. Milos P.M. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 167: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, SNP frequency varied significantly. One SNP (R282C) was never detected in our populations, whereas Val-405 was found with a frequency of 31–63%, depending on the ethnic group examined. As previously observed in the literature, only three SNPs (A373P, I405V, and R451Q) were found at a frequency of >1% across multiple populations, and D442G was found only among Asians. The number of Asians in our populations was low so an accurate frequency of D442G could not be determined. G314S, V368M, V438M, and V469M, although rare, were identified in these populations at frequencies of 0.02–0.2%. None of the studies discussed here used HDL-C levels as a selection criterion so they have been combined for improved power. As shown in Table III, the three most common SNPs, A373P, I405V, and R451Q, have statistically significant associations with HDL-C even after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The next most common SNP, V368M, demonstrates a trend toward an association, but the number of individuals with this SNP, even in this large population, is too small for statistical significance.Table IIIAssociations with HDL-C in CaucasiansSNPCommonHeterozygousRarePHDLS.D.NHDLS.D.NHDLS.D.NV368M47.711.4303541.79.6130.06A373P47.911.5275345.210.626441.715.440.0007I405V46.710.8133248.111.8118049.612.2306<0.0001V438M47.611.4302434.82.220.11R451Q47.811.4265544.911.115637.715.230.003V469M47.611.430454510.82 Open table in a new tab Two of the significantly associated SNPs, A373P and R451Q, have lower HDL-C levels with the rare alleles, whereas I405V is associated with higher HDL-C levels. Mirroring these associations exactly are the changes in CETP mass (Table IV). The three common variants are all significantly associated with differences in CETP mass even after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In all cases, the alleles associated with higher CETP mass are the same as those associated with lower HDL-C. There are too few homozygotes of Pro-373 and Gln-451 to compare with Val-405, but when heterozygotes are compared, A373P and R451Q are associated with differences in both CETP mass and HDL-C, suggesting the HDL-C effects are related to the amount of CETP rather than its specific activity for these three variants. A373P is in high linkage disequilibrium with R451Q, so these individuals were subdivided into groups with Pro-373 alone or Pro-373 in combination with Gln-451. Results were similar with the two subsets (data not shown).Table IVAssociation with CETP mass in CaucasiansSNPCommonHeterozygousRarePCETPS.D.NCETPS.D.NCETPS.D.NV368M2.60.955362.70.7430.84A373P2.60.924923.01.1742<0.0001I405V2.71.022602.60.812192.40.93610.0005V438M2.60.955322.510.90R451Q2.60.945093.00.98330.0007 Open table in a new tab Because none of these missense SNPs is in the 5′-haploblock previously shown to affect CETP transcription (9Dachet C. Poirier O. Cambien F. Chapman M.J. Rouis M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Thompson J.F. Lloyd D.B. Lira M.E. Milos P.M. Clin. Genet. 2004; 66: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the differences in mass among the variants suggest a post-transcriptional effect. To test this, each of the nine individual variants shown in Table II and the double variant P373/Q451 was cloned and expressed in mammalian cells. When proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, either transiently or stably, it was found that Pro-373 and Gln-451 yielded more protein than wild type, which in turn yielded more protein than Val-405 and substantially more than Gly-442 and Cys-282 (as observed on quantitative Western blots, data not shown). To determine whether this variable yield upon purification might be due in part to protein stability issues, the purified proteins were subjected to partial proteolysis with chymotrypsin. The mechanisms by which CETP is degraded in vivo are not known, so use of chymotrypsin serves as a surrogate for general accessibility of the protein to proteases and other degradatory processes. At room temperature (not shown) or 37 °C, Pro-373, Gln-451 (Fig. 1), and the combination P373/Q451 (data not shown) were resistant to proteolysis relative to wild type. The intact protein runs at 60–65 kDa. Partially proteolyzed Pro-373 and Gln-451 generate two major bands and some minor bands in the 42–48-kDa region, two bands in the 30–35-kDa range, and one band around 16 kDa. The other major band at 28 kDa is chymotrypsin. The 43- and 44-kDa bands yield sequences consistent with cleavage after Trp-105 and Trp-106. The 30- and 33-kDa bands yield sequences consistent with the same two cleavages, suggesting further cleavages toward the C terminus of the protein. The 16-kDa fragment was a mixture of two peptides, one corresponding to a cleavage in the tag sequence near the amino terminus and one occurring after Tyr-361. Val-405 was not found to differ significantly compared with wild type (Fig. 1). The differential stability of the protein variants first detected in vivo and then replicated in vitro suggested other properties of the proteins might also differ. Because CETP is a therapeutically attractive target for inhibition, natural variation in protein sequence might cause differences in the susceptibility of different isoforms to inhibition by torcetrapib or other compounds. To test this possibility, all of the variants shown in Table II were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the resultant proteins tested in an in vitro cholesteryl ester transfer assay as concentrated media from transient transfections, as purified proteins, or both. Activity was measured in an in vitro assay in which fluorescently labeled cholesteryl ester was transferred from synthetic lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein A-1 to HDL. Nine point concentration curves were repeated at least four times for each individual variant and the double variant with IC50s calculated relative to wild type protein. In all cases, the ability of the variants to be inhibited by torcetrapib (a CETP inhibitor) was not significantly different from wild type (Fig. 2). Gly-442 demonstrated a trend toward a greater susceptibility to inhibition, but this effect was not statistically significant using analysis of variance. Prior to evaluating the effect of CETP inhibitors on various proteins, it was important to have an understanding of the properties of the different variants. Both CETP and its substrates are highly lipophilic and display non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics, making them difficult to study in vitro. Thus, clinical populations in which both HDL-C, an indirect measure of CETP activity, and CETP mass had been determined provide a valuable tool for estimating the specific activity of the protein under physiological conditions. Previous work has been performed with promoter variants that affect only CETP mass with no impact on specific activity (7Boekholdt S.M. Thompson J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1080-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that a 20% change in transcription/mass translates to approximately a 10% change in HDL-C. The small changes in HDL-C that we observe with these amino acid variants are consistent with what has been seen in the literature. Only I405V has been studied often in large populations, and a meta-analysis of those data indicates an association with HDL-C that is highly significant despite its small magnitude (7Boekholdt S.M. Thompson J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1080-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the magnitude of changes seen previously with both HDL-C (∼5%) and CETP mass (∼10%). The slightly larger effects seen with A373P and R451Q are also consistent with the largest studies previously performed (18Agerholm-Larsen B. Tybjaerg-Hansen A. Schnohr P. Steffensen R.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 1907-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The changes in HDL-C (Table III) and CETP mass (Table IV) are consistent with the common variants A373P, I405V, and R451Q having little or no difference in specific activity. The effect on HDL-C can be explained by the observed change in CETP mass. There are too few individuals with the less common variations to draw definite conclusions. The elevated level of CETP mass with Pro-373 and Gln-451 is independent of promoter genotype and thus must arise from some post-transcriptional mechanism. To determine whether protein stability plays a role in this observation, partial proteolysis studies were carried out with purified proteins. There are two major regions of internal cleavage of CETP, with the most prominent being at Trp-105 and Trp-106. A second cleavage at Tyr-361 appears to generate the ∼33-kDa bands from the ∼45-kDa bands initially generated by cutting at Trp-105 and Trp-106. CETP is in the same protein superfamily as bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), and their sequence homology allows the generation of a CETP structure model based on the structure of BPI (20Beamer L.J. Carroll S.F. Eisenberg D. Science. 1997; 276: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bruce C. Beamer L.J. Tall A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The CETP protein can be divided into N- and C-terminal domains, with some flexibility between the two domains to allow binding to different sizes of lipids. In the molecular model of CETP (Fig. 3), Asn-445-Asp-460 forms a β-hairpin that is mostly buried at the domain interface. The Pro-373 variant could stabilize the β-hairpin by increasing hydrophobic interactions with Ile-448, whereas Gln-451 could reduce the R polarity that is not favored in the hydrophobic pocket around Trp-264. The increased stability of the Asn-445-Asp-460 hairpin does not seem to affect activity but may stabilize the protein in vivo and in vitro. The subtle and not so subtle differences among the CETP isoforms suggested that other properties might also vary. For example, the binding site for torcetrapib within the postulated CETP structure has not been characterized, and any of these variants could potentially affect its ability to bind or inhibit. As shown in Fig. 3, the variants tested here are located throughout the putative structure so it would not be surprising for one or more to be near the torcetrapib-binding site, especially R282C, V438M, D442G, or V469M. We found no statistically significant differences in the IC50s among the variants when inhibited by torcetrapib. Although we cannot rule out that small differences could occur among variants, these would necessarily be too small to be clinically significant. Variation in drug response has long been known to be driven in large part by individual differences in genetics (22Goldstein D.B. Tate S.K. Sisodiya S.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These differences are commonly caused by differences in pharmacokinetics, but target variation can also play a role. CETP is unusual relative to many drug targets because it has one very common missense variation (>30%) and three other variations that occur across multiple ethnic groups at >1% frequency. Given these high frequencies, it is important to know whether this variation affects the ability of the protein to be inhibited. We have ruled out target variation as a potential source of variability in HDL-C-elevating effects by torcetrapib. This is consistent with the relatively uniform level of inhibition observed in clinical trials to date (4Clark R.W. Sutfin T.A. Ruggeri R.B. Willauer A.T. Sugarman E.D. Magnus-Aryitey G.

https://openalex.org/W1964066897,"AF-6 is a key molecule essential for structure organization of cell-cell junction of polarized epithelia. It belongs to a novel cell-cell adhesion system. The AF-6 PDZ domain mediates interactions by binding to a specific amino acid sequence in target proteins. Here we report the solution structure of the AF-6 PDZ domain determined by NMR. Previously, the AF-6 PDZ domain was considered to be a class II PDZ domain. However we found that a unique hydrophilic amino acid, Gln70, at position αB1 makes the αB/βB groove of the AF-6 PDZ domain significantly different from that of the canonical class II PDZ domain. The AF-6 PDZ domain does not have the second hydrophobic binding pocket, and the N-terminal end of αB is closer to βB. Using BIACORE and NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments, we have studied the binding characteristics of the PDZ domain to the C-terminal peptide of Neurexin, KKNKDKEYYV, and that of Bcr, KRQSILFSTEV. The C-terminal peptide of Neurexin is a class II ligand, whereas that of Bcr is a class I ligand. The dissociation constants of these ligands were 4.08 × 10–7 and 2.23 × 10–6m, respectively. Each of the four C-terminal positions in Neurexin and Bcr may contribute to the interaction. The three-dimensional models of the AF-6 PDZ-Neurexin C-terminal peptide complex and the AF-6 PDZ-Bcr C-terminal peptide complex were built up by molecular dynamics simulations. Unlike the canonical class II PDZ domain, Ala74 at αB5 rather than the residue at αB1 makes direct hydrophobic contact with the side chain of Tyr at the –2 position of the ligand.

The human AF-6 gene was initially discovered as a fusion partner of the ALL-1 gene in acute lymphoblastic leukemia caused by a chromosomal translocation, t(6;11) (1.Prasad R. Gu Y. Alder H.

It belongs to a novel cell-cell adhesion system, which is composed of nectin and afadin (homolog molecule of AF-6 in mouse) (4.Asakura T. Nakanishi H. Sakisaka T. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Nishimura M.

It competes with Raf in binding Ras and down-regulates Ras-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase activation (9.Radziwill G. Erdmann R.A. Margelisch U. Moelling K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4663-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, AF-6 can control integrin-mediated cell adhesion by regulating Rap1 activation through the specific recruitment of Rap1GTP and SPA-1 (10.Su L. Hattori M. Moriyama M. Murata N. Harazaki M. Kaibuchi K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). AF-6 is a multidomain protein. It contains two Ras-binding domains (11.Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a forkhead-associated domain (12.Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem.

PDZ (PSD-95, discs-large, and ZO-1) domains are structurally conserved modules consisting of 80–90 residues (14.Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R.

Numerous structural and biochemical studies have demonstrated that the C-terminal peptide ligand always binds to the PDZ domain by fitting into a hydrophobic groove between a β-strand and an α-helix (19.Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 20.Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Biol. 2003; 23: 4663-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), are in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. Here we pay special attention to the interaction of AF-6 with Neurexin and Bcr. Neurexin is a neuronal cell surface protein. It can mediate the assembly of presynaptic terminals (25.Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E. Scheiffele P. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). At least three neurexin genes, designated NRXN I–III, are expressed in mammals. Thousands of neurexin isoforms are generated from these three genes by usage of alternative promoters and alternative splicing (26.Missler M. Sudhof T.C. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 20-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). They share identical transmembrane regions and cytoplasmic C-terminal domains but have variable extracellular domains on the cell surface. Neurexin can bind to many PDZ domain-containing proteins in a PDZ domain-dependent manner (23.Hock B. Bohme B. Karn T. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Holtrich U. Holland S. Pawson T. Rubsamen-Waigmann H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19933-19941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Bcr is well known as part of the chimeric fusion protein Bcr-Abl that arises by the Philadelphia chromosome that was found in 95% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (29.Faderl S. Talpaz M. Estrov Z. O'Brien S. Kurzrock R. Kantarjian H.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The normal cellular Bcr gene encodes a 160-kDa phosphoprotein associated with serine/threonine kinase activity. Bcr can induce down-regulation of Ras signaling via binding of the AF-6 PDZ domain, which increases the affinity of AF-6 for activated Ras (9.Radziwill G. Erdmann R.A. Margelisch U. Moelling K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4663-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Despite many biological progresses, major questions regarding the structural basis of interaction between AF-6 and Bcr/Neurexin remain unanswered. For instance, what is the specificity of the PDZ domain of AF-6, and how does it bind to Bcr or Neurexin? Detailed knowledge of its structure is required to better understand all these questions. We determined the solution structure of the AF-6 PDZ domain and characterized the interaction of the AF-6 PDZ domain with the C-terminal peptides of Bcr and Neurexin. Previously, the PDZ domain of AF-6 was classified as the class II PDZ domain (30.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Our data revealed that both peptides can bind to the αB/βB groove of AF-6 PDZ domain, and the αB/βB groove of the AF-6 PDZ domain significantly differs from that of the canonical class II PDZ domain. Expression and Purification of AF-6 PDZ Domain—The human AF-6 PDZ domain (amino acid residues 987–1078) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the human brain cDNA library with specific primers. The amplified DNA fragment was inserted into the plasmid pET22b (+) (Novagen). The recombinant plasmids harboring the respective target genes were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host cells for large scale protein production. Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled proteins were prepared by growing bacteria in SV40 medium using 15NH4Cl (0.5 g/liter) and 13C6-glucose (2.5 g/liter) as stable isotope sources. Recombinant PDZ domain fragment was purified using HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. The purified recombinant protein contained an N-terminal Met and a C-terminal His tag (-LEHHHHHH) carried over from the cloning vector. Peptide Synthesis—The C-terminal peptides of Neurexin and Bcr, KKNKDKEYYV and KRQSILFSTEV, were synthesized using conventional Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase peptide synthesis protocols and cleaved off the resin with 2.5% triisopropylsilane and 2.5% H2O in trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (C18 column, 5.0×250 mm) using a linear gradient of 15–30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The final products were lyophilized and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Association and dissociation of the AF-6 PDZ domain with the C-terminal peptides of Neurexin and Bcr were measured with a BIAcore® 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The C-terminal peptides of Neurexin and Bcr were coupled to a carboxymethyl-dextran CM5 sensor chip with an amine coupling kit containing 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide, and ethanolamine. After the chip was activated by 60 μl of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide mixture, the peptide was coupled to the CM5 sensor surface using about 60 μl of peptide (1 μm) in immobilization buffer (10 mm acetate, pH 5.0). The binding assay was performed with a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min at 20 °C with the PDZ domain concentrations in the range of 0–6.58 μm. The running buffer is 10 mm acetate and 150 mm NaCl (pH 5.5) containing 0.005% surfactant P20. 20 mm HCl were used to regenerate the chip. For fitting of the binding kinetics, BIA-evaluation version 4.0 software (BIAcore AB) was applied, and the 1:1 Langmuir binding model was chosen. NMR Experiments—Both the purified 15N-labeled and 15N/13C-labeled proteins were dissolved to a final concentration of 2 mm in 500 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.9) containing 1 mm EDTA in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. All of the NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer with self-shielded z axis gradients. 1H-15N HSQC 1The abbreviations used are: HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; MD, molecular dynamics; PSD-95, postsynaptic density-95. spectra were acquired on uniformly 15N-labeled or 15N/13C-labeled samples. The latter sample was used to collect triple resonance spectra. The sequential backbone resonance assignments of protein were obtained by inspection of three-dimensional HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCANH, and CBCA(CO)NH and confirmed by a three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY experiment. Side chain resonance assignments were obtained from 15N TOCSY-HSQC, H(C)(CO)NH-TOCSY, (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY, 13C NOESY-HSQC, and 15N NOESY-HSQC. The -NH2 side chains of Asn and Gln residues were assigned by a three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY experiment with the 15N-labeled protein dissolved in H2O. The 15N-separated NOESY and 13C-separated NOESY were collected with mixing times of 80 and 130 ms, respectively. The 15N-labeled sample was lyophilized and then redissolved in 99.96% D2O, which was followed immediately with HSQC experiments to monitor the disappearance of NH signal at 295 K. All of the NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe and analyzed using Sparky 3. NMR Titration—Titrations of AF-6 PDZ domain with peptidic ligands were performed by adding solid aliquots of the peptides to 250 μm solutions of the 15N-labeled protein. The 1H and 15N resonance variations were followed at 25 °C by collecting HSQC experiments. Combined chemical shift perturbation was calculated using the following equation, Δδppm=(ΔδHN) 2+(ΔδNαN) 2 with a scaling factor (αN) of 0.17. Structure Calculations—Approximate upper interproton distance restraints were from two NOESY spectra (15N-separated NOESY and 13C-separated NOESY). Nuclear Overhauser effects were grouped into four distance ranges: 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 according to their relative intensity. The chemical shift index was calculated for four types of nuclei: Cα, Cβ, C′, and Hα. The derived secondary structure based on the consensus chemical shift index were converted into restraints on ϕ and ψ angles. Hydrogen bond restrains were obtained by identifying the slow exchange amide protons located in regular secondary structures. Structures were calculated using the program CNS v1.1. The calculated structures were analyzed by the programs PROCHECK and MOLMOL. Molecular Modeling of AF-6 PDZ Domain with C-terminal Pentapeptide of Neurexin or Bcr—To build up models of the AF-6 PDZ domain with the C-terminal peptide of the Neurexin or Bcr complex, we used a crystal structure of the complex of PDZ2 of Syntenin with a Syndecan-4 peptide (Protein Data Bank code 1oby) as a template. Structure alignment was performed using a CE (31.Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar) algorithm followed by molecular replacement. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to optimize the models. First, 500 steps of steepest descent energy minimization followed by 300 ps of MD simulation at 300 K was carried out, with all heavy atoms of the protein and the ligand peptide backbone restrained to their respective starting positions by a harmonic potential, with a restraint force constant of 5.0E3 KJ/(mol*nm2). Then another 500-ps MD simulation was performed with position restraints applied to the heavy atoms of the residues out of the binding region including residues 13–24, 37–41, and 65–82. In the next step, the entire system was optimized by 500 ps of MD simulation without any restraints. Finally, the resulting configuration was minimized through stepwise simulated annealing; in a 400-ps simulation the temperature of the system was gradually reduced from 300 to 100 K. The GROMOS96 package (32.van Gunstern W.F. Billeter S.R. Eising A.A. Hunenberger P.H. Kruger P. Mark A.E. Scott W.R. Tironi I.G. Biomolecular Simulation: The GROMOS96 Manual and User Guide. Vdf Hochschulverlag, Zurich1996Google Scholar) with the GROMOS96 forcefield combined with an implicit generalized-Born/solvent-accessible surface area solvent model (33.Zhu J. Shi Y.Y. Liu H.Y. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 4844-4853Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used to perform the simulations. The quality of the resulting models was checked using the program PROCHECK. Coordinates—The coordinates of the structure of PDZ domain of AF-6 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1T2M). Coordinates of the modeled PDZ-peptide complex are available from the authors on request. NMR Structure Determination of AF-6 PDZ Domain—The 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of the AF-6 PDZ domain were assigned by standard methods using triple resonance experiments and 15N-separated TOCSY and NOESY experiments. All of the backbone resonances were assigned, with the exception of the N- and C-terminal residues and the 15N resonance of proline. More than 95% of the side chain 1H resonances were assigned. A total of 1564 experimentally derived distance and dihedral angle restraints were utilized in the structure calculations (Table I). Fig. 1A shows a stereoview of the superposition of a family of 20 lowest energy NMR structures.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of AF-6 PDZ Domain—The NMR-derived tertiary structure of the AF-6 PDZ domain is similar to other PDZ domain structures determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy (14.Doyle D.A.

The protein contains two α-helices (αA and αB) and six β-strands (from βAto βF) (Fig. 1B). All of the β-strands in the sheet have an antiparallel orientation. As in other PDZ domains, a deep binding groove for substrates can be observed that is constructed by strand βB, its N-terminal loop, and αB. We superposed the AF-6 PDZ domain with three structures representing the three interaction classes, human homologue of the discs-large protein PDZ3 (1PDR; class I), CASK/Lim2 (1KWA; class II), and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase PDZ domain (1QAU; class III). The superposition shows that the structural differences are mainly in the displacement of α-helix involved in peptide binding with respect to the β-sheet and the loops between strand βA/βB and βB/βC (Supplemental Fig. 1). Unique Characteristics of the Substrate-binding Groove— Based on the oriented peptide library technique, the AF-6 PDZ domain was recognized as the class II PDZ domain (30.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis reveals that a Gln takes the position of αB1 in the AF-6 PDZ domain (Fig. 1C). To our knowledge, it is unique. In the canonical PDZ domain, the binding specificity is critically determined by the interaction of the first residue of αB helix (αB1) with the side chain of the –2 residue of the ligand (the residue at C terminus is designated 0, and the remaining residues are numbered with negative integers whose absolute value increases toward the N terminus). Class II PDZ interactions are characterized by hydrophobic residues at both the –2 position of the peptide ligand and the αB1 position of the PDZ domain (30.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). A hydrophilic amino acid at the position of αB1 makes AF-6 PDZ domain quite different from the canonical class II PDZ domain, as exemplified by the hCASK PDZ domain. We analyzed the structure features of this residue as well as the αB/βB groove in detail, hoping to gain insight into the target binding specificity of this PDZ domain. Fig. 2 compares the conformation of the αB/βB groove of the AF-6 PDZ domain with that of the hCASK PDZ domain and PSD-95 PDZ3, respectively. It is noteworthy that the αB/βB groove of the AF-6 PDZ domain is more similar to that of PSD-95 PDZ3, in which a His takes the αB1 position. In the AF-6 PDZ domain, the side chain of Gln70 projects toward the αB/βB groove as the side chain of His does in the PSD-95 PDZ3. At the same time we noted that the position of βB5 is occupied by a small hydrophobic amino acid, Ala23. In the class II PDZ domain, a hydrophobic residue was also found at this position. But the side chain of this residue reaches to the αB/βB groove and forms a hydrophobic pocket with the residue at position αB1, whereas in the class I PDZ domain a highly conserved Gly is found at this position. In the structure of PSD-95 PDZ3, the presence of this Gly creates a turn of the peptide backbone away from the ligand. Because of the small size and different orientation of the side chain of Ala23, the N-terminal end of αB in the PDZ domain is closer to βB with respect to the αB helix in the hCASK PDZ domain. Fig. 3 compares the surface representation of a αB/βB groove of the PDZ domains of AF-6, hCASK, and PSD-95 PDZ3. We found that the surface structure of the αB/βB groove of AF-6 PDZ domain is more similar to that of PSD-95 PDZ3 and does not have the second hydrophobic binding pocket, which exists in the hCASK PDZ domain to accommodate the hydrophobic or aromatic residue at the –2 position of ligand. We therefore deduce that the binding model of the AF-6 PDZ domain is different from that of the canonical class II PDZ, although the AF-6 PDZ domain was classified as class II. Furthermore, the βA/βB connecting loop contains highly conserved Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe sequences (GLGF repeats) in the class I and class III PDZ domains. These amino acids turn out to play an important functional role in binding the C-terminal carboxylate group of the peptide, and therefore the loop is referred to as the carboxylate-binding loop. In the AF-6 PDZ domain, the carboxylate-binding loop is replaced by the sequence GMGL. Despite the difference in sequence, the side chains of both the second and fourth amino acids in the GMGL motif are pointed toward the interior of the protein and are invariantly hydrophobic. Although the structure of the αB/βB grooves of the AF-6 PDZ domain and the canonical third domain of PSD-95 are similar, differences are apparent. The AF-6 PDZ domain has a longer βB/βC loop with four extra residues, whereas it has one residue fewer in the βA/βB loop. C Termini of Neurexin and Bcr Directly Bind to AF-6 PDZ Domain—It is controversial whether Neurexin can interact with the AF-6 PDZ domain (22.Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K.

To determine the dissociation constant of the AF-6 PDZ domain with the C-terminal peptides of Neurexin and Bcr, surface plasmon resonance measurements were carried out. Both peptides were coupled to a carboxymethyl-dextran CM5 sensor chip with an amine coupling kit. Binding was observed upon injection of different concentrations of the AF-6 PDZ domain (Supplemental Fig. 2). The plateau values reached after completion of the association reaction were analyzed by a Langmuir-binding isotherm. The dissociation constants of 4.08 × 10–7 and 2.23 × 10–6m were obtained for Neurexin and Bcr, respectively. Furthermore, the peptide with the sequence KKNKDKEYY does not bind to the PDZ"

The defect in post-translational formation of the Cα-formylglycine residue causes a severe lysosomal storage disorder in humans. Recently, FGE (formylglycine-generating enzyme) has been identified as the protein required for this specific modification. Using sequence comparisons, a protein homologous to FGE was found and denoted pFGE (paralog of FGE). pFGE binds a sulfatase-derived peptide bearing the FGE recognition motif, but it lacks formylglycine-generating activity. Both proteins belong to a large family of pro- and eukaryotic proteins containing the DUF323 domain, a formylglycine-generating enzyme domain of unknown three-dimensional structure. We have crystallized the glycosylated human pFGE and determined its crystal structure at a resolution of 1.86 Å. The structure reveals a novel fold, which we denote the FGE fold and which therefore serves as a paradigm for the DUF323 domain. It is characterized by an asymmetric partitioning of secondary structure elements and is stabilized by two calcium cations. A deep cleft on the surface of pFGE most likely represents the sulfatase polypeptide binding site. The asymmetric unit of the pFGE crystal contains a homodimer. The putative peptide binding site is buried between the monomers, indicating a biological significance of the dimer. The structure suggests the capability of pFGE to form a heterodimer with FGE.

These DUF323 domains exhibit a mean average identity of 26% over the average length of 246 amino acids and are found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. Even more proteins, ∼300, containing this domain are suggested by the COG1262 (clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (14Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the domain resides mostly on its own, presumed to fulfill divergent functions such as an oxygenase involved in the synthesis of a β-lactam antibiotic (Erwinia carotovora) (15Khaleeli N.

In ∼12% of the proteins, the DUF323 domain has been found to be fused to other domains that are thought to function as a serine/threonine kinase in bacteria (Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichodesmium erythraeum), as cytosine/adenosine deaminases in fungi, as a peptidase in archaea and bacteria (Nostoc sp. and Methanosarcina barkeri), or as methyltransferase (Nitrosomonas europaea) or as Hsp60 chaperonin (Homo sapiens). In vitro studies by Mariappan et al (39Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D. Dierks T. von Figura K. J. Biol.

Comparison of gene expression reveals an equal pFGE/FGE ratio in all tissue types studied (39Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D.

Those observations and the fact that pFGE is highly conserved in vertebrates strongly suggests a function different from, but also related to, that of FGE, such as regulation of FGE activity. We determined the crystal structure of pFGE, which represents the first three-dimensional structure of a DUF323 domain. The pFGE structure reveals a single domain of a novel fold with a strikingly low degree of secondary structure. The tertiary structure is stabilized by two calcium cations and a disulfide bond. The pFGE structure was used to determine the crystal structure of FGE, revealing a high structural similarity (40Dierks, T., Dickmanns, A., Preusser-Kunze, A., Schmidt, B., Mariappan, M., von Figura, K., Ficner, R., and Rudolph, M. G. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). These structures allowed us to delineate the differences between the catalytically inactive pFGE and the active FGE. In addition, the structures point to a possible cellular function of pFGE. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of pFGE— Cloning, expression, and purification of pFGE were performed as described by Mariappan et al. (39Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A.

Protein solutions of 7-10 mg/ml concentration were used for crystallization trials. Crystals were grown at 20 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in Chryschem plates sealed with clear tape (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA) by mixing equal volumes of pFGE with reservoir solution (16-20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 20% 1,3-methyl-pentane-diol (MPD), 0.1 m CaCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m TRIS/HCl, pH 8.0), which also served a cryoprotectant. Heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking the crystals in reservoir solution supplemented with 2 mm HgCl2 and 2 mm K2PtCl4, respectively, for 45 min. Xenon-pFGE derivatives were obtained by incubation of the crystals for 25 min in a pressurized chamber at 15 bar (Xcell, Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). Data Collection—X-ray diffraction data were collected in-house using a Micromax 007 rotating copper anode generator (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX) operating at 40 kV and 20 mA, equipped with Osmic focusing mirrors and a Mar345dtb detector system (X-ray Research, Hamburg, Germany). Cryo-cooling was performed using the X-Stream system (Rigaku/MSC). The crystal-to-detector distances were 120-180 mm. Typical data sets contained more than 180 frames with 1° rotation and a 20-min exposure time/image. The native crystal diffracted to a maximum resolution of 1.86 Å with a mosaicity of 0.97°. The data were processed with DENZO/Scalepack (HKL Research, Charlottesville, VA) and revealed a primitive monoclinic lattice with unit cell parameters of a = 47.1 Å, b = 100.8 Å, c = 62.7 Å, and β = 101.7°. Systematic absences along the b axis revealed the space group to be P21.

Water molecules were assigned automatically for >3σ peaks in Fo - Fc difference maps by cycling the REFMAC5 refinement with ARP/wARP (24Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The final model consists of two molecules (A and B) encompassing residues 28-294 with Thr-109 missing in molecule A. No electron density was visible for the N-terminal residue 26 of model A and the C-terminal residues 295-312, which were therefore not included in the model. Residues Gln-106 of molecule A and Lys-107 of molecule B were modeled as alanines due to lack of side chain density. Alternate side chain conformations were modeled for Arg-79, Arg-84, Met-89, Arg-127, Arg-253, and Arg-268 of molecule A and Arg-84, Gln-138, Lys-205, and Arg-250 of molecule B. The refinement statistics are summarized below (see Table I). Surface complementarity coefficients and solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated with SC using a 1.7 Å radius probe (26Project Collaborative Computational Four Number Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). Possible hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals contacts were detected with HBPLUS and CONTACSYM (27Sheriff S. Hendrickson W.A. Smith J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 273-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) using default parameters. Surface potentials were calculated with Pymol using the implemented function of vacuum electrostatics. The quality of the model was checked using PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (29Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plots (30Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar) showed that 89.7% are in the most favorable regions and 8.3% are in the additionally allowed region, whereas 1.1% are in the generously allowed region. Only 0.9% of the residues are in the disallowed region, namely Leu-116 and Asn-233. Leu-116 of both molecules has ϕ/Ψ combinations (chain A, ϕ = 47.2°, Ψ = -118.3°; chain B, ϕ = 47.5°, Ψ = -117.5°) that lie in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, but the residues are very well defined in the electron density map. Leucine 116 is part of the contact area between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The distortion appears to be a consequence of this interaction. Asn-233 is located between 2 residues that are involved in calcium cation binding via their carbonyl oxygens. The calcium cation probably induces force on the peptidyl chain, resulting in the observed forbidden conformation of the Asn-233 residue chain: A, ϕ = 72.2°, Ψ = -87.3°; chain B, ϕ = 69.7°, Ψ = -85.0°). The monomer contains two cis-prolines at positions 53 and 201. Secondary structure predictions were performed using STRIDE (31Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar, 32Eisenhaber F. Persson B. Argos P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 1-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Coordinates were superimposed with LSQKAB (33Kabsch W. Kabsch H. Eisenberg D. J. Mol.

Structure Determination—The crystal structure of pFGE was determined by means of MIRAS using several heavy atom derivatives (Table I). The initial electron density map obtained from experimental phases after solvent flattening was of excellent quality and allowed autotracing of ∼450 out of 560 amino acids of the polypeptide chains (Fig. 1A). The quality of the initial MIRAS electron density map is exemplified by the presence of density for three sugar moieties attached to Asn-191 (Fig. 1B). A native data set was used for refinement to a resolution of 1.86 Å (Table I). The pFGE structure was refined to a free R-value of 17.2%, exhibiting good stereochemistry (Table I). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two pFGE molecules. Due to the high resolution, no noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied during refinement, allowing meaningful comparison of the two monomers. An overlay of both monomers reveals a root mean square deviation of 0.32 Å, indicative for the lack of significant structural differences between the two monomers (data not shown). The attached trisaccharide, consisting of 1 fucose and 2 GlcNAc residues, was modeled into the electron density for molecule A (Fig. 1B), but only the 2 GlcNAc residues could be modeled in the molecule B of the asymmetric unit. These GlcNAc residues protrude from the molecule into a solvent channel in the crystal. By contrast, the fucose residue of molecule A is involved in the crystal packing by interaction with a molecule of the neighboring asymmetric unit, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure. Usually, the flexibility of carbohydrate side chains is detrimental to ordered crystal packing, but not so in pFGE. Overall Fold—The fold of pFGE consists of five α-helices ranging from 5 to 11 amino acids in length and two short 310 helices (Figs. 1A and 2, denoted by η). The 11 β-strands are 2-7 amino acids in length and form four antiparallel β-sheets (Fig. 2A). The first two sheets, formed by β-strands 1/4/11 and 2/3, respectively, engulf α-helix 5, which on the opposing side is flanked by the third sheet (β-strands 7/8/9/10). The arrangement of sheet 3 and sheet 4 (β-strands 5/6) allows the formation of a deep cleft (see below). The surface of sheet 4 opposing this cleft is shielded from the solvent by two short helices, α-helix 3 and a 310 helix, η1. With the exception of the remaining two longer helices of perpendicular arrangement (helices 1 and 4) and one short helix (helix 2), the structure is void of secondary structure elements (Fig. 1A). Indeed, pFGE exhibits a surprising lack of secondary structure elements, 37% in total with 17.7% helices (2.3% 310 helices and 15.4% α-helices), and 19.2% β-strands. Remarkably, the few secondary structure elements present are distributed in a nonuniformly fashion on one side of the molecule, which in the following will be referred to as the “motif-rich” side in contrast to the “sugar side” (Fig. 1A). The pFGE monomer is of almost ellipsoid shape (50 × 30 × 30 Å) and compact with two larger protrusions, one at Asn-191, where the trisaccharide is attached (“sugar side”), and a bulge formed by 310 helix η2 on the opposing side of the molecule (Fig. 1A). The crystal structure of pFGE reveals a novel fold with an interesting partitioning of the molecule in two halves, distinguishable by the amount of secondary structure elements they contain (see above). Thus, it was not surprising that no structures with a significant homology were found when performing a search using DALI (36Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar). The structurally closest protein is a fragment of a sugar-binding protein, the C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (Crd4) from the macrophage mannose receptor (1egg-A) with a DALI score of 5.5 (a score of <2.5 is structurally dissimilar, whereas the self-comparison score of pFGE is 51). However, this homology extends over only 98 residues (of a total of 268) and shares a sequence identity of 8%. Additionally these homologous 98 residues are dispersed over the complete pFGE as well as the Crd4 domain, which comprises 132 residues. The low DALI score and arrangement of the structurally similar arranged residues prompted us to conclude that pFGE does not share any structural homology with known proteins. The FGE Fold as a Paradigm for the DUF323 Domain—The unusual paucity of secondary structure elements and their uneven distribution within the molecule are the main hallmarks of this new fold that has paradigmatic character for 300 other proteins. The pFGE and FGE structures represent the first three-dimensional models of a DUF323/COG1262 domain-containing protein. Due to the close relationship of pFGE to the functionally well characterized FGE, the novel fold of the DUF323 domain is denoted “FGE fold.” Sequence comparison of all known DUF323 domains suggests that all of them adopt the FGE fold (Fig. 2B). The manifold functions associated with the DUF323 domain, such as oxygenase, transcriptional regulator, or as an enhancer of xylanase production (see the Introduction), indicate that this fold harbors an extremely versatile set of functions. This raises the question of how the fold of the DUF323 domain can fulfill this multitude of functions. Examples in the data base showing that the DUF323/COG1262 domain is found in combination with other domains, like a serine/threonine kinase, a peptidase, or a chaperonin domain (see the Introduction), suggest that it has a predominant function in polypeptide binding/modification. The few biochemical data that are available on these proteins are insufficient to point to a common active site present in all FGE fold proteins. Thus, further biochemical and structural data are needed to clarify this question. Fold-determining and Structure-stabilizing Features of pFGE—The tertiary structure of pFGE is stabilized by a conserved disulfide bond formed by the two cysteines present in the molecule (Fig. 3A). The bridge between Cys-156 located in helix 4 to the Cys-290 in close proximity to the last β-strand (β-11) arrests this β-strand in close proximity to β-strand 4 to become part of the same β-sheet (Fig. 2A). This disulfide bridge is also conserved in FGE, underscoring its stabilizing function. Interestingly, FGE has 6 additional cysteines, 4 of which form two additional disulfide bridges, and the remaining 2 cysteines play a role in catalytic activity (13Landgrebe J. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 316: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Mutenda K. Wenzel D. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (10.1074/jbc.M413383200)Google Scholar, 40Dierks, T., Dickmanns, A., Preusser-Kunze, A., Schmidt, B., Mariappan, M., von Figura, K., Ficner, R., and Rudolph, M. G. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). Two metal binding sites could clearly be identified in the electron density maps of pFGE. Both metal ions are buried in the core of pFGE and display low B-values, indicative of their structure-stabilizing function. As the presence of calcium cations is required for crystallization, and the endoplasmic reticulum, where pFGE is naturally localized, contains elevated calcium cation concentrations, calcium cations must be the natural metal ion in pFGE. Calcium binding site 1 (Fig. 3C) in pFGE is located in the center of a bipyramidal arrangement with the corners of the pyramid base formed by the carboxamide group of the side chain of Asn-194, the Asp-208 side chain carboxylate group, and two water molecules located in 2.3-2.6 Å distance to the calcium cation. Asp-204 coordinates these two water molecules, and its side chain conformation depends on a sharp kink in the polypeptide chain due to cis-Pro-201 (Fig. 3C). The tips of the bipyramid are located off center with respect to the pyramid base and are occupied by the carbonyl groups of Leu-195 and Phe-210 in a distance of 2.3 Å to the calcium cation (Fig. 3C). A much more irregular coordination is observed for the other calcium site. The coordination of the calcium cation 2 (Fig. 3B) is achieved by the carbonyl groups of Asp-229, Gly-232, Val-234, as well as the side chain of Glu-236, showing comparable distances between 2.5 and 2.9 Å. The calcium cation is shifted from the central plane of the bipyramid toward the tip occupied by Leu-230. The second tip is harboring a water molecule (Fig. 3B). The distances from the calcium cation to the pyramid tips are similar, 2.5 Å to the water molecule and 2.6 Å to the Leu-230 (Fig. 3B). Only Leu-230 is off center when compared with the axis defined by the water molecule and the calcium cation. The carbonyl group of Leu-230 is oriented almost perpendicular to this axis, which is in contrast to the other residues involved in the coordination of both calcium cations. The sequence comparison of DUF323 domains reveals that the two calcium cation binding sites are conserved, but the cis-proline and the disulfide bridge in pFGE are predominantly found in those of mammalian origin (Fig. 2A). Peptide Binding and Dimer Formation—It has been shown that human pFGE lacks formylglycine-generating activity (39Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D. Dierks T. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15173-15179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the function of pFGE is likely to be related to FGE function for four reasons. (i) The comparison of expression levels revealed an equal pFGE/FGE ratio in all tissue types studied; (ii) the compromising effect of pFGE on FGE mediated generation of catalytically active sulfatases in coexpression studies; (iii) pFGE has been shown to bind peptides bearing the recognition motif required for the generation of FGly in arylsulfatase A in vitro; and (iv) the three-dimensional structures of pFGE and FGE are closely related (39Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D. Dierks T. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15173-15179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40Dierks, T., Dickmanns, A., Preusser-Kunze, A., Schmidt, B., Mariappan, M., von Figura, K., Ficner, R., and Rudolph, M. G. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). The active site of FGE has recently been identified by the analysis of the FGE crystal structure (40Dierks, T., Dickmanns, A., Preusser-Kunze, A., Schmidt, B., Mariappan, M., von Figura, K., Ficner, R., and Rudolph, M. G. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar) and confirmed by chemical cross-linking studies (38Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Mutenda K. Wenzel D. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (10.1074/jbc.M413383200)Google Scholar). Pro-182 of FGE, which was shown to chemically cross-link with the bound substrate related peptide, is structurally conserved in pFGE (Pro-120). These prolines border one end of a cleft thought to be involved in peptide binding (Fig. 4A, Pro-120 in blue). This cleft is conserved in FGE and pFGE and is formed by two β-sheets (Figs. 1 and 2A, S3 and S4). The shape of this cleft is highly similar, but their chemical and electrostatic properties partially differ (Fig. 4). The changes are localized in two distinct regions located at the ends of the cleft. The changes are in a small region in the vicinity of the Pro-120 reaching toward the bottom of the cleft, which results in slight changes in the surface potential. The second region of amino acid substitutions in pFGE is found at the opposite side of the cleft, changing the rather neutral surface charge in FGE into a negatively charged one. Importantly, the catalytically essential cysteine residues Cys-336 and Cys-341 of FGE are located at this end of the cleft (Fig. 4), further corroborating the notion that this cleft harbors the active site. The substitution of these 2 catalytically active cysteines by Ala-261 and Asn-266 in pFGE causes the lack of FGly-generating activity, raising the question as to which function pFGE may serve in vivo. A compelling notion with respect to the function of pFGE comes from the presence of a homodimer in the asymmetric unit of the pFGE crystal. In this homodimer, the monomers face each other with the putative binding cleft for the substrate peptide (Fig. 5A). The total surface area that is buried in the homodimer is 2559 Å2, corresponding to 22.3% of total monomer surface area. However, the actual contact area amounts to only 1437 Å2/monomer, as a large cavity including the peptide binding clefts is formed by the two monomers. This relatively small interaction area is on the lower end of high affinity protein-protein contact areas (37Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The rather small surface complementary coefficient is 0.59, further pointing to a weak interaction within the putative pFGE dimer. Dimer formation could be significantly enhanced upon binding of the substrate polypeptide into the cavity located between two pFGE monomers. With respect to the high structural similarity of pFGE and FGE, the formation of a heterodimer appears also to be possible. A model of the pFGE/FGE heterodimer, obtained by superimposing the FGE structure on a monomer of the pFGE dimer, reveals heterodimer formation to be stereochemically feasible (Fig. 5B). The low root mean square deviation value of 1.3 Å for 249 common Cα atoms of pFGE and FGE indicates that the proposed heterodimer could form, exhibiting a similar interaction surface and cavity size. The heterodimer formation would enhance binding of FGE to the substrate polypeptide and form a protected reaction environment. In line, a channel remains at the heterodimer interface that would still be able to accommodate the unfolded polypeptide chain of the sulfatases. The formation of a heterodimer would explain the observation of a decrease in FGE activity when pFGE is overexpressed in cells and also the constant expression ratio of endogenous mRNA levels found across different tissues (39Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D. Dierks T. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15173-15179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indeed, using the yeast two-hybrid system, coexpression of pFGE and FGE led to the induction of three reporter genes, suggesting a physical interaction of pFGE and FGE (39Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D. Dierks T. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15173-15179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, for FGE, homodimers and larger complexes with a sulfatase could be identified (38Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Mutenda K. Wenzel D. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (10.1074/jbc.M413383200)Google Scholar, 39Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D. Dierks T. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15173-15179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). With respect to the structures, pFGE and FGE have the capability to form homo- and heterodimers, respectively, although this oligomerization might only occur upon binding to the unfolded polypeptide chain of the sulfatase substrates. Conclusion—The crystal structures of pFGE and FGE represent the first three-dimensional structures of the DUF323 domain, which therefore was termed the FGE fold. Due to the high sequence similarity within the proteins belonging to the DUF323 family, we can expect that all DUF323 domains adopt the FGE fold. Despite the fact that pFGE exhibits no FGly-generating activity, it is expressed in an equal pFGE/FGE ratio in many tissue types, indicating an important cellular function. Interestingly, pFGE crystallizes as a dimer, with the peptide binding site buried between the monomers, indicating a biological significance of dimerization. In addition, the formation of a pFGE/FGE heterodimer appears to be possible, pointing toward a function of pFGE in assisting or regulating FGE activity.

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the mixed lineage kinase-like mitogen-activated protein triple kinase (MLTK)-α phosphorylates histone H3 at Ser28. MLTK-α but neither a kinase-negative mutant of MLTK-α nor MLTK-β interacted with and phosphorylated histone H3 in vivo and in vitro. When overexpressed in 293T or JB6 Cl41 cells, MLTK-α phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser28 but not at Ser10. The interaction between MLTK-α and histone H3 was enhanced by stimulation with ultraviolet B light (UVB) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), which resulted in the accumulation of MLTK-α in the nucleus. UVB- or EGF-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28 was not affected by PD 98059, a MEK inhibitor, or SB 202190, a p38 kinase inhibitor, in MLTK-α-overexpressing JB6 Cl41 cells. Significantly, UVB- or EGF-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28 was blocked by small interfering RNA of MLTK-α. The inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser28 in the MLTK-α knock-down JB6 Cl41 cells was not due to a defect in mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 or 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) activity. In summary, these results illustrate that MLTK-α plays a key role in the UVB- and EGF-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28, suggesting that MLTK-α might be a new histone H3 kinase at the level of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases.

The status of a eukaryotic cell is determined by endogenous and exogenous signals, and the end point of the pathways that transduce these signals is DNA. DNA is organized into a nucleoprotein complex termed chromatin, which not only facilitates packaging of DNA within the nucleus but also serves as an important factor in the regulation of genome function (1.Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histone proteins, including H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The identification of enzymes that post-translationally modify histones and the discovery of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes were milestones in the elucidation of the role of chromatin in genome function and regulation (2.Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 3.Peterson C.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cellular signaling pathways influence histones by a number of methods, including phosphorylation of the histone tails, thereby controlling gene expression (4.Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 5.Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7625) Google Scholar). In Tetrahymena, phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28 is very important for chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis (6.Wei Y. Yu L. Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 appears to be involved in the initiation of chromosome condensation but not the maintenance of it (7.Van Hooser A. Goodrich D.W. Allis C.D. Brinkley B.R. Mancini M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 is related to chromosome assembly, congregation at the metaphase plate, and segregation (8.Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 9.de la Barre A.E. Gerson V. Gout S. Creaven M. Allis C.D. Dimitrov S.

Chromosoma. 1991; 100: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28 occurs in chromosomes predominantly during early mitosis and coincides with the initiation of mitotic chromosome condensation in various mammalian cell lines (11.Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol.

Growing knowledge has demonstrated that phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28 is involved in different signal transduction pathways and is dependent on the specific stimulation or stress. For example, histone H3 at Ser10 is phosphorylated by RSK2 when cells are stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; MLTK, mixed lineage kinase-like mitogen-activated protein triple kinase; UVB, ultraviolet B light; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MSK, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase; TPA, 12-O-teteradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; MLK, mixed lineage kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's minimal essential medium; MEM, Eagle's minimal essential medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HA, hemagglutinin; M2H, mammalian two-hybrid; ZAK, zipper sterile-α-motif kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; MLTK, mixed lineage kinase-like mitogen-activated protein triple kinase; UVB, ultraviolet B light; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MSK, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase; TPA, 12-O-teteradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; MLK, mixed lineage kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's minimal essential medium; MEM, Eagle's minimal essential medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HA, hemagglutinin; M2H, mammalian two-hybrid; ZAK, zipper sterile-α-motif kinase.

In addition, our previous studies demonstrated that ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation markedly induces phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28, and the phosphorylation was inhibited by a MEK1 inhibitor or a p38 kinase inhibitor as well as dominant negative mutant ERK or dominant negative mutant p38 kinase in the cells (14.Zhong S.P.

These results clearly demonstrated that MAPKs play a key role to phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28 following stimulation by tumor promoters such as EGF, TPA or UVB. MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that can activate one or several of the MAPK kinase/MAPK cascades (16.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). MAPKKKs phosphorylate two serine/threonine residues in the activation/phosphorylation sites of MAPK kinases (17.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). The well known MAPKKKs include the Raf, the MEK kinase (MEKK) and the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family. The Raf family kinases selectively activate the ERK pathway (18.Wu J. Wong W.W. Khosravi F. Minden M.D. Penn L.Z. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6461-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MEKK1, MEKK2, and MEKK3 activate both the ERK pathway and the JNK/SAPK pathway (19.Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MLK3, MUK, TAK1, and ASK1 activate the JNK/SAPK and p38 kinase pathways (16.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Some of the MAPKKKs are activated by distinct extracellular stimuli. For example, Raf-1 is activated by mitogens and phorbol esters, TAK1 is activated by transforming growth factor-β and cytokines (17.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 20.Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and ASK1 is activated by tumor necrosis factor-α (21.Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Very recently, we demonstrated that MLTK-α, a member of the MLK family, induced neoplastic cell transformation and tumorigenesis in athymic nude mice (22.Cho Y.Y. Bode A.M. Mizuno H. Choi B.Y. Choi H.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, MLTK-α translocates into the nucleus after stimulation of EGF or TPA and also induces phosphorylation of c-Myc, Elk-1, c-Jun, and ATF2 (22.Cho Y.Y. Bode A.M. Mizuno H. Choi B.Y. Choi H.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, even though the role of histone H3 is well characterized in chromatin structure and function, very little is known about the protein kinases that are responsible for the phosphorylation of histones. Here, we demonstrated that MLTK-α is a new kinase that can phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser28, but not Ser10, in vitro and in vivo after stimulation by EGF or UVB. This phosphorylation of histone H3 by MLTK-α may play an important role in chromatin structure remodeling mediating MLTK-α-induced cell transformation or tumorigenesis. Materials—Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM), Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM), l-glutamine, gentamicin, and Lipofectamine Plus reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. EGF, PD 98059, and SB 202190 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Gemini Bio-Product (Calabasas, CA). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore (Bedford, MA), and [γ-32P]ATP and [35S]methionine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Pure histone H3, antibodies against histone H3, and phosphorylated H3 (Ser10 and Ser28) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., and antibodies against HA and 6xHisG epitopes were from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA) and Invitrogen, respectively. Antibodies against phospho-p90RSK and phospho-MSK1 were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent was purchased from Pierce. Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors—For the mammalian two-hybrid (M2H) system, the cDNAs of 60 human kinases were amplified by PCR and introduced into pBIND two-hybrid system vectors. The cDNA encoding histone H3.3 (a generous gift from Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan) was recombined into the BamHI/KpnI site of the pACT vector. To produce stably transfected JB6 Cl41 cells, a cDNA fragment from MLTK-α was introduced into the BamHI/KpnI site of pcDNA4-HisMAXA (pHisG-MLTK-α) (Invitrogen). The point mutation of histone H3 at Ser10 (S10A) or Ser28 (S28A) was generated by using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and introduced into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (pV5-H3-S10A or -S28A), respectively. The cDNAs of MLTK-α, MLTK-β, MLTK-α-KM, and MLTK-β-KM cloned into pSRα-HA were kindly provided by Dr. Eisuke Nishida (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). All of the positive clones containing cDNA inserts were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequence analysis (Genewiz Inc., North Brunswick, NJ). Cell Culture—Swiss 3T3 (Swiss mouse fibroblasts) and 293T (human embryo kidney epithelial) cells were cultured with 10% FBS supplemented with antibiotics. JB6 Cl41 (mouse epithemal) cells were cultured with 5% FBS containing antibiotics. Transfection—The pHisG-MLTK-α stably expressed cells were established using 293T and JB6 Cl41 cells selected by 200 μg/ml of zeocin and pooled. To analyze the interaction of proteins by M2H, 3T3 cells (1.5 × 104) were seeded into 48-well plates and incubated with 10% FBS-DMEM for 18 h before transfection. Transient transfection was carried out using 293T cells to analyze the in vitro kinase activity. The cells were harvested at 48 h of incubation after transfection. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—The DNAs, pACT-phistone H3.3, pBIND kinases, and pG5-luciferease, were combined in the same molar ratio, and the total amount of DNA was not more than 100 ng/well. The transfection was performed with Lipofectamine Plus reagent and following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. The cells were disrupted by addition of 200 μl of cell lysis buffer directly into each well of the 48-well plate, and then aliquots of 100 μl were added to each well of a 96-well luminescence plate. The luminescence activity was measured automatically by a computer program from MTX Lab, Inc. (Vienna, VA). The relative luciferase activity was calculated and normalized based on the pG5-luciferase basal control. For assessment of transfection efficiency and protein amount, the luciferase assay, Renilla luciferase activity assay, or Lowry protein assay was used. UVB Irradiation and Chemical Treatment—The JB6 Cl41 overexpressing cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and cultured in 5% FBS/MEM until they reached 70% confluence and then starved in serum-deprived MEM for 36 h. The cells were then incubated for 2 h in fresh serum-deprived MEM, after which time they were exposed to 4 kJ/m2 UVB and then cultured for an additional 30 min. Because the normal UVB lamp also generates a small amount of UVC light, the UVB irradiation was carried out in a UVB exposure chamber fitted with a Kodak Kodacel K6808 filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm. For the M2H assay, pBIND kinases and pACT-H3 plasmids were transiently co-transfected in Swiss 3T3 cells. After starvation in serum-deprived DMEM for 24 h, the cells were exposed to 4 kJ/m2 UVB and then cultured for 12 h more. The cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml EGF in culture medium at 37 °C for 30 min or 12 h for the in vivo kinase assay or for the M2H assay, respectively. Isolation of Histone Proteins—Approximately 2 × 107 to 5 × 107 cells were homogenized in 1 ml of nuclear preparation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.65% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate). The nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.3 ml of resuspension buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein phosphatase inhibitors). The nuclei were extracted with 0.4 n H2SO4 to isolate total histones. The samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then resuspended in double distilled H2O. Immunoblotting—The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked and then hybridized with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The protein bands were visualized by a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) after hybridization with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody from rabbit or mouse. Immunofluorescence Assay—For translocation of exogenous MLTK-α, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and pHisG-MLTK-α was detected with a monoclonal anti-HisG antibody and a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The cells were incubated for 24 h, were starved in serum-free medium for an additional 24 h, and then were or were not irradiated with 4kJ/m2 UVB or 10 ng/ml EGF. The samples were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope system (Leica) and Image-Pro software program (Silver Spring). In Vitro Binding Assay—Protein MLTK-α labeled with [35S]methionine was produced by the TnT Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) using a pHisG-MLTK-α expression vector following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. The 35S-labeled MLTK-α protein was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Xpress antibody and protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratory, San Francisco, CA) combined with 4 μg of pure histone H3 protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and then incubated 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture). Following SDS-PAGE and gel drying, the bands were visualized by autoradiography (Kodak, New Haven, CT). Phosphorylation Assay of Histone H3 in Vitro—Phosphorylation of histone H3 by MLTK-α in vitro was carried out as described previously (14.Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23.Huang C. Ma W.Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In brief, the HisG-MLTK-α protein was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected 293T cells or from the TnT Quick-coupled transcription/translation system, combined with 4 μg of bacterially expressed histone H3 in 50 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, 1 mm NaF, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 1 h at 30 °C. The samples were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and dried. The [γ-32P]ATP-labeled histone H3 was visualized by autoradiography or by using a phospho-specific antibody against histone H3 (Ser10 or Ser28). Histone H3 Interacts with MLTK-α—Recently, interest has increased in identifying the kinases that modulate chromatin through their mediation of the phosphorylation of histone H3. To identify kinases that interact with histone H3, we used a M2H assay system. In this system, histone H3 was cloned into the pACT expression vector, and individual candidate human protein kinases were cloned into the pBIND expression vector in combination with the pG5 luciferase reporter gene. An interaction between histone H3 and kinases brings together the Gal4-binding domain (from pBIND) and the VP16 transactivation domain (from pACT) of the fusion proteins and activates the luciferase reporter gene in Swiss 3T3 cells. We used the known interaction between histone H3 and DYRK3 as a positive control (pACT-H3/pBIND-DYRK3). DYRK3 is a dual specificity protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation on serine/threonine and tyrosine residues and can phosphorylate histone H3 and H2B on serine and threonine residues (24.Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). From the results of this assay in which several interesting interactions were found, we confirmed that MLTK-α interacted with histone H3 (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1A shows that more than a 40-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed in MLTK-α and histone H3 co-transfected cells (pACT-H3/pBIND-MLTK-α) compared with only pACT-H3 transfected cells. We next examined the in vitro interaction between MLTK-α and purified histone H3. First, the cDNA coding sequence of MLTK-α or DYRK3 was subcloned into the pcDNA4His/MaxA vector to generate pHisG-MLTK-α or -DYRK3, and the fusion protein was in vitro translated using the TnT Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Histone H3 immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads was incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled MLTK-α or DYRK3. The bound protein eluted from the beads was separated by SDS-PAGE and then detected by autoradiography. Fig. 1B shows that MLTK-α or DYRK3 efficiently interacted with histone H3 in the in vitro binding assays. Input represents 5% of material used for the in vitro binding assays. MLTK-α Phosphorylates Histone H3 at Ser28 in Vitro—To continue to determine whether histone H3 is a substrate of MLTK-α, we next performed an in vitro kinase assay with histone H3 using MLTK-α-overexpressing 293T cells transfected with the pHisG-MLTK-α. Overexpression of MLTK-α was detected in pHisG-MLTK-α stably transfected cells using an anti-HisG antibody (Fig. 2A). Expression was not detectable in wild type 293T cells or empty (“mock”) vector stably transfected cells. MLTK-α was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Xpress antibody against pHisG-MLTK-α. MLTK-α kinase activity with histone H3 as a substrate was measured at 30 °C at the indicated time points (Fig. 2B). We confirmed that MLTK-α immunoprecipitated from MLTK-α-overexpressing 293T cells significantly phosphorylates histone H3 in a time-dependent manner reaching a peak activity at 60 min (Fig. 2B). We next explored whether MLTK-α-phosphorylation of histone H3 occurred at Ser10 or Ser28. Interestingly, MLTK-α phosphorylated histone H3 only at Ser28 but not at Ser10 (Fig. 2C, second and third panel). To confirm that MLTK-α specifically phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser28, but not Ser10, we replaced Ser10 of histone H3 with alanine (S10A) and Ser28 with alanine (S28A) and then subcloned these constructs into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Fig. 2D, upper panels). The mutation of histone H3 (Ser28) completely blocked the ability of MLTK-α to phosphorylate H3 compared with wild type H3, whereas the mutation of histone H3 (Ser10) had no effect (Fig. 2D, bottom panels), confirming that Ser28 of histone H3 is the specific MLTK-α phosphorylation site. MLTK-α, but Not MLTK-β, Phosphorylates Histone H3 (Ser28) in Vitro—MLTK-α and MLTK-β were identified by 5′- and 3′-RACE analyses, which showed at least two mRNA variants with different 3′-sequences (25.Gotoh I. Adachi M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4276-4286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). cDNA cloning of the two variants and open reading frame prediction revealed that the two proteins have identical amino acid sequences in the NH2-terminal region (residues 1–311), which contains a kinase domain and a leucine zipper motif. The COOH-terminal region of MLTK-α has a sterile α-motif domain that has been shown to be involved in protein-protein interactions and dimer formation of several signaling molecules and transcription regulators (26.Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We expressed HA-tagged MLTK-α (pHA-MLTK-α) and -MLTK-β (pHA-MLTK-β), or the kinase negative mutants of MLTKs, made by replacing Lys45 with Met (pHA-MLTK-α-KM and -MLTK-β-KM) in Swiss 3T3 cells. We then determined whether either or both of the MLTKs phosphorylated histone H3 in vitro and whether the kinase-negative mutants of the MLTKs blocked the phosphorylation of histone H3 in vitro. After immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody, we analyzed MLTKs kinase activity for the phosphorylation of histone H3 in vitro. Very little phosphorylation of histone H3 was detected in MLTK-α-KM, MLTK-β, or MLTKβ-KM in vitro (Fig. 3, first panel), although a clear phosphorylation of histone H3 was seen in wild type MLTK-α in vitro. Also, the phosphorylation of histone H3 by MLTK-α, but not MLTK-α-KM, MLTK-β, and MLTK-β-TM, was detected with an anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser28) antibody (Fig. 4B, second panel). Taken together, these results suggest that MLTK-α, but not MLTK-β, can phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser28, and the serine/threonine kinase domain of MLTK-α plays an important role in the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28.Fig. 4Ser28 phosphorylation of histone H3 occurs in MLTK-α-overexpressing 293T cells but is attenuated in MLTK-α knockdown JB6 Cl41 cells. A, MLTK-α-overexpressing 293T cells were starved for 36 h in serum-deprived DMEM. Ser28 phosphorylation of histone H3 in MLTK-α-overexpressing 293T cells was detected by blotting with an anti-phospho-H3 (Ser28) antibody. Mock denotes a pcDNA4his/MaxA transfected control cell line. Overexpression of MLTK-α was detected in stably transfected 293T cells using an anti-HisG antibody. For visualizing equal loading of protein, total histone H3 was detected by immunoblotting (IB). B, for the gene knock-down experiment, the si-MLTK-α expression vector was constructed using the pmU6pro vector with si-MLTK-α synthetic oligomers. The pmU6pro vector containing siRNA against MLTK-α was transfected into MLTK-α-overexpressing JB6 Cl41 cells, and stable cell lines were established by selection with geneticin (800 μg/ml). Knock-down of MLTK-α in stably transfected pHisG-MLTK-α/si-MLTK-α JB6 Cl41 cells was verified by immunoblotting using an anti-HisG antibody and compared with mock (pcDNA4/hisMaxA) or MLTK-α-overexpressing JB6 Cl41 cells. The cells were cultured and then starved for 36 h and harvested. Alterations of phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28 in mock, pHisG-MLTK-α, or pHisG-MLTK-α/si-MLTK-α cells were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-phospho-H3 (Ser28) antibody. For visualizing equal loading of protein, total histone H3 or β-actin was detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MLTK-α Plays an Important Role in the Phosphorylation of Histone H3 at Ser28 in Vivo—To study whether MLTK-α regulates the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28 in vivo, we examined changes in endogenous histone H3 phosphorylation in 36-h serum-starved 293T cells, which stably express the pHisG-MLTK-α. The results demonstrated that overexpression of MLTK-α in 293T cells was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28 with serum deprivation (Fig. 4A). We next examined whether the knock-down of the MLTK-α gene by the direct introduction of siRNA against MLTK-α into MLTK-α-overexpressing JB6 Cl41 cells would decrease the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28 under the 36-h serum starvation conditions. Previously, we developed and confirmed that mRNA and protein levels of MLTK-α were significantly decreased by introducing siRNA MLTK-α into MLTK-α-overexpressing JB6 Cl41 cells (pHisG-MLTK-α/si-MLTK-α) (Fig. 4B, third panel) (22.Cho Y.Y. Bode A.M. Mizuno H. Choi B.Y. Choi H.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The results showed that phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28 in pHisG-MLTK-α/si-MLTK-α JB6 Cl41 cells was significantly blocked compared with MLTK-α-overexpressing JB6 Cl41 cells (pHisG-MLTK-α) or even “mock” JB6 Cl41 cells (Fig. 4B, first panel). This finding further confirms that MLTK-α plays an essential role in the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser28 in vivo. The Accumulation of HisG-MLTK-α in the Nucleus Was Induced by UVB or EGF Stimulation—MLTK-α contains two putative nuclear export signal-like sequences in the NH2 and COOH termini. MLTK-α is mainly localized in the cytosol and is known to accumulate in the nucleus when cells are treated with leptomycin, an inhibitor of the nuclear export signal receptor, EGF, or TPA (22.Cho Y.Y. Bode A.M. Mizuno H."
