https://openalex.org/W2085712847,"Micropipette recording with juxtacellular Neurobiotin ejection, linked micropipette-microwire recording, and antidromic and orthodromic activation from the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus were used to identify hypocretin (Hcrt) cells in anesthetized rats and develop criteria for identification of these cells in unanesthetized, unrestrained animals. We found that Hcrt cells have broad action potentials with elongated later positive deflections that distinguish them from adjacent antidromically identified cells. They are relatively inactive in quiet waking but are transiently activated during sensory stimulation. Hcrt cells are silent in slow wave sleep and tonic periods of REM sleep, with occasional burst discharge in phasic REM. Hcrt cells discharge in active waking and have moderate and approximately equal levels of activity during grooming and eating and maximal activity during exploratory behavior. Our findings suggest that these cells are activated during emotional and sensorimotor conditions similar to those that trigger cataplexy in narcoleptic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2106852912,"Progressive kidney failure is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of disorders. Podocyte foot processes and the interposed glomerular slit diaphragm are essential components of the permeability barrier in the kidney. Mutations in genes encoding structural proteins of the podocyte lead to the development of proteinuria, resulting in progressive kidney failure and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Here, we show that the canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) ion channel is expressed in podocytes and is a component of the glomerular slit diaphragm. We identified five families with autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in which disease segregated with mutations in the gene TRPC6 on chromosome 11q. Two of the TRPC6 mutants had increased current amplitudes. These data show that TRPC6 channel activity at the slit diaphragm is essential for proper regulation of podocyte structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W2085966326,"Increased epithelial permeability is observed in inflammatory states. However, the mechanism by which inflammatory mediators such as IFN-gamma increase epithelial permeability is unknown. We recently observed that IFN-gamma induces disassembly of tight junctions (TJ); in this study we asked whether such TJ disassembly is mediated by endocytosis of junctional proteins. The role of three major internalization pathways in disruption of TJ in IFN-gamma-treated intestinal epithelial cells was analyzed using selective inhibitors and markers of the pathways. No role for the clathrin- and caveolar-mediated endocytosis in the IFN-gamma-induced internalization of TJ proteins was observed. However, inhibitors of macropinocytosis blocked internalization of TJ proteins and junctional proteins colocalized with macropinocytosis markers, dextran and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate. Internalized TJ proteins were identified in early and recycling endosomes but not in late endosomes/lysosomes. These results for the first time suggest that IFN-gamma produces a leaky epithelial barrier by inducing macropinoytosis of TJ proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2067267086,"There are currently no noninvasive imaging methods available for auditory brain mapping in mice, despite the increasing use of genetically engineered mice to study auditory brain development and hearing loss. We developed a manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) method to map regions of accumulated sound-evoked activity in awake, normally behaving mice. To demonstrate its utility for high-resolution (100-microm) brain mapping, we used MEMRI to show the tonotopic organization of the mouse inferior colliculus. To test its efficacy in an experimental setting, we acquired data from mice experiencing unilateral conductive hearing loss at different ages. Larger and persistent changes in auditory brainstem activity resulted when hearing loss occurred before the onset of hearing, showing that early hearing loss biases the response toward the functional ear. Thus, MEMRI provides a sensitive and effective method for mapping the mouse auditory brainstem and has great potential for a range of functional neuroimaging studies in normal and mutant mice."

https://openalex.org/W1970495618,"We recently reported that cultivation of oat (Avena sativa L.) without phosphate resulted in plasma membrane phosphoglycerolipids being replaced to a large extent by digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) (Andersson, M. X., Stridh, M. H., Larsson, K. E., Liljenberg, C., and Sandelius, A. S. (2003) FEBS Lett. 537, 128–132). We report here that DGDG is not the only non-phosphorous-containing lipid that replaces phospholipids but that also the content of glucosylceramides and sterolglycosides increased in plasma membranes as a response to phosphate starvation. In addition, phosphate deficiency induced similar changes in lipid composition in the tonoplast. The phospholipid-to-glycolipid replacement apparently did not occur to any greater extent in endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, or mitochondrial inner membranes. In contrast to the marked effects on lipid composition, the polypeptide patterns were largely similar between root plasma membranes from well-fertilized and phosphate-limited oat, although the latter condition induced at least four polypeptides, including a chaperone of the HSP80 or HSP90 family, a phosphate transporter, and a bacterial-type phosphoesterase. The latter polypeptide reacted with an antibody raised against a phosphate deficiency-induced phospholipase C from Arabidopsis thaliana (Nakamura, Y., Awai, K., Masuda, T., Yoshioka, Y., Takamiya, K., and Ohta, H. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 7469–7476). In plasma membranes from oat, however, a phospholipase D-type activity and a phosphatidic acid phosphatase were the dominant lipase activities induced by phosphate deficiency. Our results reflect a highly developed plasticity in the lipid composition of the plasma membrane and the tonoplast. In addition, phosphate deficiency-induced alterations in plasma membrane lipid composition may involve different sets of lipid-metabolizing enzymes in different plant tissues or species, at different stages of plant development and/or at different stages of stress adjustments.

Phosphate is often a limiting plant nutrient, and the effects of a limited supply have been extensively characterized on several levels, such as growth, root architecture, and metabolism of water-soluble phosphate-containing metabolites (1Raghothama K.G.

New Phytol. 2003; 157: 423-447Crossref Scopus (1834) Google Scholar). For bacteria, it is well established that membrane phospholipids can function as a phosphate reserve and be replaced by glycolipids during phosphate starvation (3Minnikin D.E. Abdolrahimzadeh H.

When cultivated under phosphate-limited conditions, the decrease in tissue phospholipids was compensated for by an increase in the glycolipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), 1The abbreviations used are: DGDG, digalactosyldiacylglycerol; 16:0, hexadecanoic acid; 18:2, all-cis-9,12-octadecadienoic acid; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; NPC4, Arabidopsis thaliana non-specific phospholipase C; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; SG, sterol glucoside; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; DAG, diacylglycerol; LC-FTISR; liquid chromatography Fourier transform ion spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: DGDG, digalactosyldiacylglycerol; 16:0, hexadecanoic acid; 18:2, all-cis-9,12-octadecadienoic acid; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; NPC4, Arabidopsis thaliana non-specific phospholipase C; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; SG, sterol glucoside; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; DAG, diacylglycerol; LC-FTISR; liquid chromatography Fourier transform ion spectrometry. as reported for Arabidopsis thaliana (6Hartel H.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and Acer platanus suspension cells (10Jouhet J. Maréchal E. Bligny R. Joyard J. Block M.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The only non-plastid membrane of very high fraction purity that has been repeatedly reported to contain galactolipids, especially DGDG, is the plasma membrane. Except for a few reports (11Liljenberg C. Kates M. Can. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 63: 77-84Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Rochester C.P. Kjellbom P. Larsson C. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 71: 257-263Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Norberg P. Liljenberg C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the content of 1–5 mol% DGDG has been ascribed to plastid contamination. We recently established that DGDG indeed is a plasma membrane constituent because it was the dominant acyl lipid of plasma membranes isolated from shoots and roots of oat that had been cultivated for 4 weeks in a phosphate-free medium (9Andersson M.X. Stridh M.H. Larsson K.E. Liljenberg C. Sandelius A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our aim with the present study was to characterize in more detail the alterations in plasma membrane composition that occurred as a result of phosphate limitation and to establish whether the lipid replacement in extra-plastidial membranes also occurred in other membranes. Materials—Polyethylene glycol 3350 (Ultra) and lipid standards were from Sigma. TLC plates, organic solvents, inorganic salts, and other chemicals were from Merck. Radiolabeled phosphatidic acid (PA) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Other radiochemicals and Dextran T500 were from Amersham Biosciences. Plant Material—Grains of oat (A. sativa L. cv. Vital) were soaked in deionized water overnight and sown on and covered with vermiculite. The plants were grown in a full nutrient solution (13Norberg P. Liljenberg C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or in a nutrient solution in which KH2PO4 was replaced with KCl, in a climate chamber with a 16-h light/8-h dark period. The temperature was 20 °C/17 °C and the relative humidity was 70%/80% during the light/dark periods. Isolation of a Microsomal Membrane Fraction—Oat roots, 35–40 g, were homogenized with a kitchen blender equipped with replaceable razor blades in 2 ml·g–1 of 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.40 m sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 3.0 mm EGTA, 3.0 mm NaEDTA, 10 mm ascorbic acid, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 2.0 mm dithiothreitol. The homogenate was filtered through one layer of Miracloth™ (Chicopee Mills), and the filtrate was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 × gmax (fixed angle rotor). The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 60,000 × gmax (fixed angle rotor). The pellet was suspended in 5.0 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.8, 2.0 mm KCl, and 0.25 m sucrose. Isolation of Oat Root Plasma Membrane—Plasma membranes were isolated from oat root microsomal membranes by aqueous polymer two-phase partitioning. To obtain plasma membrane fractions of very high and essentially equal fraction purity, higher polymer concentrations were required for the oat membranes from phosphate-limited plants than for the membranes from fully fertilized plants. Thus, the 20.00-g two-phase systems used for microsomal membranes from 30–40 g of oat root tissue contained 6.2% (w/w) each of Dextran T500 and polyethylene glycol 3350 for membranes from well-fertilized tissue but 6.6% (w/w) of each polymer for membranes from phosphate-limited material. The systems also contained 5.0 mmol·kg–1 potassium Pi, pH 7.8, 2.0 mmol·kg–1 KCl, and 0.25 mol·kg–1 sucrose. After a three-step two-phase partition (14Sandelius A.S. Morré D.J. Larsson C. Moller I.M. The Plant Plasma Membrane. Springer Verlag, Berlin1990: 44-75Crossref Google Scholar), the plasma membrane-rich upper phase was diluted with 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, and 10 mm KCl; pelleted twice at 100,000 × gmax for 30 min; and resuspended in the same buffer. Aliquots of the suspended membranes were used for immediate lipid extraction or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until further analysis. The difference in two-phase compositions, compared with the earlier work (9Andersson M.X. Stridh M.H. Larsson K.E. Liljenberg C. Sandelius A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), was due to different batches of polymers. The purified plasma membranes were essentially devoid of contaminating membranes (data not shown; cf. Figs. 2, 3, and 5 below).Fig. 3The polypeptide patterns of membrane fractions obtained from well-fertilized and phosphate-limited oat.

The polypeptide bands indicated to the left were cut out and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by nano-LC-FTISR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fractionation of Oat Root Membranes—The microsomes were also fractionated by aqueous polymer two-phase partition in a 10-step hand counter-current procedure (Fig. 1) (15Larsson C. Hall J.L. Moore A.L. Isolation of Membranes and Organelles from Plant Cells. Academic Press, London1983: 277-309Google Scholar, 16Sandelius A.S. Hellgren L.I. Quinn P.J. Harwood J.L. Plant Lipid Biochemistry, Structure and Utilisation. Portland Press Ltd., London1990: 257-259Google Scholar). The 10 systems each weighed 10.00 g and contained 5.0 mmol·kg–1 potassium Pi, pH 7.8, 0.25 mol·kg–1 sucrose, Dextran T500, and polyethylene glycol 3350. For microsomes isolated from control roots, the systems contained 6.2% (w/w) of each polymer, whereas for microsomes from roots of phosphate-limited oat, the systems contained 6.4% (w/w) of each polymer. The membrane sample was included in the first tube. After shaking and phase separation, the upper phase of the first tube was transferred to a fresh lower phase in tube 2, and fresh upper phase was added to the first tube. The procedure was repeated until upper phase had reached tube 10, and all tubes contained both upper and lower phase. All 10 complete two-phase systems were each diluted with 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, and 10 mm KCl and pelleted twice at 100,000 × gmax. Lipid Analyses—Membrane lipids were extracted (17Sommarin M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 268-278Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and fractionated on Si60 solid phase extraction columns (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Briefly, the lipid extract was applied to a 100-mg Si60 column conditioned with 2.0 ml of chloroform:acetone (9:1, by volume). Non-polar lipids were eluted with 4.0 ml of chloroform:acetone (9:1, by volume), glycolipids were eluted with 2.0 ml of acetone:methanol (9:1, by volume), and finally, phospholipids were eluted with 2.0 ml of methanol. The separate fractions were taken to dryness under N2. Polar lipids were dissolved in chloroform:methanol (2:1, by volume), and the nonpolar lipids were dissolved in chloroform. To separate and quantify polar lipids, straight phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Hewlett Packard series 1050) was used. The lipids were separated on a Lichrosorb Si60 125 × 4-mm column (Merck) with a binary gradient system (18Becart J. Chevalier C. Biesse J. J. High Res. Chrom. 1990; 13: 126-129Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The lipids were detected with a Sedere 45 evaporative light scattering detector (Sedex, Vitry, France) operated at 50 °C with filtered air at 0.22 megapascal as nebulizer gas. All lipid classes were identified and quantified using retention times and calibration curves obtained with authentic lipid standards chromatographed under identical conditions. To analyze free sterols and fatty acid methyl esters, a Hewlett Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector was used. The underivatized free sterols in the neutral lipid fraction were separated on a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; J&W Scientific) with N2 as carrier gas at a constant flow of 2 ml·min–1. The injector and detector were maintained at 300 °C. The oven temperature was increased from 160 °C to 300 °C at 10 °C·min–1 and maintained at 300 °C for 10 min. β-Cholestanol was used as internal standard. Fatty acid methyl esters were produced by base-catalyzed methylation in 0.5 m sodium methoxide in methanol (19Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis. Pergamon Press, Oxford1976Google Scholar). Diheptadecanoylphosphatidylcholine (PC) was used as internal standard. The fatty acid methyl esters were separated on a DB-23 capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm; J&W Scientific) using N2 at a constant flow of 2 ml·min–1 as carrier gas. The injector and detector were maintained at 230 °C throughout the analysis. The oven temperature was maintained at 150 °C for 2 min, increased to 170 °C at 50 °C·min–1, further increased to 210 °C at 2 °C·min–1, and maintained at 210 °C for 5 min. Protein Analysis—Membrane protein content was determined as described previously (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar), except that the samples were pre-incubated in 0.10% (w/v) Triton X-100 prior to the addition of the reagent. Prior to SDS-PAGE, membrane fractions were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 50 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at 60 °C. Polypeptides were separated on 10% (w/v) Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE precast 15 × 15-cm gels (Bio-Rad). After separation, the proteins were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue and after destaining, with Proteo Silver™ silver stain kit (Sigma). Specific bands (see Figs. 3 and 5) were excised from the gels and sent for identification by MALDI-TOF or nano-LC-FTISR spectroscopy (Swegene Proteomics Center, Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden). Each gel piece was washed three times with acetonitrile:aqueous 25 mm NH4HCO3 (1:1, by volume) and once with methanol:aqueous 25 mm NH4HCO3 (1:1, by volume) and vacuum-dried. The dry gel piece was incubated in 10 μg·ml–1 trypsin while shaking at 37 °C. The tryptic digest was eluted from the gel piece with acetonitrile:aqueous 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (75:25, by volume). 0.5 μl of this peptide solution was mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix solution (12 mg·ml–1 α-cyano-4-OH-cinnamic acid in acetonitrile:water; 1:1, by volume) directly on the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization probe and allowed to dry at ambient conditions. Samples were analyzed using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-LR mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in reflectron mode. ACTH (18–39) MH+ 2465.199 was used as external lock mass, and tryptic autodigest MH+ 2211.105 was used as internal lock mass. Monoisotopic mass values were used for peptide mass mapping using MASCOT (www.matrixscience.com), against the nr data base at National Center for Biotechnology Information. All identifications had a score above 100, well above the limit of 74 for the 95% level of confidence. When necessary, samples were purified and concentrated with Zip-Tips containing C18 resin (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The peptides eluted in 3.5 μl of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile:water (1:1, by volume) analyzed by nano-LC-FTISR on a Thermo Finnigan LTQ-FT operated in data-dependent mode with pre-separation of the peptides on a C18 capillary column (21Olsen J.V. Ong S.E. Mann M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 608-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The tandem mass spectrometry data were used as input for protein identification by MASCOT (www.matrixscience.com). No restrictions in species, molecular weight, or pI were applied when searching against the non-redundant data base of National Center for Biotechnology Information. Proteins identified all had a score exceeding 80, whereas 43 represents the 95% confidence level. For Western blot analyses, membrane fractions containing 10 μg of protein were denatured as described above and separated on 10% bis-Tris Novex™ ready gels (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The polypeptides were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), using a xCel II Blot Module (Invitrogen). The membranes were probed with an antibody raised against the C-terminal 120 amino acids of a putative phospholipase C of A. thaliana (NPC4) (22Nakamura Y. Awai K. Masuda T. Yoshioka Y. Takamiya K. Ohta H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7469-7476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) followed by an antirabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody from donkey (Amersham Biosciences). The peroxidase activity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Phospholipase Assays—The assays were essentially as described previously (22Nakamura Y. Awai K. Masuda T. Yoshioka Y. Takamiya K. Ohta H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7469-7476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For each assay, 14 μg of unlabeled lipid and 12.5 nCi of radiolabeled lipid were dried under N2 and sonicated in 100 μl of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 0.25% (w/v) deoxycholate. The lipids used were soybean PC with 1–16:0, 2-[14C]18:2-PC (final specific activity, 0.70 mCi·mmol–1), soybean phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) with 1–16:0, 2-[14C]18:2-PE (final specific activity, 0.66 mCi·mmol–1), and egg PA with 1,2-[14C]16:0-PA (final specific activity, 0.57 mCi·mmol–1). Water, other additions, and membranes were added to a final volume of 200 μl. The assays were started by addition of membrane fractions, incubated with shaking at 37 °C, and stopped by addition of 750 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:2, by volume). The lipids were extracted by an acidic modification of the Bligh and Dyer procedure (17Sommarin M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 268-278Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). TLC separations and analysis of lipid radiolabel were as described previously (23Andersson M.X. Kjellberg J.M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1684: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the phospholipase assays, plasma membranes isolated from a new oat cultivar, Belinda, were used. We analyzed marker enzyme activities, lipid composition, and polypeptide pattern and found no differences between these plasma membranes and those obtained from the no longer available cultivar Vital with either fully fertilized or phosphate-deficient plants (data not shown). Phospholipase activities were also assayed in native gel-separated polypeptides. Root plasma membranes from phosphate-limited oat were solubilized (100 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 0.12% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 5% (v/v) glycerol), and non-soluble material was pelleted by centrifugation. The solubilized proteins were separated on a 4–12% bis-Tris Zoom gel (Invitrogen). The gel was sectioned into 2.5-mm slices, and these were homogenized in the solubilization buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatants were assayed for lipase activities. Other Assays—The following marker enzymes were assayed: cytochrome c oxidase for mitochondrial inner membrane and antimycin A- and KCN-insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase for endoplasmic reticulum (24Widell S. Larsson C. Larsson C. Moller I.M. The Plant Plasma Membrane. Springer Verlag, Berlin1990: 16-43Crossref Google Scholar), latent IDPase for Golgi membranes (essentially according to Ref. 25Sandelius A.S. Penel C. Auderset G. Brightman A. Millard M. Morré D.J. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 1,3-β-glucan synthase for plasma membrane (26Fredrikson K. Larsson C. Physiol. Plant. 1989; 77: 196-201Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) synthase for chloroplast envelope (27Kjellberg J.M. Trimborn M. Andersson M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To analyze the sugar composition of DGDG, the isolated lipid was hydrolyzed in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid, reduced with sodium borohydride, and peracetylated. The resulting alditol acetates were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography on a DB-17 column (28Holm M. Månsson J.-E. Vanier M.-T. Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The differences in lipid composition between different treatments were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using the SPSS statistics software package for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Effects of Phosphate Limitation on the Lipid Composition of Oat Root Plasma Membranes—The lipid composition of root plasma membranes isolated from 2- and 4-week-old oat grown with or without phosphate is shown in Table I. In 4-week-old well-fertilized oat, glycerolipids made up 49% of the root plasma membrane lipids, whereas this proportion decreased to 41% in the phosphate-limited oat. As in the previous investigation (9Andersson M.X. Stridh M.H. Larsson K.E. Liljenberg C. Sandelius A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), cultivation without phosphate caused a marked decrease in the proportion of phospholipids concomitant with an increase in DGDG in the plasma membrane. This alteration was observed already 2 weeks after cultivation. After 4 weeks of cultivation, there were also significant increases in the proportions of sterol glucosides (SGs) and glucocylceramides (GlcCers) in plasma membranes isolated from the roots of phosphate-limited oat, compared with well-fertilized oat. The proportions of acylated SGs and free sterols remained unaltered, although the composition of free sterols was altered. The proportion of the major sterol, stigmasterol, decreased, whereas that of β-sitosterol increased in the phosphate-limited material (Table II). The phospholipid compositions were essentially as previously reported (9Andersson M.X. Stridh M.H. Larsson K.E. Liljenberg C. Sandelius A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and after 4 weeks of cultivation, the decrease caused by phosphate starvation affected all phospholipid classes to approximately the same extent (data not shown). The proportions of MGDG and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol were each 0.5–2 mol% in all plasma membrane fractions.Table IThe lipid composition of plasma membranes isolated from the roots of 2- and 4-week-old oat grown with or without phosphateLipid classLipid composition2-week-old plants4-week-old plantsControlPhosphate-limitedControlPhosphate-limitedmol%mol%mol%mol%Phospholipids39.8 ± 2.032.4 ± 1.9ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference between root plasma membranes from control and phosphate limited oat of the same age.44.0 ± 2.812.9 ± 2.6bp < 0.01, statistically significant difference between root plasma membranes from control and phosphate limited oat of the same age.Free sterols19.6 ± 3.521.6 ± 0.119.9 ± 3.317.6 ± 1.5Acylated SG10.7 ± 3.714.6 ± 7.910.0 ± 0.310.2 ± 3.2SG11.7 ± 2.310.3 ± 0.811.8 ± 1.316.4 ± 0.6ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference between root plasma membranes from control and phosphate limited oat of the same age.GlcCer11.4 ± 3.911.2 ± 3.67.8 ± 0.313.5 ± 0.8ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference between root plasma membranes from control and phosphate limited oat of the same age.DGDG4.0 ± 0.77.8 ± 1.4ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference between root plasma membranes from control and phosphate limited oat of the same age.4.5 ± 0.125.0 ± 0.46bp < 0.01, statistically significant difference between root plasma membranes from control and phosphate limited oat of the same age.OthercMainly MGDG and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol.2.8 ± 0.82.0 ± 1.42.0 ± 1.34.4 ± 3.6a p < 0.05, statistically significant difference between root plasma membranes from control and phosphate limited oat of the same age.b p < 0.01, statistically significant difference between root plasma membranes from control and phosphate limited oat of the same age.c Mainly MGDG and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol.

https://openalex.org/W2105101090,"Identifying the neural basis of visibility is central to understanding conscious visual perception. Visibility of basic features such as brightness is often thought to reflect activity in just early visual cortex. But here we show under metacontrast masking that fMRI activity in stimulus-driven areas of early visual cortex did not reflect parametric changes in the visibility of a brightness stimulus. The psychometric visibility function was instead correlated with activity in later visual regions plus parieto-frontal areas, and surprisingly, in representations of the unstimulated stimulus surround for primary visual cortex. Critically, decreased stimulus visibility was associated with a regionally-specific decoupling between early visual cortex and higher visual areas. This provides evidence that dynamic changes in effective connectivity can closely reflect visual perception. Identifying the neural basis of visibility is central to understanding conscious visual perception. Visibility of basic features such as brightness is often thought to reflect activity in just early visual cortex. But here we show under metacontrast masking that fMRI activity in stimulus-driven areas of early visual cortex did not reflect parametric changes in the visibility of a brightness stimulus.

Critically, decreased stimulus visibility was associated with a regionally-specific decoupling between early visual cortex and higher visual areas. This provides evidence that dynamic changes in effective connectivity can closely reflect visual perception. Understanding the neural determinants of visibility is crucial to understanding how visual awareness arises. Neurons at early stages of cortical processing are tuned to basic visual features such as brightness and contrast. Visibility of these properties might thus reflect activity in early visual cortex alone. Perceived brightness and contrast can correlate with activity in early, retinotopic visual cortex (Rossi et al., 1996Rossi A.F. Rittenhouse C.D. Paradiso M.A. The representation of brightness in primary visual cortex.Science. 1996; 273: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Boynton et al., 1999Boynton G.M. Demb J.B.

Responses of human visual cortex to uniform surfaces.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4286-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, activity in these areas can sometimes reflect the perceptual properties of a stimulus rather than its physical properties (e.g., Ress and Heeger, 2003Ress D. Heeger D.J. Neuronal correlates of perception in early visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, Haynes et al., 2003Haynes J.D. Roth G. Stadler M. Heinze H.J. Neuromagnetic correlates of perceived contrast in primary visual cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 2655-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This has led to suggestions that activity in early visual cortex may be necessary and sufficient for awareness of basic visual features (see Tong, 2003Tong F. Primary visual cortex and visual awareness.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, and Rees et al., 2002Rees G. Kreiman G. Koch C. Neural correlates of consciousness in humans.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, for reviews). But such proposals have typically been based on studies that only measured activity in early visual cortex and did not examine higher areas nor any functional coupling between early visual cortex and higher areas. Others have proposed that while activity in early visual cortex may be necessary, it is not sufficient for awareness without additional contributions from higher areas (see Crick and Koch, 1995Crick F. Koch C. Are we aware of neural activity in primary visual cortex?.Nature. 1995; 375: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Later visual areas, plus parietal and prefrontal cortex, can show activity related to conscious detection of complex visual stimuli (e.g., faces or words; Lumer et al., 1998Lumer E.D. Friston K.J. Rees G. Neural correlates of perceptual rivalry in the human brain.Science. 1998; 280: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, Grill-Spector et al., 2000Grill-Spector K. Kushnir T.

Cerebral mechanisms of word masking and unconscious repetition priming.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), but their role for perception of low-level stimuli has been rarely addressed. Furthermore, the potential role of functional coupling between regions in mediating visibility has only rarely been studied (Lumer and Rees, 1999Lumer E.D. Rees G. Covariation of activity in visual and prefrontal cortex associated with subjective visual perception.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 1669-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated any role for coupling between early and higher visual areas in mediating visibility of low-level visual features, using a variant of the well-established perceptual phenomenon of metacontrast masking (reviewed in Breitmeyer and Ogmen, 2000Breitmeyer B.G. Ogmen H. Recent models and findings in visual backward masking: a comparison, review, and update.Percept. Psychophys. 2000; 62: 1572-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The visibility of a bright target stimulus can be substantially decreased if it is followed, after a brief delay, by a weak contour mask. The decrease in visibility depends critically on the exact timing between target and mask, with small changes in relative timing leading to large changes of visibility. Importantly, these visibility changes exhibit a characteristic U-shape when plotted as a function of stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA; Breitmeyer and Ogmen, 2000Breitmeyer B.G. Ogmen H. Recent models and findings in visual backward masking: a comparison, review, and update.Percept. Psychophys. 2000; 62: 1572-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Such a nonmonotonic relationship between SOA and visibility can provide a very useful signature when assessing which brain regions may mediate changes in visibility, as regions where responses exhibit a simple linear (or other monotonic) correlation with SOA will not be confused with visibility-related areas. Metacontrast masking thus allows the study of visibility as a parametric graded function of SOA. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test for neural responses in the human brain that followed the U-shaped psychophysical visibility function of each individual participant, and we examined in detail how activity changed in the retinotopic stimulus representations of early visual cortex. Importantly, we also examined whether the coupling between these cortical areas might reflect stimulus visibility, by measuring whether the strength of coupling, or effective connectivity (see Friston et al., 1997Friston K.J. Buechel C. Fink G.R. Morris J. Rolls E. Dolan R.J. Psychophysiological and modulatory interactions in neuroimaging.Neuroimage. 1997; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar), between lower and higher areas was correlated with participants’ visibility functions. Besides the characteristic U-shaped psychometric profile, metacontrast masking has several further advantages for the present study. First, a weak outline mask can be sufficient to produce highly effective masking of a strong brightness stimulus. Second, the masking can affect perception of low-level features such as brightness, often thought to be represented in early visual cortex (Rossi et al., 1996Rossi A.F. Rittenhouse C.D. Paradiso M.A. The representation of brightness in primary visual cortex.Science. 1996; 273: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Haynes et al., 2004Haynes J.D. Lotto R.B. Rees G. Responses of human visual cortex to uniform surfaces.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4286-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, metacontrast masking is traditionally thought to reflect processes within early visual cortex (Breitmeyer and Ogmen, 2000Breitmeyer B.G. Ogmen H. Recent models and findings in visual backward masking: a comparison, review, and update.Percept. Psychophys. 2000; 62: 1572-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, Macknik and Livingstone, 1998Macknik S.L. Livingstone M.S. Neuronal correlates of visibility and invisibility in the primate visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), but may also be influenced by top-down modulation (Ramachandran and Cobb, 1995Ramachandran V.S. Cobb S. Visual attention modulates metacontrast masking.Nature. 1995; 373: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, it may provide an ideal paradigm for studying any possible coupling between lower and higher visual areas in mediating visibility. To anticipate our findings, the psychometric visibility function was poorly correlated with activity in stimulus representations in retinotopic cortex; but strong correlations between activity and visibility were identified in higher visual areas V5/MT and the fusiform gyrus, in parietofrontal cortex, and surprisingly, also in representations of the unstimulated surround for primary visual cortex. Importantly, decreased stimulus visibility was reliably associated with a retinotopically and regionally specific decoupling between primary visual cortex and a focal region of fusiform cortex, as confirmed by several different analysis approaches. Participants maintained fixation on a central fixation mark while on each trial four composite target stimuli were presented briefly and simultaneously, one in each visual quadrant, followed after a brief delay (SOA) by four composite outline masks (Figure 1A ). This quadrantic stimulus geometry allowed us to distinguish the activation produced by individual stimuli in retinotopic visual areas. The targets were bright white “honeycomb” patterns presented on a dark background, while the masks consisted of thin lines tracing the outer contours of these targets (see Figure 1B and Experimental Procedures for the advantages of using these honeycomb stimuli). A small central line instructed subjects to covertly attend to the two target stimuli in one diagonal pair of quadrants. In this way, we could also examine how attention might affect visual activations (cf. Ramachandran and Cobb, 1995Ramachandran V.S. Cobb S. Visual attention modulates metacontrast masking.Nature. 1995; 373: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), though this will not be the main focus here. On each trial, one of the two stimuli on each diagonal (chosen randomly) had a slightly darker center (“target B” in Figure 1B) and participants had to indicate which one it was (for the attended diagonal) by using a button press with the right hand. This luminance discrimination served as an objective measure of visibility. As expected, subtle manipulations (jointly at all four locations) of the SOA between stimuli and subsequent masks produced the U-shaped visibility function that is characteristic of metacontrast masking (Figure 1C). There was a significant main effect of SOA on discrimination performance (F3,28 = 5.2; p = 0.006), and psychophysical discrimination during scanning was maximally impaired when the mask followed the target with a delay of 30–70 ms. In order to identify any brain regions where the level of activity in the different conditions reflected the parametric changes in visibility, we first computed the “similarity” between the individual participants’ psychometric visibility functions and their brain responses (as a function of SOA). The Pearson correlation between each individual participant’s psychometric and neurometric profiles provided the objective measure of similarity and was computed separately for each voxel (see Experimental Procedures, “whole-brain analysis”). This correlation was significant for only a small set of areas (Table 1). The fMRI signal from these areas, averaged across subjects, is plotted as a function of target-mask SOA in Figure 2A, confirming the similarity between these mean neurometric response profiles and the mean psychometric measure of stimulus visibility (cf. Figure 1C). The corresponding correlation coefficients are plotted in Figure 2C (“max. similarity”). The regions with significant psychometric-neurometric correlation were as follows: one region of retinotopic cortex, in the calcarine sulcus (CS); two areas of higher visual cortex (the fusiform gyrus and V5/MT+); plus four other areas including parietal and prefrontal cortex. Thus, only one region of early, retinotopic visual cortex, the CS, showed an activation pattern that reflected visibility during metacontrast masking. This is noteworthy given that such masking profoundly affects brightness perception (see Figure 1C), which is often assumed to reflect activity in early visual cortex (Rossi et al., 1996Rossi A.F. Rittenhouse C.D. Paradiso M.A. The representation of brightness in primary visual cortex.Science. 1996; 273: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Haynes et al., 2004Haynes J.D. Lotto R.B. Rees G. Responses of human visual cortex to uniform surfaces.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4286-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On the other hand, beyond retinotopic cortex there were several brain areas, including parietal and prefrontal cortex, that showed fMRI response profiles closely reflecting the U-shaped visibility profile.Table 1Brain Areas with Significant Correlation to PsychophysicsXYZZ Score15−87154.50Calcarine sulcus (CS)48−45−214.02Fusiform gyrus (FG)−45−66154.54V5/MT+ (MT)54−63154.02V5/MT+ (MT)−54−48273.83Temporoparietal junction (TPJ)−9−63334.44Precuneus (PC)3−6094.02Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)−4848−63.83Middle frontal gyrus (MFG)−5145−34.02Middle frontal gyrus (MFG)3015454.02Middle frontal gyrus (MFG)Brain areas with a similarity measure (explained in Experimental Procedures) significantly larger than 0 (one sample t test, df = 7; pcorr < 0.05).

Open table in a new tab Brain areas with a similarity measure (explained in Experimental Procedures) significantly larger than 0 (one sample t test, df = 7; pcorr < 0.05). X, Y, and Z are MNI standard coordinates (mm). These areas subsequently served as regions of interest for the analyses of functional coupling. The initial whole-brain fMRI analyses described above were performed after normalization of individual anatomy to standard space. However, stereotactic positions of early visual areas can be highly variable between subjects (Amunts et al., 2000Amunts K. Malikovic A. Mohlberg H. Schormann T. Zilles K. Brodmann’s areas 17 and 18 brought into stereotaxic space-where and how variable?.Neuroimage. 2000; 11: 66-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). To examine early visual cortex more closely, we therefore undertook a more detailed analysis, identifying distinct retinotopic visual areas (V1, V2, V3, V3A, V4) within each individual using retinotopic mapping (cf. Wandell, 1999Wandell B.A. Computational neuroimaging of human visual cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 145-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar; for details see Experimental Procedures). Due to the quadrantic specificity of retinotopic cortex, this also allowed us to distinguish brain activity related to the two currently attended versus two unattended stimuli. We found strong and reliable activation by the honeycomb stimulus in V1 through V4 that was also strongly modulated by attention (Figure 2B). But critically there was no U-shaped modulation reflecting visibility for these activations, not even in V1 (see the predominantly flat or monotonic SOA functions in Figure 2B, with the slight dip for V4 not being reliable). This was also reflected in the lack of correlation between psychometric and neurometric profiles. The striking quadrantic specificity of the attention effects is also revealed by plotting the main effects of attention averaged across subjects on a standard brain template (see Figure S5 in the Supplemental Data available online). The preceding retinotopic analysis raises an apparent paradox: stimulus-driven voxels in V1 showed no visibility-related profile in the retinotopic analysis (Figure 2B), yet a small region of visual cortex in the calcarine sulcus had shown such a U-shaped activity profile that correlated with visibility in the initial whole-brain analyses (top left of Figure 2A). These two findings can only be reconciled if they reflect activity from different sectors of primary visual cortex (note that the retinotopic analyses had been performed for stimulus-driven voxels in each visual area, whereas the whole-brain analysis was unrestricted). We inspected activation patterns for these different analyses on a computationally flattened representation of primary visual cortex for each participant (Teo et al., 1997Teo P.C. Sapiro G. Wandell B.A. Creating connected representations of cortical gray matter for functional MRI visualization.IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging. 1997; 16: 852-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Wandell et al., 2000Wandell B.A. Chial S. Backus B. Visualisation and measurement of the cortical surface.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this revealed that sectors showing visibility-associated (i.e., U-shaped) profiles of activity in the calcarine sulcus were spatially distinct from the sectors of V1 directly responding to the stimulus, both in the group analysis of retinotopic cortex (Figure 3) and in individual participants (Figure S4). The cortical representation corresponding to the retinotopic location of the metacontrast stimuli responded strongly in a stimulus-driven manner (solid line in Figure 3B, see also Figure 3C), but critically showed no modulation by mask SOA (Figure 3E). Visibility-associated activity (i.e., with a U-shaped SOA profile, Figure 3F) was instead confined to those regions of primary visual cortex representing the visual field immediately surrounding the metacontrast stimuli (dashed line in Figure 3B, see also Figure 3D). Center and surround also differed in other functional profiles. In addition to being strongly stimulus-driven, the “center” sector (red arrow in Figure 3B) showed strong modulation by attention (Figure 3E), whereas the “surround” (green arrow in Figure 3B) showed weak attention effects (Figure 3F). Other retinotopic areas beyond V1 showed no evidence for this center-surround organization (see Table S1). The preceding analyses revealed a restricted set of cortical areas, both within visual cortex and beyond, whose responses correlated either with the psychometric visibility function or instead were strongly stimulus driven regardless of SOA. The finding that responses in several distinct areas may relate to visibility is intriguing. However, joint activation of areas is not sufficient to demonstrate any functional relationship between them. In order to gain insight into any functional relationship among this visibility-associated network, we next undertook an analysis of effective connectivity between these cortical areas. Changes in effective connectivity between two brain regions can be studied by examining changes in covariation between their activities under different experimental conditions (Friston et al., 1997Friston K.J. Buechel C. Fink G.R. Morris J. Rolls E. Dolan R.J. Psychophysiological and modulatory interactions in neuroimaging.Neuroimage. 1997; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures). Such analyses are now well established not only for single neurons (e.g., Aertsen et al., 1989Aertsen A.M.H.J. Gerstein G.L. Habib M.K. Palm G. Dynamics of neural firing correlation: modulation of “effective connectivity”.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 900-917PubMed Google Scholar), but also for macroscopic signals from neuronal populations such as those recorded by EEG, MEG, and fMRI (Gross et al., 2001Gross J. Kujala J. Hamalainen M. Timmermann L. Schnitzler A. Salmelin R. Dynamic imaging of coherent sources: Studying neural interactions in the human brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Rowe J.B. Ritzl A. Zilles K. Fink G.R. Lateralized cognitive processes and lateralized task control in the human brain.Science. 2003; 301: 384-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The strength of effective connectivity reflects the degree to which activity evoked in a neuronal population in one cortical area can be predicted by activity in another area, independently from changes in correlation merely due to stimulus-locked transients evoked by sensory stimulation (Friston et al., 1997Friston K.J. Buechel C. Fink G.R. Morris J. Rolls E. Dolan R.J. Psychophysiological and modulatory interactions in neuroimaging.Neuroimage. 1997; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Independence of overall activity within single areas versus coupling between areas is an important feature shared by all effective connectivity analyses (e.g., Friston et al., 1997Friston K.J. Buechel C. Fink G.R. Morris J. Rolls E. Dolan R.J. Psychophysiological and modulatory interactions in neuroimaging.Neuroimage. 1997; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar, Gross et al., 2001Gross J. Kujala J. Hamalainen M.

Dynamics of neural firing correlation: modulation of “effective connectivity”.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 900-917PubMed Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures). By estimating effective connectivity between areas in this way, we could characterize how it may change under different psychophysical contexts (in this case, the visibility of the stimulus as determined by the SOA). To investigate whether psychophysical measures of visibility are reflected in the pattern of effective connectivity, we computed the correlation between all possible pair-wise combinations of areas that had shown visibility-associated responses (Table 1 and Figure 2A), plus all of the retinotopically mapped visual areas (including the stimulated and unstimulated sectors for V1), for each masking SOA. This broad initial selection of areas was undertaken deliberately in order not to be unduly restrictive (but as will be seen, the results were in fact highly selective). In order to avoid artifactual changes in correlation caused by a direct “driving” effect of the stimulus conditions, estimation of connectivity was performed using only the residuals after estimation and removal of the stimulus-driven effects (e.g., see Macaluso et al., 2000Macaluso E. Frith C.D. Driver J. Modulation of human visual cortex by crossmodal spatial attention.Science. 2000; 289: 1206-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). We then identified those pairs of areas where the profile of changes in correlation (rather than the level of activity, as in the analyses presented earlier) reflected the shape of individual participants’ psychometric functions (see Experimental Procedures and legend of Figure 4 for further details of this analysis). In accord with hypotheses that visibility may relate to functional coupling between early and higher visual cortex (e.g., Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000Lamme V.A. Roelfsema P.R.

The similarity between these changes in correlation between areas and the psychophysical visibility function was significant for the coupling between V1 and fusiform gyrus, for both the stimulus-driven and the unstimulated surround sectors of V1 (asterisks in Figure 4C). Accordingly, these changes in correlation exhibited a U-shaped profile that reflected corresponding changes in visibility with SOA (Figure 4D). Such a relationship was observed both in this group analysis (Figure 4D) and in seven of the eight individual subjects (Figure S2). To ensure that the visibility-related changes in correlation between V1 and FG indeed reflected changes in effective connectivity, we ruled out several alternate explanations. It is important to emphasize that visibility-related changes in correlation between areas did not simply reflect similar response profiles in each area. For example, the stimulus-driven regions of V1 and responses in FG showed very different activation profiles (see Figure 2), yet still showed a consistent change in their pattern of coupling that closely reflected visibility (Figure 4D). Moreover, the changes in correlation between pairs of areas were not related to a specific combination of main effects (e.g., one area showing a flat profile and one a U-shaped profile), because no other pair of areas with such overall activation profiles (e.g., other retinotopic areas, parietal and frontal regions) exhibited the same U-shaped profile of changes in coupling. Nor did this coupling result merely reflect anatomical proximity, as it was neither found between the stimulus and surround sectors of V1 themselves, nor among subsequent retinotopic visual areas (see Table S1). The result was also not caused by an increase in overall variability in the low-visibility conditions (e.g., due to any common top-down source of variability that might reflect the difficulty of detecting low versus high visibility stimuli, see Ress et al., 2000Ress D. Backus B.T. Heeger D.J. Activity in primary visual cortex predicts performance in a visual detection task.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), since the overall level of variability itself in the fMRI signal was equivalent in V1 and FG in low- and high-visibility conditions (see Table S2). The coupling result was also unchanged when correct and incorrect responses were modeled as separate events to remove any variance due to differences between hit and miss responses (see Figure 4, caption). This means that potential differences between hits and misses in within-area response amplitudes are not the cause of our observed changes in coupling. Finally, we confirmed that the regional specificity of the changes in connectivity we observed (i.e., between V1 and FG) had not arisen due to any bias in our preselection of cortical areas from our whole-brain and retinotopic analyses (which had been based on those areas identified in the earlier retinotopic and whole-brain analyses). An additional unconstrained whole-brain connectivity analysis revealed that the only areas throughout the brain to show significant (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) visibility-associated coupling with primary visual cortex as a function of SOA were bilateral fusiform gyri (see Figure S1). Furthermore, the profile of changes in connectivity was not particular to the specific details of the analysis procedure employed, as a further analysis using a different method (Friston et al., 2003Friston K.J. Harrison L. Penny W. Dynamic causal modeling.Neuroimage. 2003; 9: 1273-1302Crossref Scopus (2902) Google Scholar) for estimating effective connectivity resulted in the same findings of a U-shaped coupling profile (Figure S3). Taken together, these complementary analyses of effective connectivity using different analytic approaches all converge to show that our finding of a highly"

Here we present data indicating that the demosponge Suberites domuncula is provided with a recognition system for Gram-negative bacteria. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-interacting protein was identified as a receptor on the sponge cell surface, which recognizes the bacterial endotoxin LPS. The cDNA was isolated, and the protein (Mr 49,937) was expressed. During binding to LPS, the protein dimerizes and interacts with MyD88, which was also identified and cloned. The sponge MyD88 (Mr 28,441) is composed of two protein interaction domains, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain (found in MyD88 and in Toll-like receptors) and a death domain (present in MyD88 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase). Northern blot experiments and in situ hybridization studies showed that after LPS treatment, the level of the LPS-interacting protein remains unchanged, whereas MyD88 is strongly up-regulated. A perforin-like molecule (Mr 74,171), the macrophage-expressed protein, was identified as an executing molecule of this pathway. This gene is highly expressed after LPS treatment, especially at the surfaces of the animals. The recombinant protein possesses biological activity and eliminates Gram-negative bacteria; it is inactive against Gram-positive bacteria. These data indicate that S. domuncula is provided with an innate immune system against Gram-negative bacteria; the ligand LPS (a pathogen-associated molecular pattern) is recognized by the pattern recognition receptor (LPS-interacting protein), which interacts with MyD88.

In the last 5 years, evidence from molecular and cell biology has demonstrated that sponges (phylum Porifera) are provided with a genetically based body plan (reviewed in Refs. 1Müller W.E.G.

Encyclopedia of Molecular Cell Biology and Molecular Medicine. Wiley-VCH GmbH, Weinheim, Germany2005Google Scholar) and with a complex immune system (3Müller W.E.G. Müller I.M. Integr. Comp. Biol. 2003; 43: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As in other metazoan animals, this basic body plan is prone to modifications, depending on environmental constrains (e.g. inorganic (4Maldonado M. Carmona M.C. Uriz M. Cruzado A. Nature. 1999; 401: 785-788Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) or organic factors (5Rützler K. Boll. Mus. Ist. Biol. Univ. Genova. 2004; 68: 85-148Google Scholar)). More than other multicellular animals, sponges are exposed to foreign uni- and multicellular organisms, including viruses. Since the thorough studies of Reiswig and Osinga et al. (6Reiswig H. Rützler K. New Perspectives in Sponge Biology. Smithonian Institution Press, Washington, D. C.1990: 504-515Google Scholar, 7Osinga R. Belarbi E.H. Grima E.M. Tramper J. Wijffels R.H. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 100: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is established that sponges filtrate huge amounts of water, 0.002-0.84 cm3/s/cm3 of sponge tissue, through their aquiferous canal system to extract edible material. The marine aqueous milieu is, in contrast to the terrestrial environment, much richer in bacterial (8Gonzales J.M. Moran M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4237-4242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and viral organisms (9Bergh O. Borsheim K.Y. Bratbak G. Heldal M. Nature. 1989; 340: 467-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar); in some cases, up to 2.5 × 108 virus particles/ml have been counted. Very surprisingly, sponges are provided with the ability to distinguish the organismic particles according to their physical and chemical properties (6Reiswig H. Rützler K. New Perspectives in Sponge Biology. Smithonian Institution Press, Washington, D. C.1990: 504-515Google Scholar). In order to cope with the threats from bacteria and viruses, sponges produce nonproteinaceous secondary metabolites of low molecular weight, which have been sharpened to high selectivity and potency during their 800 million years of existence (10Sarma A.S. Daum T. Müller W.E.G. Secondary Metabolites from Marine Sponges. Akademie gemeinnütziger Wissenschaften zu Erfurt, Ullstein-Mosby Verlag, Berlin1993Google Scholar, 11Proksch P.

Other than Deuterostomia, Protostomia (e.g. Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans) and Diploblasts (with the two phyla Cnidaria and Porifera) are provided only with an innate immune system. This system relies on receptors and downstream molecules, which are expressed at the surfaces of epithelial cells facing the organism-environment boundaries (13Medzhitov R. Janeway C. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). It was Metchnikoff (14Metchnikoff É. Leçons sur la Pathologie Comparée de Inflammation. G. Masson, Paris1892Google Scholar) who first demonstrated that sponges eliminate bacteria by phagocytosis through their macrophage-related archaeocytes. It had been postulated and was subsequently experimentally supported, mainly with the demosponges Suberites domuncula and Geodia cydonium as model systems, that in Porifera, recognition molecules are present to bind bacteria and fungi. S. domuncula recognizes Gram-positive bacteria through binding to the bacterial proteoglycan (15Thakur N.L. Perović-Ottstadt S. Batel R. Korzhev M. Diehl-Seifert B. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Marine Biol. 2005; 146: 271-282Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar); consecutively, the sponge cells respond with increased (i) synthesis of lysozyme and (ii) endocytotic activity. With respect to fungi, sponges are provided with a cell surface receptor to recognize (1→3)-β-d-glucans (16Perović-Ottstadt S. Adell T. Proksch P. Wiens M. Korzhev M. Gamulin V. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1924-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); after binding, a signal transduction pathway is initiated that results in the expression of genes encoding a fibrinogen-like protein and an epidermal growth factor. Similarly exciting is the capacity of sponges to recognize Gram-negative bacteria. We established earlier that in S. domuncula, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is activated after binding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TIR, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; nt, nucleotide(s); NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; MPEG, macrophage-expressed protein; rMPEG, recombinant MPEG; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; SLIP, sponge LPS-interacting protein; rSLIP, recombinant SLIP; aa, amino acid(s); pAb, polyclonal antibody. 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TIR, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; nt, nucleotide(s); NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; MPEG, macrophage-expressed protein; rMPEG, recombinant MPEG; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; SLIP, sponge LPS-interacting protein; rSLIP, recombinant SLIP; aa, amino acid(s); pAb, polyclonal antibody. to cells (17Böhm M.

Marine Biol. 2001; 139: 1037-1045Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar); the p38 kinase and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase are rapidly phosphorylated. Additionally, S. domuncula responds to LPS with up-regulation of tachylectin, a d-GlcNAc-binding lectin (18Schröder H.C. Ushijima H. Krasko A. Gamulin V. Schütze J. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. J.

In vertebrates, the Toll-like receptor(s) (TLR(s)) are key mediators of detection of microbes (13Medzhitov R. Janeway C.

After activation of TLRs by LPS, the mitogen-activated protein kinase and the NF-κB pathways are activated (21Pålsson-McDermott E.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Immunology. 2004; 113: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar), and interferon production increases. In S. domuncula, three end point molecules involved in these processes have been identified: mitogen-activated protein kinase (17Böhm M. Hentschel U. Friedrich A. Fieseler L. Steffen R. Gamulin V.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 1382-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In human blood cells, activation of TLR results additionally in an activation of perforin (24Ambach A. Bonnekoh B. Nguyen M. Schön M.P. Gollnick H. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TLRs and members of the interleukin-1 receptor family share in their cytoplasmic domain a stretch of ∼200 amino acids (aa), which is known as the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain (20Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). This TIR domain is not only found in TLRs but also in downstream signaling molecules, such as the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-like adapter proteins (25McGettrick A.F. O'Neill L.A.J. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Neither TLR nor MyD88 have been identified in Diploblasts. In the present study, we show that S. domuncula possesses the TLR adapter molecule MyD88, which binds to a demosponge-specific protein that has been termed by us LPS-interacting protein, due to its property to bind to bacterial LPS. Furthermore, we identified in S. domuncula a perforin-like molecule whose expression is also up-regulated in response to LPS treatment. This polypeptide was termed, in line with an earlier suggestion (26Mah S.A. Moy G.W. Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), macrophage-expressed protein. The present paper is the first description of a pathway, active in the innate immune system in diploblastic animals, that involves a TIR domain-containing molecule and a perforin-like executing protein. The sources of chemicals and enzymes used were given previously (27Kruse M. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Krasko A.

Sigma provided LPS from Escherichia coli 088:B5 (L2880), fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled LPS (FITC-LPS (E. coli 088:B5; F8666)), Cy3 antibodies, and natural seawater. Protein A/G-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) was obtained from Pierce. Anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated either with alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase, PCR-DIG probe synthesis kit, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride were from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). Live specimens of S. domuncula (Porifera, Demospongiae, Hadromerida) were collected near Rovinj, Croatia, and then kept in aquariums in Mainz, Germany, for more than 10 months prior to use. During this cultivation period, the sponge specimens became almost completely free of any bacteria. Only a few bacteria species (very likely those that always live in symbiosis with S. domuncula) could be detected with low abundance (15Thakur N.L. Perović-Ottstadt S. Batel R. Korzhev M. Diehl-Seifert B. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Marine Biol. 2005; 146: 271-282Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This implies that the bacterial load of sponges under controlled cultivation conditions is low. The cDNA encoding the putative sponge LPS-interacting protein (SLIP_SUBDO) was isolated from a cDNA library (27Kruse M. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For the homology screening, the digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled DNA probe (DIG random primed DNA labeling kit; Roche Applied Science) of the aggregation factor-related molecule from G. cydonium (AFr_GEOCY; aa 61-537) (29Müller W.E.G. Koziol C. Müller I.M. Wiens M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 44: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was used. Screening of the S. domuncula cDNA library was performed under low stringency hybridization conditions of plaque lifts as described before (27Kruse M. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidmann J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Positive clones were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride as substrate (31Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russel-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). Completion of the cDNA sequence (termed SDSLIP) was confirmed by Northern blotting (1,630 nt). DNA sequencing was performed with an automatic DNA sequenator (Li-Cor 4000S). The SDMyD88 cDNA was obtained by PCR. Primers were designed against the highly conserved region (CRRMVVV; aa 216-222) within the human MyD88 (AAB49967). The degenerate forward primer (5′-TG(C/T) (C/A)GI (C/A)GI ATG GTI GTI GT-3′) was used in combination with a vector-specific reverse primer. PCR was carried out at an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 30 amplification cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 45 s, 70 °C for 1.5 min, and a final extension step at 70 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was as described earlier (32Wiens M. Koziol C. Hassanein H.M.A. Batel R. Müller W.E.G. Marine Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1998; 165: 247-257Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The genes coding for human (XP_166227) and abalone mollusk Haliotis rufescens (AAR82936) (26Mah S.A. Moy G.W. Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) macrophage-expressed protein have several highly similar regions in common. The region most suitable for searching a poriferan homologue comprised aa 50-56 (human sequence). Therefore, the degenerate forward primer 5′-GGI TGG GA(C/T) AA(C/T) (T/C)TI CGI (C/T)T-3′ was chosen together with a vector-specific reverse primer. The PCR conditions were as described above. The sequences were analyzed using computer programs BLAST (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi) and FASTA (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi-.ac.uk/fasta33/). Multiple alignments were performed with ClustalW version 1.6 (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic trees were constructed on the basis of aa sequence alignments by neighbor joining, as implemented in the “Neighbor” program of the PHYLIP package (36Felsenstein J. PHYLIP, version 3.5. University of Washington, Seattle, WA1993Google Scholar). The distance matrices were calculated using the Dayhoff PAM matrix model as described (37Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcutt B.C. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 345-352Google Scholar). The degree of support for internal branches was further assessed by bootstrapping (36Felsenstein J. PHYLIP, version 3.5. University of Washington, Seattle, WA1993Google Scholar). The graphic presentations were prepared with GeneDoc (by K. B. Nicholas and H. B. Nicholas, Jr.; available on the World Wide Web at cris.com/~ketchup/genedoc.shtml). The potential transmembrane regions were predicted by the algorithm published by Kyte and Doolittle (39Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar). LPS-interacting Protein—The poriferan SDSLIP sequence was expressed in E. coli (TOP10; Invitrogen). One forward primer (5′-TATCTCGAGTCCGAAGCCAGTGGAAGTTTGA-3′ (the XhoI restriction site is underlined)) was designed against aa 38-44 (SEASGSL; nt 181-202) and one reverse primer (5′-TATTCTAGATTACACATTGAGAGTCATCAAACCTA-3′) (XbaI)) against aa 444-451 (RFDDSQCV; nt 1398-1421) within the open reading frame were used to isolate by PCR the 1,241-bp-long segment. It was cloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of expression vector pBAD/gIIIA (Invitrogen), which contained at the 3′ terminus the myc epitope and the oligohistidine region. The insert was expressed overnight in E. coli LMG194 at 30 °C in the presence of 0.0002% l-arabinose. The fusion protein was extracted and purified with the His tag purification kit (Novagen, Madison, WI). The purity of the material was checked by 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS (PAGE) according to Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). MyD88 —The poriferan SDMyD88 sequence was expressed in E. coli (TOP10; Invitrogen). One fragment (aa 117-249; corresponding to nt 386-796), including the TIR domain (aa 117-228), was isolated by PCR using the forward primer (5′-GTGTTTCTGTCGTTTGCTGAG-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-AATATGATGAGTTACTGATTT-3′). The 411-bp-long part was cloned into the expression vector pTrcHis2-TOPO (Invitrogen), which contained at the 3′ terminus the myc epitope and the oligohistidine region. The insert was expressed overnight at 30 °C in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The fusion protein (rMyD88) was extracted and purified on a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the instructions. The purity of the material was checked by PAGE. rMyD88 was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2; 10 mm dl-dithiothreitol). Macrophage-expressed Protein—A 2,022-bp fragment (nt 4-2025) of the poriferan macrophage-expressed protein (SDMPEG, excluding the first aa) was amplified through PCR using the forward primer (5-TATCCATGGGTCTGTCTAACCAGGCAA-3′ (NcoI)) and the reverse primer (5′-TATCTGCAGCCAAGCAAAGGCAAATTTGTC-3′) (PstI)). After ligation with the expression vector pBAD/gIIIA, the recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli LMG194 in the presence of 0.0002% l-arabinose (overnight, 30 °C). Following its extraction and purification on Ni2+-NTA columns (Qiagen), the recombinant protein was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2), supplemented with 10 mmdl-dithiothreitol. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were raised against the recombinant proteins in female rabbits (White New Zealand) as described (41Schütze J. Krasko A. Diehl-Seifert B. Müller W.E.G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3189-3198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pAb against rMyD88 (TIR domain) was termed pAb-rMyD88. In separate series, the recombinant LPS-interacting protein (rSLIP) and the (almost) complete rMPEG (only the first amino acid had been omitted) were used for the preparation of the pAbs, which were named pAb-rSLIP and pAb-rMPEG, respectively. In control experiments, 100 μl of the respective pAbs were adsorbed to 20 μg of the recombinant proteins (rMyD88, rSLIP, and rMPEG) during an incubation period of 30 min (4 °C) prior to their use. For the identification of recombinant proteins (rMyD88, rSLIP, and rMPEG), the samples were subjected to 15 or 10% SDS-PAGE. After protein transfer, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with pAb-rMyD88 (1:1000 dilution), pAb-rSLIP (1:3000), and pAb-rMPEG (1:2000). If not mentioned otherwise, the immune complexes were visualized by successive incubation with anti-rabbit IgG (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) and the substrate 4-chloro-1-naphthol. As described earlier (17Böhm M. Hentschel U. Friedrich A. Fieseler L. Steffen R. Gamulin V. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Marine Biol. 2001; 139: 1037-1045Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), tissue samples (15 g each) were exposed in seawater to 1 μg of LPS/ml for the indicated periods (up to 3 days). Then the samples were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, subjected to twice the volume of lysis buffer (1× TBS (Tris-buffered saline), pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml; Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), homogenized in a mortar, and finally applied in co-immunoprecipitation or Western blot analyses. For the direct analysis of the level of protein in the extract, the samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g; 10 min; 4 °C), and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. In general, the described protocol (42Klenova E. Chernukhin I. Inoue T. Shamsuddin S. Norton J. Methods. 2002; 26: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was applied. For each immunoprecipitation, a 0.5-ml aliquot of the lysate was incubated with 10 μl of undiluted serum (preimmune or immune pAb) for 1 h (4 °C). Protein A/G-agarose beads (20 μl) were added, and after 3 h the agarose beads were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE-fractionated proteins were analyzed on Western blots. The membranes were probed with the pAbs and detected by anti-rabbit IgG (peroxidase-coupled) using the BM Chemiluminescence Blotting Substrate kit (Roche Applied Science). To determine whether the LPS-interacting protein forms a dimer on the cell surface, the noncleavable, membrane-impermeable disuccinimidyl suberate analog BS3 was used (43Knoller S. Shpungin S. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2795-2804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 3 days either in the absence or in the presence of LPS, the tissue was shockfrozen and treated with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, the samples were incubated with 0.5 mm BS3 in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS for 60 min. A parallel sample remained nonincubated with BS3. Then membranes were isolated according to the “Tris method” (44Warren L. Glick M.C. Nass N.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1967; 68: 269-288Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and subjected to PAGE/Western blot analysis. Tissue was incubated for 3 days in the absence or presence of LPS. After treatment with BS3, membranes were prepared and spotted onto nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schüll). After blocking with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS (containing 1% bovine serum albumin), the sheets were incubated with FITC-LPS (1 μg/ml; in PBS). After washing with PBS, the bound FITC-LPS was detected under UV light (490 nm). Where indicated, the FITC-LPS probe (1 μg/ml) was supplemented with unlabeled LPS (20 μg/ml). In a further control, the FITC-LPS solution was pretreated with recombinant LPS-interacting protein (rSLIP; 20 μg/ml) for 30 min, prior to the addition to the sheets. The method was described recently (45Perović S. Schröder H.C. Sudek S. Grebenjuk V.A. Batel R. Stifanić M. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. Evol. Dev. 2003; 5: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In short, 8-μm-thick frozen sections were fixed with paraformaldehyde, treated with Proteinase K, and subsequently fixed again with paraformaldehyde. Hybridization (with the antisense and sense (control) probe) was performed in 2× SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate), supplemented with 50% formamide. Following hybridization overnight in a glass chamber at 45 °C, the sections were washed at 55 °C at decreasing salt concentrations (1× down to 0.2× SSC); final washes were with PBT (PBS supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at room temperature. After blocking, the slices were reacted with anti-DIG-Fab-fragments, conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (dilution 1:100). The sections were incubated with Tris-buffer, containing the dye reagents 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Roche Applied Science) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science). Hybridizations were performed with a labeled SDMyD88 (nt 145-472), SD-SLIP (nt 130-412), and SDMPEG (nt 351-751) probes. Sense probes were used in parallel as negative controls in the experiments; they did not react with the slices. Fresh tissue was fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in Technovit 8100, and sectioned, essentially as described (23Grebenjuk V.A. Kuusksalu A. Kelve M. Schütze J. Schröder H.C. Müller W.E.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1382-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The 2-μm-thick slices were reacted with pAb antiserum against LPS-interacting protein (pAb-rSLIP; 1:1000 dilution) and finally with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The sections were inspected for immunofluorescence with an Olympus AHBT3 microscope. Control experiments with preimmune serum did not show any autoimmunofluorescence. RNA was extracted from liquid nitrogen-pulverized tissue with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) as described (23Grebenjuk V.A. Kuusksalu A. Kelve M. Schütze J. Schröder H.C. Müller W.E.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1382-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Then an amount of 5 μg of total RNA each was electrophoresed and blotted onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed with the following probes: SDMyD88 (nt 145-472), SDSLIP (nt 130-412) and SDMPEG (nt 351-751), as well as a part of β-tubulin, SDTUB (accession number AJ550806; nt 83-483). The probes were labeled with the PCR-DIG-Probe-Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science). After washing, DIG-labeled nucleic acid was detected with anti-DIG Fab fragments and visualized by the chemiluminescence technique, using CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science). The assay was performed as described (46Tunkijjanukij S. Olafsen J.A. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1998; 22: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The Gram-negative E. coli (strain XL1-Blue MRF′) and the sponge-associated Gram-negative bacteria BL21 (47Thakur N.L. Hentschel U. Krasko A. Pabel C.T. Anil A.C. Müller W.E.G. Aquatic Microbiol. Ecol. 2003; 31: 77-83Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) as well as the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus Rosenbach were grown in LB broth overnight. Then 20 μl of bacterial suspension were added to 5 μl of recombinant macrophage-expressed protein (rMPEG) and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Antibacterial activity was assayed after an overnight incubation by determination of the reduction of the colony-forming units as described (18Schröder H.C. Ushijima H. Krasko A. Gamulin V. Schütze J. Müller I.M. Müller W.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32810-3281"
https://openalex.org/W2006241634,"Neurotransmitter transporters are critical for synaptic neurotransmitter inactivation. Transporter inhibitors markedly increase the duration and magnitude of synaptic transmission, underscoring the importance of transporter activity in neurotransmission. Recent studies indicate that membrane trafficking dynamically governs neuronal transporter cell-surface presentation in a protein kinase C–regulated manner, suggesting that transporter trafficking profoundly affects synaptic signaling. However, the molecular architecture coupling neurotransmitter transporters to the endocytic machinery is not defined. Here, we identify nonclassical, distinct endocytic signals in the dopamine transporter (DAT) that are necessary and sufficient to drive constitutive and protein kinase C–regulated DAT internalization. The DAT internalization signal is conserved across SLC6 neurotransmitter carriers and is functional in the homologous norepinephrine transporter, suggesting that this region is likely to be the endocytic signal for all SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters. The DAT endocytic signal does not conform to classic internalization motifs, suggesting that SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters may have evolved unique endocytic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2129958400,"Lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques are vulnerable, and their rupture can cause the formation of a platelet- and fibrin-rich thrombus leading to myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Although the role of plaque-based tissue factor as stimulator of blood coagulation has been recognized, it is not known whether plaques can cause thrombus formation through direct activation of platelets. We isolated lipid-rich atheromatous plaques from 60 patients with carotid stenosis and identified morphologically diverse collagen type I- and type III-positive structures in the plaques that directly stimulated adhesion, dense granule secretion, and aggregation of platelets in buffer, plasma, and blood. This material also elicited platelet-monocyte aggregation and platelet-dependent blood coagulation. Plaques exposed to flowing blood at arterial wall shear rate induced platelets to adhere to and spread on the collagenous structures, triggering subsequent thrombus formation. Plaque-induced platelet thrombus formation was observed in fully anticoagulated blood (i.e., in the absence of tissue factor-mediated coagulation). Mice platelets lacking glycoprotein VI (GPVI) were unable to adhere to atheromatous plaque or form thrombi. Human platelet thrombus formation onto plaques in flowing blood was completely blocked by GPVI inhibition with the antibody 10B12 but not affected by integrin alpha2beta1 inhibition with 6F1 mAb. Moreover, the initial platelet response, shape change, induced by plaque was blocked by GPVI inhibition but not with alpha2beta1 antagonists (6F1 mAb or GFOGER-GPP peptide). Pretreatment of plaques with collagenase or anti-collagen type I and anti-collagen type III antibodies abolished plaque-induced platelet activation. Our results indicate that morphologically diverse collagen type I- and collagen type III-containing structures in lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques stimulate thrombus formation by activating platelet GPVI. This platelet collagen receptor, essential for plaque-induced thrombus formation, presents a promising new anti-thrombotic target for the prevention of ischemic cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2040635619,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), characterized by cardiac dilatation and contractile dysfunction, is a major cause of heart failure. Inherited DCM can result from mutations in the genes encoding cardiac troponin T, troponin C, and α-tropomyosin; different mutations in the same genes cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To understand how certain mutations lead specifically to DCM, we have investigated their effect on contractile function by comparing wild-type and mutant recombinant proteins. Because initial studies on two troponin T mutations have generated conflicting findings, we analyzed all eight published DCM mutations in troponin T, troponin C, and α-tropomyosin in a range of in vitro assays. Thin filaments, reconstituted with a 1:1 ratio of mutant/wild-type proteins (the likely in vivo ratio), all showed reduced Ca2+ sensitivity of activation in ATPase and motility assays, and except for one α-tropomyosin mutant showed lower maximum Ca2+ activation. Incorporation of either of two troponin T mutants in skinned cardiac trabeculae also decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation. Structure/function considerations imply that the diverse thin filament DCM mutations affect different aspects of regulatory function yet change contractility in a consistent manner. The DCM mutations depress myofibrillar function, an effect fundamentally opposite to that of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing thin filament mutations, suggesting that decreased contractility may trigger pathways that ultimately lead to the clinical phenotype.

Interstitial fibrosis and mild myocyte hypertrophy are frequently observed, as is myocyte degeneration. Various environmental insults, such as viral myocarditis or alcohol toxicity, are known to cause DCM; however, echocardiographic screening of relatives of affected individuals has suggested that about one-third of cases are familial (1.Baig M.K.

Kubler W. Katus H.A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 31: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Around 20 loci have been identified for Mendelian traits in which DCM is the predominant phenotype, and in all except 2 of these, the disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (3.Schonberger J. Seidman C.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 249-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In some instances DCM is inherited with an associated phenotype such as conduction disease, skeletal myopathy, or sensorineural hearing loss. The underlying disease genes have been identified at some of the mapped loci, and others have been implicated from candidate gene studies; these disease genes encode a wide variety of proteins, suggesting that diverse abnormalities can trigger the observed cardiac remodeling. Many of the genes encode components of the cytoskeleton: these include proteins that co-localize at the sites of attachment of the cytoskeleton to the membrane (costameres), for example, desmin (4.Li D. Tapscoft T. Gonzalez O. Burch P.E. Quinones M.A. Zoghbi W.A. Hill R. Bachinski L.L. Mann D.L. Roberts R. Circulation. 1999; 100: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and Z-disk components, such as muscle LIM protein (5.Knoll R. Hoshijima M. Hoffman H.M. Person V. Lorenzen-Schmidt I.

Cell. 2002; 111: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). This has led to the proposals that the primary deficit in DCM is either in force transmission, due to destabilization of the membrane attachment at the costameres (6.Bowles N.E. Bowles K.R. Towbin J.A. Herz. 2000; 25: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), or due to defective stretch sensing at the Z-disk (5.Knoll R. Hoshijima M. Hoffman H.M. Person V. Lorenzen-Schmidt I.

Cardiol. 2004; 44: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar)) can also cause autosomal dominant DCM, and some, if not all of these, are likely to cause changes in force generation. It is known that different mutations in the same contractile protein genes cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (12.Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), a more common familial disease with a contrasting phenotype of a hypertrophied ventricle with a small cavity and preserved systolic function. The finding that both HCM and DCM can be caused by different mutations in the same sarcomeric protein raises the question of whether there are two separate programs that remodel the heart, or whether these different morphologies reflect gradations of a single pathway (12.Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). For example, transgenic mice bearing a truncation allele of myosin-binding protein C (which produces HCM in man) show hypertrophy in heterozygotes but dilated cardiomyopathy in homozygotes (13.McConnell B.K. Jones K.A. Fatkin D. Arroyo L.H. Lee R.T. Aristizabal O. Turnbull D.H. Georgakopoulos D. Kass D. Bond M. Niimura H. Schoen F.J. Conner D. Fischman D.A. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Fischman D.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); this might suggest that severity of the underlying defect (in this case, determined by dosage), rather than the qualitative nature of the defect, could determine the resultant phenotype. However, the underlying histology is quite different because the hallmark feature of HCM, myocyte disarray, is absent in hearts of individuals with DCM due to contractile protein gene mutations (7.Kamisago M. Sharma S.D. DePalma S.R. Solomon S. Sharma P. McDonough B. Smoot L. Mullen M.P. Woolf P.K. Wigle E.D. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Jarcho J. Shapiro L.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Analysis of the function of mutated protein in reconstituted contractile systems has been used to address these questions. Many studies of different HCM thin filament mutations have been performed; these indicate a variety of functional abnormalities that generally include increased Ca2+ sensitivity and cross-bridge turnover rate (14.Knollmann B.C. Potter J.D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, experiments have only been reported for two of the DCM mutations to date, both being mutations in troponin T. Incorporation of the ΔLys-210 mutant into skinned cardiac fibers was found to result in a decrease in the Ca2+ sensitivity of tension generation (15.Morimoto S. Lu Q.W. Harada K. Takahashi-Yanaga F.

Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41670-41676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our in vitro actin-activated ATPase and motility analyses of the ΔLys-210 mutant using thin filaments reconstituted with an equal amount of wild-type and mutant troponin (the expected in vivo ratio) showed that this mutation caused reduced Ca2+ sensitivity and decreased thin filament activation (17.Robinson P.

A second TnT mutant (R141W) was shown to cause reduced Ca2+ sensitivity in one study (18.Lu Q.W. Morimoto S. Harada K. Du C.K. Takahashi-Yanaga F. Miwa Y. Sasaguri T. Ohtsuki I. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1421-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but a further study found no significant shift, leading to the suggestion that a rightward shift in Ca2+ sensitivity was not a consistent feature of these DCM mutants (16.Venkatraman G.

To resolve uncertainty regarding the functional phenotype of the sarcomeric DCM mutations and hence the relationship between DCM and HCM pathways, we extended our work to examine all reported autosomal dominant DCM mutations in thin filament regulatory proteins.

We show that reduced Ca2+ sensitivity is indeed a consistent property of all eight of these mutants and find that seven of these mutants also reduce thin filament activation. This suggests that this specific defect in myofilament regulation provides the primary stimulus for a pathway leading to myocyte death and ensuing ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. Actin and the myosin proteolytic fragments heavy meromyosin (HMM) and subfragment-1 (S-1) were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle by standard methods.

Recombinant wild-type human troponin subunits were overexpressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli and subsequently purified. pMW172 expression constructs encoding DCM mutations in TnT and TnC were made from the wild-type construct using a two-step PCR protocol.

We used F-actin labeled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate phalloidin (ϕ) and skeletal muscle HMM on cover glasses coated with silicone by soaking in 0.2% dichloroedimethylsilane in chloroform. Two 50-μl aliquots of HMM at 100 μg/ml were infused in buffer A (50 mm KCl, 25 mm imidazole-HCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) to provide a coating of immobilized HMM on the coverslip. This was followed by 2 × 50 μl of buffer B (buffer A + 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and then by 2 × 50 μl of 10 nm labeled actin ± associated tropomyosin-troponin in buffer A. 50 μl of buffer C (buffer B + 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 3 mg/ml glucose, 0.5% methylcellulose, ± troponin at assay concentration) and 50 μl of buffer D (buffer C + 1 mm ATP) were then infused. All experiments were carried out at 28 °C with final concentrations of reconstituted thin filament proteins as follows: rabbit skeletal actin, 10 nm; human cardiac tropomyosin, 30 nm; and reconstituted human cardiac troponin, 0–20 nm. Both tropomyosin and troponin were titrated to determine saturating concentrations. Four 15-s videos were recorded in each cell before any significant photobleaching had occurred. Videos were digitized, and the movement was analyzed to determine the fraction of filaments moving and the velocity of motile filaments using the automatic tracking program described by Marston et al. (24.Marston S.B. Fraser I.D. Bing W. Roper G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent regulation of isometric contraction was measured in chemically skinned guinea pig heart trabeculae by replacing endogenous troponin with whole wild-type or mutant human cardiac recombinant troponin using the method introduced by She et al. (26.She M. Trimble D. Yu L.C. Chalovich J.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Albino Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs weighing ∼250 g were killed humanely by CO2 asphyxiation by authorized United Kingdom Home Office procedures. Trabeculae were removed from the left ventricle and immersed in 2× relaxing solution (relaxing solution: 60 mm BES (pH 7.2), 6.36 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 6.26 mm Na2ATP, and 54.02 mm K2 propionate) containing 50% (v/v) glycerol and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 12 h at 2 °C. The trabeculae were then transferred to 2× relaxing solution with 50% (v/v) glycerol and stored at -20 °C for up to 7 days. The trabeculae of ∼2.0 mm in length and 0.2 mm in width were suspended between a static hook, and another was attached to the semi-conductor element of a force transducer. The trabeculae were immersed in relaxing solution at 12 °C until a stable baseline was achieved, and the length and width of the fiber were measured. The fiber was then immersed in a zero EGTA solution (60 mm BES (pH 7.2), 6.09 mm MgCl2, 6.32 mm Na2ATP, and 74.70 mm K2 propionate). Maximum tension was measured using a pCa 4.5 solution (60 mm BES (pH 7.2), 6.11 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 6.31 mm Na2ATP, 43.66 mm K2 propionate, and 10.07 mm CaCl2), and each fiber was maximally activated three times. The maximum force generated by these fibers prior to exchange was 30.27 ± 6.88 mN/mm-2, and the pCa50 was 5.73 ± 0.13. For the exchange of troponin, the trabeculae were activated in a pCa 4.5 solution and then immediately placed into a quick rinse solution (10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 5 mm EGTA, and 15 mm EDTA) for 5 min. During this time, the fiber developed a rigor force that was approximately one-third of the total Ca2+-sensitive force. Following this, the trabecula was placed in a rigor solution (170 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 2.5 mm EGTA, and 2.5 mm EDTA) for 10 min, followed by 20 min in exchange solution (170 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) without any troponin. During this time, the temperature was increased to a nominal temperature of 22 °C. The fiber was incubated in 0.5 mg/ml human recombinant cardiac troponin for 1 h. Subsequent to the troponin exchange, the fiber was washed three times (10 min each) in rigor solution and then washed twice (20 min each) in relaxing solution. During the latter incubation, the temperature of the cooling bath was returned to 12 °C. The fiber was maximally activated in a pCa 4.5 solution, and after that, the fiber was immersed sequentially in solutions containing increasing quantities of Ca2+, and the level of contraction was determined. The pCa-force curves were fitted to a four-parameter Hill equation using SigmaPlot 2002, and from this, the pCa50 and Hill coefficient were calculated. Trabeculae were separated by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. Human recombinant cardiac TnI migrates slightly faster than the guinea pig cardiac TnI subunit, and densitometric analysis was used to quantitate both proteins. A standard curve of cardiac TnI was used for calibration. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Means of mutant data were compared with wild-type using the paired Student's t test. Human cardiac troponin was reconstituted using recombinant troponin T, I, and C subunits. Wild-type troponin and troponin containing either a TnT or TnC DCM mutant were compared in thin filaments reconstituted with recombinant human Ala-Ser α-tropomyosin (for ATPase assays) or native human cardiac tropomyosin (for in vitro motility studies). To study mutations in tropomyosin, thin filaments were reconstituted using recombinant wild-type or mutant Ala-Ser α-tropomyosin with either recombinant troponin (ATPase assays) or native human troponin (in vitro motility). The Ala-Ser N-terminal addition substitutes for the absence of N-terminal acetylation of the bacterially produced peptide (27.Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Bing W. Knott A. Redwood C. Esposito G. Purcell I. Watkins H. Marston S. J. Mol.

Direct binding measurements, made under the conditions of the ATPase assay, showed normal stoichiometry for binding of all troponin subunits and tropomyosin to actin (data not shown). Effect of DCM Mutations on Maximum Activation and Inhibition—Addition of wild-type or mutant troponin to actin-tropomyosin filaments resulted in Ca2+-sensitive regulation of S-1 ATPase activity and filament motility. Titration experiments showed that the concentration of troponin needed to obtain a maximal effect was the same for wild-type and all mutant proteins; a typical set of titrations for wild-type troponin and troponin containing the TnT R131W mutation is shown in Fig. 1. At pCa 4.5, wild-type troponin activated acto-S-1 ATPase activity to 202 ± 1% of the actin-tropomyosin level, whereas at pCa 8.5, ATPase was reduced to 21 ± 1% of actin-tropomyosin activity as previously noted (17.Robinson P.

In equivalent experiments in which wild-type TnT, TnC, or tropomyosin was substituted with a DCM mutant component, the maximal activation was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) for seven of the eight mutants tested (Figs. 1 and 2A). The most marked reduction was obtained with the TnT R131W mutant (to 109 ± 4% of the actin-tropomyosin level). The α-tropomyosin E54K DCM mutant was unique because it had no effect upon maximal ATPase activation. In contrast to the changes observed in activating Ca2+, at pCa 8.5, no significant differences were detected between wild-type and six of the eight mutants; small, statistically significant decreases in the inhibited rate were detected using the TnT R205L and α-tropomyosin E54K mutants.Fig. 2Comparison of the effects of eight DCM mutations on maximal activation and inhibition by troponin. A, actin-tropomyosin-activated S-1 ATPase rates at 37 °C, pH 7.0, expressed as a percentage of the rate in the absence of troponin (8.0 ± 0.3 s-1). B, actin-tropomyosin-activated S-1 ATPase rates for 50:50 mixtures of wild-type with mutant protein. C, mean thin filament sliding velocity at 28 °C, pH 7.4, expressed as a percentage of the sliding speed of actin-tropomyosin-wild-type troponin filaments at pCa 5.4 measured in the same experiment (3.63 ± 0.17 μm/s). D, mean fraction of filaments motile. Conditions were as described in the Fig. 1 legend. Activating conditions (pCa 4.5 ATPases, pCa 5.4 motility), black boxes; relaxing conditions (pCa 8.5 ATPases, pCa 9 motility), white boxes. Results are the mean ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the in vitro motility assay, addition of troponin to actin-tropomyosin increased the sliding speed at pCa 5.4 by up to 28% but did not alter the fraction of filaments motile (Figs. 1 and 2, C and D). At pCa 9, sliding speed of motile filaments was 50–70% of actin-tropomyosin filaments, and the fraction of filaments motile was reduced to 10–15% (20.Purcell I.F. Bing W. Marston S.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The presence of DCM mutations in the thin filaments caused significant decreases compared with wild-type in the troponin-dependent speed enhancement at pCa 5.4 (Figs. 1 and 2C; p < 0.001 for TnT R131W; p < 0.01 for TnT R141W, TnT R205L, TnT ΔLys-210, and TnC G159D; and p < 0.05 for α-tropomyosin E40K). In contrast, neither the fully activated nor the fully inhibited fraction of filaments motile was significantly different from wild-type for any of the mutations (Fig. 2D). Again, the α-tropomyosin E54K mutation was unique because it had no effect on sliding speed at pCa 5. The Effect of DCM Mutations on Ca2+ Sensitivity—We determined the effect of DCM mutations on the Ca2+ concentration dependence of troponin regulation of actomyosin ATPase and in vitro motility parameters, using concentrations of troponin that gave maximal inhibition under relaxing conditions. Fig. 3 shows representative Ca2+ activation curves comparing wild-type thin filaments with thin filaments containing mutations in TnT (R205L), TnC (G159D), and α-tropomyosin (E40K); the curves obtained for the other mutations are shown in the on-line data supplement. The data were fitted to the Hill equation, and the pCa50 and Hill coefficient, nH, were determined from several independent experiments (Fig. 4 and Table I). For wild-type thin filaments, the mean pCa50 for ATPase regulation was 6.44 ± 0.02 (n = 14); in the motility studies, the mean pCa50 was 6.69 ± 0.05 (n = 18) for fraction of filaments motile and 6.35 ± 0.05 (n = 18) for filament velocity. With the exception of the TnT ΔLys-210 mutation previously described (17.Robinson P. Mirza M. Knott A. Abdulrazzak H. Willott R. Marston S. Watkins H. Redwood C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40710-40716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), all the DCM mutations caused a rightward shift of the curve for all three measured parameters in direct comparison with wild-type in paired experiments. The decrease in pCa50 was in the range 0.09 (TnT R141W) to 0.48 (α-tropomyosin E54K) pCa units in the ATPase assays and between 0.18 (TnT R270N) and 0.40 (TnT R205L) in motility studies. All the differences in pCa50 were significant in the ATPase assay, and the differences in pCa50 were also significant in in vitro motility assay when there were sufficient independent measurements for statistical analysis. The Hill coefficient, nH, a measure of cooperativity of Ca2+ activation, was significantly reduced for every TnT and TnC mutant, but no significant difference in nH was detected with the two α-tropomyosin mutants (Fig. 4D and Table I). A similar pattern of results was obtained from in vitro motility assay (data not shown).Fig. 4Effects of eight DCM mutations on pCa50 and nH, measured from ATPase and motility experiments. The mean difference in pCa50 between wild-type and mutant troponin measured in two to eight separate paired experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 3 is plotted as a histogram. Error bars show S.E. A, ΔpCa50 for thin filament activation of S-1 ATPase activity. Complete data and significance testing are presented in Table I. B, ΔpCa50 for thin filament sliding speed. Significance tests gave p < 0.001 for TnC G159D; p < 0.01 for TnT R141W, TnTΔLys-210, and α-tropomyosin E54K; and p < 0.05 for TnT D270N and α-tropomyosin E40K. C"

(1998) EMBO J. 17, 6289–6299). Our use of embryonic stem cells provided a model system that could be used to investigate the specification of multiple embryonic lineages, including cardiac myocytes. We observed the absence of myogenic α-actins, SM22α, and myocardin expression and the failure to form beating cardiac myocytes in aggregated SRF null embryonic stem cells, whereas the appearance of transcription factors Nkx2–5 and GATA4 were unaffected. To study the role of SRF during heart organogenesis, we then performed cardiac-specific ablation of SRF by crossing the transgenic α-myosin heavy chain Cre recombinase line with SRF LoxP-engineered mice. Cardiac-specific ablation of SRF resulted in embryonic lethality due to cardiac insufficiency during chamber maturation. Conditional ablation of SRF also reduced cell survival concomitant with increased apoptosis and reduced cellularity. Significant reductions in SRF (≥95%), atrial naturetic factor (≥80%), and cardiac (≥60%), skeletal (≥90%), and smooth muscle (≥75%) α-actin transcripts were also observed in the cardiac-conditional knock-out heart. This was consistent with the idea that SRF directs de novo cardiac and smooth muscle gene activities. Finally, quantitation of the knock-in LacZ reporter gene transcripts in the hearts of cardiac-conditional knock-out embryos revealed an ∼30% reduction in gene activity, indicating SRF gene autoregulation during cardiogenesis. Serum response factor (SRF) homozygous-null embryos from our backcross of SRFLacZ/+ “knock-in” mice failed to gastrulate and form mesoderm, similar to the findings of an earlier study (Arsenian, S., Weinhold, B., Oelgeschlager, M., Ruther, U., and Nordheim, A.

SRF, yeast transcription factors MCM1 and ARG80, and plant proteins, such as Deficiens, all have a related MADS box. These MADS boxes have similar DNA binding specificities and dimerize to symmetrically contact the serum response element with a consensus sequence CC(A/T)6GG, also known as the CArG box. In vertebrates, SRF expression is enriched to tissues of mesodermal and neuroectodermal origins (5Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The appearance and diversification of nascent embryonic cardiac and smooth muscle cells require the combinatorial interactions of SRF with other transcription factors, enriched in the early progenitor cells (3Reecy J.M. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Harvey R. Rosenthal N. Heart Development. Academic Press, New York1999: 273-290Crossref Google Scholar, 4Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Also, a feature of a large number of cardiac- and virtually all of the smooth muscle-expressed genes to date is their dependence upon CArG boxes (4Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In fact, SRF expression is dependent on its promoter, which contains two CArG boxes and SP1 sites, indicating that SRF may modulate its own expression (6Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast to the c-fos gene promoter, which contains a single high affinity CArG box with an adjacent Ets factor binding site, the promoters of many muscle-specific genes, including the skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle α-actins, lack the Ets binding site (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 8Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) but contain combinations of two or more CArG boxes that bind SRF in a highly cooperative manner (9Lee T.C. Chow K.L. Fang P. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chow K.-L. Hogan M.E. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1301-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutations that prevent SRF binding severely impair the expression of c-fos, as well as muscle-restricted genes. In addition, CArG boxes recruit SRF and cofactors (such as Nkx2.5 and GATA4) as transcriptosomes that strongly enhance SRF-DNA binding affinity, thus permitting the formation of higher order DNA binding complexes at relatively low SRF levels (11Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sepulveda J.L. Vlahopoulos S. Iyer D. Belaguli N. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25775-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similarly, CArG boxes recruit the cysteine-rich protein 2 LIM protein, which bridges SRF and GATA factors through interaction with the MADS αI coil (13Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Iyer D. Roberts W.B. Wu S. Dong X. Marx J.G. Moore M.S. Beckerle M.C. Majesky M.W. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 107-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and myocardin, which competes with Ets factors that interact with the MADS box αII coil (14Wang D. Li S. Hockemeyer D. Sutherland L. Schratt G. Richardson R.A. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14855-14860Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 15Wang Z. Wang D-Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Nature. 2004; 428: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). All of these myogenic cofactors greatly enhance SRF transactivation. Thus, the MADS box domain is likely to be an important regulatory nexus for the convergence of crucial cellular signals enabling SRF to recruit specific cofactors to their respective DNA binding sites and enhance transactivation of target genes. The homologous recombinant knock-out of the murine SRF gene causes early lethality prior to the formation of mesoderm (16Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which prevents the elucidation of the functions of SRF in directing cardiac gene expression. Our complementary approach was to first use SRF null embryonic stem (ES) cells, because differentiating ES cells provide an in vitro embryo model system that can be used to investigate the function of genes involved in the developmental specification of multiple embryonic lineages. Usually, a beating myocardium appears in an ES cell induced to form embryoid bodies (17Ng W.A. Doetschman T. Robbins J. Lessard J.L. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 41: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In SRF null ES cells, we observed the absence of myogenic α-actins, SM22α, and myocardin expression and the failure to form beating cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, to study the role of SRF during heart organogenesis, we then performed cardiac-specific ablation of SRF by crossing the transgenic α-myosin heavy chain Cre recombinase line with SRF LoxP-engineered mice. Although our study also supports and extends the recent observation that ablation of SRF in the embryonic heart disrupts cardiac sarcomerogenesis, reduced downstream target gene expression, and reduced cell survival in SRF cardiac-conditional knock-out embryos (18Miano J.M. Ramanan N. Georger M.A. de Mesy Bentley K.L. Emerson R.L. Balza Jr., R.O. Xiao Q. Weiler H. Ginty D.D. Misra R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17132-17137Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we did not observe the nonspecific repression of many non-SRF targets, as reported in conditional deletion with a relatively late expressing βMHC-Cre transgene (19Parlakian A. Tuil D. Hamard G. Tavernier G. Hentzen D. Concordet J.P. Paulin D. Li Z. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Finally, our study revealed a novel role for SRF in driving its own gene autoregulatory loop during cardiogenesis. Generation of SRF Cardiac-conditional Null Embryos and Genotyping—The SRF LacZ “knock-in” mouse (SRFLacZ/+) was generated, as described previously (20Barron M.R. Belaguli N.S. Trinh M. Iyer D.

In-frame replacement of the SRF coding sequence, from ATG to most of the second exon, by insertion of bacterial β-galactosidase generated an SRF null allele. LoxP sites have been inserted into the SRF gene by homologous recombination and generated into mouse lines by Nordheim and colleagues (21Wiebel F.F. Rennekampff V. Vintersten K. Nordheim. A. Genesis. 2002; 32: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocyte-specific Cre recombinase transgenic mice (α-MyHC-Cre) were used to mediate cardiac myocytic Cre/LoxP recombination (21Wiebel F.F. Rennekampff V. Vintersten K. Nordheim. A. Genesis. 2002; 32: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All mice used in this study were crossed into the C57/B6 background. SRF LacZ knock-in mice (SRFLacZ/+) were bred with α-MyHC-Cre mice to obtain double transgenic mice (SRFLacZ/+:α-MyHC-Cre). Breeding between double positive mice (SRFLacZ/+:α-MyHC-Cre) and SRF LoxP-engineered (SRFLoxP/+ or SRFLoxP/LoxP) mice generated SRF cardiac-conditional knock-out progeny (SRFLacZ/LoxP:α-MyHC-Cre, also referred to as CKO mutant mice). Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis of tail DNA for adult mice and yolk sac DNA for embryos. The SRF LacZ knock-in allele was genotyped using primers: srfpCARG2.2, 5′-GGGCTCGCCATATAAGGAGCGGCC-3′; msrfEX1, 5′-GGCTCCGGTACCTTCTTCATGAT-3′; and GALbsu361, 5′-ATCGGCCTCAGGAAGATCG-3′, which produced a DNA fragment at 950 bp for wild type and 720 bp for LacZ knock-in allele. The presence of α-MyHC-Cre was genotyped using primers: αMHC, 5′-ATGACAGACAGATCCCTCCTATCTCC-3′; and Cre3′, 5′-CTCATCACTCGTTGCATCGAC-3′ with a DNA band at 280 bp. Mice containing the SRF LoxP-engineered allele were genotyped as described previously (4Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Whole Mount X-Gal Staining—Detailed Cre recombinase activity was examined by visualizing the β-galactosidase activity of staged embryos collected from crosses between α-MyHC-Cre transgenic mice and R26R reporter mice (22Gaussin V. Van de Putte T. Mishina Y. Hanks M.C. Zwijsen A. Huylebroeck D. Behringer R.R. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2878-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). X-Gal staining was performed according to Hogan et al. (23Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994: 497Google Scholar). Staining was carried out at 37 °C for 3 h, unless otherwise noted. β-Galactosidase activity in SRF LacZ knock-in embryos and SRF cardiac-conditional knock-outs were detected in the same way. After photography, selected embryos were dehydrated in serial ethanol solutions, cleared in xylene, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 7 μm and nuclei were counter-stained with nuclear fast red using standard histological techniques. In addition, primer R26R-F, 5′-CGCCATCCCGCATCTGACCAC-3′; and R26R-R, 5′-CCGCTCTGCTACCTGCGCC-3′ were used to genotype the Rosa26R allele. Embryo Collection and in Situ Hybridization—Embryos were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. For whole mount in situ hybridization, post-fixed embryos were briefly washed in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated standard phosphate-buffered saline, and dehydrated in serial methanol. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (24Wei L. Roberts W. Wang L. Yamada M. Zhang S. Zhao Z. Rivkess S.A. Schwartz R.J. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2953-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in situ hybridization on sections, fixed embryos were washed in DEPC-treated phosphate-buffered saline and handled as stated above. Sagittal and transverse sections (7 μm) were collected onto PL-100 poly-l-lysine slides (CEL Associates, Inc., Pearland, Texas). Two to three sections were placed on each slide and hybridized with cRNA probes according to Yamada et al. (25Yamada M. Revelli J.P. Eichele G. Barron M. Eichele G. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). cRNA probes were prepared according to the digoxigenin labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Detailed probe information for cardiac α-actin, SRF, ANF, and Nkx2.5 is available upon request. Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and Imaging—Serial transverse sections pre-incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min and then in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2% serum were treated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies were anti-SRF (at 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MHC (MF20) (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), and monoclonal anti-sarcomeric α-actin (at 1:100 dilution; Sigma). After washing, secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Fluorescent-tagged secondary antibodies were applied at 1:200 dilutions (Molecular Probes). After additional washes, the sections were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratory). Images were captured using the Axio imager system and deconvolution microscopy (Zeiss, Inc.). TUNEL Assay—Apoptosis was monitored using a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit ApopTag Plus (Chemicon, Inc.) and detected with fluorescein conjugate. Staining was performed on transverse sections counter-stained for sarcomeric MHC, with MF20 antibodies and for nuclei with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The TUNEL-positive signal from the nuclei in MF20-positive myocytes in sectioned ventricles were quantitated to determine the apoptosis ratio in developing ventricular myocytes. Quantitative and Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR— Embryonic hearts dissected free of other tissues were stored at -80 °C. Embryonic yolk sacs were used to extract DNA for genotyping. Thereafter, four equivalent hearts were pooled together for total RNA extraction using the RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis for GAPDH, SRF, cardiac α-actin, smooth muscle α-actin, skeletal muscle α-actin, ANF, and Nkx2.5 was performed with Taqman probes in an Applied Biosystems Prism 7700. GAPDH served as a loading control. Wild-type controls were given a value of 1.0. Relative expression levels were determined semiquantitatively using two sets of primers against bacterial β-galactosidase: 5′-LACZAFGGCGTTACCCAACTTAATCG-3′, 5′-LACZARACGACGACAGTATCGGCCTC-3′; and 5′-LACZBFGTCGTCCCCTCAAACTGGCAGATGC-3′, 5′-LACZBRTTCGGCGCTCCACAGTTTCGGGTTTTC-3′. Statistical Analysis—RT-PCR and TUNEL data were expressed as mean ± S.D. The Student's t test was applied for data comparison, and the p value was assigned as 0.05 or 0.01 being significant. Direct SRF Targets, α-Actins, and SM22α Are Down-regulated in SRF Null ES Cells—Murine ES cells afforded us a model system to investigate the function of genes involved with the developmental specification of multiple embryonic lineages. Usually within a week, cystic embryoid bodies containing fluid-filled cavities form, and beating myocardia appear in embryoid bodies approximately 2 weeks after initiation of aggregate formation (17Ng W.A. Doetschman T. Robbins J. Lessard J.L. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 41: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Aggregation of SRF null ES cells failed to form embryoid bodies, as previously observed (26Schratt G. Philippar U. Berger J. Schwarz H. Heidenreich O. Nordheim A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the absence of SRF transcripts in SRF null ES cells. A number of genes expressed during embryogenesis were unaffected by the loss of SRF, such as the growth factor morphogens, Tgfβ2, Wnt5a, and BMP4 and the transcription factors Nkx2–5, GATA3, GATA4, GATA5, GATA6, and Smad2. However, we observed reduced transcription of Hhex and the absence of myocardin, both factors important for cardiovascular development. Also, the lack of expression of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle α-actins and SM22α transcripts was consistent with the observation that SRF directs de novo cardiac and smooth muscle gene activity. However, it may be argued that the absence of SRF may still indirectly affect cardiogenesis in ES cells at essential steps during and/or prior to mesoderm specification. Therefore, to understand the biological function of SRF as a presumed regulator of cardiac muscle gene expression, it was important to conditionally ablate the SRF gene in the developing heart, which bypassed stages of early gastrulation. Myocyte-enriched SRF Expression during Cardiogenesis—We then evaluated the expression of SRF by immunofluorescence staining in the hearts of mouse embryos staged at 9.5 dpc (Fig. 2, A–D, SRF red stain) and 10.5 dpc (Fig. 2, E–H, SRF green stain). At 9.5 dpc, SRF was predominantly localized to nuclei in myocytes, as demonstrated by the positive co-staining of SRF with muscle MHC protein with the MF20 antibody. At 10.5 dpc, SRF was detected in atrial and ventricular myocytes. In the trabeculation region, a few non-myocyte-appearing cells had detectable SRF signals. Also, an in situ hybridization assay showed SRF transcripts were expressed at relatively higher levels in myocytes in the myocardium than in the endocardium (Fig. 2I). We recently generated a line of LacZ knock-in mice (SRFLacZ/+) that was used as a reporter gene to follow endogenous SRF gene transcription activity (20Barron M.R. Belaguli N.S. Trinh M. Iyer D. Lough J.W. Parmacek M.S. Bruneau B.G. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11816-11828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These mice were engineered to have the bacterial β-galactosidase coding sequence with a nuclear localization signal inserted into the translation start site of SRF. β-galactosidase staining was performed on SRFLacZ/+ embryos, which reproduced endogenous SRF expression in embryonic muscle tissues (20Barron M.R. Belaguli N.S. Trinh M. Iyer D. Lough J.W. Parmacek M.S. Bruneau B.G. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11816-11828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and in early mesoderm (Fig. 3A). SRFLacZ/+ haploid embryos allowed the expression of the mesoderm marker T(Brachyury), as shown by in situ hybridization in Fig. 3B. The homozygous SRFLacZ/LacZ embryo, generated from a backcross of SRFLacZ/+ to itself, displayed a severe gastrulation defect and lost T(Brachyury) expression at 7.0 dpc (Fig. 3C). Thus, our SRF LacZ knock-in allele appeared equivalent to a SRF null allele, as previously described (16Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Myocyte-specific Recombination Mediated by α-MyHC-Cre—Cardiac myocyte lineage-restricted Cre/LoxP recombination was mediated by α-MyHC-Cre recombinase. To guide our functional analysis and phenotyping, using α-MyHC-Cre mice as the deleter line, Cre recombinase activity was profiled by crossing with R26R reporter mice (27Soriano P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar). As shown, at 8.5 dpc, the earliest discrete X-gal stain was detected in the heart tube prior to looping (8 pairs of somites) (Fig. 4B). By 9.5 dpc (Fig. 4, C–E), enriched X-gal stain was observed in the developing heart, thus indicating specific α-MyHC-Cre-mediated Cre/LoxP recombination in the cardiac myocyte lineage. By 10.5 dpc, fairly uniform staining was observed (Fig. 4, F–H). As shown in cardiac tissue sections at 10.5 dpc, the X-gal stain was restricted to myocytes and not found within the endocardial cushion or the adjacent endothelial lining (Fig. 4, I–K). Poor Heart Development and Pericardial Effusion in SRF Cardiac-conditional Knock-out Embryos (SRFLacZ/LoxP:α-MyHC-Cre)—We assumed that if SRF participates in the developmental expression of direct gene targets, such as the α-actins, then cardiac morphogenesis would be severely affected by cardiac-specific SRF deletion. As shown in the schematic diagram (Fig. 5, top panel), the breeding of SRFLacZ/+:α-MyHC-Cre mice with SRFLoxP/LoxP or SRF+/LoxP mice did not result in the birth of any SRF cardiac CKO mice (SRFLacZ/LoxP:α-MyHC-Cre). All of the other genotypic combinations were present at Mendelian ratios and were able to produce progeny with no obvious phenotypic abnormalities. Genotyping of embryos at various gestational stages recovered mutant embryos and others at the expected ratios at 9.5–10.5 dpc. Beyond 12.5 dpc, no viable mutant embryos were found. Analysis of SRFLacZ/LoxP:α-MyHC-Cre embryos revealed cardiac-restricted developmental defects. SRF cardiac CKO embryos were first discernible at 10.25 dpc by the appearance of dilated pericardial walls (Fig. 5, A and B). At 10.5 dpc, mutant hearts exhibited less constriction in the atrial ventricular canal (Fig. 5, C and D) and poorly developed intraventricular groove (Fig. 5, E and F). At 10.5 dpc, several mutant embryos were arrested at heart-looping stage (not shown), thus suggesting that SRF could alter early morphological movement, given the observed mosaic Cre activity at early stages (Fig. 4B). At 11.5 dpc, SRF cardiac-conditional knock-out embryos lost rhythmic beating and displayed severe pericardial effusion (Fig. 5, G and H). Examination of transverse sections revealed the appearance of a hypoplastic ventricular wall in the mutant. At 10.5 dpc, the breadth of the mutant ventricular wall compact layer was greatly reduced. Furthermore, cellular wall expansion, as shown by trabeculation, was blocked, in comparison with control SRF+/LoxP embryos (Fig. 5, I–L). The intraventricular septation was less developed in the mutant. In the outflow tract region of the mutant heart, endothelium appeared comparable with controls (Fig. 5, I and J). Reduced Cardiac Gene Expression in SRF Cardiac-conditional Knock-out Embryos—In situ hybridization assays were performed on sectioned 10.5 dpc embryos from control (Fig. 6A; a, b, e, f, i, and j under SRFLacZ/LoxP) and from SRF cardiac CKO embryos (Fig. 6A; c, d, g, h, k, and l). Cardiac α-actin gene transcripts were down-regulated in mutant ventricles at 10.25 dpc (data not shown) and 10.5 dpc in comparison to the robust expression found in control sections (Fig. 6A; a and b versus c and d). Down-regulated ANF expression was found in 10.5 dpc mutant hearts (Fig. 6A, e and f versus g and h). No obvious reduction in Nkx2–5 transcription was detected in comparison to controls (Fig. 6A, i and j versus k and l). Significant reduction in SRF (≥95%), ANF (≥80%), and cardiac (≥60%), skeletal (≥90%) and smooth muscle (≥75%) α-actin gene transcripts were observed in the SRF cardiac-conditional knockouts, as assayed by quantitative PCR (Fig. 6B). However, although a recent report suggests that Nkx2–5 might also be an SRF target (19Parlakian A. Tuil D. Hamard G. Tavernier G. Hentzen D. Concordet J.P. Paulin D. Li Z. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), on the basis that we and Miano et al. (18Miano J.M. Ramanan N. Georger M.A. de Mesy Bentley K.L. Emerson R.L. Balza Jr., R.O. Xiao Q. Weiler H. Ginty D.D. Misra R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17132-17137Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) failed to observe a significant decrement in Nkx2–5 transcripts in embryonic cardiac tissue from SRF cardiac-conditional knock-out hearts (Fig. 6, A and B) and in SRF null ES cells (Fig. 1), Nkx2–5 is not a direct target of SRF. SRF, a Stable Cardiac Transcription Factor—Given that α-MyHC-Cre activity could be detected as early as 8.5 dpc (Fig. 4B), X-gal staining reached homogeneity in heart tubes by 9.5 dpc, and our breeding strategy required only one recombination event/cell to disrupt SRF at the genomic level, we were surprised that morphological defects or changes in several SRF direct gene targets were not detected by 9.5 dpc. To examine SRF protein depletion in SRF-conditional knock-out mutant hearts, immunofluorescence staining against SRF was performed on transverse sections of mutant hearts. At 9.75 dpc, in the ventricular wall of an SRF cardiac-conditional knock-out, a fraction of the developing myocytes gave a positive SRF stain in nuclei, whereas some other myocytes had weaker SRF signals compared with a non-primary antibody control (not shown). However, by 10.5 dpc, the vast majority of mutant ventricular chamber myocytes (≥ 90%) were negative for SRF stain (Fig. 6C). This observation suggests that SRF may have a relatively long half-life in embryonic myocytes, as found in fibroblasts of at least 12 h (28Misra R.P. Rivera V.M. Wang J.M. Fan P.D. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Reduction in sarcomeric actin transcripts directed our attention toward the examination of sarcomere organization in the hearts of the SRF cardiac-conditional knock-out embryos. Immunolabeling of sarcomeric αMHC by the MF20 antibody revealed disrupted sarcomere organization in mutant hearts (Fig. 7, A–D) in comparison to striated structures detected both in the trabeculae and ventricular wall regions of the control. Three pairs of mutant and control embryonic hearts examined under laser confocal microscopy agreed well with the electron microscopic observations made by Miano et al. (18Miano J.M. Ramanan N. Georger M.A. de Mesy Bentley K.L. Emerson R.L. Balza Jr., R.O. Xiao Q. Weiler H. Ginty D.D. Misra R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17132-17137Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Elevated Apoptosis in SRF Cardiac-conditional Knock-out Hearts— SRF cardiac-conditional knock-out embryos lost rhythmic beating and were developmentally arrested at ∼10.5–11.5 dpc. Cardiac ventricular walls in these embryos displayed poor trabeculation and thinning of the ventricular compact layer (Figs. 5 and 6), suggesting that SRF might determine the cardiomyocyte number by regulating cell replication and/or cell survival. Because Nordheim and colleagues (29Schratt G. Weinhold B. Lundberg A.S. Schuck S. Berger J. Schwarz H. Weinberg R.A. Ruther U. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) show that the SRF null mutation does not effect cell replication in ES cells, we asked whether loss of SRF could affect cardiomyocyte survival. TUNEL assays were performed to evaluate apoptosis."

In this paper we describe the molecular characterization of a member of the Jumonji domain 2 (JMJD2) family of proteins, and demonstrate its binding to both class I HDACs and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). JMJD2 proteins are characterized by the presence of two leukemia-associated protein/plant homeodomain (LAP/PHD) zinc fingers, one JmjN, one JmjC (containing an internal retinoblastoma-binding protein 2 (RBBP2)-like sequence), and two Tudor domains. The first member of this group, JMJD2A, is widely expressed in human tissues and cell lines, and high endogenous expression of JMJD2A mRNA was found in several cell types, including human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1)-infected cell lines. JMJD2A and JMJD2B exhibit cell type-specific responses to the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. We show that the JMJD2A protein associates in vivo with pRb and class I HDACs, and mediates repression of E2F-regulated promoters. In HTLV-1 virus-infected cells, we find that JMJD2A binds to the viral Tax protein. Antibodies to JMJD2A recognize the native protein but also a half-sized protein fragment, the latter up-regulated in THP-1 cells during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The ability of JMJD2A to associate with pRb and HDACs and potentiate pRb-mediated repression of E2F-regulated promoters implies an important role for this protein in cell proliferation and oncogenesis.

The tight confines of chromatin have necessitated the evolution of specialized chromatin remodeling complexes to achieve appropriate regulation of gene expression within the mammalian cell. One such mechanism that has recently been elucidated involves the acetylation of the histone tails within the nucleosome. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; LAP, leukemia-associated protein; PHD, plant homeodomain; aa, amino acid(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcriptase; RPA, RNase protection assay; AD, activation domain; TK, thymidine kinase; TSA, trichostatin A; HTLV-1, human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1; RBBP, retinoblastoma-binding protein. family of proteins is involved with removing such modifications, and its members have been subgrouped into three classes depending upon their similarity to yeast proteins (1.Gray S.G. Ekström T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 2.Gray S.G. Teh B.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 401-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since the isolation of the first HDAC many members of this family have been identified, currently consisting of at least 18 members (1.Gray S.G. Ekström T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 2.Gray S.G. Teh B.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 401-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3.Gao L. Cueto M.A. Asselbergs F. Atadja P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25748-25755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Critical roles for these proteins have been identified in many aspects of cell function. The product of the retinoblastoma gene, pRb, has been shown to have multiple roles in cellular processes, including regulation of apoptosis and the cell cycle (4.Liu H. Dibling B. Spike B. Dirlam A. Macleod K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). pRb interacts with E2F family transcription factors and blocks their activity during the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. E2F proteins activate the expression of many genes involved in cell cycle progression, including cyclins A and E, as well as other proteins and enzymes required for DNA replication (5.Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Binding sites for E2F are found in the promoters of genes whose expression occurs at the G1/S transition, and repression of the promoters containing E2F-binding sites has been shown to involve binding of E2F/pRb pocket protein complexes to these sites. Previous studies have identified two distinct, although not mutually exclusive, mechanisms for the transcription repression function of pRb (5.Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 6.Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E65-E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 7.Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). The first mechanism involves the direct interaction of pRb with the E2F transactivation domain, resulting in masking of this domain and blocking its ability to stimulate transcription (8.Ross J.F. Liu X. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The second mechanism is based on the ability of pRb to recruit chromatin remodeling proteins, such as HDACs, and assemble transcription repression complexes at E2F-regulated promoters (9.Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10.Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S.

A separate series of experiments demonstrated that RBBP1, a known pRb interacting protein, acts as a bridge to recruit HDACs 1–3 to pRb-E2F complexes (13.Lai A. Lee J.M. Yang W.M. DeCaprio J.A.

The JMJD2 family of proteins has recently been identified in silico (15.Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 1623-1628PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe the molecular characterization of JMJD2A, a nuclear and cytoplasmic member of this family that participates as a pRb-HDAC complex component. JMJD2A contains two LAP/PHD (leukemia-associated protein/plant homeodomain) zinc fingers, one JmjN, one JmjC (containing an internal RBBP2-like sequence), and two Tudor domains, and promotes histone deacetylation and gene repression in vivo, through its association with HDACs and pRb. Multiple truncated fragments of JMJD2A bind pRb, suggesting that the pRb A/B pocket is not the only interaction site. JMJD2A also binds the viral protein Tax in HTLV-1-infected cells. The property of JMJD2A to both associate with pRb/HDACs and Tax and to mediate transcriptional repression suggests an important role for this protein in cell proliferation and transformation, and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of pRb function. Library Screening and Plasmid Construction—A human fetal liver λgt11 cDNA library (Clontech number HL1064b) was screened under low stringency conditions, using as a probe a DNA fragment corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of human Sp1, as described previously (16.Ladias J.A.A.

The PCR products were first cloned into pCR II (Invitrogen), from which JMJD2A was isolated using HindIII/SalI and cloned into similarly digested EYFP-N1 (Clontech). The construct was sequenced to verify that the fusion was in-frame.

Protein sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/multi-align/multi-align.html), and the conserved residues obtained from this analysis were highlighted using BOXSHADE (www.ch.embnet.org/software/Box_form.html). Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the MEGA 3 software package (www.megasoftware.net) (20.Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief Bioinform. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10656) Google Scholar). Structurally conserved elements were identified using SMART (smart.embl.de) (21.Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S.

Zinc Binding Assay—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter, denatured with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 30 min, followed by three washes in metal binding buffer A (100 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) for 1 h with three buffer changes. Subsequently, the blot was probed with 50 μCi of 65ZnCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 20 ml of buffer A for 1 h, washed three times with buffer A, rinsed with deionized H2O, and autoradiographed for 16 h at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. After autoradiography, the filter was stained with 0.1% Amido Black (Sigma) in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid for protein visualization. Cell Cultures and Treatment—Hep3B, ACHN, HeLa, U2OS, Saos-2, and 293 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/100 μg/ml of penicillin/streptomycin. HT1376 bladder carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/100 μg/ml of penicillin/streptomycin. Saos-2 cells were supplemented with l-glutamine (BioWhittaker). T-cell clones were stimulated with the polyclonal activator phytohemagglutinin (1 μg/ml) and irradiated feeders for continuous growth. All cells were plated on sterile Petri dishes or 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C with 6% CO2 and 96% humidity. Human myeloid leukemia THP-1 cells, Epstein-Barr virus lymphoblasts, HUT102, and C81 cells were grown in complete medium (RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/100 μg/ml of penicillin/streptomycin). Complete medium plus interleukin-2-containing T-Stim (Collaborative Biomedical Products) was used for T-cell clone cultures. Trichostatin A was purchased from Upstate Biochemicals, dissolved in Me2SO, and cells were treated as previously described (22.Gray S.G. Ekström T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections—THP-1 cells were transfected by electroporation as reported previously (23.Dangond F. Hafler D.A. Tong J.K. Randall J. Kojima R. Utku N. Gullans S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and other cells were transfected with various amounts of effector plasmids, 1.7 μg of luciferase reporter and 1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, as described previously (17.Green V.J. Kokkotou E. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29950-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 293 cells used for the mammalian two-hybrid assay were transfected by lipofection with the Lipofectamine Plus kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid pcDNA3 was used as filler DNA to balance the amount of transfected DNA in all experiments. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured in the lysates, as described (17.Green V.J. Kokkotou E. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29950-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transfections performed in triplicate are presented as a mean ± S.E. For fluorescent protein analysis HEK-293T cells were transfected using FuGENE (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pBluescript II SK(-) (Stratagene) was used as filler DNA. EYFP fluorescence was monitored 48 h post-transfection. For E2F promoter construct luciferase assay, 293 cells were trypsinized and plated in 24-well plates at a final concentration of 5 × 105 cells per well in 2 ml of medium, 24 h prior to transfection. Using the FuGENE 6 (Roche) transfection reagent, cells were transfected with the following various concentrations of effector plasmids, 1.0 μg of JPTR1, 0.5 μg of pRb, 0.7 μg of dihydrofolate reductase luciferase reporter, and 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-Gal. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and levels of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured using the Dual Light System (Applied Biosystem), a chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system for the combined detection of luciferase and β-galactosidase. Antibody Generation, Immunocytochemistry, and Western Blot Analyses—Rabbit anti-JMJD2A and -JMJD2B were raised using the following synthetic peptides: JMJD2A, TEKEVKQEKKRQ; and JMJD2B, STFSKLKMEIK. Immunocytochemistry with these antibodies was then performed on rat brain tissues (medulla and pons). Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were transcardially perfused with 4% para-formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, and the brain dissected out. Fifty-μm thick frozen sections were taken from brains for subsequent immunocytochemical analysis. The procedure for immunocytochemistry has been described elsewhere (24.Koibuchi N. Gibbs R.B. Suzuki M. Pfaff D.W. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3208-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and immunoreactivity was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. For Western blot analysis, cells were harvested, washed, and lysed in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) by rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. Following centrifugation, the whole cell extracts were removed and stored at -80 °C prior to use. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis using precast a 4–20% gradient Tris glycine gel (NOVEX, San Diego, CA), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to JMJD2A at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h, then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) at a dilution of 1:10,000. α-FLAG and α-HA antibodies were also used. The bands were visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposing to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR from Multiple Cell Lines—Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). RNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (Sigma)-treated water, and its concentration and purity were determined using OD 260/280 (Carey 64 UV Spectrophotometer). RNA (1 μg) was used in a cDNA synthesis reaction using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with Retroscript Kit reagents (Ambion, Austin, TX) for RT-PCR analysis. Following the manufacturer's protocol, RNA was incubated with 5 μl of oligo(dT) primer (Ambion) at 70 °C for 10 min. RNA was transferred to ice, the Superscript II mixture was added, and cDNA synthesis was allowed to occur at 42 °C for 1 h in the presence of ∼20 units of RNasin (Promega). Three μl of cDNA were used in 50 μl of PCR using recombinant Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) at 0.25 units/sample. One μl of 10 mm dNTP mixture (Invitrogen) per sample was used for each reaction. PCR was performed for JMJD2A, HDAC3, and β-actin. Specific primers were as follows: JMJD2A, forward, 5′-AATCGGATCCATGGCTTCTGAGTCTGAAACTC-3′, reverse, 5′-AGCTGGGCCCGGATCCTCTTGAGTCACCTTGTCAAA-3′; HDAC3, forward, 5′-CGCCGGCACCATGGCCAAGA-3′, reverse, 5′-GCTGGGTTGCTCCTTGCAGA-3′; β-actin, 5′-AACCCCAAGGCCAACCGCGAGAAGATGACC-3′, reverse, 5′-GGTGATGACCTGGCCGTCAGGAGCTCGTA-3′. The JMJD2A primers yield a 790-base product, which spans nucleotides (1–790), and includes the JmjN and most of the JmjC domains. The HDAC3 primers yield a PCR product of 427 bases. The β-actin primers yield a PCR product of 406 bases. PCR conditions were as follows: for JMJD2A, denaturing was performed at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 62 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min; for HDAC3, denaturing was done at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 68 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min; for β-actin, denaturing was done at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 68 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. Following 35 PCR cycles, all samples were allowed to extend at 72 °C for 10 min. All PCR were performed in a model PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA). Twenty μl of each of the PCR products were electrophoresed in 1% agarose (Invitrogen) gels. The gels were then stained with ethidium bromide, placed on a UV transilluminator, and photographed. Northern Blot Analysis—Human multiple tissue and tumor cell line Northern blots (Clontech numbers 7760-1 and 7757-1, respectively) were probed with a radiolabeled DNA fragment corresponding to JMJD2A residues 661–1064, at 42 °C for 16 h. The blots were washed twice with 1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, followed by 0.5× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. After autoradiography, the probe was removed, and hybridization was repeated using a β-actin probe (Clontech). RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerases (Invitrogen) were used to make antisense probes from the following templates according to the protocol provided in the RPA II kit (Ambion). When incorporating radioactivity into the probe, radioactive [32P]UTP with a specific activity of 800 Ci/mmol was used. Cold UTP was added such that the final UTP specific activity was 80 Ci/mmol for the β-actin probe and 400 Ci/mmol for the others. The β-actin probe used in this study is commercially available (Ambion). The probes used to measure JMJD2A and JMJD2B were prepared as follows. To measure JMJD2A expression, a 300-base pair fragment was amplified from full-length JMJD2A cDNA (nucleotides 1375–1675) using the amplification conditions as described above and the following primers: JMJD2A RPA forward, 5′-CCACTGAAGTCAAATTTGAAGAGC-3′; JMJD2A RPA reverse, 5′-GCTCTCCCACAGTGACCCTGCC-3′. The PCR amplification product was isolated from agarose using a Qiaex II Gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into pCRII using TOPO TA cloning (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid could be linearized using EcoRV, and an appropriate antisense probe generated using Sp6 RNA polymerase of which 300 bases hybridize specifically to JMJD2A RNA. This region spans amino acids 459–558, between the JmJC and PHD domains of JMJD2A. JMJD2B expression was measured using a 351-bp EcoRI/XbaI fragment of JMJD2B cDNA cloned into the same sites of pGem3zf(+) (Promega). This region spans nucleotides 3582–3933 of the full-length JMJD2B mRNA and lies within the 3′-untranslated region. Following linearization with EcoRI, Sp6 RNA polymerase was used to transcribe probe. Both plasmid templates described were sequence verified to confirm the veracity of the cloned insert. Quantification of the RPA results was obtained using a BAS-100 phosphorimager (Fuji). The levels of β-actin mRNA were utilized as the internal control in each case. The values for each experimental gene examined were normalized to the internal control for each sample. Mammalian Two-hybrid Analysis—-Protein-protein interactions in vivo were detected using the mammalian two-hybrid system (Stratagene number 211344) in 293 cells. In this assay, a gene encoding a protein of interest (protein X) was fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast protein GAL4, whereas another gene suspected of interacting with protein X (protein Y) was fused to the transcriptional activation domain of the mouse protein NF-κB. If protein X and protein Y interact, they create a functional transcription activator by bringing the activation domain into close proximity with the DNA-binding domain; this can be detected by expression from a luciferase reporter gene under control of a promoter with GAL4-binding sites. Various JMJD2A cDNA fragments were cloned into the pCMV-AD vector (Stratagene), to produce JMJD2A fused to the NF-κB activation domain (AD). These constructs (0.1 μg) were used in calcium phosphate-based cotransfection experiments with the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (1.7 μg, Stratagene), which contains a synthetic promoter with five GAL4-binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene, along with control activation domain constructs pAD-SV40T and pAD-TRAF, and binding domain constructs pBD-Rb and control pBD-p53 (0.1 μg each; all from Stratagene). Luciferase activity was then measured in cell extracts. The full-length cDNA and fragments of JPTR1 used in the mammalian two-hybrid experiments described within were derived by PCR, and the primer sets incorporated a BamHI restriction site for cloning purposes and were as follows: full-length (aa 1–1064), forward 5′-AATCGGATCCATGGCTTCTGAGTCTGAAACTC-3′, reverse, 5′-AATCGATCCCTACTCCATGATGGCCCGTTATAG-3′. Fragments Thr-660 (aa 1–660 containing the JmjN and JmjC domains), and Met-867 (aa 1–867 containing the JmjN, JmjC, and PHD domains) used the same forward primer from the full-length oligo pair but had the following reverse primers: 5′-AATCGGATCCGGTCTCATTGAATTCCTTCTCA-3′ (Thr-660) and 5′-AATCGGATCCCATCACACCGGCAGCCTGGGCGCAG-3′ (Met-867). Fragments Met-661 (aa 661–1064 containing the PHD and Tudor domains) and Met-868 (aa 868–1064 containing only the Tudor domains) use the reverse primer from the full-length oligo pair but have the following forward primers: 5′-AATCGGATCCATGGCCCAACAGGCCCCTCA-3′ (Met-661) and 5′-AATCGGATCCATGCAGCCTGACGACTGGCCT-3′ (Met-868). The amino acid prior to the numbers indicate at which each fragment starts and the numbers indicate the position of this amino acid in relation to the full-length protein. The conditions used to amplify these fragments were as follows: ∼100 ng of template (full-length JMJD2A cDNA plasmid) was combined with 0.5 μm of each primer in the presence of 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase with the supplied buffer (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 50 μl. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were extracted once with phenol-chloroform, precipitated, and then subsequently digested with BamHI. Following digestion the fragments were run into 1% agarose, and the bands were isolated and purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Following purification the fragments were subsequently ligated into pCMV-AD (Stratagene) for the mammalian two-hybrid assay (used against Rb-GAL4 from W. Kaelin), and transformed into E. coli. Immunoprecipitation—Thirty-six hours post-transfection, HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. The cells were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant by overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-human pRb G3-245 (BD Pharmingen), anti-His (Invitrogen), anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-mSin3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HDAC1 (Affinity Bioreagents), anti-HDAC3 (Affinity Bioreagents), or M2 anti-FLAG antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered on protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology), washed three times for 5 min at room temperature with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins. For enzyme activity assays, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—HeLa cells were transfected with 5 μg of UAS-TK-Luc (25.Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), and 15 μg of the GAL4-VP16-JMJD2A (aa 661–1064) or the parent expression-only GAL4-VP16 control, using the calcium-phosphate method. After 36 h, histones were cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde directly to culture medium to a final concentration of 1%, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with mild shaking. Cells were harvested and suspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitors. After sonication and dilution of lysates, half of the lysate amount was saved for a no-antibody control, whereas the remaining was incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-acetyl-histone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology number 06-599). Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected using salmon sperm DNA/protein-agarose. Precipitants were washed, and the immune complex was eluted by adding 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Subsequently, 20 μl of 5 m NaCl was added to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking at 65 °C for 4 h. Following incubation with proteinase K, 0.5 m EDTA, and 1 m Tris-HCl, DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated. Pellets were suspended in wat"

The objective of this study was to determine whether superoxide derived from endothelial cell-associated NADPH oxidase mediates the leukocyte-endothelial (L/E) and platelet-endothelial cell (P/E) adhesion that is observed in the cerebral microvasculature of sickle cell transgenic (betaS) mice. Intravital fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor L/E and P/E adhesion in brain postcapillary venules of wild-type (WT), SOD1 transgenic (SOD1-TgN), and gp91phox (NADPH oxidase)-deficient mice that were transplanted with bone marrow from betaS mice. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) yielded intense P/E and L/E adhesion responses in cerebral venules of betaS/WT chimeras that were significantly attenuated in both betaS/SOD1-TgN, and betaS/gp91phox-/- chimeras. Pretreatment of betaS/WT chimeras with the iron-chelator desferroxamine blunted the blood cell-endothelial cell adhesion responses to H/R, whereas pretreatment with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol had no effect. These findings suggest that superoxide derived from endothelial cell NADPH-oxidase and catalytically active iron contribute to the proinflammatory and prothrombogenic responses associated with sickle cell disease."

https://openalex.org/W2096490096,"Peg3 encodes a C2H2 type zinc finger protein that is implicated in a novel physiological pathway regulating core body temperature, feeding behavior, and obesity in mice. Peg3+/- mutant mice develop an excess of abdominal, subcutaneous, and intra-scapular fat, despite a lifetime of lower food intake than wild-type animals. However, they start life with reduced fat reserves and are slower to enter puberty. These mice maintain a lower core body temperature, fail to respond to a cold challenge, and have lower metabolic activity as measured by oxygen consumption. Plasma leptin levels are significantly higher than in wild types, and Peg3+/- mice appear to have developed leptin resistance. Administration of exogenous leptin resulted in a significant reduction in food intake in wild-type mice that was not observed in Peg3+/- mutants. This mutation, which is strongly expressed in hypothalamic tissue during development, has the capacity to regulate multiple events relating to energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1984617386,"The ric-3 gene is required for maturation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in Caenorhabditis elegans. The human homolog of RIC-3, hRIC-3, enhances expression of α7 nicotinic receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes, whereas it totally abolishes expression of α4β2 nicotinic and 5-HT3 serotonergic receptors. Both the N-terminal region of hRIC-3, which contains two transmembrane segments, and the C-terminal region are needed for these differential effects. hRIC-3 inhibits receptor expression by hindering export of mature receptors to the cell membrane. By using chimeric proteins made of α7 and 5-HT3 receptors, we have shown that the presence of an extracellular isoleucine close to the first transmembrane receptor fragment is responsible for the transport arrest induced by hRIC-3. Enhancement of α7 receptor expression occurs, at least, at two levels: by increasing the number of mature receptors and facilitating its transport to the membrane. Certain amino acids of a putative amphipathic helix present at the large cytoplasmic region of the α7 subunit are required for these actions.

Neurotransmitter-gated receptors constitute a gene superfamily of membrane proteins that mediate fast transmission in the nervous system.

Receptors are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the cell surface through a process that may be of central importance in regulating the efficacy of synaptic transmission (3Kneussel M.

Yassin L. Margalit E. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Moreover, the human homolog, hRIC-3, shows differential effects when co-expressed with several ligand-gated receptors (11Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, hRIC-3 enhances surface expression and currents of α7 nAChRs, whereas it inhibits currents produced by other nAChRs subtypes (α4β2 and α3β4) and by 5-HT3 serotonin receptors (5-HT3Rs). These opposite effects suggested that the hRIC-3 protein might play a key role in the biogenesis of some ligand-gated receptors and prompted us to investigate how and where it performs its action. Here we show that both the N-terminal region of hRIC-3, which contains two transmembrane segments, and the C-terminal region are needed for its action. The hRIC-3 protein acts as a barrier for some receptors such as α4β2 nAChRs and 5-HT3Rs, stopping the traffic of mature receptors to the membrane. By contrast, the inefficient transport of α7 nAChRs is enhanced by hRIC-3 in a process in which certain amino acids at the amphipathic helix located at the C-terminal region of the large cytoplasmic domain are involved. Thus, hRIC-3 plays a dual role in modulating trafficking of some ligand-gated ion channels. Plasmid Constructions—Truncated constructs of hRIC-3 were obtained by deletions produced by restriction digests of the human hRIC-3 cDNA (11Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fusion of hRIC-3, α7, and β2 nAChR subunits to green fluorescent protein (GFP) were obtained by inserting the corresponding cDNAs into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Maintenance of the appropriate reading frame and suppression of stop codons were achieved by ligating suitable double-stranded oligonucleotides. The C-terminal fusion of hRIC-3 to red fluorescent protein (RFP) was obtained by carrying the hRIC-3 cDNA directly from pEGFP-N1 to pDsRed1-N1 (Clontech), because both vectors have identical polylinker regions and reading frames. Nicotinic-serotonergic chimeric proteins were obtained by PCR, using as starting construct the V201 chimera, kindly provided by Dr. K. T. Dineley. Mutants of the amphipathic helix of the rat α7 nAChR subunit were generated by using annealed single-stranded oligonucleotides with the desired sequences and proper single strand ends that could be ligated easily to the ends generated by restriction enzymes present in previous constructs (12Valor L.M.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), α7-5-HT3R chimeras, and hRIC-3 and its truncated forms were inserted into the pSP64T vector (16Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) or a derivative thereof. Capped mRNA was synthesized in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase and the mMESSAGEmMACHINE kit (Ambion). Defoliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 10 ng of total subunit cRNA and 5 ng of hRIC-3 cRNA in 50 nl of sterile water. The final concentrations of subunits cRNAs were kept constant between injections with or without hRIC-3 for each experiment. All experiments were performed within 3 days after cRNA injection. Specific surface expression of 125I-α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt) binding sites was tested with 5 nm 125I-α-Bgt as described (17García-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were incubated for 2 h at 18 °C. At the end of the incubation, unbound 125I-α-Bgt was removed, oocytes were washed, and bound radioactivity was counted. Binding to internal and external sites was obtained by carrying out the incubations in the presence of 0.1% saponin. Nonspecific binding was determined using noninoculated oocytes in the same conditions. Electrophysiological recordings were done as described previously (17García-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Functional expression of each construct was estimated as the peak ionic current evoked by a 1-s application of 1 mm ACh at -80 mV, and no correction for desensitization was made. Errors are standard error of means. For sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis of V201 receptors, oocytes were labeled with 125I-α-Bgt as described above and homogenized in lysis buffer (1.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation for 2 × 10 min in a Microfuge, and the cleared lysate was layered onto 11-ml sucrose gradients (5-20%). After sedimentation (37,000 rpm, Beckman SW41Ti rotor) at 4 °C for 18 h, 300-μl aliquots were collected, and their radioactivity and refractive index were measured. For Western blots, oocytes were lysed and proteins separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After the transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 30 min at 20 °C with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated with an anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% dry milk for 1 h. After incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, the bands were visualized by a chromogenic reaction (Sigma Fast, nitro blue tetrazolium, Sigma). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS cells were grown in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids used in the transfections were purified by Concert columns (Invitrogen). Cells (4 × 104) on 3.5-cm-diameter plates were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as indicated by the manufacturer, using a total of 1.5 μg of DNA (ratio of hRIC-3 to receptor was 1:1). The density of α-Bgt binding sites was determined as described previously (18Campos-Caro A. Carrasco-Serrano C. Valor L.M. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy Studies of the Cellular Distribution of hRIC-3 and nAChRs—Direct observation of proteins fused to GFP or RFP was performed with an Olympus Fluoview FV300 confocal laser system mounted in a BX-50 WI upright microscope incorporating a 100× LUMPlan FI water immersion objective. This system allows for z axis reconstruction with a theoretical z-slice ∼0.5 μm thick and sequential mode studies in double labeling experiments. Analysis of fluorescent images was performed using the public domain program ImageJ with Plugins for region of interest measurement, image average, comparison of multiple channel images, and co-localization studies. Staining of the ER and the Golgi apparatus was carried out with 100 nm 3,3′-dipentyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC5(3)) and Bodipy TR ceramide (BTC) (1 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes), respectively. Cells transfected with hRIC-3 were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with any of the two markers before visualization. The hRIC-3 Protein Is Present at the ER and the Golgi Apparatus—The first transmembrane segment of hRIC-3 is adjacent to the N terminus and could play the role of a leader peptide. A prediction program (19Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the first 50 amino acids of the hRIC-3 protein. For the sake of comparison we also analyzed the N-terminal regions of the rat α7 nAChR and the mouse 5-HT3R, which have well defined leader peptides. Results were similar in the three cases (see Fig. 1A, where only the first 30 amino acids of each protein are shown as the rest have a score close to zero), suggesting that hRIC-3 is synthesized in the ER and might be addressed to the ER and/or some other organelle along the secretory pathway, thus facilitating the encounter with ion channels subunits, which transit the same route. In fact, hRIC-3 exhibited an intracellular localization when transfected into different cell lines. We studied its localization in more detail by using confocal microscopy of a transfected hRIC-3 fused to either RFP or GFP together with DiOC5(3) or BTC, which are specific markers for the ER (20Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and the Golgi apparatus (21Terasaki M. Chen L.B. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), respectively. When hRIC-3-RFP (Fig. 1B) was used in combination with DiOC5(3) (Fig. 1C), partial co-localization of both markers at the ER was observed (Fig. 1D). DiOC5(3) labeling was more extensive, whereas hRIC-3-RFP expression was restricted to only a fraction of the areas labeled by DiOC5(3). The presence of hRIC-3-GFP at the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1E) was evidenced by its co-localization (Fig. 1G) with BTC (Fig. 1F). The detection of the hRIC-3 protein at intracellular membranes is in accordance with previous results obtained in C. elegans that located it within the cell bodies (10Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Margalit E. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and suggests that this protein may be involved in the membrane trafficking of nAChRs. Regions of hRIC-3 That Are Required for Its Function—To determine which regions of hRIC-3 are required for its action, we co-expressed several versions of this protein together with different ligand-gated receptors and compared their effects on receptor expression (Fig. 2). As shown previously (11Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the whole hRIC-3 protein (construct 1-369) totally inhibited the expression of mouse 5-HT3Rs and human α4β2 nAChRs. Deletion of 166 amino acids from the C-terminal region of hRIC-3 (construct 1-203) did not significantly affect the observed inhibition. By contrast, the additional deletion of 78 amino acids (construct 1-125) abolished the inhibition, and receptor levels were similar to the ones observed in the absence of hRIC-3. Given the apparent inhibitory effect of the deleted domain, we tested another protein in which only the C-terminal region was present (construct 134-369). Again, no inhibition of receptor expression was observed, suggesting that the N-terminal region that contains the transmembrane segments of hRIC-3 and the loop between them might be required for hRIC-3 action. However, deletion of this loop (construct Δ37-90) did not abolish the inhibition observed with constructs 1-369 and 1-203, and the same happened when a coiled-coil domain present at the C-terminal region was also deleted (construct Δ137-163). Therefore, these hRIC-3 regions are not needed for the inhibition of receptor expression. We have shown previously that the presence of hRIC-3 enhances the expression of human α7 nAChRs, as judged by the currents evoked by ACh and the binding sites for α-Bgt detected at the oocyte membrane (11Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The hRIC-3 constructs (Fig. 2) were also co-expressed with human α7 nAChRs. The truncated construct 1-203 increased α7 nAChR expression, although to a lesser extent than the whole hRIC-3 protein. However, no increase was observed with the constructs that include either the C-terminal (construct 134-369) or the N-terminal (construct 1-125) regions. Interestingly, when the loop between the transmembrane fragments was deleted (Δ37-90) no activation was observed, suggesting that the loop is necessary for activation. By contrast, activation was still observed when the coiled-coil domain was eliminated (Δ137-163). An initial approach to determining which region of the receptor subunits might be relevant for the hRIC-3 action consisted of co-injecting the hRIC-3 constructs mentioned above with a chimeric protein made of the extracellular N-terminal region of the rat α7 nAChR until Val201 and the C-terminal region of the mouse 5-HT3R, which includes the four transmembrane segments and the large cytoplasmic loop (22Eisele J.L. Betrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). As shown previously by others (22Eisele J.L. Betrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), this so-called V201 chimera produced receptors that were activated by ACh and able to bind α-Bgt. The behavior of V201 with the hRIC-3 constructs was similar to that observed with the 5-HT3R (Fig. 2); thus, the whole hRIC-3 protein, its truncated version 1-203, and the deletions Δ37-90 and Δ136-163 inhibited receptor expression, whereas the N-terminal and C-terminal regions had no effect when acting individually (constructs 1-125 and 134-369, respectively). In no case was receptor expression increased, as happened with α7 nAChRs, so it can be concluded that the observed inhibitory effects of hRIC-3 were due to the presence in V201 receptors of the C-terminal moiety contributed by the 5-HT3R. hRIC-3 Protein Inhibits Receptor Expression by Preventing Export of Mature Receptors to the Membrane—To determine at which step hRIC-3 acts when inhibiting receptor expression, we used the V201 chimera, because its capacity to bind 125I-α-Bgt facilitates follow-up of the receptor fate. Thus, we asked whether the inhibitory effect of hRIC-3 takes place on receptors that have been synthesized and are mature enough for export to the membrane. In this case they should be able to bind α-Bgt and show the typical pentameric form. To test for this possibility, we performed binding in the absence or presence of 0.1% saponin and compared the amount of receptors present at the oocyte surface and at internal sites. In addition, we analyzed the oligomeric state of the receptors. As shown in Fig. 3A,inthe absence of hRIC-3 most of the V201 receptors are exported to the external membrane. By contrast, only a small fraction of V201 reached the membrane when hRIC-3 was present. Notice that in the presence of hRIC-3 the total amount of V201 was almost as high as in its absence, suggesting that a large population of receptors remained stable inside the oocytes without suffering substantial degradation, despite being unable to reach the external membrane. Sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments revealed that surface V201 receptors expressed in the absence of hRIC-3 migrated as the typical 9 S pentamer (Fig. 3B, V201 External) and their sedimentation profile was indistinguishable when 0.1% saponin was present (Fig. 3B, V201 Total; that includes external and internally located receptors, although the latter are only a very minor component). Most receptors resulting from the presence of hRIC-3 are located intracellularly and also show the same sedimentation behavior (Fig. 3B, V201+hRIC-3 Total), suggesting that hRIC-3 arrests the transport of mature receptors to the membrane. hRIC-3 Protein Enhances Receptor Expression by Acting at Two Different Steps of Receptor Biogenesis—α-Bgt binding experiments in the presence of saponin were also performed with rat α7 nAChRs, in which expression is strongly enhanced by hRIC-3. When hRIC-3 was absent, only a small percentage of the total mature receptors (12.6%) was able to reach the oocyte membrane (Fig. 4). By contrast, in the presence of hRIC-3 almost half of the total number of receptors was transported to the external membrane. Moreover, in this case the total number of receptors increased about 5-fold, suggesting that hRIC-3 acts on α7 nAChRs at two different steps: one related to facilitation of receptor synthesis (or inhibition of receptor degradation) and the other to expedite receptor transport. A further experiment, independent of α-Bgt binding, validated the previous results. For this purpose a Western blot of α7 nAChRs fused to GFP and expressed in oocytes was probed with an anti-GFP antiserum to show that the total amount of α7 subunits did also increase in the presence of hRIC-3 (see Fig. 4, inset). Another experimental approach based on confocal microscopy observations of COS cells co-transfected with hRIC-3 and nAChRs confirmed the latter results (Fig. 5). Localization of these proteins was possible by attaching RFP to the C terminus of hRIC-3 and GFP to the C termini of β2 and α7 nAChR subunits. The fusion of GFP did not significantly affect the function of the resultant α4β2 and α7 nAChRs when they were expressed in oocytes (results not shown). Cells transfected with only α4 and β2-GFP subunits showed a broad distribution of fluorescence (Fig. 5A), suggestive of receptors being synthesized and transported to the membrane. However, in the presence of hRIC-3, receptors were present as aggregates inside the cells (Fig. 5B), and the same was true for hRIC-3 (Fig. 5C), so that both proteins co-localized (Fig. 5D). These results would explain why α4β2 receptors are not detected at the oocyte membrane in the presence of hRIC-3 (Fig. 2), confirming what was observed with the V201 chimera (Fig. 3A), that transport of receptors is prevented by hRIC-3. Moreover, the co-localization of both proteins suggests that this impairing action is the consequence of a lasting and close association of hRIC-3 and α4β2 nAChRs, which could be direct or indirect through some other protein. Cells transfected with only α7-GFP nAChRs showed a general distribution of fluorescence (Fig. 5E), probably at internal sites, because α7 receptors were not detected at the plasma membrane by α-Bgt binding experiments. In the presence of hRIC-3 this pattern was not strongly modified (Fig. 5F), although some aggregates were observed, and in general, labeling was stronger. hRIC-3 labeling (Fig. 5G) only coincided with α7 receptor labeling in some places (Fig. 5H) and did not show the exact match observed with α4β2 receptors. It is possible that, in contrast to α4β2 receptors, α7 receptors interact transiently with hRIC-3 receptors, so that their transport to the cell membrane is facilitated. In fact, in the presence of hRIC-3 a significant number of binding sites for α-Bgt were detected at the cell membrane (not shown), confirming previous results (23Williams M.E. Burton B. Urrutia A. Shcherbatko A. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Cohen C.J. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A Single Amino Acid at the Extracellular Side Close to M1 Is Responsible for the Inhibition Produced by hRIC-3—The fact that V201 is expressed at relatively high levels in mammalian cells gave us the opportunity to study the effect of hRIC-3 in an expression system different from the oocyte system. Moreover, we tried to approach the question of which receptor domain would be involved in the hRIC-3-mediated inhibition. Although α4β2 nAChRs are also inhibited by hRIC-3 (Fig. 2), the use of V201 was more advantageous because its homomeric nature would simplify the production and analysis of mutants and also because receptor expression could be followed easily by α-Bgt binding. Expression of V201 receptors at the membrane of transfected COS cells was inhibited in the presence of hRIC-3 (Fig. 6) as observed previously in oocytes. We then tried a construction called N213, which extended the α7 sequence 12 more amino acids to the C terminus. No inhibition of hRIC-3 was observed in this case (Fig. 6), and the same happened with two other constructions (T207 and T202), so that we concluded that the presence of a threonine at position 202 instead of the isoleucine present in V201 is sufficient to abolish hRIC-3 inhibition. To confirm this result in a wild-type receptor, the same substitution of isoleucine by threonine was made in 5-HT3Rs. However, no expression of this mutant was detected, thus precluding study of the possible effect of hRIC-3. Amino Acids Involved in Activation of nAChR α7 Expression—Although constructs T202, T207, and N213 were not inhibited by hRIC-3 (Fig. 6), they did not have the same behavior as the α7 subunit, in which expression is strongly increased by hRIC-3, suggesting that this effect is localized in a different receptor domain that is present in α7 but not in these constructs, i.e. in a region between Asn213 and the C terminus. We hypothesized whether a direct or indirect interaction between hRIC-3 and a putative amphipathic helix (24Finer-Moore J. Stroud R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 25Le Novère N. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2329-2345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) within the C-terminal region of the large cytoplasmic loop of the receptor would be possible, because these motifs are often involved in both intra- and intermolecular protein-protein interactions (26Petros A.M. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 27Lester L.B. Scott J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 409-430PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, within this helix we observed the sequence 424RFR426, which is reminiscent of the ER retention/retrieval motifs RKR of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (28Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) and RXR(R) of GABAB receptors (29Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis were true, one would expect that mutants of the α7 subunit amphipathic helix might have a different behavior than the wild-type α7 subunit in regard to the enhancement of expression induced by hRIC-3. Moreover, this behavior might depend on mutations location. Thus, we mutated to alanines several amino acids that were located at the hydrophobic side of the helix (see Fig. 7, left), Leu411, Val418, and Phe425, and others, Lys413 and Asn423, located at the opposite side, which is more polar. In addition, Arg424 and Arg426, which might form the RXR motif, were also mutated. In contrast with the expression increase produced by hRIC-3 on wild-type rat α7 receptors (about 14-fold), mutant L411A showed similar expression levels in the presence or in the absence of hRIC-3 (Fig. 7, right); therefore, a single amino acid change is able to abolish the action of hRIC-3. Mutants V418A and F425A, which are located at the same side as L411A, have their expression slightly activated by the presence of hRIC-3 (about 1.7- and 2.2-fold over the control), but this activation did not reach the level observed with the wild-type α7. By contrast, mutant K413A, at the other side of the helix, showed strong activation with hRIC-3; the same happened with N423A, although to a lower extent in this case. Therefore, to observe the activating effect of hRIC-3 on α7 nAChRs, certain amino acids appear to be required at the hydrophobic side of the amphipathic helix. However, not only these hydrophobic amino acids are important, because mutants R424A and R426A also showed low levels of activation, suggesting that also the motif RXR might be involved in the hRIC-3 activation. The precise mechanisms by which the hRIC-3 protein exerts its effects on nicotinic and serotonergic receptors are not known. In this work we have tried to elucidate at which steps of receptor biosynthesis hRIC-3 acts and which domains of both hRIC-3 and the receptors are involved.

We have recently shown that overexpression of a miniaturized form of the molecule agrin (mini-agrin) counteracts the disease in dy(W)/dy(W) mice, a model for MDC1A. However, these mice express some residual truncated laminin-alpha2, suggesting that the observed amelioration might be due to mini-agrin's presenting the residual laminin-alpha2 to its receptors. Here we show that the mini-agrin counteracts the disease in dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice, which are null for laminin-alpha2. As in dy(W)/dy(W) mice, mini-agrin improves both the function and structure of muscle. We show that muscle regeneration after injury is severely impaired in dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice but is restored in the mini-agrin-expressing littermates. In summary, our results 1) show that the direct linkage of muscle basal lamina with the sarcolemma is the basis of mini-agrin-mediated amelioration and 2) provide unprecedented evidence that this linkage is important for proper regeneration of muscle fibers after injury. Our findings thus suggest that treatment with mini-agrin might be beneficial over the entire spectrum of the MDC1A disease, whose severity inversely correlates with expression levels and the size of the truncation in laminin-alpha2."

Unlike the wild-type, which requires trypsin, this mutant is strictly dependent on elastase. Both viruses grow equally well in cell culture.

Hemoglobin taken up from the host erythrocyte is degraded in the food vacuole, and the heme liberated during this process is crystallized to inert hemozoin. Several anti-malarial drugs target food vacuolar pathways, such as hemoglobin degradation and heme crystallization. Resistance and sensitization to some antimalarials is associated with mutations in food vacuolar membrane proteins. Other studies suggest a role of the food vacuole in ion homeostasis, and release of Ca2+ from the food vacuole may mediate adopted physiological responses. To investigate whether the food vacuole is an intracellular Ca2+ store, which in turn may affect other physiological functions in which this organelle partakes, we have investigated total and exchangeable Ca2+ within the parasite's food vacuole using x-ray microanalysis and quantitative confocal live cell Ca2+ imaging. Apparent free Ca2+ concentrations of ∼90, ∼350, and ∼400 nm were found in the host erythrocyte cytosol, the parasite cytoplasm, and the food vacuole, respectively. In our efforts to determine free intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, we evaluated several Ca2+-sensitive fluorochromes in a live cell confocal setting. We found that the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Fura-Red provides reliable determinations, whereas measurements using the frequently used Fluo-4 are compromised due to problems arising from phototoxicity, photobleaching, and the strong pH dependence of the dye. Our data suggest that the food vacuole contains only moderate amounts of Ca2+, disfavoring a role as a major intracellular Ca2+ store.

Other studies suggest a role of the food vacuole in ion homeostasis, and release of Ca2+ from the food vacuole may mediate adopted physiological responses. To investigate whether the food vacuole is an intracellular Ca2+ store, which in turn may affect other physiological functions in which this organelle partakes, we have investigated total and exchangeable Ca2+ within the parasite's food vacuole using x-ray microanalysis and quantitative confocal live cell Ca2+ imaging. Apparent free Ca2+ concentrations of ∼90, ∼350, and ∼400 nm were found in the host erythrocyte cytosol, the parasite cytoplasm, and the food vacuole, respectively. In our efforts to determine free intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, we evaluated several Ca2+-sensitive fluorochromes in a live cell confocal setting. We found that the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Fura-Red provides reliable determinations, whereas measurements using the frequently used Fluo-4 are compromised due to problems arising from phototoxicity, photobleaching, and the strong pH dependence of the dye. Our data suggest that the food vacuole contains only moderate amounts of Ca2+, disfavoring a role as a major intracellular Ca2+ store. Malaria is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Of the four parasites that can cause malaria in humans, Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent, being responsible for an estimated 300-500 million clinical cases and 1-3 million deaths, mainly children, annually (1Organization World Health World Health Organ. Tech. Rep. Ser. 2000; 892 (i-v): 1-74Google Scholar). P. falciparum is an obligatory intracellular parasite that propagates within human hepatocytes and erythrocytes. During intraerythrocytic development, malaria parasites tightly regulate their intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and sudden increases in cytosolic Ca2+ can trigger cell signaling events and developmental processes (2Billker O. Dechamps S. Tewari R. Wenig G. Franke-Fayard B. Brinkmann V. Cell. 2004; 117: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Growth of the parasite can be inhibited by a range of Ca2+ ionophores, Ca2+ channel blockers, and Ca2+/calmodulin antagonists (reviewed in Ref. 3Garcia C.R. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 488-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that factors maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis are valid targets for drug intervention. Although several Ca2+ carriers, including Ca2+-ATPases, have been identified and characterized (4Eckstein-Ludwig U. Webb R.J. Van Goethem I.D. East J.M. Lee A.G. Kimura M. O'Neill P.M. Bray P.G.

P. falciparum induces dramatic changes in the global [Ca2+]i of its host erythrocyte (7Tanabe K. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 437-449PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, the free [Ca2+]i in human erythrocytes does not exceed the lower nm range (∼50-150 nm) (8Engelmann B. Klin. Wochenschr. 1991; 69: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Harrison D.G. Long C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1968; 199: 367-381Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, a continuous net uptake of Ca2+ occurs as the parasite matures (10Tanabe K. Mikkelsen R.B. Wallach D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which has been attributed to an increased Ca2+ permeability of the host erythrocyte plasma membrane (11Desai S.A. McCleskey E.W. Schlesinger P.H. Krogstad D.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1996; 54: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Sherman I.W. Parasitology. 1985; 91: 609-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The parasite's cytoplasm is thought to contain a low free [Ca2+]i of ∼100 nm (13Camacho P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), similar to that of other eukaryotic cells (14Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar), although quantitative determinations are controversial, ranging from 50 to 700 nm (15Alleva L.M. Kirk K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Biagini G.A. Bray P.G. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Ward S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27910-27915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Early during intraerythrocytic development, high concentrations of Ca2+ appear to accumulate transiently in the parasitophorous vacuole (17Gazarini M.L. Thomas A.P. Pozzan T. Garcia C.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which separates the parasite from the erythrocyte cytosol. Other subcellular organelles considered to serve as intracellular Ca2+ stores are the parasite's endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; TG, thapsigargin. the food vacuole (16Biagini G.A.

As shown for the related apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, as well as for trypanosomatids, acidocalcisomes are electron-dense organelles containing high levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and other elements (22Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23Docampo R. de Souza W. Miranda K. Rohloff P. Moreno S.N. Nat. Rev.

A recent study has presented evidence for the presence of a calcium- and phosphorus-rich, electron-dense organelle in the merozoite (26Ruiz F.A. Luo S. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Microsc. Microanal. 2004; 10: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the invasive stage of the parasite. The food vacuole is an acidic organelle in which the erythrocyte hemoglobin is digested (27Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 28Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and the toxic byproduct heme is crystallized to inert hemozoin (28Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It is the site of action of several antimalarial drugs (29Olliaro P.L. Goldberg D.E. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 294-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and within its membrane, it contains transporters implicated in drug resistance mechanisms (30Bennett T.N. Kosar A.D. Ursos L.M. Dzekunov S. Singh Sidhu A.B. Fidock D.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 133: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A possible function of the food vacuole in Ca2+ storage was deduced from live cell confocal laser scanning microscopy using Fluo-4 as a Ca2+ indicator (16Biagini G.A. Bray P.G. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Ward S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27910-27915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The intense Fluo-4 fluorescence observed from the acidic food vacuole, as compared with the parasite's cytoplasm, was interpreted in terms of a model in which the food vacuole serves as a dynamic intracellular Ca2+ store (16Biagini G.A. Bray P.G. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Ward S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27910-27915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), similar to the situation in plants in which the tonoplast can store millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ (31Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 256: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), mainly complexed with phosphorus (32Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of Fluo-4 signals is complicated by the following. (i) Fluo-4 does not allow for ratiometric measurements, i.e. the signal depends on dye loading and/or partitioning and cannot be readily referred to Ca2+ concentrations. (ii) Fluo-4 fluorescence is potentially pH-dependent, as has been shown for the related fluorochrome fluorescein (33Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products. Ninth Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR2002Google Scholar). If Fluo-4 fluorescence also exhibits a pH dependence, then this must be taken into account when Fluo-4 fluorescence signals are compared between subcellular compartments of vastly different pH values such as the parasite's cytoplasm (pH ∼7.3) and the acidic food vacuole (pH ∼5.4) (30Bennett T.N. Kosar A.D. Ursos L.M. Dzekunov S. Singh Sidhu A.B. Fidock D.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 133: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). (iii) The food vacuole of P. falciparum is light-sensitive (34Wissing F. Sanchez C.P. Rohrbach P. Ricken S. Lanzer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37747-37755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Photo damage to its membrane and subsequent lysis quickly arise during microscopy due to photo-induced lipid peroxidation (34Wissing F. Sanchez C.P. Rohrbach P. Ricken S. Lanzer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37747-37755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whether Fluo-4 can also sensitize photo-damaging reactions is not yet investigated. As the food vacuole is an important organelle in the physiology of the parasite, we have reinvestigated steady-state and dynamic free [Ca2+]i in this compartment using, in a confocal setting, Ca2+-sensitive fluorochromes including Fluo-4, Fura-2, and Fura-Red. In addition, using x-ray microanalysis, we have examined the total calcium, phosphorus, and iron content of the food vacuole. Our data are interpreted in terms of a model suggesting that the parasite's food vacuole does not act as a major internal Ca2+ store. Chemicals—Fura-2 acetoxymethylester (AM), Fura-Red-AM, Fluo-4-AM, LysoSensor Blue DND-192, ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX, and Pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Inhibitors of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase thapsigargin (TG) and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) were obtained from Calbiochem. The H+ ionophore nigericin was purchased from Sigma, and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin was purchased from Calbiochem. P. falciparum Culture—P. falciparum parasites were maintained in continuous in vitro cultures as described previously (35Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Live cell experiments were carried out using the P. falciparum clones Dd2 and K1. Trophozoite stage parasites were used in all experiments. Dye Loading of P. falciparum Parasites—P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were washed twice with Ringer's solution (122.5 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 11 mmd-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) and loaded with 5 μm Fluo-4-AM, 5 μm Fura-2-AM, 9 μm Fura-Red-AM, or 500 nm ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX in Ringer's solution with Pluronic F-127 (0.1% v/v) for 45 min to 1 h at 37 °C. Dye-loaded parasites were settled onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in a microperfusion chamber as described previously (36Wunsch S. Sanchez C. Gekle M. Kersting U. Fischer K. Horrocks P. Lanzer M. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1997; 199: 44-50Google Scholar, 37Wunsch S. Sanchez C.P. Gekle M. Grosse-Wortmann L. Wiesner J. Lanzer M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Unbound parasites and remaining dye were washed away by perfusion with Ringer's solution. For the double labeling experiments, Ringer's solution was supplemented with the fluorescent dye LysoSensor Blue DND-192 at a concentration of 1 μm. Live Cell Imaging—Confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with UV and visible laser lines (351, 364, 458, and 488 nm) and an Axiovert 100M microscope. For Fluo-4-AM and LysoSensor Blue DND-192 double-labeling, the laser lines and filter settings used in Multi-Track mode were as follows: LysoSensor Blue DND-192 excited at 364 nm with emission detected using the LP 385-nm filter (blue channel), and Fluo-4-AM excited at 488 nm with emission using LP 505-nm filter (green channel). For optimization, the following settings were used: excitation at 488 nm with 1% transmission (argon laser, 25 milliwatt), and excitation at 364 nm with 2% transmission (UV laser, 80 milliwatt). Single images were obtained using a ×63 lens (C-APO, N.A. = 1.2) with an 8-fold software zoom, 512 × 512 pixel. For ratiometric Ca2+ imaging using Fura-2-AM, dual excitation ratio images of Fura-2-AM were acquired using 351 and 364-nm UV laser lines and a 505-nm-long pass emission filter. The line-wise Multi-Track mode was used to collect image fluorescence. Images were collected every 5 s. To record the excitation spectra of Fura-2 stained parasites, Fura-2 was excited with a polychromator (PolyChrom III, Till-Photonics) in 1-nm steps between 280 and 500 nm, and fluorescence was collected with a fixed filter setting in the visible light range (>510 nm) in an epifluorescence setup (Visitron Imaging Systems). For ratiometric confocal Fura-Red Ca2+ imaging, Fura-Red was alternately excited with the 458- and 488-nm argon laser lines. The transmittance for the 458-nm line was 9 and 1% for the 488-nm line. Fura-Red fluorescence was measured using a 570-nm-long pass filter, resulting in a pair of images (F458 nm and F488 nm). The Ca2+ inhibitors TG (1 μm) and CPA (10 μm) were added to a time series in the absence and presence of 10 μm nigericin. Note: Fura-Red is a calcium-quenching fluorophore, i.e. an increase in fluorescence corresponds to a decrease in Ca2+ concentration for both excitation wavelengths. However, the ratio F458 nm/F488 nm increases with rising Ca2+ concentration (38Lohr C. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX imaging, the dye was excited at 364 nm with emission detected using a LP385 emission filter. For all confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, a pinhole of 1.2 μm (1.34 Airy units) was chosen to ensure that fluorescence was from within the food vacuole and not regions lying above or below. P. falciparum Dd2 trophozoites were used unless stated otherwise. Fluorochrome pH Dependence—In situ experiments were performed as follows. Parasites were loaded with 5 μm Fluo-4-AM or 9 μm Fura-Red-AM at 37 °C for 45 min and then added to a chamber as described above. A time course was started, and measurements were taken every 5 s. Ringer's solution was prepared with varying pH (5.5, 6.5, 7.5) and supplied with 10 μm nigericin. This buffer was applied to the time course measurement, and the change in fluorescence was quantified. For in vitro experiments, 5 μm Fluo-4-AM or 9 μm Fura-Red-AM was added to Ringer's solution containing a fixed free Ca2+ concentration of 350 nm. pH values were adjusted ranging from 5.0 to 8.0. Using an Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer, emission scans were performed for each pH with a step size of 1 nm ranging from 500 to 600 nm for Fluo-4 and from 520 to 700 nm for Fura-Red. For Fluo-4, the spectra were integrated starting from 505 nm (LP 505 nm) and starting from 570 nm (LP 570 nm) for Fura-Red to ensure identical conditions for the fluorescence evaluation as in the confocal in situ setting. Data Analysis—P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were readily identified by eye. Using the LSM510 v3.2 software, a region of interest, including either the vacuole or the cytosol of the parasite, was defined. The mean ratio value of the region of interest was measured throughout the image sequence. The measured fluorescence was further analyzed using Excel (Microsoft), Sigma Plot (SPSS software), Origin (Microcal Systems), and ImageJ (NIH software). Images were processed using Corel Draw and Corel Photopaint. In Situ Ca2+ Calibration of Fura-Red—A confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) and the fluorescent calcium indicator Fura-Red-AM was used to measure the intracellular free calcium concentration. The mean vacuolar and cytoplasmic ratios (R458/488) were evaluated in the intact parasite (i.e. resting [Ca2+]i) as well as after permeabilizing the membranes using the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (10 μm) and clamping the external solution to various free Ca2+ values as described in Ref. 39Friedrich O. Both M. Gillis J.M. Chamberlain J.S. Fink R.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 555: 251-265Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar. Rmin corresponds to ratios in Ca2+-free solution (∼1 nm), and Rmax corresponds to ratios in the presence of saturating free Ca2+ (∼1 mm, see Ref. 39Friedrich O. Both M. Gillis J.M. Chamberlain J.S. Fink R.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 555: 251-265Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A calibration curve was fitted to this Ca2+-R458/488 relationship using a least square fit to a Hill function. The Hill coefficient was fixed to unity reflecting the 1:1 stoichiometry of Fura-Red binding to Ca2+ ions. In some analyses, the Hill coefficient was set as a free variable and accurately predicted a value close to unity (not shown). The R458/488 were then converted to corresponding resting free [Ca2+]i values using the inverse Hill equation, and a Grubbs test was performed to identify outliers (at the p = 0.05 level). Outliers of the resting R458/488 were omitted from further analysis. Finally, mean resting free [Ca2+]i from the vacuole and the cytoplasmic area were compared using a Student's t test at the p = 0.05 level. X-ray Microanalysis—X-ray microanalysis was performed on either whole cells, air-dried onto Formvar-coated grids, or cryofixed, sectioned cells. For cryofixation, infected erythrocytes were spray-frozen into liquid propane (×180 °C) using the quenched flow method (40Knoll G. Braun C. Plattner H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After removing the propane under vacuum at ×100 °C in a GT1 freeze dryer (Leybold Heraeus), cells were freeze-substituted for 48 h at ×80 °C in dry methanol containing 3% glutaraldehyde, 1% OsO4, and 250 mm KF to retain free calcium, based on previous work (41Knoll G. Grassle A. Braun C. Probst W. Hohne-Zell B. Plattner H. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Poenie M. Epel D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 939-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After freeze substitution, the temperature was slowly raised to +4 °C (overnight), and cells were finally embedded in Spurr's resin. Analysis was performed on 500-nm-thick sections. X-ray microanalysis of cryofixed sections has been successfully and reliably used to localize total Ca2+ in specific subcellular compartments (41Knoll G. Grassle A. Braun C. Probst W. Hohne-Zell B. Plattner H. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Poenie M. Epel D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 939-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 43Hardt M. Plattner H. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Hardt M. Plattner H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Specimens were analyzed using a 912 Omega scanning transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss). X-rays were collected using a lithium-drifted silicon detector (front area 30 mm2) equipped with an ATW atmospheric window. The microscope was operated as follows: 80 kV tungsten filament, scanning transmission, and imaging mode (scanning transmission electron micrographs); spot size was 63 nm, and emission current was ∼10 μA, according to Ref. 43Hardt M. Plattner H. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. Analysis was performed using the INCA EDX microanalysis software (Oxford Instruments). Temporal Changes in Fluo-4 Imaging—Staining of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes with the Ca2+ fluorophore Fluo-4 was analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope and experimental settings as described previously (16Biagini G.A. Bray P.G. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Ward S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27910-27915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In accordance with the published data, we observed a strong Fluo-4 fluorescence signal originating from the parasite's acidic food vacuole, a weak signal from the parasite cytoplasm, and hardly any from the erythrocyte cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). However, the food vacuolar fluorescence signal was unstable and declined with recurrent illumination (Fig. 1, B and C). The drop in Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity in the vacuole coincided with an increase in cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. 1, B and C). We repeated Fluo-4 imaging in the presence of LysoSensor Blue DND-192 (LS Blue), an acidotropic probe that accumulates in the parasite's food vacuolar compartment (34Wissing F. Sanchez C.P. Rohrbach P. Ricken S. Lanzer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37747-37755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Initially, both Fluo-4 and LS Blue fluorescence signals co-localized in the food vacuole (Fig. 2A). However, within one to 2 min, both Fluo-4 and LS Blue fluorescence faded from the food vacuole and were redistributed to the parasite's cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). These data indicated that Fluo-4 fluorescence signals are unstable and change over time. Possible explanations for this effect are provided under “Discussion.” Fluo-4 Fluorescence Is pH-dependent—Given that the pH in the parasite's cytoplasm and acid food vacuole differs by approximately two pH units, we considered the influence of pH on the Fluo-4 fluorescence signal. To this end, the pH of the P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes loaded with Fluo-4 was clamped to values ranging from 7.5 to 5.5. pH-induced changes in fluorescence intensity (ΔF) were determined, normalized to the value obtained in Ringer's solution at a pH of 7.3 (F0), and analyzed as a function of the pH. A substantial pH dependence of the Fluo-4 fluorescence signal was observed in situ (Fig. 3A). To clarify whether this finding represents a direct effect of the dye or is due to indirect influences of the food vacuolar environment on the fluorescence signal, the pH dependence was determined in vitro using a fluorospectrometer for the Fluo-4 fluorochrome alone. Again, a strong pH dependence was observed, with the fluorescence increasing as the pH decreases (Fig. 3B). A maximum was reached at pH 6.25, after which the fluorescence declined (Fig. 3C). Evaluation of Ratiometric Fluorescent Ca2+ Indicators—The data presented above suggest that Fluo-4 fluorescence is strongly pH-dependent, thus complicating the interpretation of data obtained from cellular compartments varying in pH. We therefore searched for ratiometric fluorescent Ca2+ indicators with chemical structures different from Fluo-4 and pH independence. We initially tested the UV light-excitable Fura-2 fluorophore, a widely used ratiometric Ca2+ indicator with a reported isosbestic point of ∼360 nm (for a review on Ca2+ indicators, see Ref. 45Takahashi A. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Herman B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1089-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes loaded with Fura-2 revealed a strong and stable fluorescence signal from both the cytoplasm and the food vacuole when excited with 351- and 364-nm UV laser lines (Fig. 4A). To monitor dynamic Ca2+ changes, we increased the laser power such that the food vacuolar membrane would lyse and monitored the time course of fluorescence intensities F351 nm and F364 nm. As expected, the fluorescence measured from the food vacuole rapidly decreased, whereas that from the parasite cytoplasm slightly increased with time (Fig. 4B). However, the kinetics of F351 nm and F364 nm was very similar for both vacuolar and cytoplasmic recordings (Fig. 4B). This was inconsistent with a ratiometric measurement. Moreover, the ratios of F351 nm over F364 nm remained constant with time (Fig. 4B). These findings suggested that the isosbestic point has shifted in our specimen, a phenomenon that has also been described in other cell types (45Takahashi A. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Herman B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1089-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Indeed, recording the excitation spectra in the parasites, in an epifluorescence setting with a polychromator, revealed a strong red shift in the Ca2+-dependent Fura-2 spectra with the isosbestic point being close to 380 nm (Fig. 4C). We next tested the Ca2+ fluorophore Fura-Red that can be excited using the visible light argon laser lines 458 and 488 nm (38Lohr C. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unlike most other Ca2+ indicators, Fura-Red fluorescence decreases once the indicator binds Ca2+. The emission ratio (F458 nm/F488 nm), however, increases with rising Ca2+ concentration (38Lohr C. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fura-Red stained the parasite (Fig. 5A) and stable fluorescence intensities (F458 nm and F488 nm) were recorded for both cytoplasm and food vacuole (Fig. 5B). The integrity of the food vacuole was not affected during the measurement, as verified using LS Blue (Fig. 5B). When the pH dependence of Fura-Red was investigated (see above), only minor effects were observed in situ (Fig. 6A). This finding was confirmed under in vitro cell-free conditions using a fluorospectrometer to scan the emission spectra at both excitation wavelengths at different pH values ra"

There have been conflicting reports as to whether decorin could function as an angiogenic inhibitor when used as an extracellular soluble factor. In this study, we demonstrated that not only purified decorin but also the 26-residue leucine-rich repeat 5 (LRR5) of decorin core protein functions as angiogenesis inhibitor by inhibiting both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis. Peptide LRR5 inhibited angiogenesis through multiple mechanisms, including inhibiting VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell (EC) migration, tube formation on Matrigel, cell attachment to fibronectin, as well as induction of EC apoptosis without significantly affecting their proliferation. We further demonstrated that different subregions of LRR5 inhibited different aspects of angiogenesis, with the middle region (LRR5M, 12 residues) inhibiting endothelial cell tube formation up to 1000 times more potently than LRR5. Although the C-terminal region (LRR5C) potently inhibited VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration, the N-terminal region (LRR5N) is as active as LRR5 in inhibiting endothelial cell attachment to fibronectin. Although both LRR5M and LRR5N induced EC apoptosis dose-dependently similar to LRR5 through a caspase-dependent pathway, LRR5C has no such function. We further showed that the inhibition of tube formation by LRR5 and LRR5M is linked with their ability to suppress VEGF-induced focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in ECs, but not their ability to interfere with endothelial cell attachment to the matrix. Circular dichroism studies revealed that LRR5 undergoes an inter-conversion between 310 helix and β-sheet structure in solution, a characteristic potentially important for its anti-angiogenic activity. Peptide LRR5 and its derivatives are therefore novel angiogenesis inhibitors that may serve as prototypes for further development into anti-angiogenic drugs.

Proteins carry out their functions by interacting with other molecules through their functional domains. These domains vary in size, composition, and structure. In recent years, a lot of effort has been put forth to develop proteins for therapeutic applications. However, the use of proteins as drugs has limitations because of their poor bioavailability, antigenicity, unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and inconsistency in bioactivity from batch to batch productions (1Fairlie D.P. West M.L. Wong A.K. Curr. Med. Chem. 1998; 5: 29-62PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, small peptides have the advantage of easy production by synthesis using automatic peptide synthesizers, low antigenicity, high solubility in water, and improved bioavailability with potential oral delivery (2Lien S. Lowman H.B. Trends Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Such peptides can represent complete or partial protein functional modules as well as possible protein-protein interaction sites (3Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature, is a multistep process involving degradation of extracellular matrix, endothelial cell proliferation and migration, capillary tube formation, and matrix remodeling (7Conway E.M. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 8Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (3439) Google Scholar). Many proteins are involved in this process, including growth factors and their cell surface receptors, extracellular matrix molecules, integrins, matrix metalloproteases, and their inhibitors. Several endogenous proteins such as endostatin and angiostatin, fragments of collagen and plasminogen, respectively, are potent inhibitors of angiogenesis (9O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C.

Its major functions include regulation of collagen fibrinogenesis, maintenance of tissue integrity via binding with fibronectin and thrombospondin, and serving as a reservoir for transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ1) (11Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 12Schmidt G. Robenek H. Harrach B. Glossl J. Nolte V. Hormann H. Richter H. Kresse H. J.

Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Decorin inhibits cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin (15Lewandowska K. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. Zardi L. Culp L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It also inhibits the growth of various tumor cells with a diverse histogenetic background when either overexpressed in tumor cells or provided as a recombinant protein primarily via a protracted inactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (16Santra M.D. Mann M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Reed C.C. Gauldie J. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3688-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Decorin expression is induced in endothelial cells during angiogenesis, but not when migration and proliferation are stimulated. Thus, it has been hypothesized that decorin may support the formation of the fibrillar pericellular matrix that stabilizes the differentiated endothelial phenotype during the later stages of angiogenesis (18Kinsella M.G. Fischer J.W. Mason D.P. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13924-13932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, there have been conflicting reports of decorin as an angiogenesis inhibitor. Decorin was reported to suppress indirectly tumor angiogenesis through inhibition of VEGF production by tumor cells (19Grant D.S. Yenisey C. Rose R.W. Tootell M. Santra M. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4765-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Increased expression of decorin in endothelial cells through retroviral transduction inhibited EC migration (18Kinsella M.G. Fischer J.W. Mason D.P. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13924-13932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, purified decorin inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation in collagen I lattices when ECs were grown on decorin-coated surfaces (20Davies Cde L. Melder R.J. Munn L.L. Mouta-Carreira C. Jain R.K. Boucher Y. Microvasc. Res. 2001; 62: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recombinant decorin was reported to have no effect on endothelial cell tube formation on Matrigel (19Grant D.S. Yenisey C. Rose R.W. Tootell M. Santra M. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4765-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and decorin expression in EA.hy926 ECs by adenovirus transduction-promoted tube formation in collagen lattices while inhibiting EC apoptosis (21Schonherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Structurally, decorin belongs to a growing family of the small leucine-rich repeat PGs. It contains a core protein of 359 amino acids linked to a single chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (11Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The mature protein is highly conserved across species and consists of a central domain harboring 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) flanked by disulfide-bonded terminal sequences. The N terminus contains a single attachment site for glycosaminoglycan, and the central domain contains three potentially N-linked glycosylation sites. LRRs are involved in protein-protein interactions and have been found in a large number of proteins, including PGs such as biglycan, fibromodulin, and lumican (22Matsushima N. Ohyanagi T. Tanaka T. Krestsinger R.H. Proteins. 2000; 38: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Decorin binds to collagen mainly through LRR4 and -5 of the core protein (23Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition, a high affinity binding site for TGFβ is located between LRR3 and -5 (24Schonherr E. Broszat M. Brandan E. Bruckner P. Kresse H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Decorin binding to TGFβ prevents the binding of TGFβ to its receptor and regulates TGFβ-mediated cellular signaling (25Ständer M. Naumann U. Wick W. Weller M. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that biologically active decorin is a monomer in solution, and therefore, decorin is a monovalent ligand for various extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors, and cell surface receptors (26Goldoni S. Owens R.T. McQuillan D.J. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Birk D.E. Campbell S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, crystal structure analysis of decorin indicated that it is a stable dimer with large interfaces (27Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In an effort to characterize the role of decorin and its core protein LRR repeats in angiogenesis and to develop small peptide angiogenic inhibitors, we identified decorin and the 26-residue LRR5 to function as potent angiogenesis inhibitors, inhibiting VEGF, bFGF, and serum-induced angiogenesis. LRR5 inhibits angiogenesis through multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of VEGF-induced EC tube formation on Matrigel, EC migration, and EC attachment to fibronectin. In addition, it also induced EC apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway. Functional mapping identified subregions of LRR5 that inhibited different aspects of angiogenesis. More importantly, the central 12-residue LRR5M specifically inhibited EC tube formation up to 1000 times more potently than LRR5. Whereas the C-terminal 13-residue LRR5C retained the ability to inhibit EC migration, the N-terminal 13-residue LRR5N is as effective as LRR5 in inhibiting EC attachment to fibronectin. Furthermore, both LRR5N and LRR5M induced EC apoptosis, with LRR5M as effective as LRR5. Further mechanistic study indicated that the abilities of LRR5 and LRR5M to inhibit EC tube formation is linked to their inhibition of VEGF-induced FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 and subsequent assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in ECs. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant human VEGF165 and recombinant human decorin (rhDCN) were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Basic FGF was from Promega (Madison, WI). Purified decorin (DCN) from bovine articular cartilage, gelatin, and Giemsa solution were from Sigma. Falcon cell culture inserts (8.0-μm pore size) and Matrigel were from BD Biosciences. Human plasma fibronectin was from Invitrogen. Endothelial culture media CSC were from Cell Systems. Pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was from Merck. Bovine articular DCN protein concentration (Sigma) was determined by using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). DCN purity was checked by both native and SDS-PAGE and shown to be more than 95% pure. The endotoxin levels in DCN and rhDCN were determined using ET0200 kit from Sigma. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized by solid phase synthesis using automated peptide synthesizer (PerSeptive Biosystems) adopting Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry in-house or procured from a commercial source (SynPep). Peptides were purified by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, freeze-dried, and stored at -20 °C until used. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from human umbilical cords and cultured in CSC complete medium at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. All cells used for the experiments were from passages 3-6. Endothelial Cell Tube Formation Assay—2.5 × 104 HUVECs were preincubated with various concentrations of peptides for 30 min before being seeded onto the solidified growth factor reduced Matrigel in a 96-well plate. After incubating in media with or without 15 ng/ml VEGF or bFGF at 37 °C for 4-6 h, cells were fixed, and tube formation was analyzed by light microscopy (×100). Four random fields were chosen in each well, and the total tube length was quantified by using NIH ImageJ 1.32 software. Cell Migration Assay—Migration assay was performed using Falcon cell culture inserts as described previously with modifications (28Wickstrom S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20178-20185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were starved overnight, trypsinized, and suspended at a final concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml. Various concentrations of peptides were preincubated with the 2-3 × 104 cells for 30 min at 37 °C before seeding onto the gelatin-coated cell culture inserts. VEGF (10 ng/ml) was placed into the lower chamber. The assembled cell culture insert chamber was then incubated at 37 °C for 8-12 h. After removing the nonmigrating cells with a cotton swab, migrated cells on the lower surface of the culture inserts were fixed, stained with 0.4% Giemsa, and photographed under a light microscope (×200). Five random fields were chosen in each insert, and the cell number was quantified using the NIH ImageJ 1.32 software. Proliferation and Cytotoxicity Analyses—Proliferation and cytotoxicity were determined using the nonradioactive EZ4U cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). The method was based on the fact that living cells are capable of reducing less colored tetrazolium salts into intensely colored formazan derivatives. This reduction process requires functional mitochondria, which are inactivated within a few minutes after cell death. In a typical 96-well plate assay, we used around 3000 HUVECs/well, and the absorbance of formazan at 460 nm was represented as mitochondrial activity. For proliferation assays, the cells were incubated in CSC medium plus 2% FBS with or without 10 ng/ml VEGF or bFGF and various concentrations of peptides (1 nm to 100 μm) for 48 h, while 6-h peptide incubation was used to measure cytotoxicity. Cell Attachment Assay—HUVECs were pre-treated with different peptides for 20 min before being plated onto a fibronectin-coated 24-well plate and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Attached cells were then fixed and stained with Giemsa. The number of cells attached were quantified in five random fields per well. The assay was done in duplicate and repeated three times on separate days. Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis was analyzed by morphological detection of chromatin fragmentation as described before (29Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Waterman M.J. Lu H. Knebelmann B. Segal M. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11721-11726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). HUVECs grown to 60-70% confluence in 4-well chamber slides were incubated with peptides for 48 h in 0.5% FBS in the presence or absence of 5-10 ng/ml VEGF. Cells were fixed, stained with Hoechst dye 33258, and observed under a fluorescent microscope (×630). Alternatively, TUNEL staining was performed using the ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay kit (Clontech). Apoptosis was also quantified using a cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 20,000 HUVECs/well were seeded onto 0.2% gelatin-coated 24-well plates for 24 h prior to treatment with peptides. Cells were treated with different concentrations of peptides, with or without 10 ng/ml VEGF for 24 h before harvested using trypsin. DNA fragmentation was measured by quantitation of cytosolic oligonucleosome-bound DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytosolic fraction (13,000 × g) of HUVECs treated with peptides in the presence and absence of 10 ng/ml VEGF was used as antigen source in the sandwich ELISA with anti-human histone antibody coated to the plate and a secondary anti-DNA antibody coupled to peroxidase for detection. The effect of peptides in inducing apoptosis was represented as absorbance value at 405 nm. The experiment was also performed in the presence of 10 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fuoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK), a Pan-caspase inhibitor. Solid Phase Binding Assay—Ninety six-well microtiter plates were coated with 100 μg/ml collagen I or fibronectin solutions overnight at 4 °C. Control wells were coated with 0.1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline. After rinsing with 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the wells were preincubated with 0.1% (w/v) BSA for 2 h before incubating with varying concentrations of FITC-labeled peptides for 4 h at room temperature. Fluorescence bound to wells was determined using SpectramaxR Gemini XS dual scanning Spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Germany). Saturation graphs were obtained using single site binding, nonlinear regression analysis by Graph Pad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc.). All analyses were done in triplicate. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Starved HUVECs were treated with 30 μm peptides individually for 2 h before exposing to 15 ng/ml VEGF165 for 30 min. The cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). After adjustment for protein concentration with the Bradford method, 100 μg of proteins from each sample were used for Western blot analysis. The blot was probed with primary rabbit anti-FAK antibody (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. The products were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). On the other hand, 500 μg of proteins from the same samples were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-FAK antibody at 4 °C overnight and probed with primary mouse anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr-397) antibody (Chemicon). Analysis of Focal Adhesions and Actin Stress Fibers in HUVECs— Cells were grown to near-confluence on chamber slides. VEGF (10 ng/ml) and peptides (100 μm) were added into the wells and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against paxillin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Slides were observed under confocal microscope (Olympus 1X70). TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was used to stain the actin cytoskeleton, and Hoechst dye 33258 was used to counter stain the nucleus. Circular Dichroism Spectral Analysis—CD spectra of all peptides were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm path length quartz cell at room temperature in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 1 mm concentration. The spectra were recorded between 190 and 260 nm with a scan speed of 50 nm/min and were the average of three scans. Base line was subtracted for final representation. Anti-angiogenic Effect of Decorin and LRR5—There have been conflicting reports regarding the role of decorin in inhibiting angiogenesis when used as a soluble factor. To clarify the role of decorin on EC tube formation, we tested purified decorin from bovine articular cartilage as well as recombinant human decorin expressed in insect cells using HUVEC tube formation assay on Matrigel. Both decorins were found to inhibit VEGF, bFGF, and serum-stimulated HUVEC tube formation on growth factor-reduced Matrigel, with purified bovine articular decorin more potent than recombinant human decorin (Fig. 1, A and B). Both decorin preparations inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation more potently than bFGF-induced tube formation. This paper therefore mainly focuses on VEGF-induced angiogenesis in subsequent studies. No endotoxin contamination was found in the decorin preparations (see under “Experimental Procedures”), confirming that the anti-angiogenic activity is a specific activity of decorin (data not shown). LRR domains in decorin core protein play important roles in decorin function, and the LRR3-5 region has been shown to be the main region binding collagen I as well as TGFβ (14Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 25Ständer M. Naumann U. Wick W. Weller M. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We set out to test if individual LRR3-5 can inhibit HUVEC tube formation by using a synthetic peptide approach. Fig. 2A lists all the peptides used in this study. Peptide LRR5 effectively inhibited EC tube formation dose-dependently, whereas LRR3 and LRR4 at 100 μm only had a mild effect (Fig. 2, B and C). More importantly, when the LRR5 amino acid sequence was scrambled (LRR5S), the inhibition effect was completely lost. These peptides were not cytotoxic to ECs when tested up to 100 μm as shown in Table I. Therefore, LRR5 can specifically inhibit VEGF-induced EC tube formation on Matrigel in a sequence-dependent manner and functions as an angiogenic inhibitor. As angiogenesis involves multiple steps, we tested the LRR peptides for their ability to inhibit EC proliferation and migration. As shown in Fig. 3, peptide LRR5 potently inhibited VEGF-stimulated EC migration in a dose-dependent as well as sequence-dependent manner with an estimated ED50 value between 100 nm and 1 μm, whereas LRR5S had no such activity. Purified bovine decorin also potently inhibited EC migration at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 3A). Both decorin and LRR5 also inhibited bFGF-induced EC migration (Fig. 3B), but much less effectively when compared with VEGF stimulation.

To test whether LRR5 has the ability to induce apoptosis in HUVECs, apoptosis was analyzed by morphological detection of chromatin fragmentation, TUNEL staining, and quantitative ELISA measurement of fragmented DNA in peptide-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, LRR5 specifically induced apoptosis in HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner. At 100 μm, many cells with fragmented chromatins were observed. TUNEL staining also confirmed the morphological observation (Fig. 5B). ELISA measurement of DNA fragmentation indicated that LRR5 potently induced apoptosis in the presence or absence of VEGF at 100 μm, and this inhibition is caspase-dependent as the Pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk effectively abolished its apoptosis inducing activity (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W2101287396,"Increased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 (PAI-1) in adipose tissues is thought to contribute to both the cardiovascular and metabolic complications associated with obesity. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is chronically elevated in adipose tissues of obese rodents and humans and has been directly implicated to induce PAI-1 in adipocytes. In this study, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes to examine the mechanism by which TNF-alpha up-regulates PAI-1 in the adipocyte. Acute (3 h) and chronic (24 h) exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to TNF-alpha induces PAI-1 mRNA by increasing the rate of transcription of the PAI-1 gene, and de novo protein synthesis is not required for this process. Although the p44/42 and PKC signaling pathways appear to be significant in the induction of PAI-1 mRNA in response to acute treatment with TNF-alpha, the more dramatic induction of PAI-1 mRNA observed in response to chronic exposure of adipocytes to TNF-alpha was mediated by these and additional signaling molecules, including p38, PI3-kinase, tyrosine kinases, and the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Moreover, the dramatic increase in PAI-1 observed after chronic exposure of adipocytes to TNF-alpha was accompanied by increased metabolic insulin resistance. Finally, we demonstrate that the PKC pathway is also central for PAI-1 induction in response to insulin and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), two additional molecules which are elevated in obesity and shown to directly induce PAI-1 in the adipocyte. The understanding of the mechanism of regulating PAI-1 expression in the adipocytes at the molecular level provides new insight to help identify novel targets in fighting the pathological complications of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2088583692,"Sites of inflammation are associated with dramatic shifts in tissue metabolism. Inflammation can result in significant tissue hypoxia, with resultant induction of hypoxia-responsive genes. Given this association, we hypothesized that neutrophil (PMN) ligands expressed on epithelial cells may be regulated by hypoxia. Initial studies confirmed earlier results that epithelial hypoxia enhances PMN transepithelial migration and promotes apical clearance of PMN from the epithelial surface. A screen of known PMN ligands revealed a surprisingly stable expression pattern in hypoxia. However, this screen identified one gene, CD55, as a highly hypoxia-inducible molecule expressed on the apical membrane of mucosal epithelia. Subsequent studies verified the induction of CD55 mRNA and protein expression by hypoxia. Overexpression of CD55 by transfection in nonhypoxic epithelia resulted in a similar pattern of apical PMN clearance, and peptide mimetics corresponding to the PMN binding site on DAF blocked such apical clearance of PMN. Studies directed at understanding molecular pathways of hypoxia inducibility revealed that a approximately 200 bp region of the CD55 gene conferred hypoxia inducibility for CD55. These studies identified a functional binding site for the transcriptional regulator hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Taken together, these results identify HIF-dependent induction of epithelial CD55 in the resolution of ongoing inflammation through clearance of apical PMN."

The present study shows that FGFR1 accumulates and interacts with the transcriptional co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) in nuclear speckle domains in the developing brain and in neural progenitor-like cells in vitro, which accompanies differentiation and postmitotic growth. Cell differentiation and gene activation by nuclear FGFR1 do not require tyrosine kinase activity. Instead, FGFR1 stimulates transcription in cooperation with CBP by increasing recruitment of RNA polymerase II and histone acetylation at the active gene promoter. FGFR1 is a multifactorial protein whose N terminus interacts with CBP and C terminus with ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1). Nuclear FGFR1 augments CBP-mediated transcription by 1) releasing the CBP C-terminal domain from RSK1 inhibition and 2) activating the CBP N-terminal domain.

During ontogeny, cells in the nervous system and in other tissues multiply, grow, and differentiate under the control of a plethora of extracellular signals. Progression through developmental phases requires concerted regulation of multiple genes, which occurs at the level of sequence specific transcription factors and at chromatin locations where remodeling occurs following histone modifications (1.Emerson B.M.

CBP and/or p300 function at the ends of several signaling cascades and interact with components of the basal transcription machinery. CBP/p300 have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and provide scaffolding for the multiprotein complexes that facilitate formation and stabilization of the RNA pol II holoenzyme complex and chromatin remodeling essential for initiation and continued transcription (2.Goodman R.H.

CBP functions are also influenced by cross-talk among distinct signaling cascades that compete for the limiting amounts of CBP (7.Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W.

For instance, Ras-mediated mitogenic stimulation induces binding of CBP to serine/threonine ribosomal S6 kinase (pp90 RSK1), which phosphorylates and activates CREB and other sequence-specific transcription factors. Sequestering of CBP by RSK1 appears to channel the thrust of cell stimulation via the Ras pathway (i.e. mitogen activation of the c-fos gene) while blocking cAMP-mediated stimulation of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene (specific for differentiated catecholaminergic cells) (10.Nakajima T.

Hence, dynamic associations between CBP and RSK1 could allow CBP to activate distinct sets of genes and thereby promote different ontogenic phases. However, how the CBP-RSK interaction may be regulated by extracellular and intracellular signals is unknown.The recently described integrative nuclear FGFR1 signaling has been shown to integrate diverse signals that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and gene transcription (11.Stachowiak M.K.

Upon cell stimulation, a newly synthesized FGFR1, a typically plasma membrane-directed protein, is released into the cytosol by a mechanism that appears analogous to the retranslocation of endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane proteins to the cytosol by Sec61 (12.Myers J.M. Martins G.G. Ostrowski J. Stachowiak M.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 1273-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic mobilization of FGFR1 is enabled by the FGFR1 transmembrane domain, whose hydrophobic chain is interrupted by polar amino acids and has a predicted β-sheet-like structure, atypical for transmembrane peptides. FGFR1 is transported into the nucleus by importin-β (13.Reilly J.F. Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14.Reilly J.F. Mizukoshi E. Maher P.A.

Nuclear FGFR1 accumulation was also observed in cultured neurons, astrocytes, adrenal cells, and fibroblasts and accompanied cell growth, differentiation, and homeostatic adaptations induced by diverse stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 11.Stachowiak M.K.

In proliferating fetal neural progenitor-like cells (NPCs) (isolated from the human brain or from a nonhematopoietic population of umbilical cord blood) and in adult rat hippocampal NPCs, FGFR1 was associated with the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. In cells stimulated to differentiate with bone morphogenetic protein 7 or dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), a marked nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 occurs accompanying withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle, outgrowth of neurites, and induction of neuron-specific genes (11.Stachowiak M.K.

This differentiation was blocked by the tyrosine kinase (TK)-deleted dominant negative FGFR1(TK-), a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein. Cell differentiation was also blocked by an exclusively nuclear, nonmembrane FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-), in which the signal peptide was replaced with the SV40 NLS. However, the inhibition of surface FGFR1 did not affect cell differentiation (19.Stachowiak E.K. Fang X. Myers J. Dunham S. Stachowiak M.K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1296-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Transfection of full-length cytoplasmic/nuclear FGFR1 or exclusively nuclear FGFR1(SP-/NLS) induced neuronal-like differentiation in the absence of cAMP or BMP-7 stimulation. In contrast, “membrane-arrested” FGFR1/R4 in which the atypical FGFR1 transmembrane domain was replaced with the α-helical FGFR4 transmembrane region did not enter the nucleus and failed to induce differentiation (19.Stachowiak E.K. Fang X. Myers J. Dunham S. Stachowiak M.K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1296-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These and related experiments using NPCs, medulloblastoma cells, and neuroblastoma cells showed that nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 is both essential and sufficient to induce cell differentiation (11.Stachowiak M.K.

Biochem. 2003; 88: 1273-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and was recently found also to enter the cell nucleus. Nuclear FGFR2 accumulation occurred in association with prostaglandin-induced osteoblast development (20.Sabbieti M.G. Marchetti L. Gabrielli M.G. Menghi M. Materazzi S. Menghi G. Raisz L.G. Hurley M.M. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 319: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in differentiating Sertoli cells (21.Schmahl J. Kim Y. Colvin J.S. Ornitz D.M. Capel B. Development. 2004; 131: 3627-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Like nuclear FGFR1 in NPCs, FGFR2 does not accumulate in the nuclei of proliferating Sertoli precursors but in cells that exit the cell cycle. Studies of FGF-9 knock-out mice have indicated that the nuclear accumulation of FGFR2 is essential for the differentiation of Sertoli cells within the gonad (21.Schmahl J. Kim Y. Colvin J.S. Ornitz D.M. Capel B. Development. 2004; 131: 3627-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, nuclear FGFR may constitute a novel class of signal transducers that regulate ontogenic development.The role of FGFR1 in the cell nucleus was shown to be that of a gene regulator (11.Stachowiak M.K.

Nuclear FGFR1 mediates the activation of catecholamine cell-specific tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and cell growth-promoting FGF-2 genes by angiotensin II receptors, cell depolarization, or direct stimulation of cAMP or protein kinase C pathways (22.Peng H. Moffett J. Myers J. Fang X. Stachowiak E.K. Maher P. Kratz E. Hines J. Fluharty S.J. Mizukoshi E. Bloom D.C. Stachowiak M.K. Mol. Biol.

Nuclear FGFR1 was also shown to activate the expression of neurofilament L, neuron-specific enolase microtubule-associated protein 2 (19.Stachowiak E.K. Fang X. Myers J. Dunham S. Stachowiak M.K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1296-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and c-jun genes (13.Reilly J.F. Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These effects were not reproduced by stimulation of cell surface FGFR. Transactivation of the CRE-regulated TH gene promoter by nuclear FGFR1 was accompanied by in vitro formation of CREB-CBP-containing complexes with the TH promoter element CRE (23.Peng H. Myers J. Fang X. Stachowiak E.K. Maher P.A. Martins G.G. Popescu G. Berezney R. Stachowiak M.K. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 506-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These complexes were disrupted by FGFR1 Ab suggesting that nuclear FGFR1 may activate transcription via CBP.In vivo in the developing brain and in differentiating cultured NPCs, endogenous nuclear FGFR1 was found to interact with RSK1 (16.Hu Y.

Thus, FGFR1 could activate transcription via RSK1-mediated regulation of sequence-specific transcription factors and/or CBP. In the present study we show that the nuclear receptor associates with CBP in developing murine brain neurons and in cultured NPCs. FGFR1 activates transcription by binding to RSK1 and dissociating the inactive CBP-RSK1 complex. Nuclear FGFR1 also binds to CBP and augments CBP-mediated transcription in a process that involves recruitment of RNA pol II and histone acetylation at the core promoter of an endogenous gene. These nuclear FGFR1-driven events allow activation of gene transcription and play a role in cell differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—pcDNA3.1 plasmids expressing wild type FGFR1, FGFR1(SP-/NLS) in which signal peptide was replaced by the SV40 large T antigen NLS, and their tyrosine kinase-deleted mutants were described by Peng et al.

Similarly, stimulation of endogenous TH or FGF-2 genes and their promoters by angiotensin II, cell depolarization, or by protein kinase C was mediated by nuclear FGFR1. These effects were mimicked by transfection of nuclear FGFR1(SP-/NLS) and prevented by deletion of the receptor TK domain (19.Stachowiak E.K. Fang X. Myers J. Dunham S. Stachowiak M.K. J.

The secreted type of PLA2, sPLA2, is a small (13-20 kDa), Ca2+-dependent, disulfide-rich protein composed of extremely diverse members present in venoms, digestive exudates, inflammation sites, various mammalian tissues, and in microorganisms. In mammals, 11 genes encoding distinct sPLA2 isozymes that display overlapping yet distinct tissue distributions have been identified through the extensive genomic search, but the precise roles for each individual isozyme largely remain to be specified. Group IB (sPLA2-IB) and group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) sPLA2s are the two well characterized sPLA2s, known as pancreatic and non-pancreatic/inflammatory sPLA2s, respectively. sPLA2-IB has been thought to be involved in the digestion of dietary phospholipids in the gastrointestinal tract (4Richmond B.L.

Recently, these sPLA2 isoforms have been implicated in neuronal apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo through the generation of reactive oxygen species generated in the course of arachidonic acid metabolism (10Yagami T.

Furthermore, in addition to these biological functions, which are dependent on their enzymatic activity, receptor-mediated actions of sPLA2-IB and sPLA2-IIA have also been proposed (14Lambeau G.

Groups X sPLA2 (sPLA2-X) is unique in that it has the prominent ability to liberate free fatty acids, including arachidonic acid, when added exogenously to the culture media of adherent mammalian cells, whereas other groups of sPLA2 do not, except for group V sPLA2 (17Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

This difference apparently results from the distinct interfacial binding affinity of sPLA2s toward phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich outer leaflet of mammalian plasma membrane, because sPLA2-X binds efficiently to vesicles rich in PC, and sPLA2-IIA exhibits very poor binding affinity for charge-neutral PC-rich vesicles in marked contrast to anionic vesicles and thus displays virtually no enzymatic activity to PC-enriched vesicles (18Singer A.G.

The distinct tissue distribution of sPLA2 enzymes, together with the variability in the substrate specificity, further argues for the existence of different physiological functions for each sPLA2 enzyme. The OGR1 subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), OGR1, G2A, GPR4, and TDAG8, displays unique ligand specificity in that they were initially proposed to recognize lysolipid molecules as ligands. OGR1 was shown to bind with high affinity to sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) (20Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and G2A and GPR4 were later reported to bind to SPC and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) with distinct affinities (21Kabarowski J.H.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41325-41335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Galactosylsphingosine (psychosine) was identified as a ligand for TDAG8 (23Im D.S. Heise C.E. Nguyen T. O'Dowd B.F. Lynch K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the respective receptors, these lysolipid ligands activate various second messenger pathways, including inositol phosphate accumulation, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and increase or decrease of cAMP content. More recently, however, these receptors have been shown to respond to changes in extracellular pH; Ludwig et al. (24Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) reported that OGR1 and GPR4 are proton-sensing receptors that accumulate inositol phosphate and cAMP, respectively, in response to acidic pH of the extracellular milieu. Furthermore, they described that SPC and LPC do not exert any effects on the generation of second messengers. Subsequently, pH-dependent activation of G2A (25Murakami N. Yokomizo T. Okuno T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 42484-42491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) showed that previously proposed ligand of G2A, LPC, inhibited pH-dependent accumulation of inositol phosphate in cells expressing G2A, whereas Wang et al. (26Wang J.Q. Kon J. Mogi C. Tobo M. Damirin A. Sato K. Komachi M. Malchinkhuu E. Murata N. Kimura T. Kuwabara A. Wakamatsu K. Koizumi H. Uede T. Tsujimoto G. Kurose H. Sato T. Harada A. Misawa N.

The latter authors also demonstrated that psychosine acts antagonistically to the pH-dependent generation of second messengers in GPR4- or OGR1-expressing cells. Thus, although the controversial results remain to be reconciled, they raise the possibility that OGR1 subfamily receptors can respond to proton in addition to lysolipid ligands, which act either agonistically or antagonistically depending on the experimental systems employed. Our previous work with fungal, bacterial, and bee venom sPLA2s has demonstrated that sPLA2s display neurotrophin-like neurite-inducing activity in PC12 cells (28Wakatsuki S. Arioka M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamasaki M. Kitamoto K. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Wakatsuki S. Yokoyama T. Nakashima S. Nishimura A. Arioka M. Kitamoto K. Biochim.

Unlike nerve growth factor (NGF), neuritogenesis of PC12 cells by sPLA2s was insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor K-252a. Conversely, inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channel or depletion of extracellular Ca2+, which were ineffective in blocking NGF-induced neuritogenesis, inhibited sPLA2-induced neurite outgrowth. Our subsequent work demonstrated that sPLA2-induced neuritogenesis requires the activation of src and ras proteins and is accompanied by the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (28Wakatsuki S. Arioka M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamasaki M. Kitamoto K. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of sPLA2s was required for induction of neurites, although direct addition of arachidonic acid (as well as oleic acid) failed to induce neurites. Also, inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase did not attenuate the neuritogenic activity of sPLA2. These results suggest that arachidonic acid release and subsequent conversion to eicosanoids is not involved in the neuritogenesis of PC12 cells. In contrast, we found that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), but not other lysophospholipids, induced neurite formation, suggesting that sPLA2 induces neurites via LPC generation (32Nakashima S. Ikeno Y. Yokoyama T. Kuwana M. Bolchi A. Ottonello S. Kitamoto K. Arioka M. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we first compared the neurite-inducing activity of a subset of sPLA2s and found that sPLA2-X exhibits potent neuritogenic activity as did the sPLA2s from other species. We then demonstrated that LPC was actually generated by sPLA2 treatment. To elucidate the mode of action of LPC, we modified the expression of G2A, a GPCR involved in LPC signaling, and found that the expression level of G2A correlates with the sensitivity of PC12 cells toward sPLA2 or LPC treatments. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that neuritogenic action of sPLA2 is mediated by LPC generation and subsequent activation of G2A.

PC12 Cell Culture and Neurite Outgrowth Assay—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, high glucose type, Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were passaged every 3-4 days and maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in humidified air. In a typical neurite-induction experiment, PC12 cells were seeded in the growth medium at 4.5 × 103 cells/cm2 in collagen type I-coated 24-well culture plates (BD Biosciences), allowed to grow for 24 h, and then supplemented with each of the various protein and/or non-protein additives specified in the text. When neuritogenesis in G2A-EGFP stable transfectants were examined, DMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) and indicated amount of LPC were used. After 24 h, neurite outgrowth was quantified by taking four random photographs/well; cells bearing processes longer than the cell diameter were judged as positive. The data are mean ± S.D. of at least two independent experiments. [3H]Oleic acid release from live PC12 cells was determined as described (32Nakashima S. Ikeno Y. Yokoyama T. Kuwana M. Bolchi A. Ottonello S. Kitamoto K. Arioka M. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The percent oleic acid release was calculated by dividing the total counts present in the medium by the sum of the counts measured in the medium and in the corresponding cell lysate; background radioactivity, measured in phospholipase-unsupplemented, control incubations was subtracted from each data point. Assay of Phospholipase-mediated LPC Release from Cells—PC12 cells grown at 1.0 × 105 cells/cm2 in 24-well culture plates were incubated for 24 h in the presence of [14C]choline chloride (0.75 μCi/ml) in 400 μl of DMEM containing sera. After washing three times with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline, cells were treated with sPLA2 and PLB for 4 h at 37°C. When the culture supernatants of COS1 cells transfected with each sPLA2 construct were examined, they were adjusted to 5% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum by 2-fold dilution with fresh DMEM containing 10% horse serum, and were applied to the PC12 cell culture. Culture media were then recovered, and cells were washed and suspended in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Lipids were extracted with 600 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), and the organic phase was separated by silica TLC, using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (60:30:8:5, v/v). Radioactive lipids were visualized and quantified using a fluorescence image analyzer (FLA3000, Fuji). RT-PCR—The expression of GPCR mRNA in the mouse brains and PC12 cells were examined by RT-PCR. Total RNA (15 μg) extracted from the mouse brains at various stages of development or PC12 cells 24 h after seeding was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT16-30) primer and PowerScript™ reverse transcriptase (Clontech, catalog no. 8460-1). An aliquot of cDNA corresponding to 1 μg of total RNA was used as a template for the PCR reaction (94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; then 72 °C for 3 min) using the specific primer sets corresponding to GenBank™ sequence of mouse G2A (G2As1: 5′-GGTGACTGCTTACATCTTCTTCTGC-3′ and G2Aas1: 5′-CTGTGTGGATTCTGGACACTTCTTG-3′), OGR1 (5′-TCTGGCCCAAAGATGGGGAACATCA-3′ and 5′-AGCCCACGCTGATGTAAATGTTCTC-3′), GPR4 (5′-ATATCAGCATCGCCTTCCTGTGCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGCCACACAATTGAGGCTGGTGAA-3′), TDAG8 (5′-TGGACTTTCTCTCCCACCTTGTGCA-3′ and 5′-AGTACAGAATGGGATCGGCAACACA-3′), β-actin (5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA-3′ and 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACT-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′). cDNA Cloning and Isolation of Stable Transfectants—Rat G2A, mouse GPR4, and TDAG8 cDNAs were amplified by PCR using Pfx DNA polymerase and cDNA libraries from PC12 cells (G2A) and mouse fetal brain (GPR4 and TDAG8) as templates. The following oligonucleotides were utilized as amplification primers: 5′-tcgcaagcttATGAGATCAGAACCTACCAA-3′ and 5′-tatgaattcGGCAGAGCTCGTCAGGCAGTC-3′ for G2A; 5′-atgtaagcttATGGACAACAGCACGGGCAC-3′ and 5′-tatgaattcGCTGTGCCGGGGGCAGCAGCA-3′ for GPR4; 5′-cgctaagcttATGGCGATGAACAGCATGTG-3′ and 5′-tatgaattcCGTCTATAATCTCTAATTCTA-3′ for TDAG8. Capital letters correspond to the coding regions, and lowercase underlined sequences indicate the HindIII and EcoRI sites used for cDNA cloning. Amplified cDNA fragments were digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and ligated to the pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), generating pEGFP-G2A, pEGFP-GPR4, and pEGFP-TDAG8. For localization studies, we used Neuro2A cells because the internalization of EGFP-tagged GPCRs were more easily detected in this cell line than in PC12 cells. Neuro2A cells were transfected with these plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 24 h, cells were starved for additional 24 h in serum-free medium and were subjected to various treatments in the final 2 h of incubation. They were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline and observed by fluorescence microscopy (BX52, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To generate stable PC12 cell transfectants, pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-G2A, pEGFP-GPR4, and pEGFP-TDAG8 were transfected into PC12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. At 24 h after transfection, cells were detached and re-plated at a 1:50 dilution into medium containing 1000 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After 12 days, G418-resistant clones were isolated, amplified, and tested for G2A-EGFP expression and for neurite outgrowth assay. Immunoblotting—PC12 cells were scraped and suspended in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 10% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue). An equal volume of cell lysates was subjected to SDS-PAGE immediately. SDS-PAGE was performed on 12.5% acrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody (1:5,000 dilution, Invitrogen, catalog no. R970-01) was performed according to the standard procedure. RNA Interference Experiment—The oligonucleotides used for expression of short hairpin (sh) RNA were (i) r1 sense, 5′-tttGTCCTACAAAGGAACGTGCcttcctgtcaGCACGTTTCTCTGTAGGACtttttggatc-3′; r1 antisense, 5′-ctaggatccaaaaaGTCCTACAGAGAAACGTGCtgacaggaagGCACGTTCCTTTGTAGGA-3′; (ii) r2 sense, 5′-tttGTGACAGCCTGCATCTTCTcttcctgtcaAGAAGATGTAAGCTGTCACtttttggatc-3′; r2 antisense, 5′-ctaggatccaaaaaGTGACAGCTTACATCTTCTtgacaggaagAGAAGATGCAGGCTGTCA-3′; (iii) r3 sense, 5′-tttGCTCAGTAATAGTCTGAGCcttcctgtcaGCTCAGGCTATCACTGAGCtttttggatc-3′; r3 antisense, 5′-ctaggatccaaaaaGCTCAGTGATAGCCTGAGCtgacaggaagGCTCAGACTATTACTGAG-3′; and (iv) m1 sense, 5′-tttGAGTAGTTCTGATGGTAGTgtgtgctgtccACCACCACCAGGACCACTCtttttggatc-3′; m1 antisense, 5′-ctaggatccaaaaaGAGTGGTCCTGGTGGTGGTggacagcacacACTACCATCAGAACTACT-3′. The central small letters indicate the 10- to 11-bp loop sequences. Underlined sequences are substitutions introduced in the sense strand of shRNA to stabilize the double strand RNA. Italicized nucleotides in m1 indicate mismatches at the single position to the rat G2A mRNA sequence. These oligonucleotides were dissolved in TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at 250 μm, and 20 μl each of sense and antisense DNA was mixed with 5 μl each of distilled water and 10× annealing buffer (1 m NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The mixture was heated in the boiling water for 5 min and spontaneously annealed by cooling down to the room temperature. The annealed double-stranded DNA was diluted by 4,000-fold in TE and ligated to pmU6pro vector (kindly provided by Dr. Dave Turner, University of Michigan) digested with BbsI and XbaI. The resultant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. These plasmids or the control plasmid pMT (which does not contain EGFP and shRNA sequences (32Nakashima S. Ikeno Y. Yokoyama T. Kuwana M. Bolchi A. Ottonello S. Kitamoto K. Arioka M. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), 2 μg each) were co-transfected with the equal amount of pEGFP-G2A into Neuro2A cells, which were subjected to RT-PCR and flow cytometry analyses 24 h after transfection. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science, catalog no. 3003230). The copy number of G2A transcript was quantified using the calibration curve drawn using the standard solution containing the fixed amount of the plasmid carrying G2A cDNA. Normalization was done against the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript. For the expression of shRNA sequences by adenovirus vector-mediated method, a HindIII-NotI fragment containing the U6 promoter, shRNA sequence, and SV40 poly(A) sequence was blunt-ended and ligated to the cloning site (SwaI site) of the adenovirus cosmid vector, pAxCAwtit (Riken DNA bank, catalog no. 3121). The resultant cosmid DNA was processed as described below. The recombinant adenoviruses thus prepared were infected to 1.0 × 106 PC12 cells grown in a 100-mm dish for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of 100, and 24 h after the infection, cells were processed for RT-PCR and neurite outgrowth experiments. In a single neurite outgrowth assay, more than 100 cells were counted for individual treatment. The data are mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Flow Cytometry—24 h after transfection, Neuro2A cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were detached from the culture dishes by trypsin. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, triturated by pipetting, and filtrated through the nylon membrane to prepare dissociated cell suspension. They were then subjected to flow cytometry analysis (BD LSR, BD Biosciences) in which ∼10,000 cells were counted. The areas counted for EGFP-positive and -negative cells were determined by control experiments conducted with cells transfected with pEGFP-N1 (positive control) and pMT lacking EGFP sequence (negative control), respectively. Adenovirus Vector Construction and Infection—A PCR-based mutagenesis protocol (33Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) was used to generate a silent mutation at Csp45I site in G2A, which is necessary for linearization of adenoviral vector. Using the pEGFP-G2A plasmid as a template, mutated DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using the following pairs of oligonucleotides as primers: G2A antisense (used for cDNA cloning)/mutant sense (5′-GTGTGACTTCGAGAACAGGCTGTAC-3′) and G2A sense/mutant antisense (5′-GTACAGCCTGTTCTCGAAGTCACAC-3′). Underlined nucleotides correspond to the silent mutation. The two resulting PCR fragments were mixed, followed by a second amplification, carried out with the G2A sense and antisense primers. The amplified DNA fragment thus obtained was then digested with HindIII and EcoRI and ligated to the pEGFP-N1 vector. The mutated G2A-EGFP fragment was blunt-ended and ligated to the SwaI site of pAxCAwtit. The resultant cosmid DNA (1 μg) was packaged in vitro using 6 μl of LAMBDA INN (Nippon Gene, catalog no. 317-01741), infected to Escherichia coli DH5α, and amplified. Cosmid DNA (10 μg) was then purified, linearized by digestion with Csp45I, and transfected to HEK293 cells grown in a 60-mm dish using 30 μl of TransFast (Promega, catalog no. E2431). Cells were recovered 24 h later in phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to a 100-mm dish, and grown in 10 ml of 5% FCS/DMEM. Five days after, DMEM containing 10% FCS (5 ml) was added. Every 5 days, 5 ml of culture medium was removed, and the same volume of fresh 10% FCS/DMEM was added until most of the cells became detached (typically 7-30 days). Then the cells and culture medium were harvested together, freeze-thawed, and centrifuged to obtain the adenovirus-enriched supernatants. Aliquots of the supernatants were added to fresh HEK293 cells, and the recombinant adenovirus was amplified by another 3 times. The resultant adenovirus-containing media were used as virus stocks, and the titers were determined by the 50% tissue culture infectious doses method, using the plaque forming assay with 293A cells. Typically, 109 plaque forming units/ml viral stocks were obtained. 24 h after plating, PC12 cells were infected with either adenoviral-EGFP or adenoviral-G2A-EGFP, each at a multiplicity of infection of 50. After infection, cells were incubated for another 24 h and were subjected to the neurite outgrowth assay as described above. Statistical Analysis—The results shown were from one experiment representative of at least two independent experiments, each done in triplicate. Data are presented as means (±S.D.). Differences were analyzed by Student's t test, and the values of p < 0.05 were taken as significant. The experiments with TLC plates, gels, and blots were carried out at least twice with duplicates, and one representative result is shown. Group X sPLA2 Induces Neurite Outgrowth in PC12 Cells via L-type Ca2+ Channel Activity—We previously reported that exogenously added fungal sPLA2, p15, induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells via L-type Ca2+ channel activity (32Nakashima S. Ikeno Y. Yokoyama T. Kuwana M. Bolchi A. Ottonello S. Kitamoto K. Arioka M. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when neuritogenesis by supernatants of COS1 cells transfected with mouse sPLA2s was examined, only the supernatant containing sPLA2-X, but not sPLA2-IB nor sPLA2-IIA, elicited neurites. To unequivocally show the neuritogenic response of PC12 cells by mammalian sPLA2s, we prepared purified, recombinant mouse sPLA2-IB and sPLA2-IIA produced by the bacu"
https://openalex.org/W1974196439,"CD44 plays a crucial role in cell migration, inflammation, and immune responses. Alteration in the levels of CD44 expression on monocytic cells by endotoxins and immunoregulatory cytokines may modulate the migration of immune cells to inflammatory sites and the development of immune responses. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), act as important regulators of CD44 expression in human monocytic cells. We previously demonstrated that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), differentially regulated LPS- but not TNF-α-induced CD44 expression in monocytic cells. In this study, our results suggest that the calcium signaling pathway, in particular calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK-II), is involved in TNF-α- but not LPS-induced CD44 expression. CD44 promoter analysis suggested the participation of distinct transcription factors AP-1 and Egr-1 in TNF-α- and LPS-induced CD44 expression, respectively. Furthermore, TNF-α-induced CD44 expression was regulated by AP-1 through the activation of the CaMK-II pathway, whereas LPS-induced CD44 transcription was regulated specifically by Egr-1 through JNK activation. Overall, the results suggest the involvement of two distinct and independent signaling pathways involved in the regulation of CD44 transcription that may represent potential targets for anti-inflammatory agents capable of inhibiting CD44-mediated cell migration.

CD44, an adhesion molecule, comprises a family of 85–200-kDa transmembrane glycoproteins that are widely expressed in a variety of cell types (1Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv.

Interaction of CD44 with its ligand, hyaluronan (HA), a component of the extracellular matrix, has been implicated in various biological and immunological phenomena such as leukocyte adhesion to high endothelial venules, leukocyte extravasation at inflammatory sites, cell activation, and hemopoiesis (2Naot D.

The multiple functions of CD44 have been attributed to its extensive molecular heterogeneity generated by alternate mRNA splicing and post-translational modifications (1Lesley J. Hyman R.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of bacterial endotoxin, contributes to the pathogenesis of sepsis and inflammation. It is established that mononuclear phagocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced syndromes and TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine, is involved in LPS-induced inflammatory responses (15Verhasselt V. Buelens C. Willems F. De Groote D. Haeffner-Cavaillon N. Goldman M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2919-2925PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have shown that TNF-α is a potent inducer of CD44 expression and a positive regulator of LPS-induced CD44 expression and CD44-HA interactions in monocytic cells (16Gee K. Kozlowski M. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37275-37287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Gee K. Lim W. Ma W. Nandan D. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kozlowski M. Kumar A. J.

The effect of cytokines on CD44 expression has been documented in different cell types (19Murakami S. Miyake K. June C.H. Kincade P.W. Hodes R.J. J.

Charrad R. Morimoto K. Le Bousse C. Clay D. Jasmin C. Smadja-Joffe F. Blood. 1997; 89: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, IL-5, a key mediator of asthma-related eosinophilic inflammation, has been shown to enhance CD44 expression in human eosinophils (22Dallaire M.J. Ferland C. Lavigne S. Chakir J. Laviolette M. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2002; 32: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and in murine B cells (19Murakami S. Miyake K. June C.H. Kincade P.W. Hodes R.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3618-3627PubMed Google Scholar). In human hematopoietic progenitor cells, IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor are cytokines that direct leukocyte development, and induce CD44-HA binding (21Legras S. Levesque J.P. Charrad R. Morimoto K. Le Bousse C. Clay D. Jasmin C. Smadja-Joffe F. Blood. 1997; 89: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IL-12 and IL-18 were found to modulate CD44-HA interactions in human T cells (23Sague S.L. Tato C. Pure E. Hunter C.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alterations in the levels of CD44 expression on mononuclear phagocytes by endotoxins and immunoregulatory cytokines may have profound effects on the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation and in the development of immune responses. Therefore, understanding the regulation of CD44 expression and characterizing the signal transduction events involved may lead to the development of strategies for the treatment of inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. During the last few years, the signaling pathways induced in monocytes following engagement of LPS with its cognate CD14-Toll receptor complex have been investigated (24DeFranco A.L. Crowley M.T. Finn A. Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1998; 397: 119-136PubMed Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction events involved in CD44 up-regulation are not well understood. There is some evidence to suggest the involvement of the calcium signaling pathway in CD44 expression on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated T lymphoma cells (25Sionov R.V. Naor D. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 503-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C were shown to regulate CD44 expression in neuroblastoma cells (26Fichter M. Hinrichs R. Eissner G. Scheffer B. Classen S. Ueffing M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our previous results demonstrated that the generation of HA-adhesive CD44 following TNF-α stimulation is regulated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in human monocytic cells (16Gee K. Kozlowski M. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37275-37287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Egr-1 transcription factor has been implicated in the transcription of CD44 in murine B cells (27Maltzman J.S. Carman J.A. Monroe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2283-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and in the IL-1stimulated human endothelial cell line ECV304 (28Fitzgerald K.A. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4920-4927PubMed Google Scholar). However, CD44 transcription following IL-1β stimulation was found to be regulated by AP-1 in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (29Foster L.C. Wiesel P. Huggins G.S. Panares R. Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Perrella M.A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel 22-bp regulatory element found in the upstream regulatory region of the CD44 gene was implicated in epidermal growth factor-stimulated murine fibroblasts (30Zhang M. Wang M.H. Singh R.K. Wells A. Siegal G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14139-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK pathway regulated LPS, but not TNF-α-induced CD44 expression in human monocytic cells (17Gee K. Lim W. Ma W. Nandan D. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kozlowski M. Kumar A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5660-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further define the signaling pathways that distinguish regulation of LPS- and TNF-α-induced CD44 expression, we examined the role of calcium signaling in the up-regulation of CD44 expression in human promonocytic THP-1 cells as a model system. Our results suggest a distinct role for the calcium pathway, in particular, calmodulin (CaM)/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK-II) activation in the regulation of TNF-α, but not LPS-induced CD44 expression. To further understand the involvement of CaM/CaMK-II and JNK in the regulation of CD44 transcription, we analyzed the CD44 promoter to identify the potential transcription factors involved. These results suggest for the first time that TNF-α and LPS induce CD44 expression through two distinct and independent signaling cascades without any evidence of cross-talk between the two pathways. TNF-α regulates CD44 expression specifically by AP-1 through CaM/CaMK-II activation. In contrast, LPS regulates CD44 transcription selectively by Egr-1 through JNK activation. Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and Reagents—THP-1, a promonocytic cell line derived from a human acute lymphocytic leukemia patient, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Five to 15% of these cells express CD14 on their surface.

Endotoxin free preparations of pCaMK-IIγB and control vectors were used to transfect cells. Flow Cytometry Analysis—CD44 expression was determined by flow cytometry as described earlier (17Gee K.

Briefly, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD44 mAbs and isotype (IgG2b)-matched control antibodies (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). The gates were set in accordance with gates obtained with the isotype-matched control antibodies and mean fluorescence intensity was determined. Data were acquired on a BD FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using the WinMDI version 2.8 software package (provided by J. Trotter, Scripps Institute, San Diego, CA). Ca2+ Influx—Cells were washed with Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature and resuspended in buffer A (RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7). The cells were washed again and resuspended in buffer A containing 1 mm Fluo3/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 1 mm Me2SO and 3.75% Pluronic F-127 solution (Sigma) followed by incubation in the dark for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of buffer B (buffer A containing 5% fetal bovine serum, pH 7.4) followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and resuspended in buffer B at a final concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml followed by analysis for Ca2+ levels by the FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with CellQuest software, version 3.2.1fl. Cell samples were maintained at 37 °C during data acquisition. Intracellular Ca2+ levels at baseline and following treatment with various inhibitors were measured. Construction of Luciferase Reporter Vectors—A series of human CD44 promoter fragments (–1109 to +53; GenBank™ accession number AH003670) were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR as described earlier (31Ma W.

The amplified fragments were subcloned into the PCRII-TOPO vector, and the sequences were confirmed. The correct insertions were subcloned into the NheI and HindIII polylinker site of pGL3B (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequences were confirmed again. All DNA sequencing was performed by the Biotechnology Research Center (University of Ottawa).

Chambers K. Angel J.B. Kozlowski M. Kumar A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of the test plasmid and 0.5 μg of pSV-βgalactosidase vectors (Promega) were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with 4.5 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent in 100 μl of serum-free Isocove's modified Dulbecco's medium to allow formation of DNA-liposome complexes. These complexes were added to the cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) in a 6-well plate (Falcon). Cells were cultured for 15 h prior to stimulation with LPS or TNF-α followed by measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using luciferase and β-galactosidase assay kits (Promega) in a Bio Orbit 1250 Luminometer (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) and spectrophotometer, respectively. Measurement of CaMK-II Activity—The CaMK-II assay was performed using a CaMK-II kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 2 h followed by stimulation of cells with either LPS or TNF-α for 10 min. Cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaF, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.7), 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. CAMK-II activity was assayed by using a peptide substrate (KKALRRQETVDAL) specific for CaMK-II. Total proteins (200 μg) were mixed with 10 μl of CaMK substrate, 0.4 μm each of peptide inhibitors for protein kinase A and protein kinase C, and 100 μCi of MgCl2-[γ-32P]ATP in ADB II buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm CaCl2). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The phosphorylated substrate was separated from the residual [γ-32P]ATP using P81 phosphocellulose paper. The papers were washed twice in 0.75% H3PO4 and once in acetone for 2 min, and were placed in 24-well Wallac plates (Turko, Finland) in scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting using a Microbeta counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). Blanks to correct for nonspecific binding of [γ-32P]ATP and its breakdown products to the phosphocellulose paper and controls for phosphorylation of endogenous proteins in the sample were performed. CaMK-II activity was measured as counts/min/μg of protein and calculated as pm as per the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described earlier (31Ma W. Lim W. Gee K. Aucoin S. Nandan D. Kozlowski M. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kumar A. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stimulated either with LPS or TNF-α in the presence or absence of inhibitors added 2 h prior to stimulation. Cell pellets were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C with buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.9)) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets containing the nuclei were suspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA and 25% glycerol) at 4 °C for 15 min. Both buffers A and B contained the proteolytic inhibitors at 0.5 mm each of dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotonin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The nuclear extracts (5 μg) were mixed with 32P-labeled AP-1 or Egr-1 oligonucleotide probes for 20 min and the resulting complexes were separated on a 5% nondenaturing gel. To illustrate specificity of bound complexes, parallel EMSA reactions were incubated with 50–200-fold excess of unlabeled specific and nonspecific probes for 20 min prior to the addition of labeled probe. Supershift experiments were also performed using specific mouse anti-AP-1 or anti-Egr-1 antibodies (0.5–1.0 μg each) (Santa Cruz). The Egr-1 and AP-1 oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: Egr-1, 5′-GCACGGGGCGGGGGCAGAGGGGCC-3′ and AP-1, 5′-GCGGGCTGCTTAGTCACAGCCCCC-3′. Differential Involvement of JNK MAPK and the Calcium Signaling Pathways in LPS- and TNF-α-induced CD44 Expression, Respectively—In this study, we confirmed our earlier observations and demonstrated the involvement of JNK in LPS-, but not in TNF-α-induced CD44 expression in human monocytes, THP-1 (Ref. 17Gee K. Lim W. Ma W. Nandan D. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kozlowski M. Kumar A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5660-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and data not shown), and THP-1/CD14 cells (Fig. 1). Both LPS and TNF-α induced JNK phosphorylation in THP-1/CD14 cells and this phosphorylation was inhibited by the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 in a dose-dependent manner (Ref. 17Gee K. Lim W. Ma W. Nandan D. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kozlowski M. Kumar A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5660-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and data not shown). Furthermore, treatment with SP600125 inhibited LPS-induced CD44 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas TNF-α-induced CD44 expression remained unaffected even at the highest dose of SP600125 (Fig. 1). To determine the molecular mechanisms involved, we investigated the role of the calcium signaling pathway in the induction of both LPS- and TNF-α-induced CD44 expression. LPS-induced CD44 expression in primary human monocytes is complex and is regulated by the interaction of LPS with its CD14-Toll receptor complex and endogenously produced cytokines TNF-α and IL-10 following LPS stimulation (17Gee K. Lim W. Ma W. Nandan D. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kozlowski M. Kumar A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5660-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. J.

The signaling pathways involved in LPS-induced CD44 expression in primary monocytes could not be investigated because of the inherent endogenous IL-10 production following LPS stimulation, and the ability of IL-10 to enhance CD44 expression in monocytes (17Gee K. Lim W. Ma W. Nandan D. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kozlowski M. Kumar A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5660-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of the calcium signaling pathway in the regulation of LPS- and TNF-α-induced CD44 expression in IL-10-refractory THP-1/CD14 cells as a model system. We first determined whether LPS and TNF-α activated calcium signaling by examining calcium influx by flow cytometry using Fluo-3 as a binding dye. Both LPS and TNF-α induced calcium flux after 12 min of stimulation which was inhibited by EGTA, a calcium chelator, to basal levels (Fig. 2). The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was used as a positive control. To determine the effect of EGTA on CD44 expression, cells were treated with EGTA (2.5–10 mm) for 2 h prior to stimulation with either LPS or TNF-α for 24 h. Interestingly, EGTA inhibited TNF-α-induced CD44 expression in a dose-dependent manner without any effect on LPS-induced CD44 expression (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Involvement of calcium signaling pathway in TNF-α- but not LPS-induced CD44 expression. THP-1/CD14 cells (0.5 × 106/ml) were treated with various concentrations of EGTA (2.5–10.0 mm), APB (10–50 μm), or SKF-96365 (10–50 μm) for 2 h prior to LPS (1 μg/ml) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml) stimulation for 24 h.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4218) Google Scholar). Most but not all effects of DAG reflect its interaction with proteins containing C1 domains, resulting in their activation and/or driving their membrane translocation. Reflecting the importance and diversity of its downstream effectors, DAG is involved in signal transduction of numerous physiological and pathological processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance (2Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These functions have focused attention on C1 domain-containing proteins as molecular targets for cancer chemotherapy (3Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The interaction between DAG and its receptors is typically mediated by a DAG-responsive motif called a “C1 domain” (4Geiger M. Wrulich O.A. Jenny M. Schwaiger W. Grunicke H.H. Uberall F. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2003; 5: 631-641PubMed Google Scholar). The highly conserved C1 domain (∼50 amino acids) is a cysteine-rich zinc finger structure (5Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) that was first identified in protein kinase C (PKC) as the interaction site for DAG and the phorbol esters (6Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4868-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The PKC family of serine/threonine protein kinases comprises the best studied mediators of DAG signaling. 8 of its 11 family members have DAG-responsive C1 domains: (i) the conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) and (ii) the novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ). Both the classic and novel PKCs contain a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain. The regulatory domain contains a pseudosubstrate domain, which occupies the catalytic site of the kinase domain and inhibits the kinase activity. Binding of DAG to the C1 domain completes a hydrophobic surface on the C1 domain, favoring its interaction with the membrane. The twin consequences are membrane translocation, controlling access to substrates, and a conformational change in PKC, removing the pseudosubstrate domain from the catalytic site, thereby activating the enzyme (7Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In addition to the PKC family, five other families of proteins (PKDs, RasGRPs, chimaerins, Munc13s, and DGKs) have been recognized with C1 domains responsive to DAG (7Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The protein kinase D (PKD/PKCμ) family represents kinases superficially similar to PKC; however, the kinase domains are not homologous and show different selectivity. The PKDs lack the pseudosubstrate domain, show different spacing between their C1 domains, and contain a membrane-interacting pleckstrin homology domain (8Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PKD is activated upon phosphorylation by PKC, with its C1 domains driving membrane localization. The Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein family members (RasGRP1 to 4) function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ras or Rap, leading to their activation (9Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16612-16617Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The chimaerins are GTPase-activating proteins for Rac, leading to Rac inhibition. The Munc13 proteins are involved in the priming of vesicle fusion, and finally the DAG kinases function to abrogate DAG signaling, thus providing a negative feedback regulatory loop for the DAG signaling pathway (7Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Not only may DAG receptor families have complementary or antagonistic functions, but the same may be true within families. For example, PKCδ is growth-inhibitory in NIH3T3 cells, whereas PKCα and PKCϵ are growth-stimulatory (2Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 3Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, complementary therapeutic strategies are to inhibit a specific PKC isoform or to stimulate an antagonistic isoform. For this latter approach, activators selective for different DAG receptors are needed. A further level of complexity is that the conventional and novel PKCs, unlike the other classes of DAG receptors, have tandem C1 domains. It is becoming increasingly clear that different C1 domains may have different recognition properties and functions (14Irie K. Nakahara A. Nakagawa Y. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kashiwagi K. Saito N. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Hughes K.M. Beheshti M. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6137-6144PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, compounds selective for individual C1 domains may have unique effects compared with less selective ligands (14Irie K. Nakahara A. Nakagawa Y. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kashiwagi K. Saito N. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Among the DAG receptors, particular attention has focused on PKC family members as therapeutic targets, because PKC isozymes play important roles in cell proliferation, tumor growth, and apoptosis (2Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For example, elevated levels of PKCα, PKCγ, PKCϵ, and PKCζ have been found in central nervous system tumors (2Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKCα and PKCβ has been reported in breast cancer cells (2Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and PKCβ is elevated in chemotherapy-resistant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (16Shipp M.A. Ross K.N. Tamayo P. Weng A.P. Kutok J.L. Aguiar R.C. Gaasenbeek M. Angelo M. Reich M. Pinkus G.S. Ray T.S. Koval M.A. Last K.W. Norton A. Lister T.A. Mesirov J. Neuberg D.S. Lander E.S. Aster J.C. Golub T.R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are data suggesting that some PKC isoforms, such as PKCδ, in many contexts promote apoptosis (17Brodie C. Blumberg P.M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). An underlying problem with the inhibition of PKC kinase activity as a therapeutic strategy is achievement of sufficient selectivity among serine/threonine specific protein kinases with homologous catalytic sites. A complementary strategy that we are pursuing has therefore been to design modulators targeted to the C1 domains. Dramatic variation in PKC behavior is provided through variability in the residues at the binding site in the C1 domains themselves, variation in other portions of the C1 domain that interact with the membranes, variations in other regions of the receptor that affect the membrane interactions (e.g. the pseudosubstrate region, the C2 domain, or the C terminus), differences in the lipid composition of different subcellular membranes, and differences among cells in membrane composition and in interacting proteins (3Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Multiple classes of high affinity ligands for PKCs have been described. These ligands include the diterpenes such as the phorbol esters, macrocyclic lactones such as the bryostatins, polyacetates such as aplysiatoxin, or indole alkaloids such as teleocidin (3Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, with the exception of the indole alkaloids, the complicated structures of these ligands have impeded their further development through medicinal chemistry. An alternative strategy, therefore, has been to use DAG derivatives in which the flexibility of the structure has been constrained to reduce the entropic loss due to binding (3Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Using DAG-lactones, the Marquez group has been able to achieve potencies approaching those of phorbol esters (3Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The earlier natural products studies have highlighted the important role of the side chains in determining biological function. For example, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate is a tumor promoter, whereas 12-deoxyphorbol 13-acetate (prostratin) is an inhibitor of tumor promotion (18Szallasi Z. Krsmanovic L. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2507-2512PubMed Google Scholar), and these compounds induce distinct patterns of localization of PKCδ in CHO cells (19Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similarly, unsaturated side chains promote inflammatory activity by phorbol esters but diminish their tumor promoting activity (20Furstenburger G. Hecker E. Planta Medica. 1972; 22: 241-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, the Marquez group has developed a combinatorial approach for exploring extensively the chemical space represented by these side chains (21Duan D. Lewin N.E. Sigano D.M. Blumberg P.M. Marquez V.E. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 3248-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here, we described our characterization of one of the early compounds emerging from this combinatorial chemistry approach. We report that the novel DAG-lactone derivative 130C037 displays marked selectivity among the recombinant C1a and C1b domains of PKCα and PKCδ. Likewise, 130C037 displays substantial selectivity for RasGRP relative to PKCα. These results provide strong encouragement for this drug discovery strategy directed at targets with C1 domains. Materials—[20-3H]Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). PDBu and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Phosphatidyl-l-serine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Reagents for expression and purification of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were obtained from Pierce. Cell culture medium, reagents, and all of the DNA primers were obtained from Invitrogen. RasGRP3-GFP was generated as previously described (22Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The rabbit polyclonal anti-PKCα and anti-PKCϵ antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Bio-Rad. The recombinant human PKCα, PKCβ, PKCγ, PKCδ, and PKCϵ were purchased from Invitrogen. Construction of GST- and GFP-fused C1 Domains of PKCα and PKCδ—The C1a and C1b domains of PKCα and PKCδ were generated by PCR using the Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The full-length cDNA clones of bovine PKCα and murine PKCδ were used as the templates. The following oligonucleotides were used as the PCR primers to pull out the targeted C1 domains: (i) forward and reverse primers for αC1a were 5′-AACGTGCACGAGGTGAAGA-3′ and 5′-CTTGCTCCTCGGGTCATCT-3′; (ii) forward and reverse primers for αC1b were 5′-TGTCCGGGTGCGGATAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCTGTGTGATCCATTCCG-3′; (iii) forward and reverse primers for δC1a were 5′-AAACAGGCCAAGATCCACTACA-3′ and 5′-GGTGTCCCGGCTATTGGT-3′; (iv) forward and reverse primers for δC1b were 5′-CAGAAAGAACGCTTCAACATCG-3′ and 5′-GGCCTCAGCCAAGAGCTTT-3′. The blunt-ended PCR products were ligated into a pCR®-Blunt vector using the Zero Blunt® PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). The pCR®-Blunt vector was digested with EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) to produce adhesive ends of the C1 fragment. This fragment was then ligated into the appropriate fluorescent protein-containing vectors (i.e. pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-C2, and pEGFP-C3) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and GST-containing vectors (i.e. pGEX-5X-1, pGEX-5X-2, and pGEX-5X-3) (Amersham Biosciences), using the EcoRI restriction sites with the sequence of the insert in the intended reading frame. The DNA sequence of each construct was finally confirmed by sequencing analysis (DNA Minicore, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Health). Expression and Purification of the GST-tagged C1 Domains of PKCα and PKCδ—The recombinant plasmids of individual C1 domains of PKCα and PKCδ were transformed into BL-21-Gold (DE3) E. coli competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-O-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the OD of the LB medium (Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) reached 0.5-0.7. The bacteria were harvested after 4 h of induction at 37 °C. The expressed GST-tagged C1 protein was purified using a B-PER GST spin purification kit (Pierce). The purity of the protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. The protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The purified GST-C1 proteins were stored in 30% glycerol at -70 °C. [3H]PDBu Binding Assay—[3H]PDBu binding to the recombinant full-length PKC isoforms or the C1 domains of PKCα and PKCδ was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay developed in our laboratory (23Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 129-156PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture (250 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 4 mg/ml bovine immunoglobulin G, [3H]PDBu, 0.1 mm CaCl2 (for PKCα,-β, and -γ) and various concentrations of competing ligand. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min (for full-length PKC isoforms) or 18 °C for 10 min (for C1 domains). Samples were chilled on ice for 7 min, 200 μl of 35% polyethylene glycol in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was added. The samples were mixed and incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. The tubes were centrifuged in a Beckman Allegra 21R centrifuge at 4 °C (12,200 rpm, 15 min). A 100-μl aliquot of the supernatant was removed for the determination of the free concentration of [3H]PDBu, and the pellet was carefully dried. The tip of the centrifuge tube containing the pellet was cut off and transferred to a scintillation vial for the determination of the total bound [3H]PDBu. Cytoscint (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was added both to the aliquot of the supernatant and to the pellet. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. Standard Scatchard analysis was performed to determine the dissociation constants (Kd) of the individual C1 domains, and the inhibitory dissociation constants (Ki) were calculated using our standard method as described previously (23Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 129-156PubMed Google Scholar). Expression and Imaging of the GFP-tagged Fluorescent Protein in Live Mammalian Cells—LNCaP cells (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.05 mg/ml) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The plasmid DNA of GFP-fused individual C1 domains of PKCα and PKCδ or the plasmid DNA of RasGRP3-GFP, PKCα-GFP, and PKCϵ-GFP was transfected into LNCaP cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression of the fluorescent protein was detected after 24 h of transfection. Confocal fluorescent images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scan head (Bio-Rad) mounted on a Nikon microscope with a × 60 planapochromat lens. Excitation at 488 nm was generated by a krypton-argon gas laser with a 522/32 emission filter for green fluorescence. For kinetics of GFP-C1a/C1b, RasGRP3-GFP, PKCα-GFP, and PKCϵ-GFP translocation in live cells, cells plated on a 40-mm round coverslip were enclosed in a Bioptechs Focht Chamber System (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). The chamber was inverted and attached to the microscope stage with a custom stage adapter. A temperature controller set at 37 °C was connected, and medium was perfused through the chamber with a Lambda microperfusion pump. Sequential images of the same cells were collected at various time points using LaserSharp Software (Bio-Rad). Preparation of Cell Fractions and Immunoblot Analysis of Membrane Translocation of RasGRP3, PKCα, and PKCϵ in CHO-K1 Cells—CHO-K1 cells (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes. After drug treatment, the cell monolayer was washed once with culture medium followed by washing once with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (KD Medical, Inc., Columbia, MD). The cells were harvested with 400 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cell suspension was then sonicated in an Eppendorf tube three times with a pulse of 6 s each time. 200 μl of the sonication mixture was transferred to a Beckman ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h with a Beckman ultracentrifuge to separate the cytosolic and membrane fractions; the remaining 200 μl was used as the total cell fraction. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and 1% Triton X-100. The pellet suspension was put on ice for 1 h. 100 μl of lysis buffer plus 1% Triton X-100 was then added to the suspension. The mixture was sonicated three times with a pulse of 6 s each time. 200 μl of the sonication mixture was again subjected to centrifugation (200,000 × g for 1 h). This supernatant was designated as the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction. Membrane translocation of RasGRP3, PKCα, and PKCϵ in response to 130C037 was determined by Western blot and analyzed by quantitation of the reduction in the amount in the cytosolic fraction. Because of the unavailability of anti-RasGRP3 antibody, the response of RasGRP3 to 130C037 in CHO-K1 cells was detected by the overexpressed RasGRP3-GFP using anti-GFP antibody. Briefly, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). Blotting of membranes was performed with antibodies against PKCα, PKCϵ (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz), or GFP (for RasGRP3-GFP, mouse monoclonal; Roche Applied Science). Following washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), developed with ECL Western blot-detecting reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Bands were quantified densitometrically using ImageJ (NIH Image). In a typical membrane translocation assay, five concentrations of ligand were used. The ED50 of the ligand was calculated using nonlinear multiple regression to the Hill equation based on the reduction of proteins in the cytosolic fractions. Establishment of an HEK-293 Cell Line Stably Overexpressing RasGRP3—The coding sequence of human RasGRP3 (KIAA0846) was sub-cloned into the modified pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO® vector by using the pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO® cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This vector provides a V5 epitope tag at the C terminus of the RasGRP3. Lentivirus-containing culture supernatant was generated by using the ViraPower™ Lentiviral Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK-293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown on 10-cm tissue culture plates with 10 ml of complete medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC). After 80% confluence had been obtained, the culture medium was removed, and 10 ml of the collected retroviral supernatant containing 6 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) was added to the plate. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The medium-containing virus was then replaced by 10 ml of complete medium. After incubation for a further 24 h, the complete medium was replaced by the selection medium (complete medium containing 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen)). The fresh selection medium was replaced every 2 days until antibiotic-resistant colonies were identified. Studies were carried out on the pooled, antibiotic-resistant cells. Erk Activation in Response to PMA or 130C037—Cells were grown in 60-mm tissue culture plates and serum-starved overnight before treatment with a series of concentrations of 130C037 or PMA for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 0.2 ml of M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce). The lysates were collected and transferred to 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and the protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The samples, each containing 30 μg of total protein, were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the protein bands were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). After the membranes were blocked with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and 5% nonfat milk for 1 h, the blots were probed with anti-phospho-44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Then the blot was stripped and reblotted with anti-44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). The blots were then developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) and imaged on BioMax MAX films (Kodak). Chemical Structure of 130C037 and 130C032 as Novel DAG-lactones—As described in detail elsewhere, we have developed a combinatorial chemical approach for the synthesis of DAG-lactones (21Duan D. Lewin N.E. Sigano D.M. Blumberg P.M. Marquez V.E. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 3248-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As part of our further analysis of some of the initial compounds emerging from that program, two compounds showed atypical binding curves with PKCα and were therefore examined in detail. The structures of these compounds, 130C037 and 130C032, are illustrated in Fig. 1. Both compounds differ from most DAG-lactone or phorbol ester derivatives that have been described in the literature in that the sn-1 and sn-2 substituents possess polar groups (3Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 130C037 and 130C032 Yielded Biphasic Binding Curves with PKC Isoforms in Vitro—The binding of 130C037 and 130C032 to recombinant PKCα, PKCβ, PKCγ, PKCδ, and PKCϵ was determined in vitro by competition with [3H]PDBu (Fig. 2). Unlike typical competitive binding curves, these curves were shallow and multiphasic both for 130C037 (Fig. 2A) and 130C032 (Fig. 2B). In addition, particularly at higher ligand concentrations, they showed appreciable differences between PKC isoforms. This is most evident comparing the curves for the classic PKCs α, β, and γ and for the novel PKCs δ and ϵ at higher concentrations of 130C037. Of these two compounds, 130C037 showed a greater range of apparent potencies. When we analyzed the binding curves using a single site model, the apparent Ki values of 130C037 and 130C032 for the five PKC isoforms ranged from ∼30 to 350 nm (as shown in Table I). Because of the shallow nature of the binding curves, the calculated Ki values should be regarded as approximations.Table IApparent Ki values of 130C037 and 130C032 for binding to PKC isoforms competing with [3H]PDBuKi130C037130C032nmPKCα343 ± 35136 ± 25PKCβ181 ± 2561.6 ± 3.7PKCγ222 ± 42175 ± 21PKCδ91 ± 1675.3 ± 2.8PKCϵ28.8 ± 6.844 ± 13 Open table in a new tab Comparison of the Binding Affinities of 130C037 for Isolated C1a and C1b Domains of PKCα and PKCδ—Since some ligands have been found to show selectivity among individual C1 domains (14Irie K.

https://openalex.org/W2130856138,"Embryonic stem cells possess the ability to differentiate in vitro into a variety of cell lineages, including insulin-producing cells. Pancreatic beta-cells derive from foregut endoderm during embryonic development. However, previous reports using transgenic mice strongly indicate that insulin-positive cells may be generated also through the neuroectoderm pathway. To analyze this point, a culture system was performed in which only ectoderm committed cells were present. Based on published work, we achieved this by maintaining transfected clonal R1 mouse embryonic stem cells in monolayer in the absence of LIF. Contrary to differentiation protocols via embryoid body formation, monolayer cultured cells displayed ectodermal fates according to the marker gene expression pattern. Under these particular conditions, neomycin was added in order to select insulin-expressing cells. The cell lineage obtained expressed Pdx1, Pax6, Isl1, AChE, MBP, TH, and GS genes, confirming ectodermal commitment, even though some of these factors are also expressed in endoderm. In addition these cells displayed excitatory properties similar to astrocytes. Co-expression of insulin II and nestin was observed in monolayer culture and in the presence of specific conditioned media. No expression of early endodermal markers was detected along monolayer cultures. Altogether, these observations suggest that cells with ectoderm fates could participate in vitro in the derivation of insulin-producing cells. These results have implications for insulin gene regulation and hormone secretion in order to generate insulin-producing cells for replacement protocols in the treatment of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2036404203,"Interendothelial junctions are important regulators of endothelial cell functions such as migration and proliferation, major features in angiogenesis, and endothelial cell monolayer wound healing. 17beta-estradiol regulates these functions in vivo and in vitro and also increases endothelial monolayer permeability as it results from impaired monolayer integrity and intercellular adhesion. We hypothesized that 17beta-estradiol affects these cell adhesion-dependent functions in endothelial cells by targeting the adherens junction complex. Here, we show that 17beta-estradiol increases uterine microvascular endothelial cell monolayer permeability and transiently redistributes interendothelial junction-forming proteins in endothelial cells. Concomitantly, adherens junction proteins are disconnected from the cytoskeleton and alpha-catenin, which links VE-cadherin to the cytoskeleton, is redistributed from the membrane and the adherens junction complex. Furthermore, 17beta-estradiol increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the adherens junction complex. These effects were inhibited by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 but could be provoked using non-cell membrane-permeable 17beta-estradiol-BSA in all cells tested, including EA.hy 926 cells, which have been shown unable to stimulate 17beta-estradiol-dependent gene transcription. Additionally, 17beta-estradiol treatment enhanced the angiogenic effect of vascular endothelial growth factor in an in vitro angiogenesis model, as a potential implication of the adherens junction disruption. Cotreatment with the Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2 prevented the redistribution and phosphorylation of the adherens junction proteins. Taken together, our data show that adherens junctions in endothelial cells are a downstream target of membrane-associated 17beta-estradiol signaling, possibly through Src-family kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2087217438,"Slac2-c/MyRIP, an in vitro Rab27A- and myosin Va/VIIa-binding protein, has recently been proposed to regulate retinal melanosome transport in retinal pigment epithelium cells by directly linking melanosome-bound Rab27A and myosin VIIa; however, the exact function of Slac2-c in melanosome transport has never been clarified. In this study, we used melanosome transport in skin melanocytes as a model for retinal melanosome transport and analyzed the in vivo function of Slac2-c in melanosome transport by the ectopic expression of Slac2-c, together with myosin VIIa, in Slac2-a-depleted melanocytes. In vitro binding experiments revealed that myosin VIIa had a greater affinity for Slac2-c, compared with the binding affinity of myosin Va, and that the myosin VIIa-binding domain of Slac2-c is different from the previously characterized myosin Va-binding domain that is conserved between Slac2-a/melanophilin and Slac2-c. Consistent with this result, cyan fluorescent protein-tagged Slac2-c expressed in melanocytes was localized on melanosomes via the specific interaction with Rab27A and recruited co-expressed yellow fluorescent protein-tagged myosin VIIa to the melanosomes without interfering with the normal peripheral melanosome distribution, whereas when myosin VIIa alone was expressed in melanocytes, it was not localized on the melanosomes. Moreover, Slac2-c ectopically expressed in melanocytes did not rescue the perinuclear aggregation phenotype induced by the knockdown of endogenous Slac2-a with a specific small interfering RNA, whereas the expression of the Slac2-c·myosin VIIa complex supported the normal melanosome distribution in Slac2-a-depleted melanocytes, indicating that Slac2-c functions as a myosin VIIa receptor rather than a myosin Va receptor in melanosome transport. Based on these findings, we propose that Slac2-c acts as a functional myosin VIIa receptor and that the Rab27A·Slac2-c·myosin VIIa tripartite protein complex regulates the transport of retinal melanosomes in pigment epithelium cells. Slac2-c/MyRIP, an in vitro Rab27A- and myosin Va/VIIa-binding protein, has recently been proposed to regulate retinal melanosome transport in retinal pigment epithelium cells by directly linking melanosome-bound Rab27A and myosin VIIa; however, the exact function of Slac2-c in melanosome transport has never been clarified. In this study, we used melanosome transport in skin melanocytes as a model for retinal melanosome transport and analyzed the in vivo function of Slac2-c in melanosome transport by the ectopic expression of Slac2-c, together with myosin VIIa, in Slac2-a-depleted melanocytes. In vitro binding experiments revealed that myosin VIIa had a greater affinity for Slac2-c, compared with the binding affinity of myosin Va, and that the myosin VIIa-binding domain of Slac2-c is different from the previously characterized myosin Va-binding domain that is conserved between Slac2-a/melanophilin and Slac2-c. Consistent with this result, cyan fluorescent protein-tagged Slac2-c expressed in melanocytes was localized on melanosomes via the specific interaction with Rab27A and recruited co-expressed yellow fluorescent protein-tagged myosin VIIa to the melanosomes without interfering with the normal peripheral melanosome distribution, whereas when myosin VIIa alone was expressed in melanocytes, it was not localized on the melanosomes. Moreover, Slac2-c ectopically expressed in melanocytes did not rescue the perinuclear aggregation phenotype induced by the knockdown of endogenous Slac2-a with a specific small interfering RNA, whereas the expression of the Slac2-c·myosin VIIa complex supported the normal melanosome distribution in Slac2-a-depleted melanocytes, indicating that Slac2-c functions as a myosin VIIa receptor rather than a myosin Va receptor in melanosome transport. Based on these findings, we propose that Slac2-c acts as a functional myosin VIIa receptor and that the Rab27A·Slac2-c·myosin VIIa tripartite protein complex regulates the transport of retinal melanosomes in pigment epithelium cells. Rab27A is a member of the small GTPase Rab family (reviewed in Refs. 1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2662) Google Scholar and 2Segev N. Sci.

First, Slac2-a mediates the transfer of melanosomes from microtubules to peripheral actin filaments by interacting with Rab27A, myosin Va, and actin (11Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Second, Slp2-a links the melanosomes to the plasma membrane through interaction with phosphatidylserine and contributes to the accumulation of melanosomes at the periphery (or dendrites) of the cell (17Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These peripheral melanosomes are eventually transferred to adjacent keratinocytes by largely unknown mechanisms (18Seiberg M.

Loss of any one of the components of the protein complex (Rab27A, Slac2-a, myosin Va, and actin) causes abnormal melanosome accumulation around the nucleus of melanocytes in humans (20Pastural E.

Rab27A is also localized on melanosomes in mammalian retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (26El-Amraoui A. Schonn J.S. Kussel-Andermann P. Blanchard S. Desnos C. Henry J.P. Wolfrum U. Darchen F.

Azarian S.M. Lillo C. Kitamoto J. Klomp A.E. Steel K.P. Libby R.T. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4509-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of a different Rab27A effector(s) in RPE cells. We have recently identified Slac2-c as a homologue of Slac2-a and characterized it as a Rab27A-, myosin Va/VIIa-, and actin-binding protein (10Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43096-43103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Slac2-c was independently identified as MyRIP (myosin-VIIa- and Rab-interacting protein) by other groups by yeast two-hybrid screening of a human retina cDNA library using the tail region of myosin VIIa as bait (26El-Amraoui A.

Mutations in MYO7A cause the combination of blindness and deafness seen in human Usher syndrome type 1B and the abnormal distribution of retinal melanosomes and photoreceptor opsin that occurs in shaker-1 mice (29Gibson F.

In addition, melanosomes are absent from the apical processes of the RPE cells of ashen (rab27a-deficient) mice (27Futter C.E. Ramalho J.S. Jaissle G.B. Seeliger M.W. Seabra M.C. Mol. Biol.

Based on these observations, Slac2-c has been proposed to function as a linker protein between myosin VIIa and retinal melanosomes in RPE cells, although involvement of Rab27A·Slac2-c·myosin VIIa complex in melanosome transport in living cells has never been investigated. Despite its proposed function, Slac2-c has recently been shown to regulate granule exocytosis independently of myosin Va and myosin VIIa in pancreatic β cell lines (35Waselle L. Coppola T. Fukuda M.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1945-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and thereby the function of Slac2-c as a myosin receptor has been questioned. To address the question of whether Slac2-c actually acts as a functional myosin receptor, we first investigated the function of the Slac2-c·myosin VIIa complex in the transport of Rab27A-bound melanosomes in skin melanocytes as a model. Slac2-c had a much higher affinity for myosin VIIa than for myosin Va and colocalized with myosin VIIa on melanosomes. The expression of Slac2-c together with myosin VIIa in Slac2-a-depleted melanocytes restored the normal distribution of melanosomes from perinuclear aggregation, whereas the expression of Slac2-c alone did not. We discuss the possible function of Slac2-c·myosin VIIa complex in retinal melanosome transport based on these findings. Plasmid Construction—Deletion mutants of Slac2-c (pEF-T7-Slac2-c-ΔSHD/ΔABD and -MBD) were constructed by conventional PCR using the following oligonucleotides with a BamHI site (underlined) or a stop codon (in boldface type): 5′-CGGATCCCGTCTGGAGAGCGGTGCCTG-3′ (ΔSHD primer, sense), 5′-TCACAGGTACACGTTTTCTTCCA-3′ (ΔABD primer, antisense), 5′-CGGATCCTTGAGTAAGCTGTGCCCACC-3′ (MBD-5′ primer, sense), and 5′-CTACTGGTCCTCCCCAGAAG-3′ (MBD-3′ primer, antisense). Site-directed mutagenesis and construction of Slac2-c point mutants (pEF-T7-Slac2-cE14A and pEF-T7-Slac2-cEA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-resistant Slac2-a mutant (pEGFP-C1-Slac2-aSR) were also performed by PCR as described previously (38Fukuda M.

Other pEF expression vectors (pEF-FLAG-Rab27A, pEF-T7-Slac2-a, pEF-T7-Slac2-c, pEF-T7-Slac2-c-ΔSHD, pEF-FLAG-MC-myosin Va-tail (melanocyte-type), 3Myosin Va-tail used in this study contains melanocyte-specific exon F. and pEF-FLAG-myosin VIIa-tail) were prepared as described previously (7Kuroda T.S.

B16-F1 cells (one confluent 10-cm dish) were harvested and homogenized in a buffer containing 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm GTPγS, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A) in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer by 10 strokes at 900-1000 rpm, and the proteins were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h.

After washing the beads five times with 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, proteins trapped by the beads were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Rab27A mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-myosin Va rabbit polyclonal antibody (11Fukuda M.

Immediately prior to use, 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) was added to the medium. COS-7 cells and B16-F1 cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. FuGENE6 (1.5 μl/μg plasmid DNA; Roche Applied Science) and Lipofectamine PLUS reagents (Invitrogen) were used for transfection into melan-a and COS-7 cells, respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. For plasmid transfection and microscopic analysis, melan-a cells (7.5 × 104 cells, the day before transfection) were seeded on 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.), and the following amounts of plasmids were transfected into melan-a cells: 2 μg of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector (see Fig. 3, D-J) or 1 μg each of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) expression vector, and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expression vector (see Fig. 5, A-I). At 48-72 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (catalogue number 168-20955; Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) for 20 min. For immunostaining of myosin Va and Rab27A, melan-a cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X-100 for 2 min and blocked with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton-X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h. The cells were then immunostained with anti-myosin Va antibody (1:100 dilution) and anti-Rab27A antibody (1:50 dilution), followed by Alexa Fluor 568 and 633 secondary IgG, respectively (1:5000 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Fluorescence and bright field images were acquired and pseudocolored with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview; OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan), and the images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software (version 7.0).Fig. 5Melanosome transport through Rab27A·Slac2-c·myosin VIIa complex.A-H, YFP-myosin VIIa alone (A and B), CFP-Slac2-c together with YFP-myosin VIIa (C-E), or CFP-Slac2-c together with YFP-myosin VIIa-tail (F-H) was expressed in melan-a cells. CFP/YFP fluorescence and the corresponding bright field images of the cells were acquired with a confocal laser scan microscope. The insets show 3-fold magnified views of the boxed area (A-E). The arrowheads in A and B indicate the absence of myosin VIIa from melanosomes, whereas those in C-E indicate accumulation of Slac2-c and myosin VIIa on melanosomes.

The number of melanocytes showing perinuclear melanosome aggregation is expressed as a percentage of the number of melanocytes bearing CFP and YFP fluorescence. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments (n > 100).

In brief, bright field images of melan-a cells transfected with fluorescent vector(s) were obtained at random (more than 50 cells/dish, three independent dishes for each plasmid). Cells in which more than 50% of the melanosomes were located around the nucleus were judged to be “aggregated.” Data were expressed as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. siRNA—The siRNA expression vector against mouse Slac2-a (target site 5′-GAAGGAAATGGAGACAGTG-3′) was prepared as described previously (17Kuroda T.S.

Immunoblotting analysis with anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; MBL Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) and anti-actin (I-19) goat polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was performed as described above. Melan-a cells seeded on 35-mm glass bottom dishes were transfected with 1 μg each of siRNA expression vector and GFP-tagged protein expression vector and analyzed for melanosome distribution as described above. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5I, melan-a cells were first transfected with 1 μg each of pECFP-C1-Slac2-c and pEYFP-C1-myosin VIIa (or their control vectors) using FuGENE6. One day after transfection, the cells were then transfected with 2 μg of a chemically synthesized siRNA against the same site of mouse Slac2-a (5′-GAAGGAAAUGGAGACAGUGdTdT-3′, sense; B-Bridge International Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) to knock down endogenous Slac2-a molecules.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the precise myosin-binding domain of Slac2-c has not yet been identified; nor has it been determined whether the two myosins bind the same domain of Slac2-c. We therefore attempted to determine the myosin-binding domain of Slac2-c by a co-transfection assay using COS-7 cells. Consistent with the previous reports, Slac2-c interacted with the tail domain of both myosin Va and myosin VIIa irrespective of the presence of the N-terminal SHD (Fig. 1, B and C, middle panels, lanes 1 and 2). First we tested the myosin binding activity of the putative myosin Va-binding domain of Slac2-c (amino acid residues 409-602), which corresponds to the previously characterized myosin Va-binding domain of Slac2-a (amino acid residues 241-405) (10Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43096-43103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Kuroda T.S. Ariga H. Fukuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5245-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Unlike Slac2-a, however, this domain alone was insufficient for the interaction with myosin Va to occur (i.e. weak interaction between T7-MBD and myosin Vatail; Fig. 1B, middle panel, lane 4), suggesting that amino acid residues 409-602 may be the minimal essential myosin Va-binding domain but that an additional sequence is required for full myosin Va binding. We then tested the myosin Va binding activity of the whole middle domain of Slac2-c (ΔSHD/ΔABD; amino acid residues 146-701). To our surprise, however, the ΔSHD/ΔABD mutant did not interact with myosin Va-tail at all (Fig. 1B, middle panel, lane 3), indicating that the C-terminal ABD of Slac2-c is required for full interaction with myosin Va. On the other hand, the myosin VIIa-tail preferentially interacted with the ΔSHD/ΔABD mutant of Slac2-c rather than the full-length Slac2-c or the Slac2-c-ΔSHD mutant (Fig. 1C, middle panel, lane 3), but the putative MBD alone did not interact with myosin VIIa-tail at all (Fig. 1C, middle panel, lane 4). Additionally, since we previously showed that a conserved acidic cluster in the MBD of Slac2-a is required for myosin Va binding activity (12Kuroda T.S. Ariga H. Fukuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5245-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we prepared a similar mutant of Slac2-c (referred to as Slac2-cEA; see Fig. 1A) and tested its myosin Va/VIIa-tail binding activity.

Double-ring chaperonin complexes play a fundamental role in cellular protein folding (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

Based on their ability to bind unfolded polypeptides within their ring cavities, chaperonins prevent off-pathway reactions and promote productive protein folding to the native state in a highly cooperative, ATP-dependent manner. Type I chaperonins such as Escherichia coli GroEL are generally homo-oligomeric, require a ring-shaped co-chaperonin complex such as GroES for productive folding, and are found in prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (1Bukau B.

Type II chaperonins are found in Archaea and eukaryotes, are hetero-oligomeric, and do not require a GroES-like cofactor (4Spiess M. Meyer A.S. Reissmann S. Frydman J.

The eukaryotic chaperonin named TRiC 1The abbreviations used are: TRiC, TCP-1 ring complex; ϵANB, Nϵ-(5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyl); CCT, chaperonin containing tail-less complex polypeptide 1; RNC, ribosome-nascent chain complex. (for TCP-1 ring complex) or CCT (for chaperonin containing TCP1) consists of eight different, yet homologous, subunits per ring that are designated either α-θ or 1-8. Based on an analysis of chaperonin subcomplexes (8Liou A.K. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), a clockwise order for the arrangement of subunits in the ring has been proposed to be, moving clockwise, α/1, ϵ/5, ζ/6, β/2, γ/3, θ/8, δ/4, and η/7. All TRiC subunits are essential for viability in yeast (4Spiess M. Meyer A.S. Reissmann S. Frydman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and this raises a fundamental question: why did TRiC evolve different subunits if prokaryotes can mediate folding with homo-oligomeric chaperonins? One possibility is that certain TRiC subunits or combinations of subunits interact with substrates that have specific structural features or motifs, and that eight unique subunits provide a mechanism for accommodating a wider variety of substrates (9Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 10Llorca O.

But in fact, little is known about how TRiC interacts with its substrates. Several studies have examined how purified TRiC interacts in vitro with chemically denatured substrates, including actin and actin-derived peptides (10Llorca O. Martin-Benito J. Grantham J. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4065-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Meyer A.S. Gillespie J.R. Walther D. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Frydman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 369-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For instance, cryo-EM studies of binary complexes made by incubating purified and chemically denatured actin with purified TRiC suggested that TRiC-bound actin is in close proximity to only two subunits, δ and either β or ϵ (9Llorca O. McCormack E.A. Hynes G. Grantham J. Cordell J. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Fernandez J.J. Valpuesta J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These experiments further proposed that subdomain 2 of actin (amino acids 33-78) bound only to the δ subunit, whereas domain 4 (amino acids 179-261) bound to either subunit β or ϵ. Yet these approaches have two significant drawbacks. First, because high-resolution cryo-EM analysis relies on averaging particles that contain electron-dense material within the cavity, these experiments can only detect chaperonin proximity to compact, well defined, and stable structures in the substrate. Yet TRiC binding sites in the substrate may localize to flexible regions that are either not resolved or are averaged out during the single particle reconstruction, and hence are not seen. Second, analyzing chemically unfolded polypeptides does not appear to reproduce what happens in vivo (12Frydman J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It has been shown that multidomain proteins, such as luciferase, begin to fold cotranslationally even before the rest of the polypeptide has been synthesized and while its C terminus is still inside the ribosome (12Frydman J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several cytosolic chaperones such as Hsp 40, Hsp 70, GIMc, and TRiC (13Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 14McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) bind to nascent chains as they emerge from the ribosome, and it has been proposed that simultaneous protein synthesis and chaperone-mediated folding serve to maintain the nascent chains within a protected folding environment (15Thulasiraman V. Yang C.-F. Frydman J.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that chaperone interactions and nascent chain conformational states that occur during physiological folding are very different from those observed between chemically denatured, full-length proteins and purified chaperones. To understand how TRiC functions to fold its substrates in the cell, it is important to determine how these proteins interact with the chaperonin as they emerge from the ribosome. A powerful approach to address this issue is to incorporate photoactivatable probes directly into ribosome-bound polypeptides and thereby identify by light-induced photocross-linking the proteins adjacent to the nascent chain at the time of sample illumination (photolysis). We have previously used this approach to examine the environment of nascent chains inside the ribosome (16Woolhead C. McCormick P.J. Johnson A.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and during cotranslational targeting to (17Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, photocross-linking experiments demonstrated that ribosome-bound actin and luciferase nascent chains interact cotranslationally with TRiC (14McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether newly synthesized chaperonin substrates interact with all or only a restricted subset of TRiC subunits, we here exploited the photocross-linking approach to identify which subunits of the hetero-oligomeric chaperonin complex are in close contact with growing polypeptide chains. Ribosome-bound actin and luciferase chains of varying lengths were cross-linked to TRiC and its subunit-specific contacts were examined after dissociating the TRiC complex and immunoprecipitating with subunit-specific antibodies under denaturing conditions. Both actin and luciferase nascent chains were found to photocross-link to at least 6 of the 8 TRiC subunits. Furthermore, actin proximity to some TRiC subunits depended upon nascent chain length, thereby suggesting that the interactions with the chaperonin changed as the chain elongates. In addition, because a single site in subdomain 2 of actin photocross-linked to multiple subunits, the actin nascent chains appear to dynamically contact and sample different TRiC subunits during the folding process. Finally, a probe photocross-links to TRiC soon after emerging from the ribosomal tunnel, so TRiC must be in extremely close proximity to the ribosomal exit site during the early stages of translation, a result that is consistent with a chaperone-dependent protected folding environment. Plasmids, mRNA, and tRNA—Amber codons were introduced into plasmids coding for mouse β-actin and luciferase (14McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene), and the primary sequence of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Truncated mRNAs of defined lengths were transcribed as described elsewhere (21McCormick P.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Yeast Nϵ-(5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNALys (ϵANB-Lys-tRNALys) was prepared as before (17Krieg U.C.

Radiolabeled Cell Lysate—Human fibroblast TSA-201 cells were grown to 50% confluency, labeled overnight, and harvested as described (23Feldman D.E. Thulasiraman V. Ferreyra R.G. Frydman J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) except that cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and not minimal essential media. Fractions enriched in TRiC were isolated by gel filtration on Superose 6 and then immunoprecipitated with various subunit-specific antibodies as described below. Translations, Photocross-linking, and Immunoprecipitations—In vitro translations (26 °C, 40 min, 100 μl) were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate as before (14McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in the presence of 20 μCi of [35S]Met and either 60 pmol of ϵANB-Lys-tRNALys or 80 pmol of ϵANB-Lys-tRNAamb. Samples were photolyzed on ice for 15 min using a 500 watt mercury arc lamp (21McCormick P.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After photolysis, samples were incubated (26 °C, 10 min) with 2.2 μm RNase A, 20 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and 14.4 mm methionine. Following clarification by sedimentation, supernatants (110 μl) were added to 650 μl of buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 140 mm KCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate) to dissociate the TRiC complex (24Hynes G.M. Willison K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18985-18994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fresh ATP was then added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and 3-14 μl of the desired antibody were added before being rocked gently at 4 °C for 2-16 h. Affinity purified antibodies were raised against the β, δ, ϵ, ζ, and θ TRiC subunits using a unique C-terminal peptide for each (25Roobol A. Grantham J. Whitaker H.C. Carden M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19220-19227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas monoclonal antibodies against α were purchased from Stressgen. After sedimentation to remove aggregates, each supernatant (750 μl) received 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) in buffer A containing 10% (w/v) delipidated bovine serum albumin (Sigma) before being rocked for at least 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then pelleted, washed 3 times with 750 μl of buffer A, and resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer (65 °C, 30 min). After SDS-PAGE, radioactive species were detected and quantified using a Bio-Rad FX phosphorimager. Experimental Approach—McCallum and colleagues (14McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) previously showed that ribosome-bound actin nascent chains photocross-link to TRiC. Because the actin-TRiC photoadducts in that study were immunoprecipitated using native conditions, the TRiC subunits remained associated and it was not known which TRiC subunits were adjacent to the nascent chain. A higher resolution view of nascent chain processing by TRiC requires both identifying any nascent chain interactions with individual TRiC subunits and also determining the nascent chain length dependence of any interactions. Translation intermediates with nascent chains of a defined length were prepared in vitro by translating mRNAs that were truncated in the coding region. Ribosomes halt when they reach the ends of such mRNAs, but normal termination does not occur because of the absence of a stop codon. The nascent chain therefore remains bound to the ribosome as a peptidyl-tRNA in a ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC). Because the length of the nascent polypeptide is determined by the length of the truncated mRNA, one can examine nascent chain length dependence simply by preparing intermediates using truncated mRNAs of different lengths. If the nascent chain binds to a particular TRiC subunit, the two polypeptides must contact and be immediately adjacent to each other. Such an interaction can then be detected using a photocross-linking approach to monitor nascent chain proximity to individual TRiC subunits at a specific time (the time of illumination). We therefore incorporated a photoactivatable probe at one or more specific sites in the nascent chain by translating the mRNA in the presence of [35S]Met and either ϵANB-Lys-tRNALys or ϵANB-Lys-tRNAamb, tRNAs that recognize either a lysine or an amber stop codon, respectively. Upon illumination, a probe in an RNC-TRiC complex will react covalently for an extremely short period of time (ns) with any protein located adjacent to the radioactive nascent chain. Whereas the formation of a particular photoadduct only proves that the nascent chain was closely juxtaposed to that TRiC subunit at the time of probe excitation, the efficiency of photocross-linking will typically be much higher between two associated proteins than between two unassociated proteins. Furthermore, by altering the position of the probe in the nascent chains, as well as the length of the nascent chains, differences in the environment of the nascent chain can be detected. This approach provides a direct means of assessing the immediate environment and interactions of the nascent chain with individual TRiC subunits at different stages during the folding process, and, in effect, provides a snapshot at a particular instant of the nascent chain proximity and binding to individual TRiC subunits in the RNC-TRiC complexes that comprise the sample. Specificity of TRiC Antibodies—Because previous immunoprecipitations done under native conditions did not dissociate the TRiC complex into its subunits (14McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the identification of subunit-specific photoadducts required immunoprecipitation conditions that dissociated the TRiC complex. Yet this approach elicited two major concerns: would the antibody-epitope association survive denaturing immunoprecipitation conditions, and would antibody specificity be compromised by cross-reactivity with other subunits under the denaturing conditions. To address these concerns, immunoprecipitation specificity and stability were assessed using radiolabeled TRiC complexes. Human fibroblast TSA 201 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met overnight and then lysed, after which the cell contents were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography. TRiC-containing fractions were identified by immunoprecipitation under native conditions with antibodies raised against the β subunit (data not shown). Fractions containing radiolabeled TRiC were used to identify solvent conditions that dissociated the TRiC subunits, but retained antibody binding to their epitopes. As reported previously (24Hynes G.M. Willison K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18985-18994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a denaturing mixed micelles buffer completely dissociated TRiC and still allowed antibodies to specifically immunoprecipitate the subunits (Fig. 1). Under these conditions (“Experimental Procedures”), 7 of the 8 antibodies raised against unique mouse C-terminal peptides (26Hynes G. Kubota H. Willison K.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) also recognized the corresponding human TRiC subunits (Fig. 1). However, the antibodies that recognize the mouse η subunit were unable to recognize the human η subunit (Fig. 1). Similarly, sequencing of rabbit γ and η in the region of the epitopes (GenBank™ accession numbers AAR92488 and AAR92487) revealed that there were significant differences when compared with mouse sequences. Because the mouse-specific antibodies bound weakly or not at all to the rabbit γ and η subunits, 2A. Roobol, unpublished data. these antibodies served as negative controls. Because the human subunits do not contain equal numbers of methionine and cysteine residues, the observed difference in the intensities of the immunoprecipitated bands in Fig. 1 is not surprising. In addition, differences in antibody-epitope affinities probably contribute to the apparent variation in immunoprecipitation efficiencies, even though each of the polyclonal antibodies is affinity purified. But most important for this study and its goal of identifying the subunits that photocross-link to the nascent chain, six of the eight TRiC subunits were specifically immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions that dissociated TRiC, as evidenced by the different apparent molecular masses of the subunits and the presence of only a single primary radioactive species in each lane (Fig. 1). These conditions were therefore used for all experiments reported here after titrations determined the amount of each antibody that maximized the immunoprecipitation of its cognate TRiC subunit from a defined sample size (data not shown). Photocross-linking of Actin Nascent Chains to Individual TRiC Subunits—To determine which TRiC subunits are photocross-linked and hence adjacent to an actin nascent chain during folding, translation intermediates (RNCs) with a 220-residue actin nascent chain (actin 220-mer) were synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing endogenous TRiC, [35S]Met, and ϵANB-Lys-tRNALys. After photolysis, a sample was split into equal aliquots and immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions before analysis by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, efficient photocross-linking occurred between the actin 220-mer and both the α and β subunits of TRiC. Surprisingly, the photocross-linking of the actin 220-mer to δ was much less efficient, even though this nascent chain contained subdomain 2 of actin. Photocross-linking of the actin 220-mer to ζ or θ was also weak (Fig. 2), whereas photoadduct formation between the actin 220-mer and ϵ was visible upon longer exposure (see Fig. 6). Thus, nascent actin is in very close proximity to multiple TRiC subunits at this stage of translation and not only to δ as concluded from the cryo-EM analysis.Fig. 6Photocross-linking of TRiC β from different actin sites.A, RNCs containing actin 220-mers with a single ϵANB-Lys at positions 18, 50, 61, 68, or 84 were photolyzed, and photoadducts containing the β subunit were detected by immunoprecipitation and are indicated by the arrowheads.

Johnson A.E. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2033-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because the N-terminal 220 residues of actin include 10 lysines, it is likely that each such nascent chain will contain 2 or 3 photoactivatable probes. Hence, if a single nascent chain contacts two or more TRiC subunits at the same time, then it is possible that upon photolysis a nascent chain will react covalently with more than one TRiC subunit. In fact, based on the apparent molecular masses of some immunopreciptated photoadducts (Fig. 2, especially lane 2), the simultaneous photocross-linking of a single actin nascent chain to two TRiC subunits does occur. Thus, although the C-terminal subdomain 4 has not yet emerged from the ribosome in these RNCs, the actin nascent chain is adjacent to and probably interacts with the α, β, δ, ϵ, ζ, and θ subunits of TRiC, and a single nascent chain is adjacent to more than one subunit at a time. Nascent Chain Length Dependence of Actin Photocross-linking—Is the proximity of actin to a particular TRiC subunit dependent on the length of the nascent chain? RNCs containing nascent actin chains between 84 and 371 residues in length were photolyzed in the presence of TRiC, and the extents of nascent chain photocross-linking to 6 TRiC subunits were determined by immunoprecipitation (Table I). For example, nascent actin chains of 133 residues or longer were adjacent to δ, although the efficiency of photocross-linking varied (Fig. 3; for conciseness, only the δ data are shown). Whereas this variation could result from a nascent chain length dependence in actin association with δ and/or a variation in the positioning of nascent chain probes relative to the δ subunit as the nascent chain lengthens, the important point is that the nascent chain remains in close proximity to δ throughout the stages of folding examined.Table IActin photo-crosslinking to various TRiC subunits in the presence or absence of ATPNascent chain lengthPhotoadducts containing:αβδϵζθIn the absence of apyrase84−−−−−−133++++−−220++++++303++++++371++++++In the presence of apyrase84−−−−−−133++++−−220++++++303++++++371++++++ Open table in a new tab Actin photoadducts containing two TRiC subunits were not observed until the nascent chain was 220 residues long (Fig. 3), presumably because a larger number of lysines were required in the actin nascent chain to increase the likelihood of incorporating multiple photoreactive probes into a single nascent chain. Alternatively, only the longer actin nascent chains adopt a conformation that can be simultaneously recognized by two or more subunits. These double photoadducts then continued to be formed as the nascent actin lengthened, as was true of adducts containing only the δ subunit. The nascent chain length dependence of actin photocross-linking to α, β, and ϵ was similar to that of δ, and the results are summarized in Table I. But photocross-linking to ζ and θ was detected only after the actin nascent chain reached 220 residues; no photocross-linking to ζ and θ was observed with RNCs containing the actin 133-mer (Table I). Thus, at an early stage of actin folding inside TRiC, the nascent chain is photocross-linked to α, β, δ, and ϵ, but not to ζ or θ. Thus, it appears that nascent actin interacts differentially with the TRiC subunits at various times during the folding process. Nascent Chain Exposure to TRiC Subunits Is Not Dictated by ATP—ATP is hydrolyzed as TRiC catalyzes actin folding (4Spiess M. Meyer A.S. Reissmann S. Frydman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to determine whether the presence or absence of ATP significantly alters the accessibility of the actin nascent chain to individual actin subunits, as evidenced by the presence or absence of photoadduct formation. Because ATP is required for translation, RNCs containing actin nascent chains of different lengths were first prepared using ϵANB-Lys-tRNALys. Each sample was then split, and one-half was incubated with apyrase to hydrolyze any remaining ATP, while the other half was similarly incubated in the absence of apyrase. After photolysis, the extent of actin cross-linking to individual TRiC subunits was examined by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3, the presence or absence of ATP either increased or decreased the photocross-linking yield of a particular actin nascent chain to the δ subunit of TRiC, but did not alter the existence of nascent actin exposure to δ. Similarly, the proximities of different"

To address this, we used TgS transgenic mice constitutively overexpressing synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE-S) and presenting a complex phenotype of progressive neurodeterioration. T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) brain images appeared similar. However, diffusion-weighted MRI showed decreased baseline water apparent diffusion coefficient in the brains of TgS animals. Furthermore, contrast-enhanced MRI after gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) injection demonstrated slower recovery of normal signals in the TgS brains than with controls. Perfusion MR imaging and difference T1 maps calculated from pre- postcontrast T1-weighted MR images indicated accumulation of more Gd-DTPA molecules in the TgS brains than in the parent strain, reflecting impaired blood-brain barrier (BBB) functioning in these transgenic mice. To explore the molecular mechanism(s) underlying these global phenotypes, we performed microarray analysis in the stress-controlling prefrontal cortex of TgS vs. strain-matched wild-type animals. Profound overexpression of numerous ion channels, transporters, and adhesion genes was confirmed by real time RT-PCR tests. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses revealed corresponding increases in the level and cellular distributions of the chloride channel CLCN3 and the water channel AQP4, both of which contribute to BBB maintenance. Our study attributes to balanced cholinergic neurotransmission, a central role in the brain's maintenance of water diffusion and ion transport, and indicates that chronic impairments in this maintenance facilitate neurodeterioration through interference with BBB function."
https://openalex.org/W2055717324,"5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) catalysis is positively regulated by Ca2+ ions and phospholipids that both act via the N-terminal C2-like domain of 5-LO. Previously, we have shown that 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) functions as an agonist for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in stimulating 5-LO product formation. Here we have demonstrated that OAG directly stimulates 5-LO catalysis in vitro. In the absence of Ca2+ (chelated using EDTA), OAG strongly and concentration-dependently stimulated crude 5-LO in 100,000 × g supernatants as well as purified 5-LO enzyme from PMNL. Also, the monoglyceride 1-O-oleyl-rac-glycerol and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol were effective, whereas various phospholipids did not stimulate 5-LO. However, in the presence of Ca2+, OAG caused no stimulation of 5-LO. Also, phospholipids or cellular membranes abolished the effects of OAG. As found previously for Ca2+, OAG renders 5-LO activity resistant against inhibition by glutathione peroxidase activity, and this effect of OAG is reversed by phospholipids. Intriguingly, a 5-LO mutant lacking tryptophan residues (Trp-13, -75, and -102) important for the binding of the 5-LO C2-like domain to phospholipids was not stimulated by OAG. We conclude that OAG directly stimulates 5-LO by acting at a phospholipid binding site located within the C2-like domain. 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) catalysis is positively regulated by Ca2+ ions and phospholipids that both act via the N-terminal C2-like domain of 5-LO.

The mechanisms leading to activation of 5-LO in the cell are complex, and the enzymatic activity of 5-LO is tightly controlled. At its active site, 5-LO contains an essential nonheme-bound iron (3Rådmark O. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which, in the resting state, is in the ferrous (Fe2+) form and requires oxidation to the ferric (Fe3+) state to enter the catalytic cycle (4Hammarberg T.

In the absence of stimulating co-factors, 5-LO activity in vitro is low, and it has been found that Ca2+, ATP, and phospholipids are required for full enzyme activity (for review, see Refs. 1Werz O.

Nevertheless, the precise pathway(s) and regulatory mechanisms of 5-LO activation in the cell are incompletely understood.

Ca2+ and/or phospholipids can strongly augment 5-LO activity in vitro but also may have no stimulatory effect, which depends on the assay conditions (see Refs. 1Werz O. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm.

Chem. 1986; 261: 11512-11519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to facilitate membrane association and binding to PC vesicles (21Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol.

For stimulation by phospholipids, apparently only the zwitterionic PC and a non-physiological cationic phospholipid (but not phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, or diacylglycerol (DAG)) stimulate 5-LO reactions (27Puustinen T. Scheffer M.M. Samuelsson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 960: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Pande A.H. Moe D. Nemec K.N. Qin S. Tan S. Tatulian S.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14653-14666Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that 5-LO catalysis occurs at an interface between lipid and water, and the ratio of AA to phospholipid seems important for its activity (29Riendeau D. Falgueyret J.P. Meisner D. Sherman M.M. Laliberte F. Street I.P. J. Lipid Mediat. 1993; 6: 23-30PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies show that DAGs similar to OAG up-regulate agonist-induced 5-LO product synthesis in leukocytes, which in part might be due to increased availability of substrate for 5-LO (see Ref. 30Albert D. Bürkert E. Steinhilber D. Werz O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar and references therein). Recently, we found that OAG, not only primes leukocytes for enhanced 5-LO product synthesis upon subsequent agonist stimulation, but also functions as a direct agonist for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), stimulating, by novel undefined mechanisms (30Albert D. Bürkert E. Steinhilber D. Werz O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), 5-LO product formation in the presence of exogenously added AA. Thus, OAG-induced 5-LO activity is not connected with increased nuclear membrane association or Ca2+ mobilization, and inhibitors of kinases relevant for 5-LO activation fail to suppress the OAG effect. Here we demonstrated that OAG can directly stimulate 5-LO in vitro. The 5-LO stimulatory effect of OAG resembled that of Ca2+ and appeared to be mediated via a phospholipid binding site located on the C2-like domain of 5-LO. Materials—1-O-Oleyl-rac-glycerol (OG), 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (SAG), and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (EAG) were from Alexis (Grünberg, Germany). 1,2-Dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG), glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1 from bovine erythrocytes, OAG, and AA, were from Sigma. HPLC solvents were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Cells—Human PMNL were freshly isolated from leukocyte concentrates obtained at St. Markus Hospital (Frankfurt, Germany). In brief, venous blood was taken from healthy adult donors, and leukocyte concentrates were prepared by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min at 20 °C. PMNL were immediately isolated by dextran sedimentation, centrifugation on Nycoprep cushions, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes, as described previously (31Werz O. Bürkert E. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Steinhilber D. Blood. 2002; 99: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cells (108/ml; purity > 96–97%) were finally resuspended in PBS containing 1 mg/ml glucose. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of 5-LO Proteins in Escherichia coli—Site-directed mutagenesis of the pT3–5LO plasmid, encoding wild type 5-LO (wt-5LO), using the QuikChange™ kit from Stratagene yielded the mutated 5-LO plasmid pT3–5LO-N43A-D44A-E46A (referred to as loop2 mut-5LO) (19Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The codons for Trp-13, -75, and -102 were mutated in the same manner yielding the 5-LO mutant 3W mut-5LO. The mutated DNAs were confirmed using the DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences), followed by analysis on an Applied Biosystem PRISM 377 sequencer (carried out by KISeq, Core Facilities at Karolinska Institutet). E. coli MV1190 was transformed with mutated or wild type DNAs, and recombinant 5-LO proteins were expressed at 27 °C as described previously (19Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Preparation of 100,000 × g Supernatants and Purification of 5-LO Proteins—For purification of recombinant 5-LO proteins, E. coli was lysed by incubation in 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, soybean trypsin inhibitor (60 μg/ml), 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, and lysozyme (500 μg/ml), homogenized by sonication (three times for 15 s each), and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 15 min. Proteins including 5-LO were precipitated with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate during stirring on ice for 60 min. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 25 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. For purification of 5-LO from human PMNL, 5 × 108 cells were resuspended in 10 ml of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. After cooling on ice for 10 min, the cells were homogenized by sonication (three times for 10 s each). Whole homogenates of PMNL and the 16,000 × g supernatants from E. coli were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C, and the 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) was applied to an ATP-agarose column. The column was eluted as described previously (32Brungs M. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). S100 or purified 5-LOs were immediately used for 5-LO activity assays. Determination of 5-LO Product Formation in Cell-free Systems—To obtain whole cell homogenates of PMNL and corresponding S100, 108 freshly isolated PMNL were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, cooled on ice for 10 min, and sonicated (three times for 10 s each) at 4 °C. The whole homogenate was then centrifuged (100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C) to get the S100. For determination of 5-LO activity in whole homogenates or in S100 from PMNL (7.5 × 106 cells) or E. coli, 1 mm ATP, phospholipids, glycerides, and GPx-1/GSH were added as indicated. For determination of the activity of purified 5-LO from PMNL or E. coli, 5-LO (corresponding to 2 × 107 PMNL or 0.5 μg of 5-LO protein, respectively) was added to 1 ml of a 5-LO reaction mix (PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm ATP). After 5 min at 4 °C, the samples containing either homogenates, S100, or partially purified 5-LO were prewarmed for 30 s at 37 °C, and AA at the indicated concentrations with or without 2 mm CaCl2 was added to start the 5-LO reaction. For PMNL-S100 and purified 5-LO enzyme in the presence of Ca2+ or OAG (as well as without additives), maximum amounts of 5-LO products were formed within 6–8 min, remaining constant until ∼13–15 min (not shown), implying that a 10-min incubation is a suitable time period to assess 5-LO product formation. Thus, the reaction was stopped after 10 min with 1 ml of methanol. Formed 5-LO metabolites were extracted and analyzed by HPLC, as described previously (33Werz O. Steinhilber D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 5-LO activity in samples derived from PMNL is expressed as ng of 5-LO products/106 cells. In samples from E. coli, 5-LO activity is expressed as ng of 5-LO products/μg of protein. 5-LO products include LTB4 (in homogenates and S100 of PMNL) and its all-trans isomers, 5(S), 12(S)-DiHETE, 5-HETE, and 5-HPETE. 5-HETE and 5-HPETE co-elute as one major peak, and integration of this peak represents both eicosanoids. Cysteinyl LTs (LTC4, -D4, and -E4) were not detected, and oxidation products of LTB4 were not determined. Determination of Glutathione Peroxidase Activity—GPx activity was measured according to the indirect GSH reductase-coupled method described by Wendel (34Wendel A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). One unit of GPx activity was defined as the conversion of 0.5 μmol of NADPH to NADP+/min at 37 °C and 1 mm GSH. GPx activity is expressed as milliunits/106 cells. Statistics—The program GraphPad PRISM version 3.0 was used for statistical comparisons. Statistical evaluation of the data was performed using the Student's t test for unpaired observations. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. OAG Stimulates 5-LO in Vitro in the Absence of Ca2+—The effects of OAG on 5-LO activity in vitro were determined using whole PMNL homogenates and corresponding S100, as well as for partially purified 5-LO derived from PMNL. Under optimized assay conditions, i.e. the presence of 1 mm ATP and 1 mm Ca2+ and absence of GPx activity, OAG (10–100 μm) caused no enhancement of 5-LO product synthesis, regardless of the substrate concentration (2–40 μm AA) and the source of 5-LO (homogenates, S100, or purified 5-LO; Fig. 1A). In contrast, OAG slightly impaired 5-LO activity in a concentration-dependent manner. To determine whether OAG could activate 5-LO under suboptimal assay conditions, Ca2+ was excluded from the incubations, which resulted in reduced 5-LO activity in homogenates, in S100, and for purified 5-LO in particular at low substrate concentrations (<20 μm AA; compare also Ref. 23Bürkert E. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For 5-LO in homogenates, the activity was not increased by OAG (0.3–100 μm) in the absence of Ca2+. However, crude 5-LO in S100 or purified 5-LO was concentration-dependently up-regulated by OAG up to 8- and 14-fold, respectively (Fig. 1B). Significant effects of OAG were apparent already at 0.3 μm OAG, and maximal stimulation was observed at 30 μm. Simultaneous addition of OAG together with AA caused the same stimulatory effect on 5-LO (in S100 or purified enzyme) as compared with prolonged OAG preincubation for up to 60 min prior to AA addition (not shown). Moreover, OAG was able to up-regulate the activity of 12-LO from human platelets and 15-LO from eosinophilic PMNL (∼3–4-fold) in the absence of Ca2+, although to a lower extent as compared with 5-LO (Fig. 1C). In the presence of Ca2+, OAG also failed to stimulate 12- and 15-LO (not shown). In agreement with previous observations (23Bürkert E. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ on 5-LO activity is most pronounced when the substrate concentration is low, whereas at higher amounts of AA (≥20 μm), Ca2+ fails to increase 5-LO product synthesis (Fig. 1D). Similarly, OAG markedly increased 5-LO product formation at low AA concentrations (0.5–10 μm AA) but had no significant effect at AA concentrations ≥20 μm (Fig. 1E). In our previous report (26Bürkert E. Arnold C. Hammarberg T. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42846-42853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) we suggest that stimulation of 5-LO by Ca2+ is because of an increased affinity toward activating LOOH. In fact, the addition of 5-HPETE to PMNL-S100 concentration-dependently up-regulated the LTA4 synthase activity of 5-LO in the absence of Ca2+ or OAG (Fig. 1F). However, it should be noted that 5-HPETE could simply serve as the 5-LO substrate for LTA4 synthesis under these conditions, thereby increasing the amounts of LTA4 hydrolysis products. Phospholipids Abolish the 5-LO Stimulatory Effects of OAG—The fact that OAG stimulates 5-LO in S100 but not in homogenates led us to conclude that cellular membrane components of homogenates, i.e. phospholipids, may interfere with the action of OAG on 5-LO. S100, essentially devoid of phospholipid membranes, was supplemented with various phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine; 30 μg/ml each), and 5-LO activity was determined. All of the phospholipids suppressed the effects of OAG without inhibiting 5-LO in the absence of OAG (Fig. 2A). More detailed analysis showed that PC reduced the effects of OAG in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 ≈ 20 μg/ml) in S100 (Fig. 2B). For purified 5-LO (also essentially devoid of endogenous phospholipids), stimulation by OAG (10 μm) was almost completely blocked at 3 μg/ml of exogenously added PC (Fig. 2C). Effects of Various Glycerides on 5-LO Activity—Next, other glycerides structurally related to OAG were tested for 5-LO stimulation in PMNL-S100. In the absence of Ca2+, the monoglyceride OG, the diacylglycerol DOG, as well as the ether-linked O-alkyl-acylglycerol EAG caused 5-LO stimulatory effects in a dose-dependent manner, although the magnitude of 5-LO activation was less pronounced as compared with OAG (Fig. 3). Interestingly, SAG, which is a long chain DAG, failed to stimulate 5-LO. As observed for OAG, no 5-LO stimulation by OG, EAG, and DOG was detectable in the presence of Ca2+ (not shown). OAG Renders 5-LO Activity Resistant against GPx—It was found that Ca2+ renders 5-LO activity resistant against inhibition by GPx-1 (26Bürkert E. Arnold C. Hammarberg T. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42846-42853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We attempted to investigate whether OAG could mimic the effect of Ca2+, rendering 5-LO activity GPx-resistant. To restore GPx activity in cell-free assays, PMNL-S100 were supplemented with defined amounts of exogenously added GPx-1 (isolated from bovine erythrocytes), where traces of endogenous thiols derived from the intracellular environment of the PMNL serve as the co-substrate for GPx-1 to suppress 5-LO activity (26Bürkert E. Arnold C. Hammarberg T. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42846-42853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PMNL-S100 containing intrinsic GPx (∼2.8 milliunits GPx/106 cells (26Bürkert E. Arnold C. Hammarberg T. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42846-42853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) were supplemented with 1 mm GSH to reconstitute the activity of endogenous GPx enzyme by elevating the co-substrate concentration (compare Ref. 26Bürkert E. Arnold C. Hammarberg T. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42846-42853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous studies (26Bürkert E. Arnold C. Hammarberg T. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42846-42853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in the absence of Ca2+, 5-LO activity was dose-dependently suppressed by either exogenously added GPx-1 at low thiol concentrations (Fig. 4A) or by supplementation of GSH as the co-substrate for endogenous GPx (Fig. 4B). As observed previously (26Bürkert E. Arnold C. Hammarberg T. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42846-42853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), varying amounts of 5-LO enzyme in the incubations (derived from 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 × 106 PMNL) did not alter the degree of 5-LO inhibition by a fixed activity of GPx-1. The GPx-mediated 5-LO inhibition could be reversed by the addition of Ca2+, but OAG (30 μm) also counteracted the suppressive effect of reconstituted GPx activity. It should be noted that 20 μm AA was used, and at this substrate concentration, OAG is not capable of up-regulating 5-LO catalysis (compare Fig. 1E). Dose response studies (Fig. 4, C and D) revealed that 3–10 μm OAG are effective to partly reverse 5-LO inhibition because of GPx activity, and 30–100 μm OAG almost completely restored 5-LO activity. By means of a GPx activity assay, it was found that OAG (up to 100 μm) has no direct inhibitory effect on GPx (100 or 300 units/ml). Also, OAG is no source for LOOH, because no oxidation of the peroxide-sensitive dye 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, by itself, was detected (not shown). Reversal of GPx-1-mediated 5-LO inhibition was also evident for other glycerides, such as OG, DOG, EAG, and partially also for SAG (Fig. 4, E and F). Again as observed for OAG, these glycerides did not (EAG and SAG) or only slightly (OG and DOG) up-regulate 5-LO activity in the absence of GPx at 20 μm AA but effectively reversed GPx-mediated suppression of 5-LO. Mutation of the Phospholipid Binding Site within the C2 Domain Abolishes the Effects of OAG on 5-LO—The C2-like domain of 5-LO binds two Ca2+ ions, essentially via the residues Asn-43, Asp-44, and Glu-46 within the loop 2, and mutation of these three residues to alanine (loop2 mut-5LO) leads to diminished Ca2+ binding and a requirement for higher Ca2+ concentrations to stimulate 5-LO activity (19Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, the C2-like domain also binds PC and lipid membranes, which is conferred by tryptophan residues (Trp-13, -75, and -102) located in the putative Ca2+ binding loops (20Chen X.S. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 811-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and mutation of Trp-13, -75, and -102 to alanine causes strongly reduced affinity to PC vesicles (21Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It appeared possible that OAG acts via this putative phospholipid binding domain to stimulate 5-LO catalysis. The tryptophan residues Trp-13, -75, and -102 were mutated to alanine, referred to as 3W mut-5LO. In an ongoing study, we found that, in fact, PC is unable to stimulate the 3W mut-5LO under conditions where the activity of wt-5LO was enhanced by PC. 2A. Michel, D. Steinhilber, and O. Werz, manuscript in preparation. wt-5LO, loop2 mut-5LO, and 3W mut-5LO were expressed in E. coli, and stimulation of enzyme activity by OAG was examined. At 5 μm AA, the activity of wt-5LO in S100 (Fig. 5A) or of purified 5-LO enzyme (Fig. 5B) was concentration-dependently stimulated by OAG (up to 10-fold) in the absence of Ca2+, as observed for 5-LO derived from PMNL. In contrast, no such stimulatory effects of OAG (0.1–100 μm) were observed for the 3W mut-5LO, nor for crude enzyme in S100, nor for purified 5-LO. In control experiments, Ca2+ substantially increased the enzymatic activity of 3W mut-5LO. Interestingly, the activity of the loop2 mut-5LO was also up-regulated by OAG, showing that the intact phospholipid binding site (rather than the Ca2+ binding residues) is required for enzyme stimulation by glycerides. Moreover, we assessed the ability of OAG to confer 5-LO enzyme resistance against GPx-1. As shown in Fig. 5C, Ca2+ (but also OAG) restored GPx-1-suppressed pr"

https://openalex.org/W2061003243,"We have cloned two new triadin isoforms from rat skeletal muscle, Trisk 49 and Trisk 32, which were named according to their theoretical molecular masses (49 and 32 kDa, respectively). Specific antibodies directed against each protein were produced to characterize both new triadins. Both are expressed in adult rat skeletal muscle, and their expression in slow twitch muscle is lower than that in fast twitch muscle. Using double immunofluorescent labeling, the localization of these two triadins was studied in comparison to well-characterized proteins such as ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, desmin, Ca(2+)-ATPase, and titin. None of these two triadins are localized within the rat skeletal muscle triad. Both are instead found in different parts of the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum. We attempted to identify partners for each isoform: neither is associated with ryanodine receptor; Trisk 49 could be associated with titin or another sarcomeric protein; and Trisk 32 could be associated with IP(3) receptor. These results open further fields of research concerning the functions of these two proteins; in particular, they could be involved in the set up and maintenance of a precise sarcoplasmic reticulum structure."
https://openalex.org/W2024783194,"The c-myb gene encodes a transcription factor required for proliferation, differentiation, and survival of hematopoietic cells. Expression of c-Myb is often increased in hematological malignancies, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We show here that c-Myb has a longer half-life (at least 2-fold) in BCR/ABL-expressing than in normal hematopoietic cells. Such enhanced stability was dependent on a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt/GSKIIIβ pathway(s) as indicated by the suppression of c-Myb expression upon treatment with PI-3K inhibitors or co-expression with dominant negative Akt or constitutively active GSKIIIβ. Moreover, inhibition of GSKIIIβ by LiCl enhanced c-Myb expression in parental 32Dcl3 cells. Compared with wild type c-Myb, three mutants (Δ(358–452), Δ(389–418), and L389A/L396A c-Myb) of the leucine zipper domain had increased stability. However, only expression of Δ(358–452) was not affected by inhibition of the PI-3K/Akt pathway and was not enhanced by a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that leucine zipper-dependent and -independent mechanisms are involved in the regulation of c-Myb stability. Indeed, Δ(389–418) carrying four lysine-to-alanine substitutions (Δ(389–418) K387A/K428A/K442A/K445A) was as stable as Δ(358–452) c-Myb. Compared with full-length c-Myb, constitutive expression of Δ(358–452) and Δ(389–418) c-Myb in Lin-Sca-1+ mouse marrow cells increased cytokine-dependent primary and secondary colony formation. In K562 cells, expression of Δ(358–452), Δ(389–418), and L389A/L396A c-Myb led to enhanced proliferation after STI571 treatment. Thus, enhanced stability of c-Myb by activation of PI-3K-dependent pathway(s) might contribute to the higher proliferative potential of BCR/ABL-expressing and, perhaps, other leukemic cells.

In normal hematopoietic cells, there is compelling evidence in support of an important function of c-Myb, since ablation of c-Myb expression and/or activity by gene knockout or by antisense/dominant negative strategies has demonstrated that it is essential for fetal liver hematopoiesis, erythroid and myeloid bone marrow colony formation, and T-cell development (3Mucenski M.L.

Since the BCR/ABL oncoproteins of the Philadelphia chromosome have been shown to regulate protein levels by enhancing or suppressing proteasome-dependent degradation (24Dai Z. Quackenbush R.C.

This would also be consistent with the requirement of c-Myb for the proliferation and survival of CML progenitor cells (20Ratajczak M.Z. Hijiya N. Catani L. DeRiel K. Luger S.M. McGlave P.

In normal hematopoietic cells, c-Myb mutants without an intact C-terminal leucine zipper and lacking (or carrying a mutation of) four adjacent lysine residues potentially involved in ubiquitination were more stable than wild-type c-Myb, were less down-modulated by suppression of PI-3K 1The abbreviations used are: PI-3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IL, interleukin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; KL, Kit ligand; HA, hemagglutinin. activity, and caused markedly increased primary and secondary colony formation. Expression of the more stable c-Myb mutants led to enhanced proliferation of K562 cells resistant to STI571-induced apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that the enhanced stability of c-Myb may contribute to the increased proliferative potential of BCR/ABL-expressing and, perhaps, of other leukemic cells.

MigRI Δ(358–452) c-myb-HA was cloned by PCR amplification of pCMV c-myb-HA using primers designed to generate 5′ and 3′ c-myb fragments lacking the nucleotides corresponding to amino acid 358–452 of human c-Myb.

The 5′ fragment and the 3′ fragment were digested with KpnI and XbaI, respectively, and phosphorylated. Then the fragments were ligated to KpnI-XbaI-digested pcDNA3. After KpnI-XbaI digestion, the released insert was blunt-ended by Klenow and cloned into the HpaI-digested MigRI vector. MigRI Δ(389–418) c-Myb-HA was cloned by PCR amplification of pCMV c-Myb-HA as described above except that the 3′ primer of the 5′ c-Myb fragment was 5′-AGGTTCTTAACATTATCCAG-3′, whereas the 5′ primer of the 3′ c-Myb fragment was 5′-AACTTCCACCCCCCTCATT-3′. After KpnI-XbaI digestion, the released insert was bluntended by Klenow and cloned into the HpaI-digested MigRI vector. MigRI Δ(389–418) K442A/K445A c-myb-HA and MigRI Δ(389–418) K387A/K428A/K442A/K445A were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of MigRI Δ(389–418) c-myb-HA. MigRI L389A/L396A c-Myb-HA was generated by mutating leucine 389 and leucine 396 to alanines by site-directed mutagenesis of MigRI wild type c-Myb-HA. MigRI ΔR2-R3 c-myb-HA, MigRI ΔR2-R3/del (452–640) c-Myb-HA, and MigRI ΔR2-R3/del (358–640) c-myb-HA—The MigRI ΔR2-R3 c-myb-HA plasmid was obtained by PCR amplification from pCMV c-Myb-HA using primers designed to generate a 5′ c-myb fragment lacking amino acids 87–189 of c-Myb. The 5′ and the 3′ primers of the 5′ c-myb fragment were 5′-CCGGTACCATGGCCCGAAG-3′, which includes the underlined KpnI site, and 5′-GGTCCATGGCCCCTTGACAA-3′. This fragment was ligated to a 3′ segment of c-myb generated with the following primers: 5′ primer (5′-CGTCGGAAGGTCGAACAG-3′) beginning at nucleotide 565 immediately downstream of the DNA binding domain and a 3′ primer (5′-CCTCTAGATTATATCTCGACAGC-3′), which includes part of the HA tag, the stop codon, and the underlined XbaI site). The PCR products were digested with KpnI/XbaI into the pCMV vector. The released KpnI-XbaI c-myb was filled by Klenow and ligated into the dephosphorylated HpaI-digested MigRI vector. The MigRI ΔR2-R3/del (358–640) c-myb-HA plasmid was obtained by PCR amplification from pCMV ΔR2-R3 c-myb-HA using the KpnI/c-Myb 5′ primer (see above) and a 3′ primer designed to terminate at amino acid 357 of c-Myb and including the HA tag, a stop codon, and the XbaI restriction site. The PCR fragment was KpnI-XbaI-digested and ligated to a KpnI-XbaI-digested pcDNA3. After KpnI-XbaI digestion, the c-myb fragment was blunt-ended by Klenow and subcloned into a dephosphorylated HpaI-digested MigRI. The orientation was determined by nucleotide sequence. The MigRI ΔR2-R3/del (452–640) c-myb-HA plasmid was obtained by PCR amplification from pCMV ΔR2-R3 c-myb-HA using the KpnI/c-myb 5′ primer and a 3′ primer (5′-TGGGGTTCTAAAAACAGTATTTTCC-′), which ends in correspondence of amino acid 452 of c-myb and includes the HA tag, the stop codon, and the XbaI restriction site. The PCR product was KpnI-XbaI-digested and ligated into the KpnI-XbaI-digested pcDNA3 vector. After KpnI-XbaI digestion, the c-myb fragment was blunt-ended by Klenow and cloned into HpaI-linearized MigRI. MigRI GSKIIIβ-S9A-HA—To generate this plasmid, pCR 3.1 S9A GSKIIIβ-HA (kind gift of Dr. P. Klein, University of Pennsylvania) was digested by the EcoRI restriction enzyme, and the released fragment was subcloned into a dephosphorylated EcoRI-digested MigRI. The orientation of mutant S9A GSKIIIβ-HA was established by sequence analysis. pCMV-S9A GSKIIIβ—This plasmid was obtained by ligating the EcoRI fragment of pCR 3.1 S9A GSKIIIβ-HA at the EcoRI site of pcDNA3. pCMV c-Myb-HA—This plasmid was obtained from pSV c-myb as described (26Biroccio A.

CD34+ cells from leukophoresis of a CML-AP patient with roughly 20% double Philadelphia1 chromosome metaphases or from cord blood mononuclear cells were purified using the CD34 Multisort Kit (Milteny Biotec, Auburn, CA). Cells were kept overnight in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and human recombinant IL-3 (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (20 ng/ml), Flt-3 ligand (100 ng/ml), and Kit ligand (KL) (100 ng/ml) (Stem Cell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, Canada) prior to cycloheximide treatment. Normal murine marrow cells were obtained from the femurs of C57BL/6 mice after hypotonic lysis and enriched for lineage-negative (Lin-) hematopoietic precursors using the standard StemSep protocol (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Lin-Sca-1+ cells were obtained by flow cytometry-activated cell sorting using a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Sca-1 antibody (Pharmingen). K562 cells, a human cell line derived from a patient with CML blast crisis (30Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B.

For transient transfection, 293T cells were grown for 16–18 h to 70% confluence and transfected with 30 μg of plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation using the ProFection System (Promega). The empty pCMV plasmid was used to normalize for equal amounts of transfected DNA. 32Dcl3, 32D-BCR/ABL, and K562 cells expressing HA-tagged wild-type and mutant c-Myb in the MigRI vector (31Pear W.S.

Lin-Sca-1+ mouse marrow cells were cultured 24–48 h in the presence of IL-3 (2 ng/ml), KL (10 ng/ml), and Flt-3 ligand (5 ng/ml) before infection with the control or the c-myb retrovirus as described (31Pear W.S.

Western blots were performed using anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibody (clone 1-1; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-HA antibody (Bapco), and anti-HSP90 antibody. Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed (107 cells/100 μl of lysis buffer) in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm Na3Vo4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate) containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Lysates were obtained and processed for Western blotting as described (34Perrotti D. Iervolino A. Cesi V. Cirinnà M. Lombardini S. Grassilli E. Bonatti S. Claudio P. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6159-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After densitometric scanning of the band corresponding to c-Myb, the half-life of wild-type and mutant c-Myb was calculated using the formula t½ = (0.693xt)/ln(Nt/No) as described (22Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-mediated nickel chromatography (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) was performed under denaturing conditions as suggested by the manufacturer. Total RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). For Northern blot analysis, RNA (15 μg) was fractionated onto denaturing 1% agarose, 6.6% formaldehyde gels, transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to a radiolabeled c-myb cDNA fragment. Enhanced Stability of c-Myb in BCR/ABL-expressing Cells—To assess whether the BCR/ABL oncogene has an effect on c-Myb expression, we compared mRNA and protein levels of c-Myb in parental myeloid precursor 32Dcl3 cells and in cells expressing p210BCR/ABL (Fig. 1). By Northern blot, c-myb levels were essentially similar in cells grown in the presence of IL-3; upon IL-3 deprivation (8 h), c-myb mRNA levels decreased in parental but not in BCR/ABL-expressing cells. Compared with BCR/ABL-expressing cells, levels of c-Myb protein were lower in parental cells grown in the presence of IL-3 and became essentially undetectable after an 8-h starvation (Fig. 1A). Expression of c-Myb was restored by treatment of IL-3-starved 32Dcl3 cells with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (Fig. 1A), suggesting that IL-3 starvation promotes the degradation of c-Myb primarily via proteasome-dependent mechanisms. Together, these data suggest that the increased expression of c-Myb in 32D-BCR/ABL cells reflects, in part, enhanced stability. Thus, levels of c-Myb were assessed by Western blotting in cells treated with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. In parental 32Dcl3 cells, c-Myb expression was rapidly down-modulated and was essentially undetectable after a 2-h treatment (Fig. 1B); levels of c-Myb were clearly more stable in 32D-BCR/ABL cells in which they were almost unchanged at 2 h and still detectable after a 4-h treatment (Fig. 1B). The half-life of c-Myb was also measured in CD34+ cells from a patient in CML-AP with a double Philadelphia chromosome in roughly 20% metaphases; the kinetics of c-Myb expression was more similar to that of BCR/ABL-expressing than parental 32Dcl3 cells (Fig. 1B). Instead, the half-life of c-Myb from cord blood CD34+ cells was similar to that of 32Dcl3 cells (Fig. 1B). By densitometry analysis, the half-life of c-Myb was ∼25 min in normal cells and 55 min in BCR/ABL-expressing cells. The Stability of c-Myb Is Regulated by a PI-3K-dependent Pathway—To investigate pathways potentially involved in the regulation of c-Myb stability, parental and BCR/ABL-expressing cells were treated with inhibitors of the PI-3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and assessed for c-Myb expression at different times after treatment. The PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 markedly suppressed c-Myb expression in parental and BCR/ABL-expressing 32Dcl3 cells (Fig. 2A), whereas the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 (36Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) had no effect (Fig. 2B) at a concentration preventing extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in IL-3-treated 32Dcl3 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). The PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin also down-modulated c-Myb levels (not shown), confirming the involvement of a PI-3K-dependent pathway. GSKIIIβ is negatively regulated by PI-3K via Akt, and phosphorylation of GSKIIIβ recognition motifs (i.e. the GSKIIIβ motif of β-catenin) may promote substrate recognition and proteasome-dependent degradation (37Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Kattori K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested whether GSKIIIβ might be involved in the regulation of c-Myb stability by measuring c-Myb levels in parental and BCR/ABL-expressing 32Dcl3 cells treated with the GSKIIIβ inhibitor LiCl (38Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows that c-Myb expression is up-modulated in LiCl-treated parental 32Dcl3 cells, whereas no effect was detected in BCR/ABL-expressing cells, probably reflecting suppression of GSKIIIβ activity induced by the BCR/ABL-dependent constitutive activation of PI-3K/Akt. The involvement of the PI-3K/Akt/GSKIIIβ pathway in regulating c-Myb stability was also tested in cells ectopically expressing dominant negative Akt or constitutively active GSKIIIβ (39Van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). 293T cells (which do not express endogenous c-Myb) were co-transfected with HA-tagged c-Myb and a dominant negative Akt plasmid (K179M) or a constitutively active (S9A) GSKIIIβ mutant (39Van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). 36 h post-transfection, levels of c-Myb were measured in untreated cells and in cells treated with cycloheximide (3 h) to suppress protein synthesis. As indicated by the anti-c-Myb-HA Western blot (Fig. 3A), expression of dominant negative K179M Akt or the constitutively active S9A GSKIIIβ markedly down-modulated expression of HA-tagged c-Myb. As expected, the effect was even more apparent after cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 3A). The effect of constitutively active GSKIIIβ on endogenous c-Myb was assessed in GFP-sorted 32D-BCR/ABL cells transduced with the MigRI bicistronic retrovirus expressing S9A GSKIIIβ and GFP. Compared with cells transduced with the empty MigRI retrovirus, cells expressing GSKIIIβ S9A had markedly lower levels of endogenous c-Myb (Fig. 3B), consistent with the involvement of GSKIIIβ in regulating c-Myb stability. The Leucine Zipper Domain and Lysines 387 and 428 Are Involved in c-Myb Degradation—To identify the region of c-Myb that may be required for protein degradation, we utilized two approaches: ubiquitination assays of c-Myb mutants in 293T cells and analysis of mutant c-Myb expression in retrovirus-transduced hematopoietic cells. The DNA binding domain of c-Myb is heavily ubiquitinated and appears to be a target of the p53-regulated SIAH-1 ubiquitin ligase (40Tanikawa J. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Kanei-Ishii C. Nakai A. Matsuzawa S. Reed J. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15578-15585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated c-Myb mutants lacking repeat 2 and repeat 3 of the DNA binding domain and with C-terminal truncation of increasing length (see Supplemental Fig. 1). In 293T cells, ΔR2-R3 c-Myb and ΔR2-R3/del (452–640) c-Myb were ubiquitinated, but ΔR2-R3/del (358–640) c-Myb was not (Fig. 4A). Thus, ΔR2-R3/del (452–640) and ΔR2-R3/del (358–640) c-Myb were cloned in the MigRI bicistronic retrovirus and transduced in 32Dcl3 cells. Levels of the encoded truncated proteins were investigated by anti-HA Western blotting in cycloheximide-treated GFP-sorted cells. Expression of ΔR2-R3/del (452–640) c-Myb was much more rapidly down-modulated than that of ΔR2-R3/del (358–640) c-Myb (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the segment of c-Myb corresponding to amino acids 358–452 is involved in c-Myb turnover in normal 32Dcl3 cells. Thus, an internally deleted c-Myb cDNA lacking the nucleotides corresponding to amino acids 358–452 (Δ(358–452) c-Myb-HA) (see Supplemental Fig. 1) was cloned in the MigRI retrovirus and transduced in parental and BCR/ABL-expressing 32Dcl3 cells. GFP-positive cells were sorted and assessed for c-Myb-HA expression at different times after cycloheximide treatment. In 32Dcl3 cells, expression of wild-type c-Myb decreased early after cycloheximide treatment and was essentially undetectable at 1 h, whereas that of Δ(358–452) c-Myb-HA was readily detectable (only a 2–3-fold decrease at 1 and 2 h) (Fig. 4C), indicating that the leucine zipper/negative regulation domain of c-Myb is involved in regulation of its stability. Since amino acids 358–452 of c-Myb do not correspond only to the leucine zipper, two other mutants (Δ(389–418) c-Myb and L389A/L396A c-Myb) (see Supplemental Fig. 1) were generated to test more directly the involvement of this domain. The kinetics of expression of these two mutants in cycloheximide-treated 32Dcl3 cells was more similar to that of Δ(358–452) than wild-type c-Myb. However, expression of these two mutants was barely detectable at 2 h, a time point at which Δ(358–452) c-Myb was decreased only 3-fold compared with the untreated cells. Together, these data indicate that the leucine zipper of c-Myb is involved in protein degradation but suggest that other amino acids in the 358–452 segment play some role in further destabilizing c-Myb. Consistent with this interpretation, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 enhanced HA c-Myb levels in 32Dcl3 cells expressing the full-length c-myb (∼13-fold) or the Δ(389–418) and L389A/L396A c-myb mutants (3–5-fold) but had virtually no effect (1.5-fold increase) in cells expressing the Δ(389–452) c-myb (Fig. 4D). Thus, two additional mutants of Δ(389–418) in which 2 or 4 lysine residues were replaced by alanine (Δ(389–418) K442A/K445A and Δ(389–418) K387A/K428A/K442A/K445A) were generated and retrovirally transduced in 32Dcl3 cells. The stability of Δ(389–418) K387A/K428A/K422A/K445A c-Myb was essentially identical to that of Δ(358–452) c-Myb"
https://openalex.org/W2112867032,"β-TrCP is the F-box protein component of an Skp1/Cul1/F-box (SCF)-type ubiquitin ligase complex. Biochemical studies have suggested that β-TrCP targets the oncogenic protein β-catenin for ubiquitination and followed by proteasome degradation. To further elucidate the basis of this interaction, a complex between a 32-residue peptide from β-catenin containing the phosphorylated motif DpSGXXpS (P-β-Cat17–48) and β-TrCP was studied using Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments. These experiments make it possible to identify the binding epitope of a ligand at atomic resolution. An analysis of STD spectra provided clear evidence that only a few of the 32 residues receive the largest saturation transfer. In particular, the amide protons of the residues in the phosphorylated motif appear to be in close contact to the amino acids of the β-TrCP binding pocket. The amide and aromatic protons of the His24 and Trp25 residues also receive a significant saturation transfer. These findings are in keeping with a recently published x-ray structure of a shorter β-catenin fragment with the β-TrCP1-Skp1 complex and with the earlier findings from mutagenesis and activity assays. To better characterize the ligand-protein interaction, the bound conformation of the phosphorylated β-catenin peptide was obtained using TRansfer Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY (TRNOESY) experiments.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation is essential for various important biological processes including cell cycle progression, gene transcription, and signal transduction (1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). This work is based on the study of the oncogenic protein β-catenin (β-Cat), 1The abbreviations used are: β-Cat, β-catenin; β-TrCP, transducin repeat-containing protein; Cul1, Cullin 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; IκBα, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa Bα; INEPT, insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; P-β-Cat, phosphorylated β-catenin peptide; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; SCF, Skp1/Cul1/F-box; Skp1, suppressor of kinetochore protein; STD, saturation transfer difference; TRNOESY, transferred nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; TPPI, time proportional phase incrementation; WATERGATE, water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation; pS, phosphorylated Ser. which plays an essential role in the Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway and is an important component of cadherin cell-adhesion complexes (Fig. 1A). The abundance of β-catenin in the cytoplasm is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (3), and Wnt signaling is regulated by the presence or absence of the intracellular protein β-catenin. When Wnt signal is absent, the signal transduction pathway is off because β-catenin is rapidly destroyed. A large multiprotein machine normally facilitates the addition of phosphate groups to β-catenin by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). Phosphorylated β-catenin binds to a protein called β-TrCP and is then modified by the covalent addition of a small protein called ubiquitin. Proteins tagged with ubiquitin are degraded by the 26 S proteasome, the protein-recycling center of the cell. When cells are exposed to the Wnt signal, it binds to cell surface receptors. Receptor activation blocks β-catenin phosphorylation, and its subsequent ubiquitination by an unknown mechanism that requires the intervention of the Disheveled protein (Dsh). β-Catenin is thus diverted from the proteasome. It accumulates and enters the nucleus, where it finds a partner, a DNA-binding protein of the TCF/LEF family. Together, they activate new gene expression programs. In human colon cancer cells, inappropriate activation of the Wnt pathway initiates cell proliferation by activating genes encoding oncoproteins and cell cycle regulators (4Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 5Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Thus, the abnormal accumulation of β-catenin as a result of mutations, either in the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein or in β-catenin itself, is thought to initiate colorectal neoplasia and has been implicated in various human cancers. The formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates requires three enzymes that participate in a cascade of ubiquitin transfer reactions: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). β-Catenin contains a DSGXXS sequence that includes the phosphorylation site required for ubiquitination (3Aberle H.

Skp1/Cul1/F-box (SCF) complexes constitute a class of E3 enzymes that are required for the degradation of many key cellular proteins. β-TrCP is the F-box protein that functions as a receptor for target molecules such as phosphorylated β-catenin, phosphorylated IκBα (the inhibitor of the master transcription factor NFκB), and phosphorylated HIV-1 protein Vpu. The substrate specificity of SCF complexes is thus thought to be determined by the F-box protein (Fig. 1B). It has been shown that β-TrCP is a member of the WD40 repeat-containing family and specifically only recognizes β-catenin, IκBα, and Vpu as substrates when they are phosphorylated at both serine residues in the conserved DSGXXS motif (6Hattori K.

Human β-TrCP is composed of two main domains: an F-box near the N terminus involved in interaction with Skp1, which is a connecting factor to the other subunits of the SCF E3 ligase complex for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis; and at the C terminus, the seven WD repeats necessary and sufficient for binding phosphorylated protein substrates of β-TrCP. Hence, all substrates of β-TrCP, either viral like Vpu or cellular like IκBα, share this consensus motif, which is also present in many cellular signaling proteins. The structure of the SCF β-TrCP ubiquitin-ligase complex and its function are depicted in Fig. 1B. The phosphorylation of the motif on the two serine residues is required for interaction with β-TrCP, and the subsequent targeting of these substrates leads to their degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Thus, the elucidation of the mechanism involved in substrate recognition by β-TrCP upon phosphorylation of this DSGXXS motif is essential. In a previous study, we examined the structural influence of phosphorylation at the two sites Ser33 and Ser37 of the free 32-residue phosphorylated peptide (12Megy S. Bertho G. Gharbi-Benarous J. Baleux F. Benarous R. Girault J.P. Peptides. 2005; 26: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (hereafter referenced as P-β-Cat17–48, Fig. 1A). We now report the β-TrCP-bound conformation of P-β-Cat17–48 and its binding, studied by NMR methods. An array of one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic techniques was investigated for the structural characterization and spectral assignment of the ligand. To drive rationally new therapeutic approaches, an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of the interaction of phosphorylated β-catenin with β-TrCP is essential. NMR-based screening methods have been developed in the last few years to characterize the binding process (13Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). For binding ligands, an NMR approach (14Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar, 15Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 423-442Google Scholar), usually referred to as TRansferred Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (TRNOE) spectroscopy, is successfully applied to investigate the conformation of a ligand in its bound form. With regard to the structural analysis of the β-TrCP-bound conformations, TRNOESY experiments were recorded and were further completed by molecular modeling studies to determine the structural properties of the P-β-Cat17–48 peptide when bound to β-TrCP. A further technique, the Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR method, allows determination of binding epitopes (13Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 16Mayer T. Meyer M. Janning A. Schiedel A.C. Barnekow A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This method is based on magnetization transfer by protein signals and their relayed effect to ligand. During the saturation period, progressive saturation transfers from the protein to the ligand protons when the ligand binds to the target. The ligand protons nearest to the protein are most likely to be saturated to the highest degree and therefore have the strongest signal in the STD spectrum; whereas the ligand protons located further away are saturated to a lower degree, and their STD intensities are weaker. Therefore, the degree of saturation of individual ligand protons reflects their proximity to the protein surface and can be used as an epitope method to describe the target-ligand interactions (13Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 17Moller H. Serttas N. Paulsen H. Burchell J.M. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Eur. J.

Reson. 2003; 163: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, STD NMR experiments were performed to define the binding epitopes of the P-β-Cat17–48 peptide. A crystal structure of the complex involving a peptide derived from the β-catenin sequence and β-TrCP was recently published (19Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). It was interesting to compare the two structures. Comparing the x-ray complex with the experimental NMR data could lead to a selection of a particular model, especially in the absence of crystallographic information on the different models of the β-TrCP complexes. Reagents—β-Cat fragments (17–48): peptides β-Cat17–48 with the amino acid sequence DRKAAVSHWQQQSYLDSGIHSGATTTAPSLSG and P-β-Cat17–48 containing the phosphorylated sites 33 and 37, Ser(PO3H2), DRKAAVSHWQQQSYLDpSGIHpSGATTTAPSLSG were purchased from Neosystem Laboratories. The purity of the peptides (95%) was tested by analytical HPLC and by mass spectrometry. Purification of the WD Repeat Region from Human Protein β-TrCP— The β-TrCP protein was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The previously described construction (20Margottin F. Bour S. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) resulted in a fusion protein of ∼60 kDa corresponding to the 218 residues of the GST, an 18-mer linker, and the seven WD repeats (residues 251–569) of β-TrCP, hereafter named GST-β-TrCP. The expression, separation, and purification of GST-β-TrCP were accomplished following a standard GST fusion protein protocol that was previously described (21Coadou G. Gharbi-Benarous J. Megy S. Bertho G. Evrard-Todeschi N. Segeral E. Benarous R. Girault J.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14741-14751Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This amount of purified recombinant protein was then used to prepare the NMR samples. NMR Spectroscopy—1H NMR and STD spectra were recorded with a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer. Standard Bruker software was used to acquire and process the NMR data. NMR samples contained nonphosphorylated β-Cat17–48 or phosphorylated P-β-Cat17–48 with or without the GST-β-TrCP protein. They were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline solution, pH 7.1 (20 mm phosphate, 5% D2O, 0.02% NaN3). 1H NMR spectra were recorded at constant temperature (278 K). The NMR samples were adjusted to a protein concentration of 0.02 mm based on the visible absorption at 595 nm. A 150-fold ligand excess (3 mm) over binding sites were used throughout the studies. One sample control was prepared containing the β-Cat17–48 nonphosphorylated peptide with the GST-β-TrCP protein at the same ratio 150:1 as that used for the P-β-Cat17–48/GST-β-TrCP sample. A second negative control was done using P-β-Cat17–48 with the fusion protein GST-Nef (22Bodeus M. Marie-Cardine A. Bougeret C. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Resonances of the peptide were assigned, based on two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY experiments. Water suppression was achieved by WATERGATE (23Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts were referred to internal TSPD4, 3-(trimethylsilyl)[2,2,3,3-d4] propionic acid, sodium salt (Tables I and II). Two-dimensional TRNOESY spectra were recorded to determine the most favorable ratio for TRNOE effects, which was found to be 150:1. TRNOESY experiments were performed with mixing times of 100, 200, and 400 ms for molar ratios between 600:1 and 25:1. After optimization of the P-β-Cat17–48 peptide/protein ratio, the final sample was prepared with 0.5 mg of GST-β-TrCP protein (0.02 mm protein) and 5.2 mg of the P-β-Cat17–48 peptide (3 mm; 150:1 peptide/binding site ratio) in 500 μl of buffer. TRNOESY experiments were acquired in phase-sensitive mode using the States-TPPI method, with 4k points and 512 t1 increments, a relaxation delay of 1 s. The mixing time of the transferred NOE experiment was set to 200 ms according to the TRNOE build-up curves of P-β-Cat17–48 peptide in the presence of the GST-β-TrCP protein.Table IProton chemical shift assignments Proton chemical shift assignments at 278 K, pH 7.1, in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer of the P-β-Cat17–48 peptide with β-TrCP in ppm from TSPD4 are shown.

STD NMR spectra were acquired using a series of 40 equally spaced 50-ms gaussian-shaped pulses for selective saturation, with 1-ms delay between the pulses, and a total saturation time of ∼2 s. With an attenuation of 50 dB, the radio frequency field strength for the selective saturation pulses in all STD NMR experiments was 190 Hz. The frequency of the protein (on-resonance) saturation was set to the protein 1H NMR signals in the low frequency region -3 ppm. The off-resonance saturation frequency was set at 30.0 ppm. Subtraction of FID values with on- and off-resonance protein saturation was achieved by phase cycling. As no baseline distortion was observed, no T1ρ filter was applied to eliminate the background resonances of the GST-β-TrCP protein. A total relaxation delay (Aq + d1) of 3.4 s and 8 dummy scans were employed to reduce subtraction artifacts. 1k total scans (or 10k for a better signal to noise ratio) were collected. One-dimensional spectra were multiplied with exponential functions (LB = 2 Hz) and zero-filled two times. Relative STD values were calculated by dividing STD signal intensities by the intensities of the corresponding signals in a one-dimensional 1H NMR reference spectrum of the same sample recorded with 512 scans and similarly processed. For STD experiments, several control samples were prepared to verify the specificity of the interaction. We performed one-dimensional STD NMR experiments with P-β-Cat17–48 and other fusion proteins such as GST-Nef (22Bodeus M. Marie-Cardine A. Bougeret C. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or GST-N-Ter, which corresponds to the GST protein fused with the first 260 residues of the full-length β-TrCP protein, including the F-box, but not the 7 WD domains. These experiments resulted in no observable signal, proving the specificity of the interaction observed between P-β-Cat17–48 and the GST-β-TrCP fusion protein. Investigation of the time dependence of the saturation transfer with saturation times from 0.2 to 4.0 s showed that 2 s was leading to efficient transfer of saturation from the protein to the ligand protons. Two-dimensional STD inverse correlation (1H-13C)-phase-sensitive HSQC experiments were recorded using echo/anti-echo gradient selection with decoupling during acquisition (24Schleucher J. Schwendinger M. Sattler M. Schmidt P. Schedletzky O. Glaser S.J. Sorensen O.W. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional 1H/13C correlation were obtained via double INEPT transfer using TRIM pulse of 0.2-ms duration. One millisecond half-sinusoid echo/anti-echo gradients of 40, 10 G/cm with recovery delay of 200 μs were used. To select protons attached to carbon, a delay of 1.78 ms was optimum for C-H one-bond couplings: delay = 1/(4 1JC-H). This technique is optimized to obtain Cα-Hα correlations with a sensitivity enhancement. The spectra were recorded with 512 experiments of 2048 data points and 48 scans per t1 experiment. Subtraction of the on- and off-resonance spectra was made by phase cycling. The acquisition times for the two-dimensional experiments were typically around 20 h with a relaxation delay (Aq + D1) of 2.2 s. All spectra were processed with Bruker XWINNMR software. Two-dimensional spectra were multiplied with 90°-shifted squared sine bells in both dimensions and zero-filled two times in the F1 dimension. 512 and 2k points of linear prediction were added in the F1 dimension for NOESY or TRNOESY and for two-dimensional STD spectra, respectively. Structure Calculation—NMR spectra were analyzed with the FELIX software (Biosym Technologies). P-β-Cat17–48 chemical shifts were assigned using standard technique (25Wüthrich K. Sons J.W. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Distance restraints used in the structure calculations were derived from TRNOESY experiments performed with mixing times of 200 ms. As for the free ligand we obtained a NOESY spectrum at 100 ms with very few peaks and only intra-residue and sequential correlations at 200 ms. They were based on TRNOE peak volumes and were classified as strong, medium, weak, or very weak restraints, corresponding to distance restraints of 1.8–2.7, 1.8–3.6, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–6.0 Å, respectively. The distance between the two Tyr aromatic protons (2.42 Å) was used as a reference for calibration. The final list of distance restraints containing 455 restraints was incorporated for structure calculation with the standard protocol of ARIA 1.2 (26Nilges M. O'Donoghue S. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1998; 32: 107-139Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 27Linge J. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 28Brünger A.T.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). This program was used to compute the solution structure starting from an extended structure with random side chain conformation. All NOE cross-peaks from the TRNOESY spectra were used as input to ARIA. By default, ARIA calibrates distance restraints by computing the relaxation matrix from the NOE peak volumes and the chemical shift assignments (29Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A rotational correlation time of 8 ns for the peptide bound to the GST-β-TrCP protein was used for computation of the relaxation matrix. The simulated annealing protocol consisted of four stages: a high temperature torsion angle simulated annealing phase at 10,000 K (30 ps), a first torsion angle dynamics cooling phase from 10,000 K to 50 K (15 ps), a second Cartesian dynamics cooling phase from 2000 K to 50 K (27 ps), and a final minimization phase at 50 K. ARIA runs were performed using the default parameters with eight iterations. Twenty structures were generated each round, and the 10 lowest energy structures were carried to the next iteration. The peptide structures were determined and further refined using molecular dynamics with the PARALLHDG 5.3 parameters file. Modifications to the force field for the phosphorylated residues (pSer) were made with CHARMM (30Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13967) Google Scholar) and reported for molecular dynamics simulations. The residues, except the N-terminal Asp17, Gly34, Gly38, and Pro44, were constrained using 28 φ dihedral angles constraints between -20° and -180° (usually the only range considered in NMR-derived structures) (31Schibli D.J. Monelero R.C. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the region of a Ramachandran plot populated by nearly all non-glycyl residues. While ARIA allows the final structures to undergo a procedure in a simulated water box, it was decided that because of the presence of the bound peptide in the hydrophobic recognition sites this step was not applicable. After the final iteration, with ARIA software (OPLS force field) 20 structures were generated, and the 10 best with lower energies were retained as the final structures. The final list of distant restraints contained 455 restraints divided into 213 intra-residue, 150 sequential, 85 medium range, and 7 long range NOEs. Analysis of the ARIA results (Table III) was carried out using the aria.overview script (32Vranken W. Tolkatchev D. Xu P. Tanha J. Chen Z. Narang S. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8570-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The final PDB structures were analyzed and visualized with Procheck-NMR (33Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C.W.M.A.M. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (34Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

The set of P-β-Cat17–48 structures was selected for structural analysis according to good geometry and few NOE violations, and by eliminating those structures with φ, Ψ values in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot specified with Procheck.Table IIIStructural statistics of the final 10 NMR structures of P-β-Cat17–48 bound to the β-TrCP proteinARIAoutputNo. of exptl distance restraintsUnambiguous NOE350Ambiguous NOE105Total NOEs455Divided intoIntra-residue NOE213Sequential NOE150Medium range NOE85Long range NOE7No. of exptl broad dihedral restraints28NOE violations > 0.3 Å per structure1.6R.m.s.d.aCalculated by MOLMOL (Å) to a mean moleculeBackbone (all residues)5.6 ± 1.9Heavy atoms (all residues)6.0 ± 1.7Backbone (residues 21-36)2.0 ± 0.9Heavy atoms (residues 21-36)2.4 ± 0.8Ramachandran plot of residuesbCalculated by PROCHECK (%)In most favored regions35.2In additional allowed regions57.0In generously allowed regions7.4In disallowed regions0.4a Calculated by MOLMOLb Calculated by PROCHECK Open table in a new tab NMR Assignments for the P-β-Cat17–48/β-TrCP Protein Complex—Proton chemical shifts and resonance assignments were established using two-dimensional 1H, 1H TOCSY, and NOESY experiments and are reported in Table I. Sequential assignments of 1H resonances were based on characteristic sequential NOE connectivities observed between the α-proton of residue i and the amide proton of residue i+1, i.e. dαN(i,i+1), in the NOESY data set. The Arg18 (residue 2 in the peptide numbering) broad amide signal was not identified for the P-β-Cat17–48 peptide. In a similar way, it could not be observed in the study of the free peptide (12Megy S. Bertho G. Gharbi-Benarous J. Baleux F. Benarous R. Girault J.P. Peptides. 2005; 26: 327-34"
https://openalex.org/W1989238243,"To investigate the role of USF phosphorylation in the regulation of the PGHS-2 promoter in granulosa cells, promoter activity assays were performed in primary cultures of bovine granulosa cells transfected with the chimeric PGHS-2 promoter/luciferase (LUC) construct –149/–2PGHS-2.LUC. Transfections were done in the absence or presence of forskolin; the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89; or an expression vector encoding USF1, USF2, the catalytic subunit of PKA (cPKA), or a PKA inhibitor protein (PKI). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to study USF/DNA interactions using granulosa cell nuclear extracts and a 32P-labeled proximal PGHS-2 promoter fragment containing the E-box element. The results show that forskolin stimulation and cPKA overexpression caused a marked and significant increase in USF-dependent DNA binding and PGHS-2 promoter activities (p < 0.05). In contrast, both activities were decreased by H-89 treatment or PKI overexpression. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that these treatments had similar effects on endogenous PGHS-2 mRNA levels in granulosa cells. Cotransfection studies with a USF2 mutant lacking N-terminal activation domains (U2Δ1–220) repressed forskolin-, cPKA-, and USF-dependent PGHS-2 promoter activities. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that U2Δ1–220 was able to compete with full-length USF proteins and to saturate the E-box element. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot analyses revealed an increase in the levels of phosphorylated USF1 and USF2 after forskolin treatment, whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that binding of USF proteins to the endogenous PGHS-2 promoter was stimulated by forskolin. Site-directed mutagenesis of a consensus PKA phosphorylation site within USF proteins abolished their transactivating capacity. Collectively, these results characterize the role of USF phosphorylation in PGHS-2 expression and identify the phosphorylation-dependent increase in USF binding to the E-box as a putative molecular basis for the increase in PGHS-2 promoter transactivation in granulosa cells. To investigate the role of USF phosphorylation in the regulation of the PGHS-2 promoter in granulosa cells, promoter activity assays were performed in primary cultures of bovine granulosa cells transfected with the chimeric PGHS-2 promoter/luciferase (LUC) construct –149/–2PGHS-2.LUC. Transfections were done in the absence or presence of forskolin; the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89; or an expression vector encoding USF1, USF2, the catalytic subunit of PKA (cPKA), or a PKA inhibitor protein (PKI). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to study USF/DNA interactions using granulosa cell nuclear extracts and a 32P-labeled proximal PGHS-2 promoter fragment containing the E-box element. The results show that forskolin stimulation and cPKA overexpression caused a marked and significant increase in USF-dependent DNA binding and PGHS-2 promoter activities (p < 0.05). In contrast, both activities were decreased by H-89 treatment or PKI overexpression. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that these treatments had similar effects on endogenous PGHS-2 mRNA levels in granulosa cells.

Collectively, these results characterize the role of USF phosphorylation in PGHS-2 expression and identify the phosphorylation-dependent increase in USF binding to the E-box as a putative molecular basis for the increase in PGHS-2 promoter transactivation in granulosa cells. Prostaglandins are important regulators of a number of biological processes, including ovulation, which involves a complex series of biochemical events culminating in the rupture of the preovulatory follicle (1Armstrong D.T.

Update. 2004; 10: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Evidence for a relationship between prostaglandins and ovulation emerged in the 1970s, when studies in a number of species revealed a marked increase in the levels of follicular prostaglandins just prior to ovulation and the ability of indomethacin to block ovulation (reviewed in Refs. 1Armstrong D.T.

Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 725-781Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations in rats showed that this preovulatory rise in follicular prostaglandin synthesis results from gonadotropin-dependent, cell type-specific induction of prostaglandin G/H synthase (PGHS), 1The abbreviations used are: PGHS, prostaglandin G/H synthase; PKA, protein kinase A; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; cPKA, catalytic subunit of PKA; PKI, PKA inhibitor protein; CaMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; wt, wild-type; LUC, luciferase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin. the first rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis from arachidonic acid, in granulosa cells (5Hedin L.

Purification and N-terminal sequencing of the PGHS enzyme induced in rat granulosa cells helped characterize the presence and physiological significance of a then distinct PGHS isoform, now known as PGHS-2 (also referred to as cyclooxygenase-2) (8Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6382-6388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The selective induction of PGHS-2 in rat preovulatory follicles proved to be a conserved mechanism by which the synthesis of prostaglandins necessary for ovulation is regulated in different species (9Sirois J.

Reprod. 2003; 68: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ultimately, genetic studies underscored the essential role of the enzyme in ovulation, as mice deficient in PGHS-2 have an anovulatory phenotype that can be reversed with exogenous prostaglandin E2 (16Lim H.

Interestingly, the genetic background of the PGHS-2-null mice was shown to markedly influence the anovulatory/ovulatory phenotype (19Wang H. Ma W.G. Tejada L. Zhang H. Morrow J.D. Das S.K. Dey S.K.

The gonadotropin-dependent induction of PGHS-2 observed in preovulatory follicles in vivo has been recapitulated in vitro, as numerous agonists acting primarily through the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway were shown to increase expression of the PGHS-2 transcript and protein in primary cultures of granulosa cells (7Wong W.Y.

Incubation with the transcriptional inhibitor α-amanitin abolishes the agonist-dependent increase in PGHS-2 expression, clearly indicating that the phenomenon is dependent on transcription (20Wong W.Y. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1714-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cloning of the rat and bovine PGHS-2 promoters and their characterization using homologous granulosa cell cultures revealed in both species that the proximal 150–200 bp located upstream of the transcriptional start site are sufficient to confer basal and forskolin/gonadotropin-inducible promoter activities (21Liu J.

Although a number of consensus cis-acting elements were identified within this proximal region, site-directed mutagenesis identified the E-box element as the predominant element involved in the regulation of PGHS-2 promoter activities in preovulatory granulosa cells (21Liu J.

Upstream stimulatory factor (USF) 1 and USF2 are ubiquitous proteins characterized by highly conserved C-terminal basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains responsible for dimerization and DNA binding activities (24Gregor P.D.

Immunoblotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) provided evidence for the presence of USF proteins in granulosa cell nuclear extracts and for their ability to interact with the E-box element present in the PGHS-2 promoter (21Liu J. Antaya M. Boerboom D. Lussier J.G. Silversides D.W. Sirois J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35037-35045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Morris J.K. Richards J.S. J.

More direct evidence for a role of USF proteins in PGHS-2 promoter transactivation came from the demonstration that overexpression of full-length USF proteins markedly increases and overexpression of a dominant-negative USF2 mutant represses PGHS-2 promoter activities in a E-box-dependent manner in granulosa cells (33Sayasith K. Bouchard N. Sawadogo M. Lussier J.G. Sirois J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6327-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the absence of changes in the endogenous levels of full-length USF proteins during the ovulatory process in rat and bovine granulosa cells (21Liu J. Antaya M. Boerboom D. Lussier J.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16633-16643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) raises questions as to the precise mechanism controlling USF-dependent PGHS-2 activation. Considering that USF phosphorylation has been implicated in modulating the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of other genes (34Cheung E. Mayr P. Coda-Zabetta F. Woodman P.G. Boam D.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 36Xiao Q. Kenessey A. Ojamaa K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H213-H219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the specific objective of the present study was to determine the potential role of USF phosphorylation in the regulation of the PGHS-2 promoter in preovulatory granulosa cells. Materials—[α-32P]dCTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Woodbridge, Ontario, Canada). Lipofectamine Plus reagent, TRIzol total RNA isolation reagent, a 1-kb DNA ladder, synthetic oligonucleotides, and culture medium were obtained from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). The 5′-end labeling system, the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system, and plasmids pGEM-T Easy and pGL3-Basic were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, Rainbow molecular weight markers, the ECL Plus Western blotting system, horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and restriction enzymes were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Baie D'Urfé, Québec, Canada). Polyclonal antibodies against USF1 and USF2 and protein A/G-Sepharose beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphatase type VII-S, 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, benzamidine, chymotrypsin, pepstatin, and monoclonal antibodies against phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were purchased from Sigma (Oakville, Ontario). Proteinase K and the One-Step RT-PCR system were purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Mississauga, Ontario). Forskolin and the PKA inhibitor H-89 were obtained from Calbiochem. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Expression constructs for the catalytic subunit of PKA (cPKA), the PKA inhibitor protein (PKI), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II, and CaMKIV were generously provided by Dr. Richard Maurer (Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR). Bovine USF cDNA and PGHS-2 Promoter Constructs—Expression constructs containing full-length USF proteins (referred to as wild-type (wt) USF1 (U1wt) and USF2 (U2wt)) and constructs encoding N-terminally truncated forms of USF1 (U1Δ1–129, which lacks residues 1–129) and USF2 (U2Δ1–220, which lacks residues 1–220) were produced by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) as described previously (33Sayasith K. Bouchard N. Sawadogo M. Lussier J.G. Sirois J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6327-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Full-length USF constructs containing a single point mutation were produced to generate mutants in which a putative phosphorylatable serine residue was replaced with a non-phosphorylatable alanine residue. These mutants were made with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's protocol using the U1wt or U2wt construct as template and the mutagenic oligonucleotide primers described under “Results.” For USF1 mutants, the amino acid switch was performed at Ser257 or Ser262, and the constructs were named U1S257A and U1S262A, respectively. For USF2 constructs, the amino acid switch was performed at Ser259, Ser269, or Ser275, and the constructs were named U2S259A, U2S269A, and U2S275A, respectively. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The production of the chimeric bovine PGHS-2 promoter/firefly luciferase (LUC) constructs –149/–2PGHS-2.LUC and –149/–2PGHS-2ΔE-box.LUC has been described previously (21Liu J. Antaya M. Boerboom D.

Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Reporter Activity Assays— Primary cultures of bovine granulosa cells, transient transfections, and reporter activity assays were performed as described previously (21Liu J.

Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1–2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates containing 0.5 ml of minimal essential medium supplemented with l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, 2% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with –149/–2PGHS-2.LUC or –149/–2PGHS-2ΔE-box.LUC (90 fmol/well) in the absence or presence of the USF, cPKA, PKI, CaMKII, or CaMKIV expression construct (10 fmol/well) using 2 μg of Lipofectamine Plus reagent in 0.3 ml of minimal essential medium following the manufacturer's protocol. In all cases, cotransfection with the SV40 Renilla luciferase control vector (pRL-SV40) was performed to normalize results. Three hours after transfection, cells were incubated in fresh culture medium for 36 h in the absence (control) or presence of forskolin (10 μm), 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 100 nm). After the culture period, cell lysates were prepared, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase assay system and a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Granulosa Cell Nuclear Extracts and EMSAs—Confluent cultures of granulosa cells (100-mm dish) were transfected with the U1wt, U2wt, U1Δ1–129, or U2Δ1–220 expression construct (4 μg of construct/dish) using 30 μg of Lipofectamine Plus reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. Three hours after transfection, cells were incubated in fresh culture medium in the absence (control) or presence of forskolin (10 μm). Twenty-four hours after incubation, cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (21Liu J. Antaya M. Boerboom D. Lussier J.G. Silversides D.W. Sirois J. J. Biol.

In some experiments, extracts were preincubated for 10 min with phosphatase type VII-S (0.5–1 IU) prior to addition of other reagents to study the effect of protein dephosphorylation on binding activities. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (29Szentirmay M.N. Yang H.X. Pawar S.A. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37231-37240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, untransfected granulosa cells or granulosa cells transfected with the U2wt or U2Δ1–220 expression construct were cultured for 36 h in the absence (control) or presence of forskolin (10 μm). At the end of the culture period, protein/DNA cross-linking was performed by incubating cells with minimal essential medium containing 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (15 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml chymotrypsin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were sonicated (five cycles, 10 s/cycle) using a Branson Model 450 Sonifier to obtain DNA fragments of 0.5–1 kb, and debris were removed by low speed centrifugation. For each chromatin extract supernatant, one-third was kept as DNA input (positive control for DNA); one-third was incubated with anti-USF2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); and the remaining third was incubated with normal rabbit serum (negative control). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, lysates were incubated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 2 h and subsequently washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline by repeated centrifugation/resuspension cycles. Beads were incubated at 65 °C for 4 h and treated with proteinase K for 2 h at 50 °C to reverse protein/DNA cross-links. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and PCR was performed using sense (5′-TCCTA CCCCA ACCCG GGTCT TGCGC AATTG TT-3′) and antisense (5′-CTCTG ACGTT CACTG CGAGT CC-3′) primers specific for the bovine PGHS-2 promoter. The expected PCR product (180 bp), which contains the USF-binding E-box cis-element, was analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from granulosa cells cultured under various experimental conditions using TRIzol reagent. The One-Step RT-PCR system was used to characterize expression of bovine USF1, USF2, PGHS-2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs. Reactions were performed as described previously (33Sayasith K. Bouchard N. Sawadogo M. Lussier J.G. Sirois J. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts were also prepared from granulosa cells of bovine preovulatory follicles obtained from animals ovariectomized 0 and 18 h after the administration of an ovulatory dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as described (21Liu J.

Membranes were incubated with anti-phosphothreonine (1:500 dilution) or anti-phosphoserine (1:500 dilution) antibody, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) and the ECL Plus Western blotting system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance was used to test the effect of different treatments and constructs on reporter gene activities. When the results indicated significant differences (p < 0.05), Dunnett's test was used for multiple comparisons of means. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). PKA Pathway-dependent Control of USF-regulated PGHS-2 Promoter Activities in Granulosa Cells—To characterize the role of the PKA pathway in basal and USF-regulated PGHS-2 promoter activities, granulosa cells were cotransfected with the promoter construct –149/–2PGHS-2.LUC and the vector expressing USF1 or USF2, and cells were cultured in the absence or presence of a PKA activator (forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP) and inhibitor (H-89) and a protein kinase C activator (PMA). The results show that forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP significantly increased basal PGHS-2 promoter activity (3.3 ± 0.4 (control) versus 6.2 ± 0.5 (forskolin) and 5.5 ± 0.4 (8-Br-cAMP); p < 0.05), whereas the phorbol ester PMA had no effect in cells not overexpressing USF proteins (Fig. 1A). Cotransfections with the USF1 or USF2 expression vector resulted in an increase in basal promoter activity, which was further stimulated by forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP, but not by PMA (Fig. 1A). Incubation of cells with the PKA inhibitor H-89 blocked forskolin-stimulated PGHS-2 promoter activity in untransfected granulosa cells or in those transfected with the USF1 and USF2 expression vectors (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, H-89 also reduced USF1- and USF2-regulated PGHS-2 promoter activities in cells not stimulated with forskolin (7.8 ± 0.8 versus 3.8 ± 0.4 (USF1) and 13.0 ± 2.7 versus 3.4 ± 0.1 (USF2); p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B), suggesting the presence of some"
https://openalex.org/W2027637736,"The regulated catabolism of hyaluronan is critical to the function of many connective tissues. In cartilage, hyaluronan catabolism occurs locally by resident chondrocytes. To determine whether the expression of lysosomal hyaluronidases contributes to this regulation, the promoter elements associated with HYAL-2 gene expression were characterized. Human articular chondrocytes were found to express all three lysosomal hyaluronidases, HYAL-1, HYAL-2, and HYAL-3. HYAL-2 was the predominant gene product. Using 5′ RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) analysis, multiple transcription initiation sites were identified including a novel initiation site located within intron 1 of the gene expressed by human articular chondrocytes. The presence of multiple transcriptional initiation sites is a typical feature of TATA-less promoter regions, such as those of HYAL-2. Approximately 4000 bp of 5′ flanking sequence of the HYAL-2 gene was characterized. Transient transfection of C-28/I2 cells with various 5′ deletion constructs indicated that the region between +959 to +1158 (within intron 1) contains the basal promoter for HYAL-2 in chondrocytes. In addition, the region +224 to +958 contained a negative modulator that could control the basal expression level of HYAL-2. Treatment of human articular chondrocytes or C-28/I2 cells with various catabolic cytokines did not alter HYAL-2 mRNA expression, luciferase promoter expression, or hyaluronidase enzymatic activity. Thus, in chondrocytes HYAL-2 appears to be constitutively expressed and not inducibly regulated by catabolic agents. As such, it appears that the expression of lysosomal hyaluronidase participates little in the overall regulation of hyaluronan catabolism.

Hyaluronan (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HYAL, hyaluronidase; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HYAL, hyaluronidase; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.is a high molecular weight, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid (1Knudson W. Knudson C.B. Curr. Opin. Orthop. 2004; 15: 369-375Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). HA is a ubiquitous component of the extracellular matrix and, as such, is present in most body fluids and tissues (2Laurent T.C. Fraser R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). In cartilage HA serves as a tethering scaffold with >50 aggrecan proteoglycans and link proteins bound to a single filament of HA (3Buckwalter J.A. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9830-9839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cartilage is avascular and devoid of a lymphatic system, all HA catabolism occurs locally by the resident chondrocytes. As such, cartilage serves as a useful model system to examine the regulation of local HA catabolism. Under steady state conditions, aggrecan and HA are catabolized in a coordinated manner (4Morales T.I. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3632-3638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ng K.C. Handley C.J. Preston B.N. Robinson H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, whereas aggrecan fragments are detected in the extracellular matrix and media, presumably due to extracellular processing by neutral pH proteinases, HA degradation products typically are not found. Our laboratory has determined that chondrocytes readily internalize HA via a CD44-mediated mechanism, delivering the HA into low pH intracellular organelles (6Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chow G. Knudson C.B. Homandberg G. Knudson W. J. Biol.

Given that the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine blocks the degradation of HA into small fragments by chondrocytes (6Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this finding suggests that HA is catabolized intracellularly via the action of lysosomal hyaluronidases.The hyaluronidases are represented by a family of β-endoglucosidases that degrade HA by cleaving internal β-1,4 linkages. In humans, six hyaluronidase genes have been identified (10Csoka A.B. Scherer S.W. Stern R. Genomics. 1999; 60: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 11Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). These genes occur in clusters of three at two chromosomal locations. HYAL-1, HYAL-2, and HYAL-3 are located on chromosome 3p21.3, and SPAM-1 (sperm adhesion molecule 1), HYAL-4, and HYALP1 are located on chromosome 7q31.3. HYAL-1 is expressed in most tissues but is predominantly found in the plasma and urine (11Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Similarly, HYAL-2 is found in most tissues; however, it is notably absent in the adult brain. Both HYAL-1 and HYAL-2 are believed to act in concert to degrade HA (11Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Cartilage has been shown to express mRNA encoding HYAL-1, HYAL-2, and HYAL-3 (12Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study we have confirmed these results and demonstrated that HYAL-2 is the predominant mRNA. The cDNA sequences for HYAL-2 have been reported for human (13Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), mouse (13Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and Xenopus laevis (14Mullegger J. Lepperdinger G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 111: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both the human and mouse HYAL-2 amino acid sequences are highly conserved with an identity of 82% and no insertions or deletions (13Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of human HYAL-2 that share the same coding exons, namely exons 2, 3, and 4. They differ only in the 5′ untranslated region of the mRNA whereby one isoform contains exon 1 (GenBank™ accession number U09577) and the other contains intron 1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_033158).Despite the fact that the gene sequence for human HYAL-2 has been known for some time and that HYAL-2 has been implicated in a number of biological activities such as tumor growth and metastasis (15Novak U. Stylli S.S. Kaye A.H. Lepperdinger G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6246-6250PubMed Google Scholar), embryonic development (16Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and inflammation (17Li Y. Rahmanian M. Widstrom C. Lepperdinger G. Frost G.I. Heldin P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), little is known about its regulation. Cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF are potent stimulators of chondrocyte-mediated cartilage degradation (7Chow G. Knudson C.B. Homandberg G. Knudson W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27734-27741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 12Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, studies of the effects of cytokines on the modulation of HYAL-2 expression are contradictory. When treated with cytokines such as IL-1 (α/β), TNF-α, or IFN-γ, there was no change in the expression level of the HYAL-2 message as observed in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (18Ohno S. Ijuin C. Doi T. Yoneno K. Tanne K. J. Periodontol. 2002; 73: 1331-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), human proximal tubular epithelial cells (19Selbi W. de la Motte C. Hascall V. Phillips A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), human kidney and renal cells (20Sun L. Feusi E. Sibalic A. Beck-Schimmer B. Wuthrich R.P. Kidney Blood Press. Res. 1998; 21: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and murine lung endothelial cells (21Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an increase in the HYAL-2 mRNA level was observed in human chondrocytes after IL-1β and TNF-α treatment (12Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and in rat lung tissue by transforming growth factor β (17Li Y. Rahmanian M. Widstrom C. Lepperdinger G. Frost G.I. Heldin P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Nicoll et al. (22Nicoll S.B. Barak O. Csoka A.B. Bhatnagar R.S. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have shown that human dermal fibroblasts treated with lactate and/or staurosporine expressed an elevated HYAL-2 message level.In this study, we have generated a number of 5′ and 3′ deletion constructs to delineate the promoter region and also to identify positive and negative cis-elements critical to the regulation of the hyaluronidase gene expression in human chondrocytes. In addition, we have determined that the expression of HYAL-2 in human chondrocytes or HYAL-2 promoter constructs is not altered by pre-treatment of cells with a variety of cytokines, growth factors, or cellular mediators.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 were from Cellgro (Herndon, VA). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from HyClone (South Logan, UT). FuGENE 6 and collagenase P were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Pronase was from Calbiochem. IL-1α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α were from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). TRIzol, the TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing, and platinum Pfx DNA polymerase were purchased from Invitrogen. The BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit was from BD Biosciences Clontech. Specific primers were custom made by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The GeneAmp RNA PCR kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. pGL3-Basic, Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids, the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system, and human genomic DNA were purchased from Promega. All other chemicals were either molecular biology grade or reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma.Cell Culture—Immortalized human chondrocytes, C-28/I2 (a gift from Dr. Mary Goldring, Harvard Institutes of Medicine), were grown in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (50:50) mix supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Normal human talocrural ankle cartilage (obtained from the Gift of Hope Organ and Tissue Donor Network with consent and Institutional Review Board approval) was isolated by sequential digestion of Pronase and collagenase (7Chow G. Knudson C.B. Homandberg G. Knudson W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27734-27741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The human chondrocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. To study the effects of cytokines on the mRNA expression level of HYAL-2 and hyaluronidase activity, human chondrocytes or C-28/I2 immortalized human chondrocytes were treated with 0.5–10 ng/ml IL-1β, 10 ng/ml IL-1α, 100 ng/ml TNF-α, or 10–3 μg/ml IFN-γ for 48 h in either serum-free media or 10% serum-containing media. Total RNA was then isolated using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. The serum-free media were collected, protease inhibitor mixture was added, and the samples were stored at –20 °C prior to analysis for hyaluronidase.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from human monolayer cultures with TRIzol reagent, purified, and then subjected to RT-PCR analysis as described previously (23Jiang H. Peterson R.S. Wang W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10531-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 ng of total RNA was converted to cDNA using Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of a specific HYAL-1, -2, or -3 downstream primer (0.15 μm). The resulting cDNA samples were then amplified in the presence of a specific HYAL-1, -2, or -3 upstream primer (0.15 μm) in a PCR mixture consisting of 2 mm magnesium chloride, 200 μm each deoxyribonucleotide, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. The DNA was denatured by heating at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s of annealing at 60 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. This reaction was followed by a final elongation step that lasted for 5 min at 72 °C. The amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels followed by staining with ethidium bromide. The stained products were scanned and quantified using a fluorimaging system (Fluor-S MultiImager; Bio-Rad). Two specific primers sets for HYAL-2 were utilized. To monitor all HYAL-2 transcripts, the sense primer 5′-GGCACAATATGAGTTTGAGTTCGC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TTGAGGTACTGGCAGGTCTCCG-3′ were used. To determine HYAL-2 transcripts specifically containing exon 1, the sense primer 5′-GGCTCACCCCAGGTAAGGAGGG-3′ was used in conjunction with the antisense primer 5′-CCATGCACAGACCTTCCGGCAGAAT-3′. The primer sequences used for HYAL-1 were 5′-CCAGAATGCCAGCCTGATTGCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTCATTTTGGGCACGGATGCC-3′ (antisense), and the primer sequences used for HYAL-3 were 5′-CATTTTCTACAAGAACCAACTCGGCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCAATGCAGTTGAGTGTTGCGG3′ (antisense).5′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′ RACE)—Total RNA was isolated from normal human talocrural chondrocytes using TRIzol reagent, and human placental total RNA was obtained from BD Biosciences Clontech. An antisense HYAL-2 oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-CCATGCACAGACCTTCCGGCAGAAT-3′) corresponding to positions 2493–2517 downstream from exon 1 (11Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) was synthesized. First-strand cDNA synthesis and subsequent amplification of 5′ cDNA ends were carried as detailed in the BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit manual. In brief, total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a modified lock-docking oligonucleotide (dT) primer and BD SMART II A oligonucleotide at 42 °C for 1.5 h to obtain the first-strand cDNA. 5′RACE was performed by incubating with an aliquot of first-strand cDNA, the antisense HYAL-2, and universal primer mix using the following PCR conditions. After an initial denaturation of one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, the mixture was amplified at 94 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min for 30 cycles. The resulting products were cloned into a sequencing vector, TOPO TA, and sequenced (Research Resources Center DNA Sequencing, University of Illinois at Chicago) to determine the transcription start site(s).Transient Transfection Assay—Transient transfection of C-28/I2 immortalized human chondrocytes with HYAL-2 promoter/firefly luciferase reporter plasmids was performed using FuGENE 6. Cells were seeded at 1.2 × 105 per well in 24-well plates the day before and transfected with 0.2 μg of one promoter construct with 0.6 μl of Fu-GENE 6 in the presence of serum-containing medium for 48 h. The cells were then lysed and assayed for promoter activity using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. The enzymatic activity of luciferase was measured with a luminometer (Sirius; Berthold Detection System, Oak Ridge, TN). To normalize for transfection efficiency, the cells were co-transfected with Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (2 ng). To study the effects of cytokines on the promoter activity of the various constructs, the cells were transfected for 24 h with the promoter constructs as outlined above. The next day the cells were washed and, following overnight serum starvation, treated with various cytokines in serum-free medium for another 24 h and then assayed for promoter activity.Construction of Promoter Reporter—A human genome BLAST homology search of the public data base (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59166) Google Scholar) was performed using the human HYAL-2 cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number U09577). Three series of 5′ deletion constructs were generated and arbitrarily designated L, C, and P. High purity human genomic DNA was used as the template to generate the inserts. Inserts were PCR-amplified using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase with the appropriate primer sets shown in Fig. 5. The amplified products were then cloned into the KpnI/NheI sites of the pGL3-Basic firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. The KpnI and NheI restriction enzymes sites were engineered into the primers and are underlined in the sequences shown in Fig. 5. The positions are numbered from the transcriptional start site (+1) of human placenta HYAL-2 (HP-HYAL-2; Fig. 3).Fig. 3Transcription start sites and putative regulatory elements of the 5′ flanking region of the HYAL-2 gene. The 5′ RACE HYAL-2 products were cloned, sequenced, and compared with the known sequence for the HYAL-2 gene in GenBank™ (accession number AC002455). The sequences identified by 5′ RACE, all originating from a primer anchored in exon 2, are depicted in boldface; known exon sequences are underlined. The transcription start site used by human placental cells (HP-HYAL-2), which is 5′ upstream of exon 1, was designated +1. The transcription start sites used by human chondrocytes were located in the intron 1 and are denoted HC-S-HYAL-S-2 (+1360) and HC-l-HYAL-2 (+1688). The MatInspector program (44Quandt L. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar), available from Genomatix on-line, was used to identify potential cis-regulatory elements in the 5′ flanking sequence of the HYAL-2 gene (core sequence is underlined). All sites shown have >85% consensus.

Yamagata S. Miura Y. Harada T. Yamagata T. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were loaded and run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing a final concentration of 0.17 mg/ml HA followed by 1 h of incubation in 0.3% Triton X-100 and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in 0.1 m sodium formate and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 3.7. After the overnight incubation, the gel was treated for 1 h with 1 mg/ml Pronase in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stained with 0.5% Alcian blue in 3% acetic acid for 30 min. The gel was then destained with 40% ethanol in 3% acetic acid until the background was sufficiently reduced to visualize the cleared bands. The signal intensity was scanned and quantified using the fluorimaging system.Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-human HYAL-2 Antibody—A peptide-specific rabbit anti-human HYAL-2 antibody was prepared (NeoMPS, San Diego, CA). Briefly, a specific 11-amino acid synthetic peptide, unique to the human HYAL-2 sequence (GDAGYTTSTET), was synthesized. The purified peptide was coupled through the terminal cysteine thiol to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with the heterofunctional cross-linking agent m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. The antigen was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, emulsified by mixing with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant, and injected into the subcutaneous dorsal sites of rabbits for primary immunization. Subsequent immunizations were performed using incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The animals were then bled, and the serum was collected and immunoaffinity-purified. The anti-peptide antibody titer was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Western Blot Analysis—For detection of HYAL-2 protein, conditioned media was removed and concentrated by lyophilization and cell layers extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.15 m NaCl for 1 h on ice. The isolates were then separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, followed by incubating with a 1:120 dilution of rabbit anti-human HYAL-2 antisera. The blots were then incubated with Vectastain Elite ABC peroxidase kit reagents (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and developed using the enzyme substrate diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. As controls, the blots were probed without the addition of primary antibody. The bands were scanned and quantified using the fluorimaging system.RESULTSExpression of Hyaluronidases in Human Articular Chondrocytes—Shown in Fig. 1 is the hyaluronidase mRNA expression pattern of two representative samples of normal human ankle articular chondrocytes. Both of these high density cultures exhibited messages for HYAL-1, HYAL-2, and HYAL-3 (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3 and 4–6, respectively), with HYAL-2 being the predominant species. These results confirm the earlier observations made by Flannery et al. (12Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because HYAL-2 was the major hyaluronidase gene product expressed by human chondrocytes, we focused our investigation into the transcriptional regulation of the HYAL-2 gene.Fig. 1RT-PCR analysis of hyaluronidase gene expression in human articular chondrocytes. Total RNA was isolated from two separate high density primary cultures of human articular chondrocytes. Equivalent aliquots of RNA from each donor were analyzed by RT-PCR using specific primer sets for HYAL-1 (lanes 1 and 4), HYAL-2 (lanes 2 and 5), and HYAL-3 (lanes 3 and 6). The expression profiles of the three hyaluronidases expressed by donor 1 are shown in lanes 1–3, and those for donor 2 are shown in lanes 4–6. Std, standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Determination of the Transcription Start Site(s) Using 5′ RACE—The genomic structure for human HYAL-2 consists of four exons separated by three introns. The translational start site (AUG) is located within exon 2, which is 2225 bp downstream from exon 1 (11Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To identify the transcription initiation site(s) for HYAL-2, 5′ RACE was performed using a HYAL-2-specific primer anchored in exon 2 to amplify total RNA from human articular chondrocytes as well as from human placenta. 5′ RACE amplification of human chondrocyte RNA resulted in two bands with estimated sizes of 450 and 650 bp of about equal intensity (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Cloning and sequencing of these PCR products revealed two totally distinct DNA sequences (the 5′ RACE adapter sequence accounts for 53 bp of the sequence). Both sequences extend exon 2 upstream and have their 5′ start sites located in different regions of intron 1 of the HYAL-2 gene (Fig. 3). The shorter of the two sequences, HC-S-HYAL-2 (+1360; Fig. 3), extends 44 base pairs into the distal portion of intron 1. The longer sequence, HC-L-HYAL-2 (+1688; Fig. 3), extends 289 base pairs into intron 1. Both of the RNA transcripts are generated by splicing out the intervening intron sequences in accordance to the GT-AG rule. These spliced regions are shown in Fig. 3 as the non-boldfaced sequence between +1360 and the start of exon 2 and +1688 and exon 2.Fig. 2Determination of transcriptional start site(s) for HYAL-2. Total RNA isolated from high density primary cultures of human articular chondrocytes (panel A) or human placental RNA (panel B) was subjected to a 5′ RACE reaction using 5′ universal primer mix and 3′ HYAL-2-specific primers. Following amplification, the 5′ RACE products were visualized by electrophoresis using 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Lanes 1 in panels A and B represent a 100-bp DNA ladder, and lanes 2 represent the 5′ RACE HYAL-2 products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, in the case of 5′ RACE amplification of human placental RNA, only a single band was observed (Fig. 2B, lane 2). In addition to exon 2, it contains exon 1 and extends continuously into the 5′ untranslated region by 57 bp. We have designated this start site as +1 (HP-HYAL-2). This sequence is 57 bp longer than the previously published cDNA HYAL-2 sequence in the GenBank™ (accession number U09577). In this instance, the mature mRNA is synthesized by splicing out the complete intron 1 sequence. The sequences of the splice acceptor and donor sites again comply with the GT-AG rule for splicing.To assess the possibility that human chondrocytes also express an alternate transcript that utilizes exon 1, a sense oligonucleotide primer located within exon 1 was synthesized. As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 1 and 2), even after 30 PCR cycles only a very low level of expression was detected (400-bp product) when total RNA isolated from either primary cultures of normal human chondrocytes or C-28/I2 immortalized human chondrocytes was subjected to RT-PCR using exon 1-to-exon 2-specific primers. On the other hand, under the same conditions a strong 400-bp product was obtained with human placental RNA (Fig. 4, lane 3).Fig. 4Expression of HYAL-2 mRNA transcripts containing exon 1. Total RNA isolated from primary human articular chondrocytes (lane 1), C-28/I2 immortalized human chondrocytes (lane 2), and human placenta (lane 3) was subjected to RT-PCR using specific 5′ primers located in exon 1 together with a 3′ primer located in exon 2 of the HYAL-2 mRNA. The products (expected size of 400 bp) were visualized following agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide.

Because hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, resolution of the molecular basis for this reduction is of significant clinical interest. The PEMT pathway is a metabolically channeled process localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To assess the importance of PEMT localization for Hcy homeostasis, we identified and ablated the minimal ER targeting motif. Mutagenesis of a conserved, C-terminal lysine residue (197) relocalized the enzyme to the Golgi, demonstrating that Lys-197 is essential for targeting PEMT to the ER. To evaluate the functional significance of PEMT localization, hepatoma cell lines were generated that stably expressed either ER- or Golgi-localized PEMT only. Intriguingly, stable expression of PEMT in either the ER or the Golgi caused increased Hcy secretion. Moreover, PEMT-mediated Hcy secretion correlated with the methyltransferase activity of the enzyme, independently of subcellular localization. Thus, our data suggest that Hcy homeostasis is regulated concomitantly with PEMT activity but independently of PEMT localization.

Although plasma Hcy levels are clearly of significant clinical interest, the molecular basis underlying Hcy homeostasis remains poorly understood.Recently, we demonstrated that mice homozygous for a disrupted PEMT allele display a >50% reduction in circulating Hcy concentrations (8Noga A.A.

Furthermore, primary hepatocytes cultured from PEMT null mice secrete ∼50% less Hcy (8Noga A.A. Stead L.M. Zhao Y. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Conversely, ectopic expression of PEMT in a cell line that lacks endogenous PEMT promotes Hcy secretion (8Noga A.A. Stead L.M. Zhao Y. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In early studies, the synthesis of creatine by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase was proposed to be the major contributing reaction in homocysteine formation (9Mudd S.H. Poole J.R. Metabolism. 1975; 24: 721-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 10Mudd S.H. Ebert M.H. Scriver C.R. Metabolism. 1980; 29: 707-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our data reveal a key, yet previously unrecognized, role for PEMT in Hcy homeostasis.PEMT is a liver-specific enzyme that catalyzes three sequential transmethylation reactions in the production of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (11Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is the methyl donor for each reaction and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) is the demethylated product, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to adenosine and the non-protein amino acid, Hcy (11Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Finkelstein J.D. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S40-S44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of AdoHcy is carried out by the cytosolic enzyme, S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcyase) (12Finkelstein J.D. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S40-S44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Coulter-Karis D.E. Hershfield M.S. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1989; 53: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Efficient hydrolysis of AdoHcy is essential, as an increase in AdoHcy levels, along with the associated decrease in the cellular AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio, inhibits AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (14Clarke S. Banfield K. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2001: 63-78Google Scholar).Approximately 40 different mammalian methyltransferases, including DNA, RNA, protein, lipid, and small molecule methyltransferases, use AdoMet as a methyl donor and consequently produce AdoHcy during the methylation reaction (15Fauman E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-38Crossref Google Scholar, 16Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because AdoHcy from each transmethylation reaction can potentially be used to produce Hcy, it is all the more striking that genetic ablation of just one methyltransferase, PEMT, suffices to depress circulating Hcy levels by half (8Noga A.A. Stead L.M. Zhao Y. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The question thus arises: what molecular features of the PEMT pathway cause the preferential use of PEMT-derived AdoHcy as a substrate for AdoHcyase?PEMT is localized in the ER and is present in a subfraction of ER membranes that co-fractionates biochemically with mitochondria, known as mitochondria-associated membranes (17Cui Z.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mitochondria-associated membranes represent a metabolically important region of the ER, characterized by a significant enrichment in lipid biosynthetic enzymes relative to other areas of the ER (19Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. J. Biol.

Foy B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we investigated whether precise subcellular localization might be essential to the role of PEMT in Hcy homeostasis.To evaluate the importance of PEMT localization for Hcy homeostasis, we relocalized PEMT to a different cellular sub-compartment by defining and ablating the ER retrieval motif. The canonical retrieval motif for ER membrane proteins features a lysine residue at the -4, -3 (KKXX) or -5, -3 (KXKXX) positions relative to the C-terminal end (23Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This motif functions in mammals, yeast, and plants (24Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 25Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A.

Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Here, we have validated the minimal ER targeting motif of PEMT and have presented biochemical evidence that PEMT can promote Hcy secretion through an ER localization-independent mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, restriction endonucleases, and Platinum™ Pfx DNA polymerase were from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Institute of Biomolecular Design, University of Alberta. S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (15 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Non-radiolabeled S-adenosyl-l-methionine and anti-HA monoclonal antibody were from Sigma. FuGENE 6™ transfection reagent was from Roche Applied Science.Phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine was from Avanti Polar Lipids. Anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) antibody was from Stressgen Biotech. Mannosidase II (Man II) and TGN-38 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Paul Melançon, University of Alberta. Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Pierce. Texas Red-X goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit, and Prolong Antifade™ reagent were from Molecular Probes.Recombinant Plasmid ConstructionPlasmids encoding PEMT localization mutants were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using the hemagglutinin (HA)-hPEMT-pCI plasmid as template (18Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes a previously described HA-tagged derivative of the human PEMT protein, which is enzymatically active (18Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To mutate the residues of the putative ER retrieval motif, a common HA-PEMT-specific sense primer and a different antisense primer for each mutant were used. Primer sequences are available upon request. Mutant PCR products were subcloned into pCI (Promega) using XhoI and XbaI restriction sites. Transcription from the pCI vector is under the control of a CMV promoter. All constructs were sequenced at the Molecular Biology Services Unit, University of Alberta.Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Generation of Stable Cell LinesCell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection repository. NRK (normal rat kidney) cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. McArdle RH-7777 hepatoma cells were similarly maintained, except the culture media also included 10% horse serum. Transient transfection of NRK cells was performed using the FuGENE 6™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. McArdle RH-7777 stable transfectants were generated using the FuGENE 6™ reagent or by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar).Confocal Microscopy AnalysisNRK cells were seeded onto 22-mm coverslips in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, the cells were transfected with plasmids encoding mutant PEMT derivatives as described above. 24 h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved for 1 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, for 10 min. Following permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min, cells were incubated with the first primary polyclonal antibody at 37 °C for 1 h at the indicated dilution: PDI (1:100), Man II (1:300), or TGN-38 (1:200). Cells were then incubated with the second primary antibody (monoclonal anti-HA, 1:150) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with both secondary antibodies: Texas Red-X goat anti-mouse (1:200) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:200). Coverslips were mounted onto slides with Prolong Antifade™ reagent and immunofluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. All images presented are single sections in the Z plane.PEMT Enzymatic AssaysIn Vitro PEMT Assays—These assays were performed as described previously (29Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and harvested into phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted at 1000 × g, and resuspended in buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Following homogenization by sonication, protein homogenates (50 μg) were assayed for PEMT activity using phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine as a methyl acceptor and S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine as the methyl group donor.Assays of PEMT Activity in Cells—cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish. After 24 h, cells were washed with DMEM and incubated for 2 h with 1.5 ml of DMEM containing 0.4 mm oleate, [14C]glycerol (0.5 μCi/dish), and [3H]ethanolamine or [3H]methionine (5 μCi/dish). Radiolabeled lipids were extracted and quantitated (30Gilham D. Ho S. Rasouli M. Martres P. Vance D.E. Lehner R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Immunoblot AnalysisProteins from cell homogenate (5 μg) were separated by Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels calibrated with prestained molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:5000 dilution). Protein-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) as directed (1:5000 dilution). Membranes were exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak) at room temperature.Homocysteine SecretionTotal media Hcy content was assayed by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection of ammonium 7-fluora 2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate thiol adducts (31Vester B. Rasmussen K. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 29: 549-554PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical AnalysisStatistical differences between the means of two groups were determined using a Student's t test. Mean values of more than two groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc test.RESULTSIdentification of an ER Retrieval Motif—To identify a putative ER retrieval motif, comparative analysis of known PEMT primary sequences was performed. A classical C-terminal ER retrieval motif (KKXX) is present in yeast and neurospora PEMT orthologs (Fig. 1A). Although the functional relevance of this motif is unknown, only the lysine residue at the -3 position (Lys-197 in humans) is conserved in higher species (Fig. 1A). Either lysine in a di-lysine motif can be mutated to an arginine or histidine residue without detriment to ER targeting (32Hardt B. Bause E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because Lys-197 is flanked by histidine and arginine residues (HKRX), one of several combinations of basic residues could target PEMT to the ER (Fig. 1A). To serve as a functional ER retrieval signal, the C-terminal motif should be exposed to the cytosol (24Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 25Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). PEMT adopts a topography within the ER membrane that positions both termini in the cytosol (Fig. 1B) (18Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, Lys-197 of human PEMT is optimally positioned to interact with the ER retrieval machinery.Mutation of Lys-197 Prevents Targeting of PEMT to the ER—To investigate the role of the putative retrieval motif in targeting PEMT to the ER, we generated recombinant constructs in which Lys-197 and the flanking basic residues, His-196 and Arg-198, were mutated to serine residues. Each of the constructs included a N-terminal HA tag, because the epitope recognized by the PEMT antibody spans the region that includes the putative retrieval motif (17Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mutations in this region abolish epitope recognition. 2D. J. Shields, S. Lingrell, L. B. Agellon, J. T. Brosnan, and D. E. Vance, unpublished results. HA-tagged PEMT derivatives have been characterized, and the tagged enzyme retains significant transmethylation activity compared with the unmodified enzyme (18Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).To assess the role of specific residues in targeting PEMT to the ER, constructs encoding the mutant PEMT proteins were transfected into NRK cells, and colocalization studies were performed using the ER marker, PDI. NRK cells, which do not express endogenous PEMT protein, 2D. J. Shields, S. Lingrell, L. B. Agellon, J. T. Brosnan, and D. E. Vance, unpublished results. are a commonly used model for subcellular localization studies (33Satoh A. Wang Y. Malsam J. Beard M.B. Warren G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Colanzi A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As expected, the unmodified PEMT enzyme co-localized with the ER protein, PDI (Fig. 2A). In contrast, a PEMT derivative in which both Lys-197 and Arg-198 were mutated to serine residues (K197S/R198S) failed to colocalize with PDI; instead, the double mutant displayed a juxtanuclear localization (Fig. 2B). Mutation of His-196 resulted in a PEMT derivative that was either poorly expressed or rapidly degraded, as H196 transfectants were very rarely detected. 2D. J. Shields, S. Lingrell, L. B. Agellon, J. T. Brosnan, and D. E. Vance, unpublished results. Thus, the role of His-196 in targeting PEMT to the ER could not be determined.Fig. 2Mutagenesis of Lys-197 displaces PEMT from the ER.

Confocal analysis demonstrated that the R198S mutant co-localized with PDI, suggesting that Arg-198 is not essential for ER localization (Fig. 2C). In contrast, mutation of Lys-197 caused a loss of colocalization with PDI (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the K197S (Fig. 2B) mutant adopted a juxtanuclear localization similar to that of the K197S/R198S double mutant (Fig. 2B). Therefore, mutation of Lys-197 is sufficient to abrogate ER targeting of PEMT, supporting the notion that Lys-197 is essential for retrieval of PEMT to the ER.PEMT-K197S Mutants Are Localized to the Golgi—PEMT derivatives that harbor a mutation of Lys-197 (K197S/R198S or K197S) adopt a juxtanuclear localization that resembles the pattern of Golgi. To define the localization of the displaced K197S mutants, we performed co-localization analysis with the Golgi enzyme Man II. Extensive co-localization between the Lys-197 mutants and Man II was observed, suggesting that mutation of Lys-197 relocalizes PEMT to the Golgi (Fig. 3, B and D). Conversely, the unmodified enzyme and the R198S mutant, each of which colocalized with PDI, did not colocalize with Man II (Fig. 3, A and C). Thus, Lys-197 is essential for targeting PEMT to the ER, as mutagenesis causes relocalization to the Golgi.Fig. 3PEMT Lys-197 mutants colocalize with the Golgi enzyme, Man II. NRK cells were transiently transfected with plasmids (2 μg) containing wild-type PEMT (A) or localization mutants PEMT-K197S/R198S (B), PEMT-R198S (C), PEMT-K197S (D).

By modulating the subcellular localization of the enzyme, the significance of PEMT localization in Hcy homeostasis could thus be investigated. To directly assess the functional significance of PEMT localization, McArdle RH-7777 cell lines were generated that stably express either ER- or Golgi-localized PEMT. Mutation of Lys-197 also caused the relocalization of PEMT from the ER to the Golgi in McArdle RH-7777 cells. 2D. J. Shields, S. Lingrell, L. B. Agellon, J. T. Brosnan, and D. E.

Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Golgi-localized enzymes are active, PEMT enzymatic assays were performed. Cells expressing PEMT localization mutants were radiolabeled with metabolic precursors, and the radiolabeling of PE and PC was quantitated.As expected, stable expression of the unmodified enzyme caused a significant increase in the PC/PE ratio (Fig. 4A). Similarly, expression of the ER-localized R198S mutant resulted in a marked increase in the PC/PE ratio, demonstrating that mutation of Arg-198 is not inhibitory for PEMT activity (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, stable expression of each of the Golgi-localized PEMT mutants (K197S/R198S and K197S) also caused a significant increase in the PC/PE ratio compared with cells stably transfected with empty vector (Fig. 4A). Thus, displacement of PEMT from the ER does not abolish the methyltransferase activity in cells. Furthermore, localization of PEMT in the Golgi does not preclude the methylation-based synthesis of PC. Although the ER- and Golgi-localized PEMT derivatives displayed similar activity levels in cells (Fig. 4A), immunoblot analysis revealed that amounts of the Golgi-localized enzymes were in fact significantly lower than the ER-localized PEMT derivatives (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that Golgi-localized PEMT displays higher specific activity than the corresponding ER-localized enzyme. Alternatively, PC biosynthesis may be limited either through product-based feedback inhibition or via an unknown PC-sensing regulatory system.Fig. 4Stable PEMT expressors display enzymatic activity in intact cells.

Media were collected from cells that stably expressed ER- or Golgi-localized PEMT, and Hcy levels were measured. As predicted, stable expression of the ER-localized enzymes (PEMT and R198S) resulted in a significant increase in media Hcy content (Fig. 5B). However, stable expression of the Golgi-localized PEMT mutants (K197S/R198S and K197S), also significantly increased the secretion of Hcy compared with cells that were stably transfected with empty vector (Fig. 5B).

Our data suggest that AKAP12 localization is regulated by a hierarchy of targeting domains and that the localization of AKAP12-assembled signaling complexes may be dynamically regulated. Multicellular organisms require extensive signaling networks to coordinate physiological responses to a diverse array of stimuli. As organismal complexity increases, so theoretically does the requirement for an increased complement of signal transduction machinery. Whereas expansion of some kinase families appears to parallel increasing organismal complexity (1Gu J. Gu X. Gene. 2003; 317: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the protein kinase A family has undergone little expansion (2Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) despite the large number of its physiological substrates distributed throughout the cell. Thus, intrinsic differences between protein kinase A family members cannot fully account for such diversity because, on their own, they do not provide sufficient specificity. Instead, specificity appears to be conferred by an ever expanding pseudo-family of anchoring proteins, the A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, A kinase anchoring protein; AR, acidic residue-rich; BR, basic residue-rich; GFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GR, ganglioside-rich; hCASMC, human coronary artery smooth muscle cell; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; NLS, nuclear localization signal. that compartmentalize protein kinase A-containing signaling complexes to discrete subcellular locales (3Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 2002; 42: 235-257Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The intrinsic targeting and protein-protein interaction domains of each AKAP direct correct spatial and temporal assembly of protein kinase A-containing signaling complexes. Such compartmentalization simultaneously shields neighboring complexes from activated signal cascades and confers specificity to signaling complexes utilizing ubiquitous components (4Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these targeting and interaction domains comprise the primary determinants of the role of each AKAP. For example, the ability of AKAP5 (also known as AKAP75, AKAP79, or AKAP150) to amplify cAMP signals to the nucleus is disrupted either by deletion of its membrane-targeting sequence or by mutation of the protein kinase A binding site (5Indolfi C. Stabile E. Coppola C. Gallo A. Perrino C. Allevato G. Cavuto L. Torella D. Di Lorenzo E. Troncone G. Feliciello A. Avvedimento E.V. Chiariello M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, localization of AKAPs can be dynamically regulated through the phosphorylation of critical residues within their targeting motifs, such as the membrane-targeting sequence of AKAP5 (6Dell'Acqua M.L. Faux M.C. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2246-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), to allow for mobilization of AKAP-anchored signaling complexes. Characterization of the domains that direct the localization of each AKAP is thus an essential foundational step toward elucidating AKAP physiological functions. AKAP12, also known as SSeCKS and Gravin, is an anchoring protein that coordinates the assembly of a multiprotein complex that may include protein kinase A, protein kinase C, protein phosphatase 2B, the β-adrenergic receptor, and calmodulin (7Nauert J.B.

Commun. 2002; 290: 1368-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the AKAP12 gene encodes three transcriptionally separate AKAP12 isoforms, α, β, and γ, that have distinct spatio-temporal expression patterns (13Streb J.W. Kitchen C.M. Gelman I.H. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56014-56023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although all three isoforms share >95% of their coding sequence, an N-terminal myristoylation motif directs AKAP12α to the endoplasmic reticulum. The remaining isoforms are localized in the cytosol and at discrete locations at the cell periphery, indicating that their targeting information is contained in domains common to all three isoforms. Characterization of the domains controlling AKAP12 targeting will provide a foundation to address how localization of this protein controls its ability to dually regulate nuclear/perinuclear compartmentalization of cyclin D1 (14Lin X. Nelson P.J. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7259-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and β-adrenergic receptor functions at the cell membrane (10Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study we have characterized the localization of the non-myristoylated AKAP12 isoforms. AKAP12 is a highly charged protein composed of an N terminus of alternating acidic and basic residue-rich regions and a large acidic C-terminal tail. Here we used cross-species sequence analysis and deletion mapping to facilitate the identification of targeting motifs. Seven conserved basic regions in the N terminus were found to be important in determining the localization of AKAP12. The first three basic regions display similarity to the membrane-targeting domain of the MARCKS protein and are important determinants of AKAP12 targeting to ganglioside-rich regions at the cell periphery. Interestingly, the remaining basic regions each contain an SV40-like nuclear localization signal (NLS). Constructs spanning this region are localized to the nucleus. A fifth NLS, revealed through deletion mapping and mutagenesis, represents a novel class of NLS. Nuclear localization, however, is suppressed by the acidic C terminus. The ability of the C terminus to suppress nuclear localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras could not be localized to any specific region of the C terminus but instead appears to be related to net charge. Together, our data indicate that the charged residues in the AKAP12 protein are the main targeting determinants and reveal new insight into the interplay between charged residue-rich targeting domains in regulating subcellular localization. Additionally, our data suggest that localization of AKAP12-anchored signaling complexes may be dynamically regulated by factors or modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) that alter the local charge of the AKAP12-targeting domains. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's directions. Primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (hCASMCs) were obtained from Cascade Biologics and cultured per the manufacturers' directions. For differentiation experiments, growth media were replaced with SMC differentiation media (Cascade Biologics) for 7 days. hCASMCs were used prior to passage 10. Experiments using hCASMC cells were repeated with independent isolates. Plasmid Constructs—AKAP12β-enhanced GFP deletion constructs were constructed using either internal restriction enzymes or by amplifying the indicated region by PCR using restriction site-clamped primers. We used our recently described AKAP12β-GFP reporter construct, which displays similar localization as endogenous AKAP12, as the template for the deletions reported in this study (13Streb J.W.

Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers incorporating the indicated amino acid changes. All amplified constructs were sequenced to confirm fidelity and in-frame fusion to GFP. Sequences of the primers used in this report are available upon request. Microscopy—Localization of GFP fusion proteins was assessed 48 h post-transfection using a BX51 microscope and a 60× water immersion lens (Olympus) as described previously (13Streb J.W. Kitchen C.M. Gelman I.H. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56014-56023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Images were digitized with a charge-coupled device camera (Spot) and processed in Photoshop (Adobe). Ganglioside-rich (GR) membrane regions were labeled by incubating cells (48 h post-transfection) with 1 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (Molecular Probes) for 5 min at 37 °C (15Kenworthy A.K. Petranova N. Edidin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS and immediately visualized. In some experiments the number of cells with peripheral AKAP12β-GFP localization was quantitated by counting 100 cells per condition. Data presented are the means of three separate experiments. Localization of AKAP12 in hCASMC cells was examined by seeding cells on glass chamber slides (Nalgene) and culturing as indicated. Cells were fixed with 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. AKAP12 was detected using rabbit anti-SSeCKS antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Irwin Gelman, Roswell Park Cancer Institute) and goat anti-rabbit fluorescein (Pierce). Smooth muscle actin, a marker of differentiated smooth muscle cells, was detected with mouse anti-smooth muscle actin (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse rhodamine (Pierce). Nuclei were stained by labeling nucleic acids with 4,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Cells were visualized as described previously (13Streb J.W. Kitchen C.M. Gelman I.H. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56014-56023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Computer Analysis—The charge plot profile for AKAP12 was generated using the charge program of EMBOSS via web interface (bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/charge.html) (16Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6537) Google Scholar). The rat AKAP12 β sequence (AY695057) was used. Because of window size constraints, the charge over the first and last 10 amino acids is not included in analysis. The evolutionary conservation profile plot was created using eSHADOW (17Ovcharenko I. Boffelli D. Loots G.G. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, sequences for rat, mouse (fusion of open reading frames of BY002721 and NM_031185 to create mouse AKAP12β), and human (NM_144497) AKAP12β were submitted via Internet interface (eshadow.dcode.org/). The returned ClustalW alignment was then checked and manually edited as necessary to ensure proper alignment prior to final submission for visualization of conserved regions. Charge and Conservation of AKAP12—We recently characterized the AKAP12 gene locus and identified three separate AKAP12 transcripts, α, β, and γ (13Streb J.W. Kitchen C.M. Gelman I.H. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56014-56023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These transcripts encode distinct but largely similar proteins. Although an N-terminal myristoylation motif targets the AKAP12α protein to the endoplasmic reticulum, mutants lacking this motif localize in a similar manner as the β and γ isoforms. This finding indicates that the common AKAP12 coding sequence contains targeting information that directs localization of the AKAP12 isoforms in the absence of myristoylation. Because the subcellular distributions of endogenous AKAP12β and AKAP12γ as well as those of the AKAP12α myristoylation mutants are highly similar, we have used AKAP12β (hereafter referred to as AKAP12) here to identify the targeting domains regulating non-myristoylated AKAP12 localization. AKAP12 is a large, highly charged protein that is enriched in acidic and basic amino acid residues (nearly 1 of every 3) and has a predicted net charge of -196 at physiological pH. These charged residues are not equally distributed across the protein but rather are organized into alternating acidic and basic residue-rich (AR and BR, respectively) regions (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal half of AKAP12 is composed of seven alternating AR and BR regions. The C-terminal half, in contrast, is more uniformly negatively charged because of the wide distribution of acidic residues across this region. Comparison of the distribution of these regions with the profile of evolutionary conserved regions reveals elevated conservation of the BR regions, as compared with neutral and AR regions (Fig. 1B). Given that targeting motifs regulate a key property of AKAP function and are therefore likely to be well conserved across species, we hypothesized that these basic regions may be important determinants of AKAP12 localization. Three Regions Regulate AKAP12 Localization—To determine whether the targeting regions of AKAP12 are localized to the BR regions, we performed a first pass deletion study to identify general regions important in AKAP12 targeting (Fig. 1C). Whereas deletion of the C-terminal most 404 amino acids does not affect localization, further truncation of the C terminus (Δ791-1607) results in redistribution of AKAP12-GFP chimeras to the nucleus (Fig. 1D). Nuclear targeting is abolished and normal targeting is restored when we further deleted the region from amino acids 486 to 790 (data not shown). Finally, specific targeting is eliminated by deleting all but the first 78 amino acids. Our deletion analysis suggests the AKAP12 targeting domains are subdivided into three regions. Interestingly, these three regions span the first two BR regions, the fourth through seventh BR region, and the AR region C terminus, respectively. The first region spans amino acids 79-286 and directs the cytosolic distribution of AKAP12 as well as targeting at the cell periphery. The second region, spanning amino acids 486-790, directs localization to the nucleus. A third region at the C terminus appears to be involved in suppressing nuclear localization, because a construct containing only the first 78 and last 404 (1-78, 1203-1607) amino acids is excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 1D). However, nuclear localization of AKAP12 appears to be suppressed by an additional C-terminal sequence, as constructs containing the region spanning amino acids 791-1202 were similarly excluded from the nucleus. Thus, based on our deletion analysis, the role of the three AKAP12 targeting regions appears to be subdivided into two functions: 1) nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning; and 2) cytosolic and peripheral targeting. Nuclear Localization Potential of AKAP12—The nuclear localization potential of AKAP12 is intriguing because a recent study has demonstrated the presence of AKAP12 in nuclear fractions, a finding that likely relates to its ability to control cell cycle progression through regulation of cyclin D1 compartmentalization (14Lin X. Nelson P.J. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7259-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed differential compartmentalization of AKAP12 in some primary cell lines. In growing hCASMCs, for example, AKAP12 is predominantly localized in the nucleus with some expression in the cytosol (Fig. 2). Upon differentiation, however, AKAP12 expression diminishes greatly in the nucleus and appears to be redirected to the perinuclear region of the cytosol (Fig. 2) The reduction of AKAP12 nuclear expression is not due to reduced protein expression as detected by Western blotting (data not shown). AKAP12 also appears at times to be localized to the nucleus in vivo. When we examined tissues with high levels of AKAP12β expression, we noted nuclear AKAP12 in a subpopulation of mesenchymal cells of the bladder and lung (data not shown). Because our deletion study suggested the determinants for nuclear targeting are contained in the region spanning amino acids 486-790, we assessed whether this region was sufficient for nuclear targeting. A fusion construct comprising GFP and a sub-fragment of this region (amino acids 501-767) localizes predominantly to the nucleus, confirming that the nuclear targeting information is retained in this region (Fig. 3, B and C). As this region was localized in the same fashion as larger constructs, we focused our investigation of nuclear targeting on this subregion of AKAP12. The nuclear targeting region spans the fourth to seventh BR regions. Using PSORT (psort.org/), we scanned this region and the rest of AKAP12 to identify potential NLSs (18Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Several bipartite and SV40-type NLSs were found. The bipartite NLSs were found outside of the nuclear targeting region and do not appear to contribute to nuclear localization (data not shown). However, four SV40-type NLSs were identified in the nuclear targeting region, with one identified in each BR region (Fig. 3A). Because the region encompassing only these four NLSs is sufficient for nuclear localization (Fig. 3, B and C), we constructed further deletions to determine whether the NLSs are necessary for nuclear targeting. Deletion of a single NLS does not affect targeting, nor is the targeting of constructs containing only the two N-terminal NLSs or the two central NLSs altered (Fig. 3D). In contrast, a construct containing only the two C-terminal most NLSs is not specifically targeted to the nucleus, suggesting that the NLSs are not equal in their ability to target to the nucleus. This notion is supported by further deletions, as only the region spanning the second NLS is sufficient on its own for nuclear targeting. Taken with the other deletions, this last finding indicates that nuclear localization is only observed when the second NLS is present. Although NLS2 appears to be the dominant NLS, the result was somewhat surprising because NLS2 differs little in sequence with the other three NLSs (Fig. 3A). Identification of a Novel Class of NLS—Using mutagenesis, we assessed whether the second SV40 NLS is required for nuclear targeting (Fig. 4A). Mutagenesis of NLS2 in a construct spanning amino acids 559-612 does not affect nuclear localization (Fig. 4B). As this region lacks the other three NLSs, this finding indicates that the targeting of this region is not conferred by NLS2 but instead by another motif contained in this region. To identify the nuclear targeting sequence within amino acids 559-612 we constructed a series of GFP chimeras tiled across this region. Consistent with our mutagenesis data, a sub-region containing NLS2 was not sufficient to target to the nucleus; however, two C-terminal sub-regions displayed specific nuclear localization (Fig. 4C). This region contains several basic residues but does not represent either an SV40-type or a bipartite NLS, the two main NLS classes. Interestingly, this region is similar to the nuclear localization signal of the transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF) (19Rech J. Barlat I. Veyrune J.L. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D), and thus represents a novel third class of NLS. This class tentatively has a consensus of GXX(K/R)(K/R)XX(K/R)(K/R)XX- SXX(D/E), although identification of further NLSs of this class will be necessary to define a precise consensus. Based on the spacing of the consensus amino acids, we propose that this new class of NLS be termed X2-NLS to reflect the di-amino acid spacing between the pairs of basic residues. Both pairs of basic residues are necessary for the X2-NLS to target to the nucleus. Substitution of either pair with alanines abolishes specific nuclear localization (Fig. 4E). In contrast, substitution of the serines with alanines does not affect localization, indicating that the pairs of basic residues are the primary targeting determinant of this class of NLS (data not shown). It should be noted that the other two classes of NLS, the SV40-type and the bipartite, are also composed of two pairs of basic residues, though some substitution is allowed (e.g. proline at position 1 of the SV40-type NLS). In these cases, the spacing between pairs is 0 and 10 amino acids, respectively. In addition to differing in spacing, at least two of the NLS types are substantially different in their ability to target to the nucleus. Whereas no specific nuclear localization is observed with any of the single SV40-type NLS chimaeras, the single X2-NLS is sufficient for targeting to the nucleus (Figs. 3D and 4C). Together, these data indicate that the nuclear targeting region of AKAP12 (amino acids 501-767) contains five NLSs split between two NLS classes that differ in their ability to confer nuclear targeting. The Five NLSs Contribute to Nuclear Localization Potential—To clarify which class of NLS confers targeting to the AKAP12 nuclear localization region, we mutated either the four SV40-type NLSs or the X2-NLS and then examined localization. Mutation of all four SV40-type NLSs abolishes specific nuclear localization, indicating that these NLSs are important for localization and that the X2-NLS is not sufficient on its own for nuclear targeting in the context of the AKAP12 nuclear targeting region (Fig. 5). Mutation of the X2-NLS alone reduces the extent of nuclear localization, indicating it also contributes to nuclear targeting. However, in support of the X2-NLS being stronger than the SV40-type NLS, mutation of any single SV40-type NLS had no affect on localization (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that all five NLSs contribute to the overall nuclear localizing potential of the region between amino acids 486 and 790 of AKAP12. In support of the combinatorial nature of the NLS motifs of AKAP12, inspection of the conservation of these sites revealed that the X2-NLS and at least three of the four SV40-type NLSs are highly conserved in all species examined (human, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, Xenopus, zebrafish, and Tetraodon; data not shown). The C Terminus of AKAP12 Prevents Nuclear Localization—The presence of five functional NLSs suggests that AKAP12 should be localized to the nucleus. However, nuclear localization of AKAP12 is not always observed, indicating that AKAP12 is being excluded from the nucleus. Our initial deletion mapping experiments indicate that this exclusion is mediated by the AKAP12 C-terminal region spanning amino acids 787-1607 (Fig. 1). Moreover, fusion of this region to GFP is sufficient to exclude GFP from the nucleus (Fig. 6). To determine whether nuclear export mediates AKAP12 exclusion, we scanned this region for nuclear export sequences and examined the effect of the nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B, on targeting. Presently known nuclear export mechanisms are unlikely to be the mechanisms by which the C terminus of AKAP12 mediates nuclear exclusion, as this region lacks any clear nuclear export signals, and its targeting is not affected by leptomycin B (data not shown). To explore other potential targeting mechanisms, we searched the C terminus for conserved regions with similarity to other targeting or protein interaction domains. The only candidate domain we identified was a potential 14-3-3 binding site (data not shown). Because 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to regulate the nuclear localization of other proteins (21Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), we used deletion mapping to assess if this site was important for targeting. Deletion of the region from amino acid 787 to amino acid 883, which contains the putative 14-3-3 site, does not affect targeting, therefore excluding this site as a mediator (Fig. 6). Because we were unable to identify any known nuclear exclusion motifs by similarity or pattern searches, we instead used deletion mapping to identify sub-regions in the C terminus that mediate nuclear exclusion. In support of our initial deletion study (Fig. 1), division of the C terminus into two approximate halves does not affect nuclear exclusion, suggesting that at least two domains are capable of this function (Fig. 6). Further division of these sub-regions, however, failed to identify a specific nuclear localization domain, as none of these deletion chimeras is capable of preventing nuclear localization. Thus, the nuclear exclusion property of this region may be conferred by a pair of large complex domains or by the physical composition of the C terminus. For instance, the ability of the C-terminal sub-regions to prevent nuclear localization appears to be correlated with their net charge (Fig. 6), suggesting that the predominance of acidic residues across the C terminus is related to the targeting role of this region. The C Terminus of AKAP12 Antagonizes NLSs—As the GFP reporter we used to assess nuclear exclusion is not specifically targeted and lacks a NLS, we sought to determine whether the C terminus can specifically suppress nuclear targeting conferred by a NLS. To generate a specifically targeted GFP reporter, we tandemly fused three copies of the SV40 NLS to the C terminus of GFP (GFP-3×NLS) (Fig. 7). An AKAP12 C terminus-3×NLS chimera was then created to test the ability of this region to antagonize specific nuclear targeting. Whe"

We investigated the in vivo consequences on heart rate of such antibodies in mice immunized with a peptide derived from the second extracellular loop of the M2ACh-R compared with mice immunized with an irrelevant peptide. Sera of mice immunized with the M2ACh-R-derived peptide recognized the M2ACh-R on immunoblots and enhanced agonist activity of carbachol toward the M2AChR transfected in CHO cells. In vivo, no difference could be shown in heart rate or heart rate variability between the two groups of mice. The decrease in heart rate induced by carbachol was more pronounced, however, in the M2ACh-R immunized mice. The increase in heart rate induced by atropine, gallamine, and isoproterenol was significantly attenuated in the M2ACh-R immunized mice. Analysis of heart rate variability further argued for an increased parasympathetic response to different drugs in the M2ACh-R immunized mice. Antibodies raised against the M2AChR can behave as positive M2AChR allosteric modulators in vivo. They might be protective in boosting the activity of the parasympathetic drive to the heart, especially in patients with a high sympathetic tone."
https://openalex.org/W2164093734,"In cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis, airways are chronically injured by exposure to neutrophil elastase (NE). We sought to identify factors required for epithelial repair following NE exposure. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were treated with NE (50 nM, 22 h) or control vehicle. Following NE treatment, we found a marked and sustained decrease in epithelial proliferation as detected by Ki67 immunostaining. 3H-thymidine incorporation was also initially depressed but increased over 72 h in NE-treated cells, which suggests that DNA synthesis constitutes an early repair process following NE exposure. We hypothesized that ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase, a regulator of cancer cell proliferation, was required for epithelial DNA synthesis following NE exposure. Immediately following NE treatment, by flow cytometry analysis, we found a decrease in ErbB2 surface expression. Protein levels of the full-length 185 kD ErbB2 receptor significantly decreased following NE treatment and smaller ErbB2-positive bands, ranging in size from 23 to 40 kD, appeared, which suggests that NE caused ErbB2 degradation. By real-time RT-PCR analysis, we found no change in ErbB2 mRNA expression following NE treatment, which suggests that changes in ErbB2 protein levels were regulated at the post-translational level. Following NE treatment, full-length 185 kD ErbB2 levels increased to pretreatment levels, correlating with the increase in thymidine incorporation during the same time period. Importantly, inhibition of ErbB2 activity with AG825 (5 microM) or Herceptin (3.1 microM), an ErbB2-neutralizing antibody, blocked thymidine incorporation only in NE-treated cells. These results suggest ErbB2 is a critical factor for epithelial recovery following NE exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2011017530,"Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is toxic to neurons, but the mechanism for its action remains largely unknown. Here, we have identified a novel death-inducing protein, Abeta-related DIP (AB-DIP), by two-hybrid screening of the human brain cDNA library and confirmed the binding of Abeta with AB-DIP by coimmunoprecipitation. Overexpression of AB-DIP-induced cell death and coexpression of Abeta enhanced the cell death. During apoptosis, the 97-kDa AB-DIP was cleaved to a 62-kDa protein (AB-DIP p62) at the caspase cleavage site, LEKD. It is more important that cotransfection of Abeta with AB-DIP produced the AB-DIP p62 fragment. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of AB-DIP protein expression significantly protected neuroblastoma cells from Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. AB-DIP may mediate the neurotoxicity of Abeta, and therefore, AB-DIP may be a potential, therapeutic target for AD."
