https://openalex.org/W3199974613,"Monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated clinical benefits in cases of mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection, substantially reducing the risk for hospitalization and severe disease1-4. Treatment generally requires the administration of high doses of these monoclonal antibodies and has limited efficacy in preventing disease complications or mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-195. Here we report the development and evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies with optimized Fc domains that show superior potency for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Using several animal disease models of COVID-196,7, we demonstrate that selective engagement of activating Fcγ receptors results in improved efficacy in both preventing and treating disease-induced weight loss and mortality, significantly reducing the dose required to confer full protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge and for treatment of pre-infected animals. Our results highlight the importance of Fcγ receptor pathways in driving antibody-mediated antiviral immunity and exclude the possibility of pathogenic or disease-enhancing effects of Fcγ receptor engagement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies upon infection. These findings have important implications for the development of Fc-engineered monoclonal antibodies with optimal Fc-effector function and improved clinical efficacy against COVID-19 disease."

https://openalex.org/W3198921016,"Microbial interactions in harmful algal bloom (HAB) communities have been examined in marine systems, but are poorly studied in fresh waters. To investigate HAB-microbe interactions, we isolated bacteria with close associations to bloom-forming cyanobacteria, Microcystis spp., during a 2017 bloom in the western basin of Lake Erie. The genomes of five isolates (Exiguobacterium sp. JMULE1, Enterobacter sp. JMULE2, Deinococcus sp. JMULE3, Paenibacillus sp. JMULE4, and Acidovorax sp. JMULE5.) were sequenced on a PacBio Sequel system. These genomes ranged in size from 3.1 Mbp (Exiguobacterium sp. JMULE1) to 5.7 Mbp (Enterobacter sp. JMULE2). The genomes were analyzed for genes relating to critical metabolic functions, including nitrogen reduction and carbon utilization. All five of the sequenced genomes contained genes that could be used in potential signaling and nutrient exchange between the bacteria and cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Gene expression signatures of algal-derived carbon utilization for two isolates were identified in Microcystis blooms in Lake Erie and Lake Tai (Taihu) at low levels, suggesting these organisms are active and may have a functional role during Microcystis blooms in aggregates, but were largely missing from whole water samples. These findings build on the growing evidence that the bacterial microbiome associated with bloom-forming algae have the functional potential to contribute to nutrient exchange within bloom communities and interact with important bloom formers like Microcystis."
https://openalex.org/W3200413155,"The World Health Organization (WHO) calls for the development of a rapid, biomarker-based, non-sputum test capable of detecting all forms of tuberculosis (TB) at the point-of-care to enable immediate treatment initiation. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is the only WHO-endorsed TB biomarker that can be detected in urine, an easily collected sample matrix. For obtaining optimal sensitivity, we and others have shown that some form of sample pretreatment is necessary to remove background from patient urine samples. A number of systems are paper-based often destined for resource limited settings. Our current work presents incorporation of one such sample pretreatment, proteinase K (ProK) immobilized on paper (IPK) and test its performance in comparison to standard proteinase K (SPK) treatment that involves addition and deactivation at high temperature prior to performing a capture ELISA. Herein, a simple and economical method was developed for using ProK immobilized strips to pretreat urine samples. Simplification and cost reduction of the proposed pretreatment strip were achieved by using Whatman no.1 paper and by minimizing the concentration of ProK (an expensive but necessary reagent) used to pretreat the clinical samples prior to ELISA. To test the applicability of IPK, capture ELISA was carried out on either LAM-spiked urine or the clinical samples after pretreatment with ProK at 400 μg/mL for 30 minutes at room temperature. The optimal conditions and stability of the IPK were tested and validation was performed on a set of 25 previously analyzed archived clinical urine samples with known TB and HIV status. The results of IPK and SPK treated samples were in agreement showing that the urine LAM test currently under development has the potential to reach adult and pediatric patients regardless of HIV status or site of infection, and to facilitate global TB control to improve assay performance and ultimately treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3199707756,"Background The progress of green credit in China is accelerating, but its development is uneven and insufficient in different regions. And whether the issuance of green credit can effectively promote the improvement of the environment and economy is not well understood. Objective Previous research has found that green credit promotes economic growth through improvement of the industrial structure and green technological innovation. However, these studies have not considered the positive externality of environmental improvement even though environmental improvement and economic growth are requirements of the sustainable development concept. Methods We use the chain-mediated model to estimate the impact of green credit issuance on the economic growth of different provinces since the large-scale implementation of green credit in China with data from 2008 to 2016. Results and conclusion This paper shows that the issuance of green credit can improve labor supply rather than labor productivity through the improvement of air quality to achieve regional economic growth. Such a chain-mediated path is different from the economic growth caused by industrial structural adjustment and green technology innovation. At the national level, every 1% increase in green credit issuance relative to industrial loans will increase the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) by approximately 4.6 yuan, or 0.012%, through air quality and labor supply, accounting for 2.875% of the total effect. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that due to regional industrial structure differences and diminishing marginal effects, the impact of green credit is stronger in the western region than in the eastern and central regions. For every 1% increase in the proportion of green credit issuance relative to industrial loans, the per capita GDP growth achieved through the chain-mediated path is approximately 30.17 yuan in the western region, approximately 6.6 times greater than that at the national level. Within a 95% confidence interval of 5000 bootstrap samples, this path is found to be true, and the chain-mediated effect accounts for approximately 12.96% of the total indirect effect. Limitations The limitation of this paper is the measurement of green credit. Although green credit has a large volume, it remains underdeveloped, and there is a lack of perfect indicators. Most existing studies have adopted only alternative or reverse indicators to measure the issuance of green credit. For example, this paper takes the interest expenditure of six high-energy-consuming enterprises as the reverse indicator, which may to a certain extent lead to the overestimation of the issuance of green credit and its impact on the environment and economy. Future research can accurately explore the performance of green credit on the basis of its mature development."
https://openalex.org/W3199778408,"Wildlife rehabilitation is a publicly popular practice, though not without controversy. State wildlife agencies frequently debate the ecological impact of rehabilitation. By analyzing case records, we can clarify and quantify the causes for rehabilitation, species involved, and treatment outcomes. This data would aid regulatory agencies and rehabilitators in making informed decisions, as well as gaining insight into causes of species mortality. In New York State, the Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) has licensed rehabilitators since 1980 and annual reporting is required. In this study, we analyzed 58,185 individual wildlife cases that were attended by New York rehabilitators between 2012 and 2014. These encompassed 30,182 (51.9%) birds, 25,447 (43.7%) mammals, 2,421 (4.2%) reptiles, and 75 (0.1%) amphibians. We identified patterns among taxonomic representation, reasons for presentation to a rehabilitation center, and animal disposition. Major causes of presentation were trauma (n = 22,156; 38.1%) and orphaning (n = 21,679; 37.3%), with habitat loss (n = 3,937; 6.8%), infectious disease (n = 1,824; 3.1%), and poisoning or toxin exposure (n = 806; 1.4%) playing lesser roles. The overall release rate for animals receiving care was 50.2% while 45.3% died or were euthanized during the rehabilitation process. A relatively small number (0.3%) were permanently non-releasable and placed in captivity; 4.1% had unknown outcomes. A comparable evaluation in 1989 revealed that wildlife submissions have increased (annual mean 12,583 vs 19,395), and are accompanied by a significant improvement in release (50.2% in the study period vs 44.4% in 1989) (χ 2 (1) = 90.43, p &lt; 0.0001). In this manuscript, we aim to describe the rehabilitator community in New York State, and present the causes and outcomes for rehabilitation over a three-year period."
https://openalex.org/W3201117601,"Androgen excess is one of the most common endocrine disorders of reproductive-aged women, affecting up to 20% of this population. Women with elevated androgens often exhibit hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. The mechanisms of how elevated androgens affect metabolic function are not clear. Hyperandrogenemia in a dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated female mouse model induces whole body insulin resistance possibly through activation of the hepatic androgen receptor (AR). We investigated the role of hepatocyte AR in hyperandrogenemia-induced metabolic dysfunction by using several approaches to delete hepatic AR via animal-, cell-, and clinical-based methodologies. We conditionally disrupted hepatocyte AR in female mice developmentally (LivARKO) or acutely by tail vein injection of an adeno-associated virus with a liver-specific promoter for Cre expression in ARfl/fl mice (adLivARKO). We observed normal metabolic function in littermate female Control (ARfl/fl ) and LivARKO (ARfl/fl ; Cre+/- ) mice. Following chronic DHT treatment, female Control mice treated with DHT (Con-DHT) developed impaired glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and insulin tolerance, not observed in LivARKO mice treated with DHT (LivARKO-DHT). Furthermore, during an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, the glucose infusion rate was improved in LivARKO-DHT mice compared to Con-DHT mice. Liver from LivARKO, and primary hepatocytes derived from LivARKO, and adLivARKO mice were protected from DHT-induced insulin resistance and increased gluconeogenesis. These data support a paradigm in which elevated androgens in females disrupt metabolic function via hepatic AR and insulin sensitivity was restored by deletion of hepatic AR."
https://openalex.org/W3201294258,"Previous studies have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to hepatic steatosis in several manners. However, how lipid droplet (LD) proteins participate in this process has rarely been reported. In the present study, ER stress was induced at both in vitro and in vivo levels with tunicamycin in large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). Effects of LD protein perilipin2 (PLIN2) on hepatic lipid accumulation and lipoprotein transport under normal physiological condition and ER stress were then explored using dsRNA mediated knockdown. Subsequently, the transcriptional regulation of plin2 expression by transcription factors generated in the unfolded protein response (UPR) was determined by dual-luciferase reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. We demonstrated that ER stress could promote LDs accumulation and inhibit lipoprotein transport by transcriptionally upregulating PLIN2 in liver. Among the transcription factors generated by UPR, spliced X-box binding protein1 can directly upregulated the expression of plin2, whereas C/EBP homologous protein can upregulate the expression of plin2 through peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor α. These results revealed that the LD protein PLIN2 played an important role in ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis, which might be a novel mechanism explaining hepatic steatosis triggered by ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W3200865246,"Background and objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted health systems worldwide, including in Bangladesh, limiting access to family planning information (FP) and services. Unfortunately, the evidence on the factors linked to such disruption is limited, and no study has addressed the link among Bangladeshis. This study aimed to examine the socioeconomic, demographic, and other critical factors linked to the use of FP in the studied areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The characteristics of the respondents were assessed using a cross-sectional questionnaire survey and descriptive statistics. The variables that were substantially linked with FP usage were identified using a Chi-square test. In addition, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify the parameters linked to FP in the study areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results The prevalence of FP use among currently married 15–49 years aged women was 36.03% suggesting a 23% (approximately) decrease compared to before pandemic data. Results also showed that 24.42% of the respondents were using oral contraceptive pills (OCP) which is lower than before pandemic data (61.7%). Multivariate regression analysis provided broader insight into the factors affecting FP use. Results showed that woman’s age, education level of the respondents, working status of the household head, locality, reading a newspaper, FP workers’ advice, currently using OCP, ever used OCP, husbands’ supportive attitude towards OCP use, duration of the marriage, ever pregnant, the number of children and dead child were significantly associated with FP use in the study areas during COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions This study discusses unobserved factors that contributed to a reduction in FP use and identifies impediments to FP use in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 epidemic. This research further adds to our understanding of FP usage by revealing the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on FP use in Bangladesh’s rural and urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W3199237219,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is associated with hepatic metabolic function, yet it is not well understood how endoplasmic reticulum (ER) disturbance might influence metabolic homeostasis. Here, we describe the physiological function of Cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2 (Creld2), previously characterized as a downstream target of the ER-stress signal transducer Atf6. To this end, we generated Creld2-deficient mice and induced UPR by injection of tunicamycin. Creld2 augments protein folding and creates an interlink between the UPR axes through its interaction with proteins involved in the cellular stress response. Thereby, Creld2 promotes tolerance to ER stress and recovery from acute stress. Creld2-deficiency leads to a dysregulated UPR and causes the development of hepatic steatosis during ER stress conditions. Moreover, Creld2-dependent enhancement of the UPR assists in the regulation of energy expenditure. Furthermore, we observed a sex dimorphism in human and mouse livers with only male patients showing an accumulation of CRELD2 protein during the progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and only male Creld2-deficient mice developing hepatic steatosis upon aging. These results reveal a Creld2 function at the intersection between UPR and metabolic homeostasis and suggest a mechanism in which chronic ER stress underlies fatty liver disease in males."
https://openalex.org/W3185888696,"The present study examined individual characteristics potentially associated with changes in mitigation behaviors (social distancing and hygiene) recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Analysis of online survey responses from 361 adults, ages 20–78, with US IP addresses, identified significant correlates of adaptive behavioral changes, with implications for preventive strategies and mental health needs. The extent to which individuals changed their mitigation behaviors was unrelated to self-rated health or concern regarding the personal effects of COVID-19 but was related to concern regarding the effects of the pandemic on others. Thus, mitigation behaviors do not appear to be primarily motivated by self-protection. Importantly, adaptive changes in mitigation behaviors increased with age. However, these changes, particularly those related to the frequency of close proximity encounters, appear to be due to age-related decreases in anxiety and depression. Taken together, the present results argue against over-reliance on ‘fear appeals’ in public health messages as they may increase anxiety and depression. Instead, the present findings argue for more appeals to people’s concern for others to motivate mitigation as well as indicating an immediate need to address individual mental health concerns for the sake of society as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W3199446699,"Cities are increasingly promoting walkability to tackle climate change, improve urban quality of life, and address socioeconomic inequities that auto-oriented development tends to exacerbate, prompting a need for predictive pedestrian flow models. This paper implements a novel network-based pedestrian flow model at a property-level resolution in the City of Melbourne. Data on Melbourne’s urban form, land-uses, amenities, and pedestrian walkways as well as weather conditions are used to predict pedestrian flows between different land-use pairs, which are subsequently calibrated against hourly observed pedestrian counts from automated sensors. Calibration allows the model extrapolate pedestrian flows on all streets throughout the city center based on reliable baseline observations, and to forecast how new development projects will change existing pedestrian flows. Longitudinal data availability also allows us to validate how accurate such predictions are by comparing model results to actual pedestrian counts observed in following years. Updating the built-environment data annually, we (1) test the accuracy of different calibration techniques for predicting foot-traffic on the city’s streets in subsequent years; (2) assess how changes in the built environment affect changes in foot-traffic; (3) analyze which pedestrian origin-destination flows explain observed foot-traffic during three peak weekday periods; and (4) assess the stability of model predictions over time. We find that annual changes in the built environment have a significant and measurable impact on the spatial distribution of Melbourne’s pedestrian flows. We hope this novel framework can be used by planners to implement “pedestrian impact assessments” for newly planned developments, which can complement traditional vehicular “traffic impact assessments”."
https://openalex.org/W3199894170,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by adiposity and atherogenic dyslipidemia consisting of elevated triglyceride and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels however, cholesterol concentration alone does not reflect HDL functionality. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) captures a key anti-atherosclerotic function of HDL; studies linking CEC to MetS have yielded inconsistent findings and lacked racial/ethnic diversity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between CEC and MetS in a large multi-ethnic population utilizing two different CEC assays interrogating overlapping but distinct reverse cholesterol transport pathways. A cross-sectional study was performed using the Dallas Heart Study cohort and cholesterol efflux was measured with radiolabeled and fluorescent cholesterol assays. The relationship between CEC and MetS was assessed using multivariable regression analyses. A total of 2241 participants were included (mean age was 50 years; 38% men and 53% Blacks). CEC was independently and inversely associated with MetS irrespective of efflux assay (CEC-radiolabeled, adjusted OR 0·71 [95% CI 0·65-0·80]. CEC-fluorescent, adjusted OR 0·85 [95% CI 0·77-0·94]). Both CEC measures were inversely associated with waist circumference and directly associated with HDL-C but not with other MetS components. There was an interaction by sex but not by race such that the inverse associations between CEC and MetS were somewhat attenuated in men (OR 0·86, 95%CI 0·74-1·01). In this large multi-ethnic cohort, impaired CEC is linked to MetS irrespective of efflux assay and race/ethnicity but less so among men. Future studies are needed to assess whether CEC mediates the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk of MetS."
https://openalex.org/W3199174046,"Myocardial fibrosis is a characteristic of various cardiomyopathies, and myocardial fibroblasts play a central role in this process. Gelsolin (GSN) is an actin severing and capping protein that regulates actin assembly and may be involved in fibroblast activation. While the role of GSN in mechanical stress-mediated cardiac fibrosis has been explored, its role in myocardial fibrosis in the absence of mechanical stress is not defined. In this study, we investigated the role of GSN in myocardial fibrosis induced by Angiotensin II (Ang II), a profibrotic hormone that is elevated in cardiovascular disease. We utilized mice lacking GSN (Gsn-/- ) and cultured primary adult cardiac fibroblasts (cFB). In vivo, Ang II infusion in mice resulted in significantly less severe myocardial fibrosis in Gsn-/- compared with Gsn+/+ mice, along with diminished activation of the TGFβ1-Smad2/3 pathway, and reduced expression of cardiac extracellular matrix proteins (collagen, fibronectin, periostin). Moreover, Gsn-deficient hearts exhibited suppressed activity of the AMPK pathway and its downstream effectors, mTOR and P70S6Kinase, which could contribute to the suppressed TGFβ1 activity. In vitro, the Ang II-induced activation of cFBs was reduced in Gsn-deficient fibroblasts evident from decreased expression of αSMA and periostin, diminished actin filament turnover; which also exhibited reduced activity of the AMPK-mTOR pathway, and P70S6K phosphorylation. AMPK inhibition compensated for the loss of GSN, restored the levels of G-actin in Gsn-/- cFBs and promoted activation to myofibroblasts by increasing αSMA and periostin levels. This study reveals a novel role for GSN in mediating myocardial fibrosis by regulating the AMPK-mTOR-P70S6K pathway in cFB activation independent from mechanical stress-induced factors."
https://openalex.org/W3199549809,"Marine algae catalyze half of all global photosynthetic production of carbohydrates. Owing to their fast growth rates, Ulva spp. rapidly produce substantial amounts of carbohydrate-rich biomass and represent an emerging renewable energy and carbon resource. Their major cell wall polysaccharide is the anionic carbohydrate ulvan. Here, we describe a new enzymatic degradation pathway of the marine bacterium Formosa agariphila for ulvan oligosaccharides involving unsaturated uronic acid at the nonreducing end linked to rhamnose-3-sulfate and glucuronic or iduronic acid (Δ-Rha3S-GlcA/IdoA-Rha3S). Notably, we discovered a new dehydratase (P29_PDnc) acting on the nonreducing end of ulvan oligosaccharides, i.e., GlcA/IdoA-Rha3S, forming the aforementioned unsaturated uronic acid residue. This residue represents the substrate for GH105 glycoside hydrolases, which complements the enzymatic degradation pathway including one ulvan lyase, one multimodular sulfatase, three glycoside hydrolases, and the dehydratase P29_PDnc, the latter being described for the first time. Our research thus shows that the oligosaccharide dehydratase is involved in the degradation of carboxylated polysaccharides into monosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W3200128815,"It has been known that moderate mechanical loading, like that caused by exercise, promotes bone formation. However, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we showed that moderate running dramatically improved trabecular bone in mice tibias with an increase in bone volume fraction and trabecular number and a decrease in trabecular pattern factor. Results of immunohistochemical and histochemical staining revealed that moderate running mainly increased the number of osteoblasts but had no effect on osteoclasts. In addition, we observed a dramatic increase in the number of colony forming unit-fibroblast in endosteal bone marrow and the percentage of CD45- Leptin receptor+ (CD45- LepR+ ) endosteal mesenchymal progenitors. Bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptional data from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database identified chemokine c-c-motif ligands (CCL2) as a critical candidate induced by mechanical loading. Interestingly, we found that CCL2 was up-regulated mainly in osteoblastic cells in the tibia of mice after moderate running. Further, we found that mechanical loading up-regulated the expression of CCL2 by activating ERK1/2 pathway, thereby stimulating migration of endosteal progenitors. Finally, neutralizing CCL2 abolished the recruitment of endosteal progenitors and the increased bone formation in mice after 4 weeks running. These results therefore uncover an unknown connection between osteoblasts and endosteal progenitors recruited in the increased bone formation induced by mechanical loading."

The mutant protein carries a 15 amino acid C-terminal extension associated with pathogenicity. Here we report the first animal model of the disease by expressing the human mutant TNPO3 gene in Drosophila musculature or motor neurons and concomitantly silencing the endogenous expression of the fly protein ortholog. A similar genotype expressing wildtype TNPO3 served as a control. Phenotypes characterization revealed that mutant TNPO3 expression targeted at muscles or motor neurons caused LGMDD2-like phenotypes such as muscle degeneration and atrophy, and reduced locomotor ability. Notably, LGMDD2 mutation increase TNPO3 at the transcript and protein level in the Drosophila model Upregulated muscle autophagy observed in LGMDD2 patients was also confirmed in the fly model, in which the anti-autophagic drug chloroquine was able to rescue histologic and functional phenotypes. Overall, we provide a proof of concept of autophagy as a target to treat disease phenotypes and propose a neurogenic component to explain mutant TNPO3 pathogenicity in diseased muscles."
https://openalex.org/W3199816176,"Sex as a physiologic factor has a strong association with the features of metabolic syndrome. Our previous study showed that loss of the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 inhibits insulin secretion and leads to hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in male mice. However, there are significant differences in blood glucose between male and female Hv1-knockout (KO) mice. Here, we investigated the differences in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity between male and female KO mice and how sex steroids contribute to these differences. We found that the fasting blood glucose in female KO mice was visibly lower than that in male KO mice, which was accompanied by hypotestosteronemia. KO mice in both sexes exhibited higher expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes in liver compared with WT mice. Also, the livers from KO males displayed a decrease in glycolysis-related gene expression and an increase in gluconeogenesis-related gene expression compared with KO females. Furthermore, exogenous testosterone supplementation decreased blood glucose levels in male KO mice, as well as enhancing insulin signaling. Taken together, our data demonstrate that knockout of Hv1 results in higher blood glucose levels in male than female mice, despite a decreased insulin secretion in both sexes. This sex-related difference in glucose homeostasis is associated with the glucose metabolism in liver tissue, likely due to the physiological levels of testosterone in KO male mice."
https://openalex.org/W3199892130,"Leukotrienes play a central pathophysiological role in both paediatric and adult asthma. However, 35% to 78% of asthmatics do not respond to leukotriene inhibitors. In this study we tested the role of the LTA4H regulatory variant rs2660845 and age of asthma onset in response to montelukast in ethnically diverse populations. We identified and genotyped 3,594 asthma patients treated with montelukast (2,514 late-onset and 1,080 early-onset) from seven cohorts (UKBiobank, GoSHARE, BREATHE, Tayside RCT, PAGES, GALA II and SAGE). Individuals under montelukast treatment experiencing at least one exacerbation in a 12-month period were compared against individuals with no exacerbation, using logistic regression for each cohort and meta-analysis. While no significant association was found with European late-onset subjects, a meta-analysis of 523 early-onset individuals from European ancestry demonstrated the odds of experiencing asthma exacerbations by carriers of at least one G allele, despite montelukast treatment, were increased (odds-ratio = 2.92, 95%confidence interval (CI): 1.04-8.18, I2 = 62%, p = 0.0412) compared to those in the AA group. When meta-analysing with other ethnic groups, no significant increased risk of asthma exacerbations was found (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 0.61-4.19, I2 = 85%, p = 0.342). Our study demonstrates that genetic variation in LTA4H, together with timing of asthma onset, may contribute to variability in montelukast response. European individuals with early-onset (≤18y) carrying at least one copy of rs2660845 have increased odd of exacerbation under montelukast treatment, presumably due to the up-regulation of LTA4H activity. These findings support a precision medicine approach for the treatment of asthma with montelukast."
https://openalex.org/W3199969292,"Despite the awareness of the importance of mental health problems among adolescents in developed countries like Australia, inequality has not been widely researched. This study, is therefore, aimed to measure and compare household income-related and area-based socioeconomic inequalities in mental health problems (bullying victimization, mental disorders–single and multiple, self-harm and suicidality–ideation, plan and attempt) among Australian adolescents aged 12–17 years. Young Minds Matter (YMM)—the 2 nd national cross-sectional mental health and well-being survey involving Australian children and adolescents conducted in 2013–14, was used in this study to select data for adolescents aged 12–17 years (n = 2521). Outcome variables included: bullying, mental disorders, self-harm, and suicidal ideation, plan and attempt. The Erreygers’s corrected concentration index (CI) approach was used to measure the socioeconomic inequalities in mental health problems using two separate rank variables–equivalised household income quintiles and area-based Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD) quintiles. The prevalence of mental health problems in the previous 12-months among these study participants were: bullying victimization (31.1%, 95% CI: 29%-33%), mental disorder (22.9%, 95% CI: 21%-24%), self-harm (9.1%, 95% CI: 8%-10%), suicidal ideation (8.5%, 95% CI: 7%-10%), suicidal plan (5.9%, 95% CI: 5%-7%) and suicidal attempt (2.8%, 95% CI: 2%-3%). The concentration indices (CIs) were statistically significant for bullying victimization (CI = -0.049, p = 0.020), multiple mental disorders (CI = -0.088, p = &lt;0.001), suicidal ideation (CI = -0.023, p = 0.047) and suicidal attempt (CI = -0.021, p = 0.002), implying pro-poor socioeconomic inequalities based on equivalized household income quintiles. Similar findings revealed when adolescents mental health inequalities calculated on the basis of area based IRSAD (Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage) quintiles. Overall, adolescents from economically worse-off families experienced more mental health-related problems compared to those from economically better-off families. This has implications for prevention strategies and government policy in order to promote mental health and provide equitable healthcare facility."
https://openalex.org/W3200039945,"Uterine glands are essential for the establishment of pregnancy and have critical roles in endometrial receptivity to blastocyst implantation, stromal cell decidualization, and placentation. Uterine gland dysfunction is considered a major contributing factor to pregnancy loss, however our understanding of how glands impact embryo survival and stromal cell decidualization is incomplete. Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) is expressed only in the glandular epithelium and regulates its development and function. Mice with a conditional deletion of FOXA2 in the uterus are infertile due to defective embryo implantation arising from a lack of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a critical factor of uterine gland origin. Here, a glandless FOXA2-deficient mouse model, coupled with LIF repletion to rescue the implantation defect, was used to investigate the roles of uterine glands in embryo survival and decidualization. Studies found that embryo survival and decidualization were compromised in glandless FOXA2-deficient mice on gestational day 6.5, resulting in abrupt pregnancy loss by day 7.5. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that uterine glands secrete factors other than LIF that impact embryo survival and stromal cell decidualization for pregnancy success."
https://openalex.org/W3200949898,"Skin cancer is currently the most common type of cancer among Caucasians. The increase in life expectancy, along with new diagnostic tools and treatments for skin cancer, has resulted in unprecedented changes in patient care and has generated a great burden on healthcare systems. Early detection of skin tumors is expected to reduce this burden. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that support skin cancer diagnoses have been shown to perform at least as well as dermatologists' diagnoses. Recognizing the need for clinically and economically efficient means of diagnosing skin cancers at early stages in the primary care attention, we developed an efficient computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to be used by primary care physicians (PCP). Additionally, we developed a smartphone application with a protocol for data acquisition (i.e., photographs, demographic data and short clinical histories) and AI algorithms for clinical and dermoscopic image classification. For each lesion analyzed, a report is generated, showing the image of the suspected lesion and its respective Heat Map; the predicted probability of the suspected lesion being melanoma or malignant; the probable diagnosis based on that probability; and a suggestion on how the lesion should be managed. The accuracy of the dermoscopy model for melanoma was 89.3%, and for the clinical model, 84.7% with 0.91 and 0.89 sensitivity and 0.89 and 0.83 specificity, respectively. Both models achieved an area under the curve (AUC) above 0.9. Our CAD system can screen skin cancers to guide lesion management by PCPs, especially in the contexts where the access to the dermatologist can be difficult or time consuming. Its use can enable risk stratification of lesions and/or patients and dramatically improve timely access to specialist care for those requiring urgent attention."
https://openalex.org/W3201620601,"Autophagy is a self-phagocytic and highly evolutionarily conserved intracellular lysosomal catabolic system, which plays a vital role in a variety of trauma models, including skin wound healing (SWH). However, the roles and potential mechanisms of autophagy in SWH are still controversial. We firstly investigated the role of autophagy in SWH-induced wound closure rate, inflammatory response, and histopathology, utilizing an inhibitor of autophagy 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and its agonist rapamycin (RAP). As expected, we found 3-MA treatment remarkably increased the wound closure rate, combated inflammation response, and mitigated histopathological changes, while RAP delivery aggravated SWH-induced pathological damage. To further exploit the underlying mechanism of autophagy regulating inflammation, the specific inhibitors of yes-associated protein (YAP), Verteporfin, and Anti-IL-33 were applied. Herein, treating with 3-MA markedly suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and IL-6, promoted that of IL-10, IL-33, and ST2, while RAP administration reverted SWH-induced the up-regulation of these inflammatory cytokines mentioned above. Importantly, Verteporfin administration not only down-regulated the expression levels of YAP, TNF-α, and IL-6 but also up-regulated that of IL-33 and IL-10. Unexpectedly, 3-MA or RAP retreatment did not have any impact on the changes in IL-33 among these inflammatory indicators. Furthermore, elevated expression of IL-33 promoted wound closure and alleviated the pathological damage, whereas, its antagonist Anti-IL-33 treatment overtly reversed the above-mentioned effects of IL-33. Moreover, 3-MA in combination with anti-IL-33 treatment reversed the role of 3-MA alone in mitigated pathological changes, but they failed to revert the effect of anti-IL-33 alone on worsening pathological damage. In sum, emerging data support the novel contribution of the YAP/IL-33 pathway in autophagy inhibition against SWH-induced pathological damage, and highlight that the autophagy/YAP/IL-33 signal axis is expected to become a new therapeutic target for SWH."
https://openalex.org/W3199070398,"Background Life satisfaction is associated with many important health outcomes among older adults and is an indicator of successful ageing. The present study aims to replicate earlier findings regarding relationships between satisfaction with various life domains and life satisfaction in older adults. The study furthermore explores how parental status is associated with satisfaction with different life domains and how two types of intergenerational contact (contact with own children; post-retirement work in childcare) relate to life satisfaction. Methods Participants were 1978 older adults, aged 65–75 year (51.7% female), who live in Bremen and took part in the OUTDOOR ACTIVE study. 82.6% of the participants had one or more children. All participants completed a questionnaire, which among others comprised items assessing life satisfaction as well as satisfaction with six different life domains (satisfaction with living situation, financial situation, leisure time, health, family, neighbors and friends). Results LS is significantly related to all of the investigated life domains, independent of sex and age. For the participants with children, life satisfaction had the highest association with satisfaction with family (β: 0.202; 95%CI: 0.170–0.235), followed by satisfaction with neighbors and friends (β: 0.151; 95%CI: 0.111–0.191), and health satisfaction (β: 0.148; 95%CI: 0.120–0.176). In comparison to that, participants without children had the highest association between life satisfaction and satisfaction with health (β: 0.193; 95%CI: 0.135–0.252), followed by satisfaction with family (β: 0.175; 95%CI: 0.114–0.236) and satisfaction with neighbors and friends (β: 0.154; 95%CI: 0.077–0.232). In participants with children, there was a non-significant negative association between life satisfaction and work in childcare (β: -0.031; 95%CI: -0.178–0.116), while life satisfaction was statistically significantly positively associated to work in childcare in participants without own children (β: 0.681; 95%CI: 0.075–1.288). Conclusions The results suggest that the domain-specific approach to life satisfaction can elucidate differences in the correlates of life satisfaction and well-being between older adults with and without children. They further suggest that the benefits of working with children for life satisfaction may be more pronounced in older adults without children than older adults with children."
https://openalex.org/W3199937311,"Background Adolescent pregnancy is considered a major contributor to maternal and child morbidity and mortality, the greatest concern of developing countries and an important public health issue globally. Adolescents are responsible for eleven percent of births worldwide and they face several pregnancy and childbirth related complications. However, in low-income countries like Ethiopia, there are limited researches conducted to investigate outcomes of adolescent pregnancy. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the adverse maternal outcomes of adolescent pregnancy in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in 12 health facilities from seven districts in East Gojjam zone, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 418 adolescents (15–19 years old) and 836 adult women (20–34 years old) who attended randomly selected health facilities in East Gojjam zone were included. Data were collected starting from admission to the maternity ward for labor and delivery, and postnatal depression was measured at six weeks’ postpartum period using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to account for the within subject correlation and assess the effect of different known factors that could influence the outcome of this study. Results A lower percentage of adolescent (58.4%) than adult (71.2%) women had their first antenatal care booking before 16 weeks of gestation. After adjusting for different confounding factors, the adverse outcome that was significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy was postpartum depression (AOR: 2.29; 95% CI, 1.42, 3.7, p-value = 0 . 001) . Assisted vaginal delivery (AOR: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23, 0.86, p-value 0 . 016) and cesarean section (AOR: 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19, 0.97, p-value = 0 . 042) were significantly lower among adolescent women. Conclusions Adolescent pregnancy is associated with higher odds of postpartum depression, and lower odds to undergo cesarean section and assisted vaginal delivery than adult women. Perinatal care services should be more adolescent-friendly to ensure early diagnosis and treatment of postpartum depression. School and community-based awareness programs regarding use of contraception to prevent unwanted adolescent pregnancy, early antenatal care booking and adverse pregnancy outcomes of adolescent pregnancy and provision of psychosocial support are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3200036816,"In earlier work, we have developed and evaluated an alternative approach to the analysis of GWAS data, based on a statistic called the PPLD. More recently, motivated by a GWAS for genetic modifiers of the X-linked Mendelian disorder Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), we adapted the PPLD for application to time-to-event (TE) phenotypes. Because DMD itself is relatively rare, this is a setting in which the very large sample sizes generally assembled for GWAS are simply not attainable. For this reason, statistical methods specially adapted for use in small data sets are required. Here we explore the behavior of the TE-PPLD via simulations, comparing the TE-PPLD with Cox Proportional Hazards analysis in the context of small to moderate sample sizes. Our results will help to inform our approach to the DMD study going forward, and they illustrate several respects in which the TE-PPLD, and by extension the original PPLD, offer advantages over regression-based approaches to GWAS in this context."
https://openalex.org/W3200097657,"Metabolic stress contributes to the regulation of cell death in normal and diseased tissues. While different forms of cell death are known to be regulated by metabolic stress, how the cell engulfment and killing mechanism entosis is regulated is not well understood. Here we find that the death of entotic cells is regulated by the presence of amino acids and activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Amino acid withdrawal or mTOR inhibition induces apoptosis of engulfed cells and blocks entotic cell death that is associated with the lipidation of the autophagy protein microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) to entotic vacuoles. Two other live cell engulfment programs, homotypic cell cannibalism (HoCC) and anti-CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis, known as phagoptosis, also undergo a similar vacuole maturation sequence involving LC3 lipidation and lysosome fusion, but only HoCC involves mTOR-dependent regulation of vacuole maturation and engulfed cell death similar to entosis. We further find that the regulation of cell death by mTOR is independent of autophagy activation and instead involves the 4E-BP1/2 proteins that are known regulators of mRNA translation. Depletion of 4E-BP1/2 proteins can restore the mTOR-regulated changes of entotic death and apoptosis rates of engulfed cells. These results identify amino acid signaling and the mTOR-4E-BP1/2 pathway as an upstream regulation mechanism for the fate of live engulfed cells formed by entosis and HoCC."
https://openalex.org/W3200211309,"Winter mortality can strongly affect the population dynamics of blue crabs ( Callinectes sapidus) near poleward range limits. We simulated winter in the lab to test the effects of temperature, salinity, and estuary of origin on blue crab winter mortality over three years using a broad range of crab sizes from both Great South Bay and Chesapeake Bay. We fit accelerated failure time models to our data and to data from prior blue crab winter mortality experiments, illustrating that, in a widely distributed, commercially valuable marine decapod, temperature, salinity, size, estuary of origin, and winter duration were important predictors of winter mortality. Furthermore, our results suggest that extrapolation of a Chesapeake Bay based survivorship model to crabs from New York estuaries yielded poor fits. As such, the severity and duration of winter can impact northern blue crab populations differently along latitudinal gradients. In the context of climate change, future warming could possibility confer a benefit to crab populations near the range edge that are currently limited by temperature-induced winter mortality by shifting their range edge poleward, but care must be taken in generalizing from models that are developed based on populations from one part of the range to populations near the edges, especially for species that occupy large geographical areas."
https://openalex.org/W3200303264,"A parameter is a numerical factor whose values help us to identify a system. Connectivity parameters are essential in the analysis of connectivity of various kinds of networks. In graphs, the strength of a cycle is always one. But, in a fuzzy incidence graph (FIG), the strengths of cycles may vary even for a given pair of vertices. Cyclic reachability is an attribute that decides the overall connectedness of any network. In graph the cycle connectivity ( CC ) from vertex a to vertex b and from vertex b to vertex a is always one. In fuzzy graph (FG) the CC from vertex a to vertex b and from vertex b to vertex a is always same. But if someone is interested in finding CC from vertex a to an edge ab , then graphs and FGs cannot answer this question. Therefore, in this research article, we proposed the idea of CC for FIG. Because in FIG, we can find CC from vertex a to vertex b and also from vertex a to an edge ab . Also, we proposed the idea of CC of fuzzy incidence cycles (FICs) and complete fuzzy incidence graphs ( CFIGs ). The fuzzy incidence cyclic cut-vertex, fuzzy incidence cyclic bridge, and fuzzy incidence cyclic cut pair are established. A condition for CFIG to have fuzzy incidence cyclic cut-vertex is examined. Cyclic connectivity index and average cyclic connectivity index of FIG are also investigated. Three different types of vertices, such as cyclic connectivity increasing vertex, cyclically neutral vertex and, cyclic connectivity decreasing vertex, are also defined. The real-life applications of CC of FIG in a highway system of different cities to minimize road accidents and a computer network to find the best computers among all other computers are also provided."
https://openalex.org/W3200383733,"Background Surgical procedures play an increasing role among health technologies to treat diseases. Pain often accompanies such diseases, both as a result of their pathology, but also as the side-effect of the intervention itself, and it is not only a burdensome subjective feeling, but adversely affects the recovery process, can induce complications and increases treatment costs. Acute Pain Service Teams are becoming increasingly widespread in hospitals to address post-operative pain, yet we have so far no data on how many hospitals have actually adopted this technology in Hungary. Objectives The main objectives of our study were to assess the prevalence of Acute Pain Service Teams, map their structure and operation, as well as to understand the barriers and conducive factors of their establishment in Hungarian hospitals. Methods We carried out a survey among the 72 hospitals with surgical departments. The questionnaire was filled in by 52 providers, which gave us a response rate of 72.2%. Results Our results show, that only two of the responding hospitals have Acute Pain Service Teams albeit their structure and operation are in line with the literature. In the 50 hospitals without such teams, financing difficulties and human resources shortages are mentioned to be the most important obstacles of their establishment, but the lack of initiative and interest on the part of the specialities concerned are also an important barrier. Conclusions Lagging behind the more affluent EU member states, but similarly to other Central and Eastern European countries, Acute Pain Service has been hardly adopted by Hungarian hospitals. Hungarian health professionals know the technology and would support its wider introduction, if the technical feasibility barriers could be overcome. Health policy should play a more active role to facilitate change in this area, the investment in which promises a substantial return in terms of health gains and cost savings."
https://openalex.org/W3200491845,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages express an aconitate decarboxylase (IRG1, also called ACOD1), leading to accumulation of the endogenous metabolite itaconate. However, the precise mechanisms by which elevated itaconate levels alter macrophage function are not clear. Our hypothesis is itaconate affects macrophage function through some uncertain mechanism. Based on this, we established a transcriptional and proteomic signature of macrophages stimulated by itaconate and identified the pathways of IL-1β secretion and altered iron metabolism. Consistently, the effect of IRG1 deficiency on IL-1β secretion and iron metabolism was confirmed in IRG1 knockout THP-1 cell lines. Several common inhibitors and other compounds were used to examine the molecular mechanisms involved. Only cysteine and antioxidants (catechin hydrate) could inhibit caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in itaconate-stimulated macrophages. We further found that aconitase activity was decreased by itaconate stimulation. Our results demonstrate the counteracting effects of overexpression of mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2, a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme) or cytosolic aconitase (ACO1, an iron regulatory protein) on IL-1β secretion and altered iron metabolism. Both enzyme activities were inhibited by itaconate because of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster destruction. Our findings indicate that the immunoregulatory functions of IRG1 and itaconate in macrophages are stressful Fe-S cluster of aconitases disrupting and iron metabolism rebalancing."
https://openalex.org/W3201577720,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a widely hyped concept, with its focus on the connection of smart devices to the Internet rather than on people. IoT for consumers is often called the smart home market, and a large part of that market consists of home security devices. Consumers are often motivated to purchase smart home security devices to prevent burglaries, which they fear may lead to damage to their property or threats to their families. However, they also understand that IoT home security devices may be a threat to the privacy of their personal information. To determine the relative roles of fear and privacy concerns in the decision to purchase IoT home security devices, we conducted a survey of American consumers. We used the Theory of Reasoned Action as the theoretical basis for the study. We found that fear positively affected consumer attitudes toward purchasing smart home security devices, while concerns about privacy negatively affected attitudes. We found that attitudes toward purchase, the opinions of important others, and experience with burglaries all affected intent to purchase. We also found that the relationship between privacy concerns and intent to purchase is completely mediated by attitudes, while fear has both direct and indirect effects on intent."
https://openalex.org/W3199008074,"Key Population size estimation (PSE) is instrumental for HIV/STI preventive, treatment and care services planning, implementation and delivery. The objective was to estimate the overall population of female sex workers (FSW) in all the 16 regions of Ghana using different PSE methods.Mapping of venues and complete enumeration of seaters was conducted at the formative stage prior to the bio-behavioral survey (BBS). Three PSE methods were used to derive the size estimates of FSW in the 16 regions. These include: Capture-recapture (CRC), service multiplier and three-source capture recapture (3SCRC) methods. The final choice of the estimation method used to estimate the roamer population was 3SCRC. This method was chosen because of its perfect record-linkage-hierarchic combination of three names that minimizes overmatching as well as the addition of an interaction term in the model which corrects for the dependencies in CRC.The total population size estimate of the female sex workers in the country obtained for roamers using capture re-capture was 41,746 (95% CI: 41,488-41,932). Using the service multiplier, the total population for both the roamers and seaters was 41,153 (95% CI: 37,242-45,984). The 3-source capture re-capture yielded 55,686 roamers FSW (95% CI: 47,686-63,686). The seater population was 4,363 FSW based on census/complete enumeration. The total population size estimate of FSW (seaters and roamers) in Ghana was 60,049 when 3SCRC and census were added. This represents about 0.76% of all estimated adult females aged 15-49yrs in Ghana.We report population size estimates (PSE) for FSW in Ghana. These estimates are the results of 3SCRC. These findings provide a valid and reliable source of information that should be referenced by government officials and policymakers to plan, implement and provide HIV/STI preventive, treatment, and care services for FSW in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3199105136,"The purpose of this paper is to analyse the global Sales and Operations Planning (S&amp;OP) process and investigate the steps to support consolidated business planning in worldwide operations and large-scale supply chains. The paper conducts a case study at a multinational manufacturing company applying an abductive approach. It combines the deductive logic from theory and the inductive logic from field observation in an attempt to elaborate further on theory on global S&amp;OP. The analysis is structured and guided by a novel framework for global S&amp;OP, which is developed based on the theoretical background and the case study findings. The research findings characterise the S&amp;OP process for global operations and identify challenges related to the need to synchronise the subsidiaries’ S&amp;OP efforts worldwide to deal with different contingencies of these subsidiaries, and to manage and analyse a large amount of information gathered. The research reveals how the subsidiaries’ performance is analysed by top executives along the global S&amp;OP process, feeding strategic initiatives in the organisation and identifying business opportunities like benchmarking among subsidiaries, synergies with other management practices, and global gains. This paper offers a novel investigation of the global steps on S&amp;OP in a real-life setting, offering a well-documented characterisation of the process that goes beyond the traditional local approach. Moreover, it is the first study to reveal challenges and expected outcomes of such a global perspective for S&amp;OP. The theoretical advancements of S&amp;OP research offered herein aid scholars, opening avenues for middle-range theorising, highlighting the cross-disciplinary nature of the domain, and discussing the use of concepts from related disciplines like Economics, Psychology, and Information Systems. The research findings can also assist executives, especially from multinational manufacturers, in their efforts to consolidate global planning."
https://openalex.org/W3199376247,"The current study aimed to verify whether or not passive static stretching affects balance control capacity. Thirty-eight participants (19 women and 19 men) underwent a passive static stretching session, involving the knee extensor/flexor and dorsi/plantarflexor muscles, and a control session (no stretching, CTRL). Before (PRE), immediately after (POST), after 15 (POST15) and 30 min (POST30) from stretching (or rest in CTRL), balance control was evaluated under static and dynamic conditions, with open/closed eyes, and with/without somatosensory perturbation (foam under the feet). During tests, centre of pressure (CoP) sway area and perimeter and antero-posterior and medio-lateral sway mean speed were computed. Surface electromyography root mean square (sEMG RMS) was calculated from the vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, and tibialis anterior muscles during MVC and during the balance tests. Hip flexion/extension and dorsi/plantarflexion range of motion (ROM), maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and sEMG RMS during MVC were measured at the same time points. After stretching, ROM increased (≈6.5%; P<0.05), while MVC and sEMG RMS decreased (≈9% and ≈7.5%, respectively; P<0.05). Regardless of the testing condition, CoP sway area and the perimeter remained similar, while antero-posterior and medio-lateral sway mean speed decreased by ≈8% and ≈12%, respectively (P<0.05). sEMG RMS during the balance tests increased in all muscles in POST (≈7%, P<0.05). All variables recovered in POST30. No changes occurred in CTRL. Passive static stretching did not affect the overall balance control ability. However, greater muscle activation was required to maintain similar CoP sway, thus suggesting a decrease in muscle efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3200601304,"Relative humidity (RH) was measured at hourly intervals for approximately one year in two caves at seven stations near Playa del Carmen in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Sistema Muévelo Rico is a 1.1 km long cave with 12 entrances and almost no dark zone. Río Secreto (Tuch) is a large river cave with more than 40 km of passages, and an extensive dark zone. Given the need for cave specialists to adapt to saturated humidity, presumably by cuticular thinning, the major stress of RH would be its deviation from saturation. RH in Río Secreto (Tuch) was invariant at three sites and displayed short deviations from 100% RH at the other four sites. These deviations were concentrated at the end of the nortes and beginning of the rainy season. Three of the sites in Sistema Muévelo Rico showed a similar pattern although the timing of the deviations from 100% RH was somewhat displaced. Four sites in Sistema Muévelo Rico were more variable, and were analyzed using a measure of amount of time of deviation from 100% RH for each 24 hour period. Strong seasonality was evident but, remarkably, periods of constant high humidity were not the same at all sites. In most Sistema Muévelo Rico sites, there was a detectable 24 hour cycle in RH, although it was quite weak in about half of them. For Río Secreto (Tuch) only one site showed any sign of a 24 hour cycle. The troglomorphic fauna was more or less uniformly spread throughout the caves and did not concentrate in any one area or set of RH conditions. Compared to temperature, RH is much more constant, perhaps even more constant than the amount of light. However, changes in RH as a result of global warming may have a major negative effect on the subterranean fauna."
https://openalex.org/W3200761833,"The growth period, phenology, grain yield and gum content of two different guar ecotypes were studied in response to different sowing dates and plant densities. A two-year field experiment was conducted as a split-factorial in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates in the research field of Tarbiat Modares University during 2016 and 2017 growing season. Main plots consisted of four sowing dates (May 21, June 4, June 21 and July 5 in 2016 and May 10, May 26, June 10 and June 26 in 2017), and subplots including three plant densities (13, 20 and 40 plants m -2 ) and two ecotypes (Pakistani and Indian). Based on findings, the phenological traits, plant height, grain yield and harvest index were significantly affected by plant density. The effect of ecotypes was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) on all traits except harvest index in the first year. Furthermore, the seed sowings on May 21 and May 26 with 13 plants m -2 led to highest grain yield (3004.8 and 2826.10 kg.ha -1 for two consecutive years). The high gum content (33.68 and 33.78% for two consecutive years) was also recorded for Pakistani ecotype while for gravity, Indian ecotype showed higher value in both crop years.

To address this, we present Exogene, a sensitive and efficient workflow for detecting viral integrations from paired-end next generation sequencing data. Exogene's read filtering and breakpoint detection strategies yield integration coordinates that are highly concordant with long read validation. We demonstrate this concordance across 6 TCGA Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor samples, identifying integrations of hepatitis B virus that are also supported by long reads. Additionally, we applied Exogene to targeted capture data from 426 previously studied HCC samples, achieving 98.9% concordance with existing methods and identifying 238 high-confidence integrations that were not previously reported. Exogene is applicable to multiple types of paired-end sequence data, including genome, exome, RNA-Seq and targeted capture."

When psyllid-plant associations involve economically important crops, this may lead to the recognition of a psyllid species as an agricultural or horticultural pest. The Australian endemic tea tree, Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden &amp; Betche) Cheel., has been used for more than a century to extract essential oils and, long before that, as a traditional medicine by Indigenous Australian people. Recently, a triozid species has been found to damage the new growth of tea trees both in Queensland and New South Wales, raising interest around this previously undocumented pest. Furthermore, adults of the same species were also collected from Citrus plantations, leading to potential false-positive records of the exotic pest Trioza erytreae (Del Guercio 1918), the African Citrus psyllid. Here we describe for the first time Trioza melaleucae Martoni sp. nov. providing information on its distribution, host plant associations and phylogenetic relationships to other Trioza species. This work enables both morphological and molecular identification of this new species, allowing it to be recognized and distinguished for the first time from exotic pests as well as other Australian native psyllids.

https://openalex.org/W3201649950,"Cone photoreceptors are responsible for the visual acuity and color vision of the human eye. Red/green cone opsin missense mutations N94K, W177R, P307L, R330Q, and G338E have been identified in subjects with congenital blue cone monochromacy or color-vision deficiency. Studies on disease mechanisms due to these cone opsin mutations have been previously carried out exclusively in vitro, and the reported impairments were not always consistent. Here we expressed these mutants via AAV specifically in vivo in M-opsin knockout mouse cones to investigate their subcellular localization, the pathogenic effects on cone structure, function, and cone viability. We show that these mutations alter the M-opsin structure, function, and localization. N94K and W177R mutants appeared to be misfolded since they localized exclusively in cone inner segments and endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, P307L, R330Q, and G338E mutants were detected predominately in cone outer segments. Expression of R330Q and G338E, but not P307L opsins, also partially restored expression and correct localization of cone PDE6α’ and cone transducin γ and resulted in partial rescue of M-cone-mediated light responses. Expression of W177R and P307L mutants significantly reduced cone viability, whereas N94K, R330Q, and G338E were only modestly toxic. We propose that although the underlying biochemical and cellular defects caused by these mutants are distinct, they all seem to exhibit a dominant phenotype, resembling autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa associated with the majority of rhodopsin missense mutations. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with these cone opsin mutants is fundamental to developing targeted therapies for cone dystrophy/dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3198953182,"Background The use of antibiotics for treating infection in childhood and their association with increased risk of asthma remain controversial. Infants diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) belong to a unique population who are administered antibiotics for a long time and are susceptible to recurrent UTI. It is interesting to study the risk of asthma in these infants with or without VUR. Methods Taiwanese children born between 2000 and 2007 were enrolled in population-based birth cohort study. Participants diagnosed with VUR and UTI within first year were classified into four groups (VUR, UTI, VUR and UTI, and control). We calculated follow-up person-years for each participant from the index date until the asthma diagnosis, their withdrawal from the insurance system (because of death or loss to follow-up), or till the end of 2008. The risk of asthma was compared between the 4 cohorts by using Cox proportional hazards model analysis, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results Children diagnosed with VUR (n = 350), UTI (n = 15542), VUR and UTI (n = 1696), and randomly selected controls (n = 17588) were enrolled. The overall rate of incidence of asthma was found to be 1.64-fold, 1.45-fold, and 1.17-fold higher in the UTI, VUR/UTI, and VUR cohorts than in the controls (5.60, 5.07, and 4.10 vs. 3.17 per 100 person-years), respectively. After adjusting the potential factors, the overall risk of asthma remained the highest in UTI (aHR: 1.74, 95% CI : 1.65 to 1.80) followed by VUR/UTI (aHR: 1.56, 95% CI : 1.40 to 1.75) and VUR cohorts (aHR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.62). The incidence of asthma was higher in boys than in girls. Conclusion The nationwide retrospective cohort study demonstrated that short-term therapeutic dose of antibiotics for UTI in infants with or without VUR has a positive correlation with the prevalence of childhood asthma. Significant risk of childhood asthma was not observed when VUR cohort was exposed to long-term low-dose of prophylactic antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3199424282,"The centromere is a chromosomal locus that is essential for the accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Transcription of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) at the centromere plays a crucial role in centromere function. The zinc-finger transcriptional regulator ZFAT binds to a specific 8-bp DNA sequence at the centromere, named the ZFAT box, to control ncRNA transcription. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which ZFAT localizes to the centromere remain elusive. Here we show that the centromeric protein CENP-B is required for the centromeric localization of ZFAT to regulate ncRNA transcription. The ectopic expression of CENP-B induces the accumulation of both endogenous and ectopically expressed ZFAT protein at the centromere in human cells, suggesting that the centromeric localization of ZFAT requires the presence of CENP-B. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis reveals that ZFAT interacts with the acidic domain of CENP-B, and depletion of endogenous CENP-B reduces the centromeric levels of ZFAT protein, further supporting that CENP-B is required for the centromeric localization of ZFAT. In addition, knockdown of CENP-B significantly decreased the expression levels of ncRNA at the centromere where ZFAT regulates the transcription, suggesting that CENP-B is involved in the ZFAT-regulated centromeric ncRNA transcription. Thus, we concluded that CENP-B contributes to the establishment of the centromeric localization of ZFAT to regulate ncRNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W3200061644,"Objective To investigate the characteristics and medical expenditures of patients with Asthma- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) compared to asthma and COPD patients. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study involving patients diagnosed with ACO, asthma or COPD as of January 2016. Medical records for patients attending King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH), in northern Jordan, during the years 2015–2016 were used to identify eligible patients and all relevant clinical characteristics. Both respiratory and all-cause charges were extracted from KAUH billing system during the year 2016. Total, inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy charges were described and compared across the three disease categories. Charges were measured in Jordanian Dinar (JOD, equal to 1.41 US Dollar). Results Of a total of 761, 87 ACO patients, 494 asthmatic patients and 180 COPD patients were identified and included in this study. The average total respiratory-related charges were significantly higher in patients with ACO compared to patients with asthma (601.4 versus 354.3 JODs; P value &lt; 0.001). Average all-cause charges were higher in case of ACO and COPD compared to patients with asthma (1830.8 and 1705.4 versus 1251.7 JODs; P value &lt; 0.001). ACO was a significant predictor of higher respiratory and all-cause related charges. Respiratory charges were also higher in older patients and those with higher disease severity. Conclusions ACO is a risk factor for incurring higher health expenditures in Jordan. Higher respiratory expenditures are also associated with older ages and higher disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3201326693,"Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) are a class of specialized metabolites with a diverse range of chemical structures and physiological effects. Codeine and morphine are two closely related BIAs with particularly useful analgesic properties. The aldo-keto reductase (AKR) codeinone reductase (COR) catalyzes the final and penultimate steps in the biosynthesis of codeine and morphine, respectively, in opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). However, the structural determinants that mediate substrate recognition and catalysis are not well defined. Here, we describe the crystal structure of apo-COR determined to a resolution of 2.4 Å by molecular replacement using chalcone reductase as a search model. Structural comparisons of COR to closely related plant AKRs and more distantly related homologues reveal a novel conformation in the β1α1 loop adjacent to the BIA-binding pocket. The proximity of this loop to several highly conserved active-site residues and the expected location of the nicotinamide ring of the NADP(H) cofactor suggest a model for BIA recognition that implies roles for several key residues. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that substitutions at Met-28 and His-120 of COR lead to changes in AKR activity for the major and minor substrates codeinone and neopinone, respectively. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the molecular basis of substrate recognition in COR and the closely related 1,2-dehydroreticuline reductase responsible for the second half of a stereochemical inversion that initiates the morphine biosynthesis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3201537679,"Degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) by zero-valent iron (ZVI) activating three common peroxides (peroxymonosulfate (PMS), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and peroxydisulfate (PS)) was investigated. The effects of ZVI dosage, peroxides concentration, initial pH, and Cl - concentration were examined. The 2,4,6-TCP degradation efficiencies by Fe 0 /peroxides (PMS, H 2 O 2 , PS) were compared. Results showed that the order for degradation efficiency was H 2 O 2 ≥PMS&gt;PS. The degradation efficiency of 2,4,6-TCP in ZVI/peroxides systems were optimal at c(Ox) = 1 mmol•L -1 ; c(Fe 0 ) = 0.1 g/L; initial pH = 3.2. Additionally, pH had a vital effect on 2,4,6-TCP degradation. At pH&lt;3.2, ferrous play a vital role in all reaction, and accelerate the reaction rate rapidly. The existence of NaCl showed different results in the four systems. Chloride had little effect on 2,4,6-TCP degradation when chloride concentration at 5 mM, whereas the presence of 300 mM chloride significantly accelerated the degradation of 2,4,6-TCP from 72.7% to 95.2% in ZVI-PMS system. Notably, the other three systems showed opposite results. In contrast, the AOX (Absorbable Organic Halogen) values were highest in ZVI-PMS-Cl - system, due to the formation of lots of refractory chlorinated phenols as identified by GC-MS. These findings are good for choosing the most suitable technology for chlorophenol wastewater treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3169909032,"CRISPR base editors are powerful tools for large-scale mutagenesis studies. This kind of approach can elucidate the mechanism of action of compounds, a key process in drug discovery. Here, we explore the utility of base editors in an early drug discovery context focusing on G-protein coupled receptors. A pooled mutagenesis screening framework was set up based on a modified version of the CRISPR-X base editor system. We determine optimized experimental conditions for mutagenesis where sgRNAs are delivered by cell transfection or viral infection over extended time periods (&gt;14 days), resulting in high mutagenesis produced in a short region located at -4/+8 nucleotides with respect to the sgRNA match. The β2 Adrenergic Receptor (B2AR) was targeted in this way employing a 6xCRE-mCherry reporter system to monitor its response to isoproterenol. The results of our screening indicate that residue 184 of B2AR is crucial for its activation. Based on our experience, we outline the crucial points to consider when designing and performing CRISPR-based pooled mutagenesis screening, including the typical technical hurdles encountered when studying compound pharmacology."
https://openalex.org/W3200287310,"Seagrass meadows, and other submerged vegetated habitats, support a wide range of essential ecological services, but the true extents of these services are in many ways still not quantified. One important tool needed to assess and model many of these services is accurate estimations of the systems´ primary productivity. Such productivity estimations require an understanding of the underwater light field, especially regarding the amount of light that actually reaches the plants’ photosynthetic tissue. In this study, we tested a simple practical approach to estimate leaf light exposure, relative to incoming light at the canopy, by attaching light sensitive film at different positions on leaves of Zostera marina , eelgrass, in four seagrass meadows composed of different shoot density and at two different depths. We found that the light reaching the leaves decreased linearly down through the canopy. While the upper parts of the leaves received approximately the same level of light (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) as recorded with a PAR meter at the canopy top, the average light that the seagrass leaves were exposed to varied between 40 and 60% of the light on top of the canopy, with an overall average of 48%. We recommend that actual light interception is measured when assessing or modelling light depending processes in submerged vegetation, but if this is not achievable a rough estimation for vegetation similar to Z . marina would be to use a correction factor of 0.5 to compensate for the reduced light due to leaf orientation and internal shading."
https://openalex.org/W3200564731,"A kiosk-based survey at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in 2016-2018 allowed us to assess public knowledge of antibiotics and public attitudes toward microbes in museum goers. Over 22,000 visitors from 172 countries and territories answered several carefully designed questions about microbes and antibiotics. These visitors also entered age, gender, and country demographic data that allowed for stratification along these demographic and geographic divisions. Because museum goers are likely to be better informed about these and other science-based topics, the results described here can set a potential upper bound for public knowledge on these topics. Surprisingly, the results of our analysis of museum goers' answers about microbes and antibiotics indicate a substantial lack of familiarity with both topics. For example, overall only about 50% of respondents can correctly identify penicillin as an antibiotic and less than 50% of museum visitors view microbes as beneficial. The results described here suggest that we are perhaps off target with our educational efforts in this area and that a major shift in approach toward more basic microbial topics is warranted in our educational efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3200932959,"One important feature of episodic memory is that it contains fine-grained and vividly recollected details. How to improve and maintain detailed information over time has been one of the central issues in memory research. Previous studies have inconsistent findings on whether detailed memory is forgotten more rapidly than gist memory. In this study, we investigated to what extent different encoding tasks modulated forgetting of gist and detailed information. In three experiments, participants were presented pictures of common objects and were asked to name them (Experiment 1), describe the details about them (Experiment 2) or imagine scenes associated with them (Experiment 3). After intervals of 10 minutes, one day, one week and one month, gist and detailed memories of the pictures were tested and assessed using a remember/know/guess judgement. The results showed that after the naming task, gist and detailed memories were forgotten at a similar rate, but after the description and the imagination tasks, detailed memory was forgotten at a slower rate than gist memory. The forgetting rate of gist memory was the slowest after the naming task, while that of detailed memory was the slowest after the description task. In addition, when three experiments were compared, the naming task enhanced the contributions of recollection and familiarity for gist memory, while the description task enhanced the contribution of familiarity for detailed memory. These results reveal the importance of the encoding task in the forgetting of gist and detailed information, and suggest a possible way to maintain perceptual details of objects at longer intervals."
https://openalex.org/W3200529070,"This study aimed to theoretically identify the vascular nature of the deep capillary plexus (DCP) by examining patients presenting with both paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) and prominent middle limiting membrane (p-MLM) sign and p-MLM sign alone in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). A retrospective review of the medical records of patients with retinal vein or artery occlusion from two tertiary medical centers was performed. Consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of all categories of retinal artery occlusion (RAO) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) (branch or central and ischemic or non-ischemic) who had undergone SD-OCT imaging from January 2015 to May 2020 were recruited and their p-MLM signs and PAMM lesions were assessed. We included 118 patients who presented with p-MLM sign with or without PAMM lesions. Amon them, 40 were female and 78 were male, with a mean age of 61.1 years. Of the 109 patients with both p-MLM sign and PAMM lesions, 23 had branch RAO, two had branch RVO, 67 had central RAO, 13 had central RVO, and four had a combination of central RAO and central RVO. All nine patients with the p-MLM sign alone had central RVO accompanied by cystoid macular edema. In all the enrolled patients, the hyperreflective lines of the p-MLM sign were continuous, regardless of the type of PAMM lesions. In conclusion, when PAMM and p-MLM sign are examined together, further proof regarding the possible complete venous nature of the vasculature of the retinal DCP might be speculated."
