https://openalex.org/W2020092689,"We have identified and molecularly cloned 46 kb of human DNA from chromosome 22 using a probe specific for the Philadelphia (Ph') translocation breakpoint domain of one chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) patient. The DNAs of 19 CML patients were examined for rearrangements on chromosome 22 with probes isolated from this cloned region. In 17 patients, chromosomal breakpoints were found within a limited region of up to 5.8 kb, for which we propose the term ""breakpoint cluster region"" (bcr). The two patients having no rearrangements within bcr lacked the Ph' chromosome. The highly specific presence of a chromosomal breakpoint within bcr in Ph'-positive CML patients strongly suggests the involvement of bcr in this type of leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2061734833,"The worldwide importance of human hepatitis B virus infection and the toll it takes in chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma, make it imperative that a vaccine be developed for worldwide application. Human hepatitis B vaccines are presently prepared using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) that is purified from the plasma of human carriers of hepatitis B virus infection. The preparation of hepatitis B vaccine from a human source is restricted by the available supply of infected human plasma and by the need to apply stringent processes that purify the antigen and render it free of infectious hepatitis B virus and other possible living agents that might be present in the plasma. Joint efforts between our laboratories and those of Drs W. Rutter and B. Hall led to the preparation of vectors carrying the DNA sequence for HBsAg and antigen expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we describe the development of hepatitis B vaccine of yeast cell origin. HBsAg of subtype adw was produced in recombinant yeast cell culture, and the purified antigen in alum formulation stimulated production of antibody in mice, grivet monkeys and chimpanzees. Vaccinated chimpanzees were totally protected when challenged intravenously with either homologous or heterologous subtype adr and ayw virus of human serum source. This is the first example of a vaccine produced from recombinant cells which is effective against a human viral infection."

https://openalex.org/W2006836034,"The upstream activation site (UAS) of the yeast CYC1 gene is shown to contain two homologous subsites, UAS1 and UAS2. Each site, when placed upstream of the transcriptional initiation region of the yeast LEU2 gene, activates LEU2 transcription which is regulated by catabolite repression. UAS1 is responsible for most of the transcription under glucose repressed conditions, while UAS1 and UAS2 contribute equally to lactate derepressed transcription. A single point mutation in UAS2 increases its activity in glucose 10- to 20-fold. Several experiments indicate that UAS1 and UAS2 are regulated distinctly at the molecular level. First, UAS1 but not UAS2 is fully depressed in glucose by increasing the levels of intracellular heme. Second, trans-acting regulatory mutations, hap1-1 and hap2-1, selectively abolish the activity of UAS1 or UAS2. HAP1 appears to encode a protein that mediates catabolite repression of UAS1 by responding to intracellular heme levels."
https://openalex.org/W2104996004,"The FBJ murine osteosarcoma virus (FBJ-MuSV) induces osteosarcomas in mice and transforms fibroblasts in vitro. It contains an oncogene termed v-fos derived from a normal cellular gene by recombination with an associated helper virus. The product of the v-fos gene is a 55,000 dalton protein, p55v-fos. This protein was found in the nuclei of cells containing amplified levels of the v-fos gene, and also in the nuclei of virus-transformed cells. The c-fos protein was localized in the nuclei of normal mouse amnion cells and in the nuclei of cells transformed by a recombinant plasmid that expresses the c-fos gene product. However, p55c-fos undergoes more extensive post-translational modification in the nucleus than p55v-fos. Immunofluorescence data indicate that the level of p55c-fos in normal mouse amnion cells is similar to that found in fibroblasts transformed by the v-fos or c-fos proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2119859213,"Using an in vivo assay, we have obtained competition between several types of enhancer-containing molecules for cellular components that interact with them. The presence of these cellular factors is required for enhancer function. Specific competition involved enhancers and not other SV40 promoter elements such as the 21 bp repeats or TATA box. Point mutants within the 72 bp repeat of SV40 that were defective in enhancer function were unable to compete for the cellular components in the competition assay. Although heterologous enhancers compete in several types of cells for the same set of cellular molecules, the host cell preference of different enhancers is reflected in the competition assay. This result might explain the previously described host cell preference of enhancer elements."
https://openalex.org/W2036690337,"P-element-mediated DNA transformation was used to generate transformants carrying segments of DNA from the white locus of D. melanogaster. The vast majority of transduced copies of an 11.7 or a 14.3 kb segment of DNA from white successfully rescued the white- eye-color phenotype when inserted in many different chromosomal locations. However, two transformants with abnormal eye pigmentation--apparently a consequence of the genomic positions of the transduced white gene--were also recovered. In all seven cases tested, autosomal insertions of white, which is dosage-compensated in its normal location on the X chromosome, retained the property of dosage compensation. In contrast to the relative insensitivity of eye-color pigmentation and dosage compensation to genomic position, the transduced white DNA segments differed widely in their interactions with the zeste mutation, ranging from greater than normal repression by zeste to insensitivity to the presence of zeste."
https://openalex.org/W2031418345,"In contrast to other human tumors in which the c-myc gene and its transcript are greatly amplified, careful analysis of t(8;14) Burkitt cell lines indicates that the c-myc transcript is marginally, and in some cases not at all, increased by comparison to control lymphoblastoid cell lines. Instead, there is a more subtle alteration in the expression of the translocated c-myc gene characterized by a shift in promoter utilization and an apparent insensitivity to the regulation that inactivates the normal c-myc allele within these same cells. In some Burkitt cell lines, such deregulation might be because of the loss of a putative control region through removal of the large dual promoter/leader segment of the c-myc gene. In other cell lines, however, this deregulation may be explained by somatic mutations that occur within the putative control region even though it is located many hundreds of bases from the translocation breakpoint."

https://openalex.org/W2134078619,"We have examined the activation of the SV40 late promoter by inserting the late promoter and the viral origin of replication into chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) transient expression vectors. Very little late promoter activity was detected in CV-1 cells, compared with high activity in COS cells, in which replication occurs due to endogenous T antigen. Nonreplicative counterparts of these plasmids, containing a mutated origin of replication, produced significantly more late promoter activity in COS cells than any of the plasmids in CV-1 cells. When plasmids were cotransfected into CV-1 cells with a plasmid that supplies T antigen, the nonreplicative plasmid displayed 30% of the activity of the replicative plasmid. Using mutant T antigens unable to replicate viral DNA, late promoter activation occurred only with mutant T antigens that retain DNA binding activity. These results demonstrate that T antigen can substantially stimulate late promoter activity directly and independent of viral DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2023271648,"Mannose-6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptors for lysosomal enzymes were localized by immunocytochemistry in several secretory and adsorptive cell types using monospecific antireceptor antibodies. By immunofluorescence, the receptors were found in the Golgi region of polarized cells. When localized by immunoperoxidase at the electron microscope level, they were detected in Golgi cisternae, coated vesicles, endosomes, and lysosomes of all cell types examined (hepatocytes, exocrine pancreatic and epididymal epithelia). Within the Golgi complex, immunoreactive receptors were restricted in their distribution to one or two cisternae on the cis side of the Golgi stacks. They were not detected in trans Golgi or GERL cisternae. Based on their high concentration of Man-6-P receptors, we propose that the cis Golgi cisternae represent the site where the secretory and lysosomal pathways diverge: lysosomal enzymes bearing the Man-6-P recognition marker bind to Man-6-P receptors in this location and are delivered to endosomes and lysosomes via coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2005504241,"The nucleotide sequence of the region of Gardner-Rasheed feline sarcoma virus (GR-FeSV) encoding its primary translation product, p70gag-fgr, has been determined. From the nucleotide sequence, the amino acid sequence of this transforming protein was deduced. Computer analysis indicates that a portion of P70gag-fgr has extensive amino acid sequence homology with actin, a eukaryotic cytoskeletal protein. A second region of P70gag-fgr is closely related to the tyrosine-specific kinase gene family. Thus, the v-fgr oncogene appears to have arisen as a result of recombinational events involving two distinct cellular genes, one coding for a structural protein and the other for a protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1998340779,"NRK fibroblasts exposed to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) show increased binding of radiolabeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) relative to untreated cells. The binding of another growth factor, rat insulin-like growth factor-II, is unaffected. The increase in EGF binding induced by TGF-beta is not due to inhibition of EGF processing nor to an alteration in the affinity of plasma membrane EGF receptors. However, treatment of the cells with TGF-beta does cause a rapid increase in the number of plasma membrane receptors for EGF. TGF-beta has little effect on the rate of overall protein synthesis, but the increase it induces in EGF binding can be completely inhibited by cycloheximide and tunicamycin. Thus a selective synthetic mechanism underlies TGF-beta action. Cells incubated with TGF-beta also show altered down regulation of their EGF receptors in response to the ligand; concentrations of EGF that can induce strong biological responses no longer decrease the plasma membrane receptor level below the basal state. These results agree well with the known specificity and synergism of the interaction between TGF-beta and EGF. Moreover, they describe a mechanism of growth control in which bioactive peptides act coordinately through a regulatory effect on the number of cell-surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1973393468,"Bovine Papilloma Virus (BPV-1) establishes itself as a multicopy nuclear plasmid in somatic mammalian cells in culture. We report here that two discontinuous regions within the viral genome can independently support extrachromosomal replication of the Tn5 neomycin' gene in cells that provide viral factors in trans. The viral plasmid maintenance sequences (PMS) act in cis and will integrate along with the marker gene in cell lines that do not provide BPV-1 gene products. PMS-1 is localized within a 521 bp region upstream of the BPV-1 early transcription unit; PMS-2 has been localized to a 140 bp region within the putative reading frame for the E1 protein of the viral genome. Recombinant plasmids carrying either of the PMS elements are unrearranged and stably maintained at a constant copy number supernumerary to the resident BPV-1 genomes even in the absence of selective pressure. Specific deletion mutants within the viral genome show that BPV-1 gene products required for morphological transformation are dispensable for plasmid maintenance. In mouse cells cotransformed with such deletion derivatives and an unlinked marker gene (neomycinr or Tk), the marker genes integrate into the host genome while the BPV molecules are nonselectively carried as nuclear plasmids. This result implies that the BPV-1 genome must have signals that specifically preclude integration in the presence of trans-acting factors."
https://openalex.org/W2013864385,"The mouse c-abl gene, part of the sequence of which was captured in Moloney murine leukemia virus to generate the transforming gene (v-abl) of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, has been isolated and characterized. The c-abl locus spans 40 kb in the mouse genome with the v-abl homologies distributed in no less than ten clusters along 25 kb of the cloned DNA. Partial sequence of the v-abl homologous regions indicates that v-abl derived from c-abl mainly by splicing of multiple exons of the c-abl gene. The c-abl sequences can be subdivided into two regions: a tyrosine kinase coding sequence distributed among eight small clusters on the 5' end of the gene and a C-terminal portion consisting of one small and one large cluster, which are needed neither for the tyrosine kinase activity nor for the transforming ability of v-abl. Apparent exon/intron boundaries in the homologous kinase-coding regions of c-abl and c-src are at different locations."

This topology has been confirmed by partial proteolysis of the polypeptide in intact and disrupted thylakoid membranes and in inside-out and right-side-out vesicles of chloroplast membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1580552987,"Adenylate cyclase in NG108-15 (neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid) cells is responsive to both stimulatory and inhibitory ligands. Bordetella pertussis toxin (PT) catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of a 41,000-Da peptide believed to be a subunit of the putative guanyl nucleotide-binding protein (Gi) involved in cyclase inhibition and abolishes inhibitory effects of opiate agonists. In studying the effects of PT on opiate receptors, we found that [3H]enkephalinamide binding was reduced by approximately 90% in membranes prepared from cells incubated with PT compared to control membranes. Agonist affinity, assessed by enkephalinamide competition for [3H]diprenorphine-binding sites, was markedly reduced in cells incubated with PT. Furthermore, inhibition by guanylylimidodiphosphate of ligand binding to opiate receptors was reduced following treatment with PT. The number of opiate receptors assessed by [3H]diprenorphine binding was unaltered by PT. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that PT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation impairs the interaction of Gi with the inhibitory receptor-ligand complex, effectively uncoupling the inhibitory receptor from Gi and the cyclase catalytic unit."
https://openalex.org/W2084965795,"T4 endonuclease VII, which cleaves Holliday-like junctions in DNA, specifically cleaves short inverted repeats in supercoiled plasmids. These sequences are subject to site-specific cleavage by single-strand-specific nucleases, and cruciform formation has been suggested as an explanation for this observation. This proposal is greatly strengthened by the present data, since a formal analogy between cruciform structures and Holliday junctions exists. Resolution of a variety of unrelated cruciform sequences demonstrates that the cleavage process results in a linear molecule with hairpin ends and single ligatable nicks at positions corresponding to the stem-base of the cruciform. In two examples mapped in detail, the cleavages are exclusively introduced at two or three nucleotides from the end of the symmetric sequence at the 5' side on each strand. These studies demonstrate the potential of endonuclease VII as a probe of cruciform structure and the utility of short cruciform structures as Holliday junction models."
https://openalex.org/W2065252285,"Elimination of specific DNA sequences occurs during macronuclear development in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. Recombinant DNA clones containing a segment of micronuclear (germinal) DNA involved in elimination and the corresponding segment of macronuclear (somatic) DNA produced after elimination were isolated. Detailed comparisons of the cloned DNAs, as well as the genomic DNAs, by hybridization indicated that DNA elimination is accompanied by specific DNA rearrangements. In this 9.5 kb region three defined DNA segments are deleted and the remaining sequences are linked together as one contiguous piece in the macronucleus. Specific DNA rearrangement of this kind occurs widely in the genome. Analysis of 20 randomly selected DNA clones suggests that there are more than 5000 such rearrangement sites in the genome. Thus specific breakage and rejoining of DNA occurs extensively during development, and might play an essential role in nuclear differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2027348071,"The transcription, processing, and accumulation of μ and δ mRNA was studied in several cell lines representing different stages of B-lymphocyte maturation. Our results indicate that the relative content of μ and δ mRNA is the major determinant of the IgM versus IgM + IgD phenotype and that the production of δ mRNA is regulated at distinctly different levels of gene expression in early and later developmental stages. In B cell lymphomas typical of early stages, transcription extends over the entire 25 kb of the μ-δ locus and the relative content of μ and δ mRNA is determined at the level of mRNA processing. In contrast, in cells typical of mature IgM secretors, transcription is terminated abruptly between the μ and δ genes, precluding the production of δ mRNA. We propose a model that accounts for qualitative and quantitative changes in μ-δ expression in the developing B lymphocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2034178928,"Neutrophils contribute to chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema associated with cigarette smoking. Nicotine was found to be chemotactic for human neutrophils but not monocytes, with a peak activity at approximately 31 micromolar. In lower concentrations (comparable to those in smokers' plasma), nicotine enhanced the response of neutrophils to two chemotactic peptides. In contrast to most other chemoattractants for neutrophils, however, nicotine did not affect degranulation or superoxide production. Nicotine thus may promote inflammation and consequent lung injury in smokers."

https://openalex.org/W2050142983,"Essential nucleotide contacts between the SV40 large T (tumor) antigen and binding sites I and II on the SV40 genome have been inferred from in vitro methylation- and ethylation-interference experiments. Each site contains two clusters of guanine residues that reduce the specific binding of T antigen when modified. Methylation at any one of nine guanines within site I or any one of five guanines within site II severely interferes with the interaction of T antigen with each respective site. Methylation at any one of a second group of five guanines within site II results in an appreciably weaker effect on the binding of T antigen. A similar inhibitory effect on binding is observed upon ethylation of adjacent phosphate residues. Although there are significant differences in the nucleotide sequence of the two binding sites, the pattern of protein contacts is strikingly similar between sites I and II. Three-dimensional projection reveals that the guanine contacts within each binding site are localized so that the specific binding interactions are accessible from only one face of the DNA helix."
https://openalex.org/W2078242855,"Immunotoxins containing pokeweed antiviral protein and monoclonal antibodies against human T cells or human transferrin receptor efficiently killed acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Chloroquine specifically enhanced the rate of protein synthesis inhibition by immunotoxin. Depending on its concentration, chloroquine (10 to 100 micromolar) reduced by up to 65-fold the amount of immunotoxin required to inhibit protein synthesis in the target cells 50 percent."
https://openalex.org/W1985190834,"Endotoxin-free thymosin fraction 5 elevated corticotropin, beta-endorphin, and cortisol in a dose- and time-dependent fashion when administered intravenously to prepubertal cynomolgus monkeys. Two synthetic component peptides of thymosin fraction 5 had no acute effects on pituitary function, suggesting that some other peptides in thymosin fraction 5 were responsible for its corticotropin-releasing activity. In agreement with these observations, total thymectomy of juvenile macaques was associated with decreases in plasma cortisol, corticotropin, and beta-endorphin. These findings indicate that the prepubertal primate thymus contains corticotropin-releasing activity that may contribute to a physiological immunoregulatory circuit between the developing immunological and pituitary-adrenal systems."
https://openalex.org/W1557077241,"Abstract When rat adipocyte membranes had been labeled with [3H]GTP in the presence of a beta-adrenergic agonist, the subsequent [3H]GDP release was stimulated by beta-agonists or agonists (e.g. glucagon and secretin) of other receptors involved in activation of adenylate cyclase, but was not stimulated by agonists (e.g. prostaglandin E1 and adenosine) of receptors involved in cyclase inhibition. On the contrary, agonists of inhibitory receptors were effective in stimulating GDP release from hamster adipocyte membranes that had been labeled via inhibitory alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, but an activatory receptor agonist such as isoproterenol was not. Thus, the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ni) involved in adenylate cyclase inhibition is an entity distinct from the regulatory protein (Ns) involved in cyclase activation, and multiple activatory or inhibitory receptors are coupled to a respective common pool of Ns or Ni. Preactivated cholera toxin added together with NAD enhanced GDP release from rat adipocyte membranes prelabeled with isoproterenol but was without effect on the release from hamster adipocyte membranes that had been labeled with an alpha-agonist. In sharp contrast, the active subunit of islet-activating protein, pertussis toxin, failed to alter GDP release from the former membrane but completely abolished inhibitory agonist-induced stimulation of GDP release from the latter membrane preparation in the presence of NAD. Thus, the site of action of cholera toxin is Ns, while that of islet-activating protein is Ni. The function of Ni to communicate between inhibitory receptors and adenylate cyclase was lost when it was ADP-ribosylated by islet-activating protein."
https://openalex.org/W2021439072,"T-cell growth factor (TCGF) or interleukin-2 (IL-2), an immunoregulatory lymphokine, is produced by lectin- or antigen-activated mature T lymphocytes and in a constitutive manner by certain T-cell lymphoma cell lines. By means of a molecular clone of human TCGF and DNA extracted from a panel of somatic cell hybrids (rodent cells × normal human lymphocytes), the TCGF structural gene was identified on human chromosome 4. In situ hybridization of the TCGF clone to human chromosomes resulted in significant labeling of the midportion of the long arm of chromosome 4, indicating that the TCGF gene was located at band q26-28. Genomic DNA from a panel of hybrids prepared with HUT-102 B2 cells was examined with the same molecular clone. In this clone of cells, which produces human T-cell leukemia virus, the TCGF gene was also located on chromosome 4 and was apparently not rearranged. The homologous TCGF locus in the domestic cat was assigned to chromosome B1 by using a somatic cell hybrid panel that segregates cat chromosomes. Linkage studies as well as high-resolution G-trypsin banding indicate that this feline chromosome is partially homologous to human chromosome 4."

https://openalex.org/W1542009026,"The toxic A chain of ricin was linked to human transferrin via a disulfide bond and the resulting conjugate was shown to bind to cell membrane transferrin receptors. Surface-localized transferrin A chain (TF-A chain) gained access to the cytoplasm and inactivated ribosomes as witnessed by a rapid curtailment of cellular protein synthesis (t1/2 = 6 h) and subsequent cytolysis. The intact conjugate produced potent cytotoxic effects on human leukemia CEM cells, (ID50 = 3 X 10(-11) M), while a 10,000-fold higher concentration of uncoupled transferrin plus A chain was required for comparable action. TF-A chain cytotoxicity was totally blocked by native transferrin or by antibodies directed against ricin A chain and human transferrin. CEM cells gradually acclimated to grow in the presence of TF-A chain displayed 1000-fold resistance to the conjugate while their sensitivity to whole ricin was undiminished. The level of transferrin receptor expressed by these cells was 1/20 the amount present on the parent line and their capacity to bind human transferrin was below the limits of detectability using fluorescent probes. This receptor-deficient cell line was unresponsive to the low levels of transferrin which stimulated proliferation of control CEM cells, but their growth was supported by greatly elevated concentrations of ligand. Receptor variant CEM cells, together with the specific TF-A chain toxin, will be useful for studying the mechanisms for transmembrane delivery of both Fe3+ and ricin A chain into cells and will aid in understanding the growth regulatory functions of the receptor-ligand interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1493181842,"The long term action of cyclic AMP analogs to stimulate the synthesis of cytochromes P-450scc, P-45011 beta, and adrenodoxin has been studied utilizing confluent monolayers of adult bovine adrenocortical cells maintained for periods of time up to 72 h in the absence or presence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM), 8-bromo cyclic AMP (1 mM), or ACTH (adrenocorticotropin) (10(-6) M). The synthesis of these proteins was examined by radiolabeling cellular proteins with [35S]methionine or else by translating RNA extracted from such cells in a cell-free system in the presence of [35S]methionine. In each case, the protein under study was immunoprecipitated utilizing specific antisera, or IgG fractions prepared from such antisera. ACTH and both analogs of cyclic AMP caused an increase in the synthesis of cytochrome P-450scc which reached a maximum 36-48 h after addition, and then declined. On the other hand, butyric acid (1 mM) had no effect on the synthesis of cytochrome P-450scc. Cytochrome P-450scc activity measured as pregnenolone production by both intact cells or isolated mitochondria from such cells was increased following incubation of cells with either dibutyryl cyclic AMP or ACTH. The binding of rabbit anti-cytochrome P-450scc IgG was also increased in cells incubated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP or ACTH as estimated by immunofluorescence microscopy using fluorescein-tagged anti-rabbit IgG. Furthermore, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and ACTH both increased the synthesis of adrenodoxin and of cytochrome P-45011 beta, as well as the activity of 11 beta-hydroxylase. In addition, ACTH stimulated the secretion of cyclic AMP in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Thus, it is concluded that analogs of cyclic AMP can mimic the long term actions of ACTH to induce the synthesis of steroidogenic enzymes, and that this action of ACTH is likely mediated by cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1982861233,"Epidermal growth factor (10−9 M), prostaglandin (8.5 × 10−7 M), F2α, and insulin (10−9 M), each of which only leads to a partial phosphorylation of 40S ribosomal protein S6, generate the same first eight phosphopeptides induced by 10% serum, suggesting all three activate a common regulatory pathway for the phosphorylation of S6. Added together, they induce almost maximal S6 phosphorylation and a phosphopeptide pattern nearly equivalent to that of serum. Unlike the agents above, 8-Br-cAMP or PGE1 has no significant effect on protein synthesis, but does induce a small increase in S6 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the three peptides that become phosphorylated are identical with insulin-induced phosphopeptides 10b, 11, and 9, based on either comigration, limited acid hydrolysis, or V8 protease digestion. Incubation of 40S subunits with cAMP-dependent protein kinase induces the phosphorylation of these same three phosphopeptides. The in vitro and in vivo studies described here raise the possibility that cAMP could, in part, be responsible for mediating the phosphorylation of S6 during the mitogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W1992368997,"Steroid hormones, when complexed to their receptors, recognize and bind specific DNA sequences and subsequently induce increased levels of transcription. The mechanisms of steroid hormone action were analyzed by constructing chimeric DNA molecules from portions of mouse mammary tumor virus envelope and long terminal repeat (LTR) regions ligated to the thymidine kinase (tk) gene of herpes simplex virus. This construction allowed the tk gene to be expressed in a hormone-responsive fashion upon transfection into Ltk- cells. Comparison of transcription data with in vitro binding data showed that hormone-responsive transcription can be directly correlated to the presence of steroid hormone receptor binding sites on the DNA. There are at least two such receptor binding sites in the LTR region, one between -202 and -137 and another between -137 and -50 base pairs from the RNA cap site, as well as a site near the 5' end of the envelope region. These results strengthen the hypothesis that steroid-receptor complexes regulate genes primarily by binding to DNA sites near the promoter region and thereby modulate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2094382548,"Certain derivatives of copy-control mutants of plasmid Clo DF13 are not stably inherited in E. coli. These plasmids, predominantly present as multimeric DNA molecules, lack a specific region, designated parB. Here we present the nucleotide sequence of this parB region spanning 328 bp between 46% and 49% on the plasmid genome. parB is a noncoding region with extensive internal symmetry. A recA-independent, site-specific resolution process occurs between two intramolecular parB sites present in direct orientation relative to each other. A gene located in the direct vicinity of parB, gene L, is not essential for parB functioning. However, our genetic data indicate that transcription from the gene L-containing operon into parB is required. We conclude that the efficient maintenance of Clo DF13 cop derivatives containing parB is provided by resolution of mutimeric molecules. Because Clo DF13 wt and cop derivatives have a different response to the deletion of parB we postulate that two different recombination systems, a parB-dependent and a parB-independent system, operate in the efficient maintenance of Clo DF13 plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W1480183156,"We recently reported that the dissociation of internalized receptor-125I-asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) complexes by isolated hepatocytes is a biphasic process; most complexes dissociate rapidly but 25-50% dissociate slowly (Oka, J. A., and Weigel, P. H. J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10253-10262). Cells were allowed to endocytose a pulse of surface-bound 125I-ASOR, and were washed and then incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence or absence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Without EGTA, very little intact ASOR appeared in the medium. With EGTA present, a large amount of intracellular ligand appeared undegraded in the medium in a time-dependent manner. N-Acetylgalactosamine, but not ASOR, in the medium also caused release of intact 125I-ASOR. Within 15 min, more than 50% and by completion at least 80% of the internalized ligand in the slow dissociation compartment was released into the medium. If cells containing internalized ligand were incubated at 37 degrees C for increasing times before the addition of EGTA, then progressively less ligand accumulated in the medium. Experiments at 18 degrees C, a temperature at which neither degradation nor slow dissociation occurred, demonstrated that in the presence of EGTA the intracellular free 125I-ASOR pool did not change. The amount of receptor-bound ligand in the slowly dissociating pool decreased and the amount of intact ligand in the medium increased by essentially equal amounts. The temperature dependence for the return of internal 125I-ASOR to the cell surface was similar to that for endocytosis, with a cut-off temperature of about 12 degrees C. We conclude that a normal part of the endocytic process involves the return of receptor-ligand complexes to the cell surface from an internal slowly dissociating pool. This might reflect either an obligatory step or a reversible statistically random step in the endocytic/recycling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1496235326,"Affinity cross-linking techniques have been used to identify a growth hormone (GH) receptor in rat adipocyte membranes. Adipocytes were incubated with 125I-human GH (125I-hGH) for 2 h at 37 degrees C and washed once to remove unbound hGH. The bivalent cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate (0.4 mM) was added to the cells for 15 min at 15 degrees C. A plasma membrane-enriched fraction was prepared and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The autoradiographs of gels containing samples treated with reductant revealed an intense band of apparent Mr = 134,000 which was not present when cells were incubated with an excess of hGH or bovine GH. In contrast, the intensity of the Mr = 134,000 band was not altered by the presence of a similar excess of insulin or rat prolactin during the binding step. Multiple lower molecular weight species displaying the same hormone sensitivity as the Mr = 134,000 species were also present but at much lower levels. In the absence of reductant, the affinity-labeled GH receptor migrated as a broad band of Mr = 116,000-125,000 and as a less intense band of Mr = 230,000. At low reductant concentrations, both of the hGH-labeled complexes exhibited larger apparent molecular weights (Mr (X 10(3) ) = 135 and 270), indicating the presence of intrachain disulfide bonds. At higher reductant concentrations, the Mr = 270,000 species disappeared as the Mr = 134,000 band increased in intensity. Use of a cleavable cross-linking reagent, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate), in conjunction with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, revealed that the Mr = 134,000 complex is composed of iodinated monomeric hGH (Mr = 22,000) bound to a membrane protein. The molecular weight of the reduced hGH receptor protein itself was calculated to be 112,000, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry of hormone to receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1525537668,"The active NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of wild type yeast cells fractionated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography was inactivated in vitro by the addition of either the cAMP-dependent or cAMP-independent protein kinases obtained from wild type cells. cAMP-dependent inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase activity was not observed in the crude extract of bcy1 mutant cells which were deficient in the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase of CYR3 mutant cells, which has a high K alpha value for cAMP in the phosphorylation reaction, required a high cAMP concentration for the inactivation of NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase. An increased inactivation of partially purified active NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (Mr = 450,000) was observed to correlate with increased phosphorylation of a protein subunit (Mr = 100,000) of glutamate dehydrogenase. The phosphorylated protein was labeled by an NADH analog, 5'-p-fluorosulfonyl[14C]benzoyladenosine. Activation and dephosphorylation of inactive NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase fractions were observed in vitro by treatment with bovine alkaline phosphatase or crude yeast cell extracts. These results suggested that the conversion of the active form of NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase to an inactive form is regulated by phosphorylation through cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1509663711,"The beta 1-adrenergic receptor of rat fat cells was effectively solubilized with digitonin and purified by affinity chromatography and steric exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purification strategy described permits an approximately 24,000-fold purification of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor of fat cells with an overall recovery of approximately 70%. Purified receptor preparations demonstrate a specific activity for (-) [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding of 12 nmol/mg of protein. The purified receptor was shown to migrate in steric exclusion HPLC as a Mr = 67,000 protein. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of radioiodinated purified receptor revealed a single, major peptide of Mr = 67,000. The binding of (-) [3H]dihydroalprenolol to purified receptor preparations displayed stereoselectivity and affinities for antagonists similar in nature to the membrane-bound and digitonin-solubilized beta 1-adrenergic receptor. In addition to the Mr = 67,000 component, a Mr = 140,000 form of the receptor was identified in HPLC runs of freshly prepared, affinity chromatographed receptor preparations that had not been frozen. This larger form of the receptor yielded binding activity of Mr = 67,000 on sequential HPLC runs and was shown to contain the Mr = 67,000 peptide. The beta 1-receptor from this mammalian source, composed of a single Mr = 67,000 peptide, is clearly quite distinct from the purified avian beta 1-, amphibian beta 2-, and mammalian beta 2-adrenergic receptors described by others."
https://openalex.org/W1591042311,"Kinetic and binding studies with substrates, products, and a spin-labeled product analogue of glutathione (sl-glutathione) have been used to characterize the kinetic mechanism and properties of the catalytic site of the homodimer YaYa of glutathione S-transferase. Product inhibition studies and inhibition by sl-glutathione indicate the random addition of substrates. The kinetically determined dissociation constant for the product S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione is approximately 7 microM. A newly described spin-labeled product analogue, S-[[(2,2,5,5,-tetramethyl-1-oxy-3-pyrrolidinyl)-carbamoyl]methyl] glutathione (sl-glutathione), acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to both substrates (glutathione and 1-Cl-2,4-dinitrobenzene) with a kinetically determined dissociation constant of approximately 40 microM. Analysis of the glutathione S-transferase X sl-glutathione complex by EPR gives a rigid limit spectrum indicative of highly immobilized spin label. Kinetic and EPR results support the proposal that sl-glutathione binds as a bisubstrate or product analogue by occupying both the glutathione and hydrophobic substrate sites. Binding studies of sl-glutathione by EPR give a dissociation constant of 28 microM and a single binding site per homodimer. Displacement of sl-glutathione by substrates and product have been used to directly determine enzyme-ligand dissociation constants. Dissociation constants of 2.1 mM, 17 microM, and 25 microM were obtained for glutathione, 1-Cl-2,4-dinitrobenzene and S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione when enzyme was added to a mixture of sl-glutathione and the competing ligand. The dissociation constants for glutathione and 1-Cl-2,4-dinitrobenzene but not for S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) glutathione were dependent on the order of addition, consistent with the existence of several kinetically stable conformations for the enzyme. The sl-glutathione described here may provide a useful analogue for similar studies with other glutathione S-transferases or other enzymes which bind glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1514336087,"Cytochrome oxidase from T. thermophilus is isolated as a noncovalent complex of cytochromes c1 and aa3 in which the four redox components of aa3 appear to be associated with a single approximately 55,000-D subunit while the heme C is associated with a approximately 33,000-D peptide (Yoshida, T., Lorence, R. M., Choc, M. G., Tarr, G. E., Findling, K. L., and Fee, J. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 112-123). We have examined the steady state transfer of electrons from ascorbate to oxygen by cytochrome c1aa3 as mediated by horse heart, Candida krusei, and T. thermophilus (c552) cytochromes c as well as tetramethylphenylenediamine (TMPD). These mediators exhibit simple Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior yielding Vmax and KM values characteristic of the experimental conditions. Three classes of kinetic behavior were observed and are qualitatively discussed in terms of a reaction scheme. The data show that tetramethylphenyldiamine and cytochromes c react with the enzyme at independent sites; it is suggested that cytochrome c1 may efficiently transfer electrons to cytochrome aa3. When incorporated into phospholipid vesicles, the highly purified cytochrome c1aa3 was found to translocate one proton into the exterior medium for each molecule of cytochrome c552 oxidized. The combined results suggest that this bacterial enzyme functions in a manner generally identical with the more complex eucaryotic enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2022626791,"Simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS), a disease clinically and pathologically similar to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in humans, was transmitted from diseased rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) to normal monkeys by inoculation with heparinized whole blood or plasma that had been passed through filters of 0.45 micrometer pore size. This suggests that the causative agent is small and most probably a virus. No viruses, however, were isolated by standard cell culture techniques from the blood or filtered plasma which caused SAIDS. Both cellular and humoral immunity were markedly depressed in animals with advanced SAIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2052352788,"We have analyzed the nucleotide sequences and secondary structure required for the transcriptional inhibitory activity of the plus-strand leader RNA of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in a reconstituted HeLa cell transcription system using the adenovirus-2 late promoter (LP) and virus-associated (VA) genes as templates. The New Jersey serotype (VSVNJ) leader and the leader of the Indiana serotype (VSVInd) both contain cleavage sites for the double-strand-specific ribonuclease V1, and these sites are consistent with the presence of a predicted AU-rich stem-loop structure. Studies in which the secondary structure was perturbed with the intercalating agent proflavin suggested that a stem-loop structure enhances the efficiency of transcription inhibition in the VSVNJ leader. Experiments using leader RNA fragments, a VSVInd cDNA derived from the 3' end of the genome, and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide homologous to regions of the VSV leader indicated that the AU(AT)-rich center region of the VSV leader molecule is sufficient to inhibit DNA-dependent transcription directed by both polymerase II and III, but flanking nucleotide sequences are important for more efficient inhibition of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2094420152,"The hypotrichous ciliated protozoan Oxytricha fallax has both macronuclei and micronuclei. The short DNA molecules of the macronucleus are terminated with repeats of the octanucleotide C4A4. Micronuclear DNA carries a family of long sequence blocks, which share a consensus restriction map and have homology with the C4A4 repeats. Each block contains a 3 to 6 kb subregion, which is refractory to all restriction enzymes tested and includes the C4A4 homology. We conclude that these refractory sequences are at DNA termini because Sau 3A fragments containing them fail to ligate to form circles, and they are rapidly degraded by Bal 31 nuclease. These terminal C4A4-homologous sequence blocks likely represent micronuclear chromosomal telomeres. Possible relationships between these sequences, internal micronuclear C4A4 repeats, and macronuclear DNA termini are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488889774,"Cell-free extracts of the Vero cell line (monkey kidney origin) contain an activity which converts 7-[5-[( (1S,4S,5R)-4, 5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-yl)-amino]methyl]-7-deazaguanosine (queuosine) 5'-phosphate into queuine (the base of queuosine). We designate this the queuine salvage activity because it apparently is responsible for the ability of intact Vero cells to salvage queuosine base from tRNA degraded during the normal turnover process. Queuosine-3'-P, mannosylqueuosine-5'-P, or queuosine nucleoside does not support the queuine salvage reaction. Extracts of the L-M cell line (mouse embryo origin) lack the queuine salvage activity, a finding consistent with the inability of intact L-M cells to retrieve queuine subsequent to tRNA turnover (Gunduz, U., and Katze, J. R. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 109, 159-167)."
https://openalex.org/W1508808395,"Characterization of the steady state kinetics of reduction of horse ferricytochrome c by purified beef ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, employing 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decylbenzoquinol as reductant, has shown that: 1) the dependence of the reaction on quinol and on ferricytochrome c concentration is consistent with a ping-pong mechanism; 2) the pH optimum of the reaction is near 8.0; 3) the effect of ionic strength on the apparent Km and the TNmax of the reaction for the native cytochrome c is small, and at higher cytochrome c concentrations substrate inhibition is observed; 4) the effect of ionic strength on the kinetic parameters for the reaction of 4-carboxy-2,6-dinitrophenyllysine 27 horse cytochrome c is much larger than for the native protein; and 5) competitive product inhibition is also observed with a Ki consistent with the binding affinity of ferrocytochrome c for Complex III, as determined by gel filtration. In addition, direct binding measurements demonstrated that ferricytochrome c binds more tightly than the reduced protein to Complex III under low ionic strength conditions and that under these conditions more than one molecule of cytochrome c is bound per molecule of Complex III. Exchange of Complex III into a nonionic detergent decreases this excess nonspecific binding. Measurement of the rates of dissociation of the oxidized and reduced 1:1 complexes of cytochrome c and Complex III by stopped flow was consistent with the disparity of binding affinities, the dissociation rate constant for ferrocytochrome c being about 5-fold higher than that for the ferric protein. A model which accounts for the properties of this system is described, assuming that cytochrome c bound to noncatalytic sites on the respiratory complex decreases the catalytic site binding constant for the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1977843113,"Replication of the chromosome of E. coli at 42°C in an integratively suppressed dnaA mutant (dnaA46 Sin Hfr) occurs predominantly from the origin of replication of the integrated plasmid (oriV). We have carried out a detailed marker frequency analysis on such Hfrs. This analysis indicates that replication at 42°C occurs not only from oriV, but also from an origin, oriX, located in the terminal region of the chromosome close to, but distinct from, the prophage rac (oriJ). In an oxal mutant of one of these Hfrs, we have shown that replication proceeds at 42°C from all three origins: oriV, oriX, and oriC. Loss of the integrated plasmid results in a temperature- and rich-medium-sensitive strain that replicates the chromosome from oriC and oriX. Replication from oriX proceeds slowly and bidirectionally. We suggest that oriX may be involved in the coupling between replication and cell division."

It is particularly suited for the detection of vitreal liquefaction and intraocular hemorrhage because of the dependence of the signal on the physical environment of water. Conversely, the vitreous body provides a new model for studying changes in proton relaxation times of protein solutions in biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1986913980,"The transposase of bacteriophage Mu (gene A protein) mediates the coupled replication and integration processes that constitute transposition during the lytic cycle. Our previous results showed that the activity of the A protein is unstable, as its continued synthesis is required to maintain Mu DNA replication throughout the lytic cycle. We present here the results of experiments in which the A protein is used stoichiometrically and must be synthesized de novo for each round of Mu DNA replication. Induction of a Mu lysogen in the absence of DNA replication allows accumulation of potential for a single round of Mu DNA replication. Once achieved, this potential is stable even in the absence of further protein synthesis. Release of inhibition of DNA replication leads to a single semi-conservative replicative transposition event, followed by later rounds only if additional synthesis of the A protein is allowed."
