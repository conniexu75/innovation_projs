https://openalex.org/W2073724146,"I have proposed that the precessional torques acting on the earth can sustain a turbulent hydromagnetic flow in the molten core. A gross balance of the Coriolis force, the Lorentz force, and the precessional force in the core fluid provided estimates of the fluid velocity and the interior magnetic field characteristic of such flow. Then these numbers and a balance of the processes responsible for the decay and regeneration of the magnetic field provided an estimate of the magnetic field external to the core. This external field is in keeping with the observations, but its value is dependent upon the speculative value for the electrical conductivity of core material. The proposal that turbulent flow due to precession can occur in the core was tested in a study of nonmagnetic laboratory flows induced by the steady precession of fluid-filled rotating spheroids. It was found that these flows exhibit both small wavelike instabilities and violent finite-amplitude instability to turbulent motion above critical values of the precession rate. The observed critical parameters indicate that a laminar flow in the core, due to the earth's precession, would have weak hydrodynamic instabilities at most, but that finite-amplitude hydromagnetic instability could lead to fully turbulent flow."

On the other hand, intact or castrated males given estrogen neonatally show little estrous behavior in adulthood. Thus, feminization is induced by lack of neonatal androgen rather than by the presence of estrogen. Estrogen administered to newborn rats suppresses feminization."

https://openalex.org/W2410514530,"Monkeys reared from birth away from other monkeys and handled by humans during the first month of life preferred humans to monkeys when tested at the age of 2 to 3 years. Animals having both early human handling and physical contact with other monkeys, or physical contact with other monkeys and no human handling, preferred monkeys. Subjects reared in complete isolation from humans and monkeys spent less time with either choice stimulus, but also preferred monkeys to humans."

Water depresses the vitrification temperature of glycerol (184°K) monotonously, and this property has been used for derivation of an estimate of its Tg. The result, 127° ± 4°K (-146° ± 4°C), is the temperature below which water presumably exists as a brittle, glassy substance."

It may therefore be possible to determine the mass of Vesta from observations of Arete. From 72 observations a value of (1.20 +/- 0.08) x 10(-10) solar mass was derived, the indicated uncertainty being a probable error."

A column of amyl alcohol supported in aim by a high voltage was investigated experimentally; the diameter of the column varied aS the voltage raised to the 3.5 power.

https://openalex.org/W1514657851,"Although the basic processes associated with the propagation of environmental noise, such as reflection, scattering, and spreading are well known, numerous theoretical problems remain. The propagation processes that are significant in different situations have yet to be identified, and criteria for evaluating their relative importance in each situation must be developed. In evaluating the noise of aircraft, for example, attenuation caused by the spreading of energy may exceed 60 dB, with atmospheric attenuation accounting for another 10 dB or so. In the propagation of highway noise, on the other hand, spreading may account for only 10 dB of attenuation, air absorption for 1 dB, and absorption by ground may account for 10 to 15 dB of attenuation. If those problems are approached systematically, we should be able to predict accurately the effects of noise sources and barriers and thus control the distribution of noise levels in cities and suburban areas."

The filaments are about 100 to 150 angstroms in diameter and often striated. By swelling they block the pores of old sieve plates after slime has been lost from the elements. In Cucurbita, slime may be loosely bound to the filaments; in many species it is hydrolyzed, swept out by the assimilate stream, and eventually metabolized."
