https://openalex.org/W2022770520,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). A large number of AIDS patients show evidence of neurologic involvement, known as AIDS-related subacute encephalopathy, which has been correlated with the presence of HIV in the brain. In this study, two genetically distinct but related viruses were isolated from one patient from two different sources in the central nervous system: brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. Both viruses were found to replicate in peripheral blood lymphocytes, but only virus from brain tissue will efficiently infect macrophage/monocytes. The viruses also differ in their ability to infect a brain glioma explant culture. This infection of the brain-derived cells in vitro is generally nonproductive, and appears to be some form of persistent or latent infection. These results indicate that genetic variation of HIV in vivo may result in altered cell tropisms and possibly implicate strains of HIV with glial cell tropism in the pathogenesis of some neurologic disorders of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2090084965,"HIV LTR-directed expression is markedly stimulated in trans by coexpression of a region of the HIV genome encoding a portion of the tat reading frame. Transient expression assay analysis reveals that trans-activation of LTR-directed expression results primarily from an increase in mRNA accumulation. Deletion analysis of the LTR indicates that upstream promoter and enhancer elements are dispensible for trans-activation, while sequences 3′ of the RNA start site displaying strict orientation and position dependence are required. These sequences, contained in the 5′ leader of all HIV transcripts, form a stable stem-loop structure with twofold symmetry in the cognate mRNA. Analysis of mutations in the trans-acting region demonstrates that the trans-activator is the protein product of the tat gene, identified biochemically in HIV-infected and transfected cells as an Mr 15,000 polypeptide. We discuss possible mechanisms whereby the interaction of p15tat with the dyad element promotes the accumulation of LTR-directed mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1976009198,"A method of deleting specific cell lineages has been developed that entails microinjection into fertilized eggs of a chimeric gene in which a cell-specific enhancer/promoter is used to drive the expression of a toxic gene product. We show that microinjection of a construct in which the elastase I promoter/enhancer is fused to a gene for diphtheria toxin A polypeptide results in birth of mice lacking a normal pancreas because of expression of the toxin in pancreatic acinar cells. A small pancreatic rudiment, containing islet and duct-like cells, was observed in some of the transgenic mice. This method provides a new approach for studying cell-lineage relationships and for analyzing cellular interactions during development."
https://openalex.org/W1531497588,"A heat shock element is located in the 5'-flanking region of the rat heme oxygenase gene (HO gene). The incubation of rat glioma cells at 42 degrees C or with hemin at 37 degrees C increased the levels of heme oxygenase mRNA within 1 h and produced a maximum at 3 h (at least a 20-fold increase). In both treatments, the heme oxygenase activity started to increase after a lag period of about 1 h and reached a maximum value at 5 h. There was an apparent additive effect of both treatments on the heme oxygenase induction. Studies with actinomycin D and cycloheximide suggested that both heat shock and hemin acted at the transcriptional level to induce heme oxygenase. Therefore, we analyzed the transient expression of chimeric fusion genes harboring the promoter of the rat HO gene ligated to the Escherichia coli gene gpt in rat glioma cells and in K1735 mouse amelanotic melanoma cells. The 5'-flanking region of the rat HO gene bearing the heat shock element conferred the heat inducibility of gpt RNA production in both cell lines; however, hemin treatment did not induce gpt RNA. These results indicate that rat heme oxygenase is a heat shock protein and that hemin induces heme oxygenase through a different mechanism from heat shock."
https://openalex.org/W1971478527,"We have generated all possible single point mutations of the invariant 5' GT of the large beta-globin intron and determined their effect on splicing in vitro. None of the mutants prevented cleavage in the 5' splice region, but many reduced or abolished exon joining. The mutations GT----TT and GT----CT resulted in a shift of the 5' cleavage site on nucleotide upstream; in the case of the mutation GT----TT, this shift was reverted by a second site mutation within the 5' splice region. Our results suggest that the 5' cleavage site is determined not by the conserved GU sequence but by the 5' splice region as a whole, most probably via base-pairing to the 5' end of the U1 snRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2092205160,"Deletion analysis was carried out on the human 7SK RNA gene to map regions essential for in vitro transcription by RNA polymerase III. The sequence promoting transcription is located between 37 and 3 bp upstream of the 7SK RNA coding region. RNA polymerase III transcription of adjacent plasmid sequences can be directed by this promoter in the complete absence of the 7SK RNA coding region, indicating that no internal promoter sequences are required. Transcription is terminated by a stretch of T residues, typical of RNA polymerase III transcription. The promoter contains a TATA box at position -25, mutations within which dramatically reduce the efficiency of transcription. Upstream sequences from position -37 to -243 increase the promoter's efficiency. The promoter recognized by RNA polymerase III is structurally and functionally similar to the promoter of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1486311063,"Protein G, the immunoglobin G-binding surface protein of group C and G streptococci, also binds serum albumin. The albumin-binding site on protein G is distinct from the immunoglobulin G-binding site. By mild acid hydrolysis of the papain-liberated protein G fragment (35 kDa), a 28-kDa fragment was produced which retained full immunoglobulin G-binding activity (determined by Scatchard plotting) but had lost all albumin-binding capacity. A protein G (65 kDa), isolated after cloning and expression of the protein G gene in Escherichia coli, had comparable affinity to immunoglobulin G (5-10 X 10(10)M-1), but much higher affinity to albumin than the 35- and 28-kDa protein G fragments (31, 2.6, and 0 X 10(9)M-1, respectively). The amino-terminal amino acid sequences of the 65-, 35-, and 28-kDa fragments allowed us to exactly locate the three fragments in an overall sequence map of protein G, based on the partial gene sequences published by Guss et al. (Guss, B., Eliasson, M., Olsson, A., Uhlen, M., Frej, A.-K., Jornvall, H., Flock, J.-I., and Lindberg, M. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 1567-1575) and Fahnestock et al. (Fahnestock, S. R., Alexander, P., Nagle, J., and Filpula, D. (1986) J. Bacteriol. 167, 870-880). In this map could then be deduced the location of three homologous albumin-binding regions and three homologous immunoglobulin G-binding regions."
https://openalex.org/W2023202999,"The human complement protein Factor B is encoded by a single gene in the major histocompatibility complex and is closely linked to the gene encoding the second component of complement C2. DNA sequencing, S1 mapping, and primer extension experiments have established that the transcription initiation site of the Factor B gene lies only 421 bp from the poly(A) site of the C2 gene. Deletion analysis of the Factor B 5′-flanking region has suggested the presence of cis-acting DNA elements that are essential for the cell-specific expression of the Factor B gene. These sequences extend into the 3′ region of the C2 gene. We have defined an enhancer element in the 5′-flanking region in addition to the promoter element. Our results suggest that the cell-specific expression of the Factor B gene is dependent upon the combinatorial effect of both the promoter and the enhancer elements."
https://openalex.org/W1524686766,"We recently identified residues 185-224 of the light chain of human high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) as the binding site for plasma prekallikrein (Tait, J.F., and Fujikawa, K. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15396-15401). In the present study, we have further defined the primary structure requirements for binding of HMWK to factor XI and prekallikrein. In a competitive fluorescence polarization binding assay, a 31-residue synthetic peptide (residues 194-224 of the HMWK light chain) bound to prekallikrein with a Kd of 20 +/- 6 nM, indistinguishable from the previously determined value of 18 +/- 5 nM for the light chain. We also prepared three shorter synthetic peptides corresponding to different portions of the 31-residue peptide (residues 205-224, 212-224, and 194-211), but these peptides bound to prekallikrein more than 100-fold more weakly. Factor XI also bound to the same region of the HMWK light chain, but at least 58 residues (185-242) were required for optimal binding (Kd = 69 +/- 4 nM for the light chain; Kd = 130 +/- 50 nM for residues 185-242). The four synthetic peptides inhibited kaolin-activated clotting of blood plasma with potencies paralleling their affinities for prekallikrein and factor XI. Peptide 194-224 can also be used for rapid affinity purification of prekallikrein and factor XI from plasma."

https://openalex.org/W2056261557,"Heparin is an acceleratory cofactor for antithrombin, a circulating inhibitor of blood coagulation enzymes. The presence of heparin on blood vessel walls is believed to contribute to the nonthrombogenic properties of those surfaces. In apparent opposition to this function, heparin was found to greatly accelerate the in vitro inactivation of antithrombin by neutrophil elastase. Inactivation rates in solution were potentiated several hundredfold by specific heparin fractions with anticoagulant activity. Although the data suggest that a heparin-antithrombin complex is essential for the inactivation by elastase to occur, the enzyme itself interacts tightly with heparin. These results suggest a mechanism which, if operating in vivo, could lead to a localized neutralization of the anticoagulant function of heparin at the endothelial surface."
https://openalex.org/W1598668033,"Studies with 75Se have shown the existence of a rat plasma selenoprotein in addition to glutathione peroxidase. Because the function of the protein is not known, it has been referred to as selenoprotein P. A partially purified preparation was used to produce a monoclonal antibody to selenoprotein P. The antibody did not bind glutathione peroxidase as evidenced by its failure to remove glutathione peroxidase activity from rat plasma by immunoprecipitation. An immunoaffinity column was prepared with the monoclonal antibody, and selenoprotein P was purified 1270-fold from rat plasma in a two-step procedure. The purified selenoprotein P migrated in a single band with an Mr of 57,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Autoradiography demonstrated that this band contained 75Se when the protein was purified from rats which had received 75SeO2-(3). A competitive radioimmunoassay for selenoprotein P was developed. The selenoprotein P concentration in plasma of selenium-replete rats was determined with this assay to be 51 +/- 3.7 micrograms/ml. It was less than 5 micrograms/ml in plasma from selenium-deficient rats. Injection of 50 micrograms of selenium into selenium-deficient rats caused an increase in selenoprotein P from less than 10% of control to 52% of control in 6 h. Plasma glutathione peroxidase activity increased only from 2.2 to 3.1% of control. These experiments demonstrate that rat plasma contains a selenoprotein distinct from glutathione peroxidase. The concentration of this selenoprotein is depressed in selenium deficiency, as is glutathione peroxidase activity, but selenoprotein P increases more rapidly when selenium is supplied than does glutathione peroxidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1761340827,"We have isolated cDNA clones of the mRNA for prostaglandin omega-hydroxylase (cytochrome P-450p-2) (Yamamoto, S., Kusunose, E., Ogita, K., Kaku, M., Ichihara, K., and Kusunose, M. (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 96, 593-603) in rabbit lung by using synthetic oligonucleotides as probes. The cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 1,470 nucleotides, the first 9 amino acids of which correspond to the residues 17-25 of cytochrome P-450p-2 determined from protein analysis. The predicted primary structure contains amino acid sequences of 23 tryptic fragments of cytochrome P-450p-2 and the deduced amino acid composition is in agreement with that determined from the purified protein. The complete polypeptide, including residues 1-16, contains 506 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 58,515. Cytochrome P-450p-2 shared 74% amino acid similarity with rat hepatic lauric acid omega-hydroxylase (cytochrome P-450LA omega) (Hardwick, J.P., Song, B.-J., Huberman, E., and Gonzalez, F. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 801-810), whereas it showed less than 25% similarity to other forms of cytochrome P-450, indicating that the two cytochrome P-450s constitute a unique cytochrome P-450 gene family. DNA blot analysis of the total genomic DNA of rabbits suggest the presence of several genes or gene-like DNA sequences which cross-hybridized with the cloned cDNA. RNA blot analysis showed that progesterone treatment increased the amount of mRNA hybridizable to the cDNA by about 100-fold in the lung of rabbits as compared with the basal level without the treatment. This high level of the mRNA was also observed in the lung of pregnant rabbits."

https://openalex.org/W1969105500,"A cDNA for purpurin, a secreted 20,000 dalton neural retina cell adhesion and survival protein, has been sequenced and expressed in mammalian cells. Purpurin mRNA is found in both embryonic and adult retina, but not the brain, heart, or liver. The protein is highly concentrated in the neural retina between the pigmented epithelium and the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells; it is synthesized by photoreceptor cells. The predicted purpurin sequence contains 196 residues, has approximately 50% sequence homology with serum retinol binding protein, and is a member of the alpha-2 mu-globulin superfamily. Purpurin binds retinol and may play a major role in retinol transport across the interphotoreceptor cell matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1577644682,"Peptide YY is a 36-residue gastrointestinal hormone which inhibits both pancreatic and gastric secretion. We have isolated a cDNA encoding the peptide YY precursor by screening a rat intestinal lambda gt11 cDNA library with an antiserum directed against the porcine hormone. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encodes a 98-residue protein (molecular weight, 11, 121) which has an amino acid sequence identical to that of porcine peptide YY. Rat peptide YY is preceded immediately by a signal sequence and followed by a cleavage-amidation sequence Gly-Lys-Arg plus 31 additional amino acids. Thus the peptide YY precursor is similar in structure to that of two related peptides, pancreatic polypeptide and neuropeptide Y. RNA blot hybridizations reveal that the peptide YY gene is much more actively expressed in pancreas than previously realized. In situ hybridizations localized peptide YY cells exclusively to the exocrine pancreas. The abundance of peptide YY in one of its target organs, the pancreas, suggests a paracrine mechanism for peptide YY in regulating pancreatic enzyme secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1497837607,"The spermatid transition proteins comprise a set of basic chromosomal proteins that appear during the period when spermatids are undergoing nuclear elongation and condensation, about midway between the end of meiosis and the release of spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubule. The transition proteins replace the histones but are themselves subsequently replaced by protamines, and they are not found in sperm nuclei. We have used a cDNA clone for the smallest transition protein (TP1, 54 amino acids) to show that its message first appears postmeiotically in late round spermatids. Thus production of TP1 is an example of haploid gene expression. The message remains translationally inactive for some 3-4 days before translation occurs in early elongating spermatids. While translationally repressed, TP1 message is nonpolysomal and has a discrete size of about 590 bases, including a 140 residue poly(A) tail. In contrast, polysome-associated message is of heterogeneous size due to variability of poly(A) lengths."
https://openalex.org/W127937226,"A variant of a low density lipoprotein receptor-negative Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant was isolated using a nutritional selection called MeLoCo. The variant, designated met-18b-2, internalized and metabolized mevalonate at rates 10-40 times greater than the progenitor cells from which they were derived. The extent of incorporation of radioactivity from [3H]mevalonate into steroidal and nonsteroidal mevalonate derivatives, including modified proteins, was much greater in met-18b-2 cells than in their progenitors. Much of the internalized [3H]mevalonate was converted to nonpolar lipids. Unlike wild type CHO cells or the receptor-negative progenitors, met-18b-2 cells were killed by high concentrations of mevalonate (greater than 6 mM) in the culture medium. Regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity and cholesterol esterification was dramatically more sensitive to mevalonate in met-18b-2 cells than in progenitor cells. In cell extracts, both the rates of conversion of [3H]mevalonate to cholesterol and mevalonate kinase activities were similar for met-18b-2 and progenitor cells. In contrast to progenitor cells, met-18b-2 cells internalized [3H]mevalonate with high capacity (Km approximately 0.3 mM) kinetics. The increased uptake of [3H]mevalonate was temperature dependent and highly specific. These results suggest that met-18b-2 cells express a mevalonate transport activity that is not normally expressed by CHO cells. This activity may be due to a specific mevalonate transporter that is differentially expressed in specialized tissues. Because intracellular mevalonate in met-18b-2 cells can be labeled to high specific activity, these cells should prove very useful in further characterizing the structures of mevalonate derivatives and their metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1578160661,"We have examined the control of actin isoform synthesis by pituitary-derived fibroblast growth factor and serum in BC3H1 cells, a tumor-derived nonfusing muscle cell line. Under differentiating conditions in BC3H1 cells, the synthesis of beta- and gamma-actin ceases, and the rate of alpha-actin synthesis is increased concomitant with cessation of cell growth. Addition of fetal calf serum to differentiated cells reverses the process, whereas the addition of pituitary-derived fibroblast growth factor inhibits synthesis of alpha-actin but fails to induce the synthesis of beta- and gamma-actin. Analysis of RNA from differentiated BC3H1 cells after the addition of fetal calf serum indicated that the serum-induced increase in beta- and gamma-actin synthesis reflected an increase in their mRNA levels. In contrast, the repression of alpha-actin synthesis by fetal calf serum or fibroblast growth factor appears to reflect the translation efficiency of alpha-actin mRNA. Fibroblast growth factor is a competence factor for BC3H1 cells which allows them to progress from G0 4 h into the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In order to understand the nature of the intracellular signals responsible for the effect of fibroblast growth factor, we treated cells with vanadate, a known inhibitor of tyrosine-specific protein phosphatases. Vanadate fully mimics the action of fibroblast growth on actin synthesis and creatine phosphokinase synthesis and causes BC3H1 cells to exit the G0 portion of the cell cycle, as demonstrated by the induction of the c-fos proto-oncogene following addition of serum, vanadate, or bovine pituitary-derived fibroblast growth factor to these cells. We conclude that repression of alpha-actin synthesis and induction of the synthesis of beta- and gamma-actin are under independent control and that the induction of beta- and gamma-nonmuscle actin synthesis following serum addition is independent from movement into the cell cycle, and dependent on as yet unidentified serum components. The rate of synthesis of alpha-actin can be controlled by a defined mitogenic polypeptide fibroblast growth factor, which in short term experiments primarily affects the rate of translation of alpha-actin mRNA. The repression by fibroblast growth factor is most likely due to activation of a tyrosine specific protein kinase(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1546629949,"Alternative complement pathway C3 convertase formation involves the cleavage of C3b-associated factor B into fragments Ba and Bb. Whereas Bb, in complex with C3b, has proteolytic specificity toward native C3, the function of the Ba moiety in the formation and/or decay of alternative complement pathway C3 convertase is uncertain. Therefore, we have examined the effect of purified Ba fragment on both fluid-phase and surface-bound enzymatic activity and showed that whereas Ba could inhibit the rate of C3 convertase formation, the rate of intrinsic decay remained unaffected. A specific, metal ion-independent interaction between Ba and C3b was subsequently demonstrated by use of the cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). When cell-associated 125I-B was activated by D, the dissociation of Bb fragment displayed simple first-order kinetics with a half-time of 2.4 min, this value being in reasonable agreement with the hemolytically determined decay rate of 1.8 min. In contrast, most of the Ba fragment undergoes rapid dissociation, but there is also evidence to suggest the establishment of a new equilibrium due to the ability of Ba to rebind to C3b. Cumulatively, these data are consistent with a model in which the attachment of intact B to C3b is mediated by two points of contact, one being in the Ba domain and the other in the Bb domain. Due to avidity effects, each of these interactions could be of relatively low intrinsic affinity, and the characteristic unidirectionality of alternative complement pathway C3 convertase decay may simply result from the low intrinsic association of univalent Bb for the C3b subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1539194431,"The biochemical characteristics of specific receptor molecules for diphtheria toxin on the surface of two toxin-sensitive cell lines (Vero and BS-C-1) were examined. Diphtheria toxin was found to bind to a number of different proteins in Nonidet P-40 solubilized extracts of 125I-labeled cells. In contrast, permitting diphtheria toxin to bind first to labeled intact cells, which were subsequently solubilized and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-diphtheria toxin, resulted in a far more restricted profile of diphtheria toxin-binding proteins that possessed Mrs in the range of 10,000-20,000. Direct chemical cross-linking of radioiodinated diphtheria toxin to cell surface proteins resulted in the appearance of several predominant bands possessing Mrs of approximately 80,000. The Mr approximately 80,000 complexes were shown to be composed of radiolabeled diphtheria toxin (Mr 60,000) and unlabeled Mr approximately 20,000 cellular proteins. These complexes were judged to be a result of specific binding in that their appearance could be preferentially inhibited by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled diphtheria toxin. The formation of the Mr approximately 80,000 complexes was sensitive to prior trypsin treatment of the cells and to known inhibitors of diphtheria toxin binding. Furthermore, prior incubation of the cells with diphtheria toxin at 37 degrees C (down regulation) markedly and specifically reduced the subsequent formation of the Mr approximately 80,000 cross-linked complexes, and these down-regulated cells were less sensitive to diphtheria toxin in cytotoxicity assays. Further incubation of down-regulated cells at 37 degrees C restored their ability to form Mr approximately 80,000 complexes; this regeneration requires protein synthesis and restores the cells' sensitivity to diphtheria toxin-mediated cytotoxicity. These results strongly suggest that a Mr 10,000-20,000 cell surface protein is, or constitutes a portion of, the functional diphtheria toxin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1560808158,"The rebinding of CO, O2, NO, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl isocyanide to isolated alpha and beta chains and intact hemoglobin at pH 7, 20 degrees C was examined both during and after a 30-ns dye laser pulse. The resultant absorbance changes were analyzed in terms of a linear three-step reaction scheme: Hb + × in equilibrium with C in equilibrium with B in equilibrium with A or HbX, where A is the final bound state, and C and B are geminate states. Rate constants were assigned for each of the transitions in this mechanism using fitting procedures described previously for analyzing ligand rebinding to sperm whale myoglobin at room temperature (Gibson, Q. H., Olson, J. S., McKinnie, R. E., and Rohlfs, R. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10228-10239). Five major conclusions were obtained. First, initial geminate recombination phases for the NO and O2 complexes of hemoglobin and its isolated subunits exhibit half-times equal to approximately 12 and approximately 440 ps, respectively. These values are in excellent agreement with more direct, picosecond measurements of the geminate recombination of HbNO (Cornelius, P. A., Hochstrasser, R. M., and Steele, A. W. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 163, 119-128) and HbO2 (Friedman, J. M., Scott, T. W., Fisanick, G. J., Simon, S. R., Findsen, E. W., Ondrias, M. R., and MacDonald, V. W. (1985) Science 229, 187-229) following extremely short laser pulses. Second, the correspondence between our nanosecond measurements and the published picosecond data suggests strongly that the intrinsic photochemical yield of all ferrous, hexacoordinate heme complexes approaches one. Third, the major differences between the isolated alpha and beta chains involve the rate of ligand migration to the solvent, kC—X and the extent of recombination from the second geminate state, C, as measured by the ratio kC—B/kC—X. Fourth, for both isolated chains and intact hemoglobin, the rate and equilibrium constants for the formation of the initial O2 geminate state starting from ligand in the solvent (i.e. kX—B and KX—B) are 5-10 times greater than the corresponding parameters for the formation of the first CO geminate state. Fifth, the rate-limiting step for NO, O2, and isonitrile binding to hemoglobin and its isolated subunits is ligand migration up to the initial geminate state (i.e. kX—B). In the case of CO binding, both migration to state B and iron-ligand bond formation (kB—A) affect the overall, bimolecular association rate constant."
https://openalex.org/W1486162627,"Hyaluronic acid-binding region and trypsin-link protein were prepared from bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycan complex after trypsin digestion. Binary complexes were reformed between trypsin-link protein and hyaluronic acid-binding region or hyaluronate. Upon trypsin treatment of these complexes, two fragments deriving from trypsin-link protein were characterized. One of them, of 20 kDa, corresponds in fact to a 140-amino acid long fragment and bears the glycosylated site of trypsin-link protein; it appears to be involved in proteoglycan/link protein interaction. The other, of 22 kDa, corresponds to the 200 C-terminal amino acids of trypsin-link protein; it appears to be involved in the binding of link protein with hyaluronic acid. A structural model of bovine trypsin-like protein depicting two distinct domains involved in hyaluronate and proteoglycan subunit interactions is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1533455618,"Abstract Measurements of the in vitro splicing efficiency of deletion mutant RNA precursors containing the small intron of the rabbit beta-globin gene, which are truncated in the first or in the second exon, revealed that no more than approximately 20 nucleotides of either exon are necessary for efficient splicing. At least for the second exon, this minimal length requirement is globin sequence-independent. Reduction of the exon-2 length to 14 nucleotides resulted in very inefficient splicing, whereas further reduction to 5 nucleotides apparently abolished the second splicing step (3' cutting and ligation), whereas the first step (5' cutting and branching) still occurred. The splicing efficiency of a double-mutant substrate retaining approximately 20 nucleotides of each exon was reduced to 50%. A kinetic study indicated that in the reaction of this double-mutant substrate the second, but not the first, splicing step was delayed, in contrast to the reaction of the wild-type precursor. Duplication or triplication of the entire sequence of exon-1 did not affect the splicing efficiency, whereas elongation of this exon with approximately 100 nucleotides of 5'-flanking (nontranscribed) beta-globin sequence diminished the level of correct splicing with the simultaneous appearance of aberrant lariat forms. We conclude that for mono-intronic precursors in which there is only one choice of splice sites, most of the exon sequences are not mechanistically involved in the splicing process."

Inhibitor I was a mixture of 1-acyl (16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, and 20:4)-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (acyllyso-GPC) and 1-alkyl (16:0, 18:0, and 18:1)-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkyllyso-GPC). 16:0 acyllyso-GPC was the most inhibitory, followed by 18:1, 18:2, 20:4, and 18:0 acyllyso-GPCs and 16:0 alkyllyso-GPC. Their IC50 values were in the range of 1-4 X 10(-5) M against the platelet aggregation induced by 1 X 10(-10) M 16:0 alkylacetyl-GPC, indicating that they were about 100 times weaker inhibitors than CV-3988. Inhibitor II was a mixture of N-acyl sphing-4-enyl phosphocholine (18:1/18:0, 18:1/20:0, 18:1/24:0, and 18:1/24:2). The most inhibitory of these components were 18:1/20:0 and 18:1/24:0, followed by 18:1/24:2 and 18:1/18:0, and their IC50 values were in the range of 4-5 X 10(-5) M against platelet aggregation induced by the alkylacetyl-GPC. Quantitatively, about 10(5) times higher concentrations of these inhibitors should be necessary to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by 1 X 10(-10) M 16:0 alkylacetyl-GPC. In fact, the contents of Inhibitors I and II, respectively, were approximately 10(5) times (4.7 X 10(-2) and 7.1 X 10(-2) mol/mol lipid-phosphorus of the original uterine phospholipids) than that of 16:0 alkylacetyl-GPC (1.4 X 10(-6) mol/mol lipid-phosphorus). The role of alkylacetyl-GPC in normal rat uterus is uncertain, but it coexists in situ with two kinds of endogenous inhibitors, choline containing lysoglycerophospholipids and sphingophospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W2006895755,"The neuron R15 is a peptidergic cell within the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia that participates in two neural circuits governing physiological and behavioral programs. We have cloned and characterized the major gene product expressed in this neuron. The R15 cDNA encodes a polyprotein precursor that is cleaved to yield a set of small neuropeptides. One peptide, R15 alpha 1, may act on different target cells to generate distinct but complementary physiological alterations that contribute to a program of cardiovascular changes in Aplysia. We have found that the RNA encoding the R15 polyprotein is spliced differently in different neurons. Our results suggest that alternative splicing of RNAs encoding polyproteins may provide a mechanism to generate distinct but overlapping sets of peptides that govern distinct but related physiological or behavioral programs."

Antithrombin Northwick Park, a functionally inactive variant antithrombin, has recently been shown by us (Lane, D.A., Flynn, A., Ireland, H., Erdjument, H., Samson, D., Howarth, D., and Thompson, E. (1987) Br. J. Haematol. 65,451-456) to be present in plasma, in part, as a high Mr (approximately 120,000) component which has a characteristic electrophoretic mobility in agarose gels in the absence of denaturing agents. In this communication, we present evidence that this Mr approximately 120,000 variant component is comprised of an antithrombin-albumin covalent disulfide-linked complex. This proposal is supported by results of: (a) fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the isolated reduced, S-carboxymethylated, trypsin-digested Mr approximately 120,000 complex; (b) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this complex and its reduced and S-carboxymethylated constituents; (c) immunoblotting of these polyacrylamide gels with antisera specific for antithrombin and albumin; (d) NH2-terminal sequence analysis of one of the isolated, S-carboxymethylated proteins that comprise the Mr approximately 120,000 complex; and (e) fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of its tryptic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1606920818,"Stabilization of iron in a bioavailable form is the function of ferritin, a protein of 24 subunits forming a coat around a core of less than or equal to 4500 hydrated iron atoms. The core of ferritin isolated from tissues contains Fe3+, but Fe2+ is required for experimental core formation in protein coats; reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ facilitates iron removal from protein coats. Using the differences in x-ray absorption spectra (x-ray absorption near edge structure) between Fe2+ and Fe3+ to monitor reconstitution of ferritin from Fe2+ and protein coats, we observed stabilization of Fe2+, apparently inside the coat. Mixtures of Fe2+ and Fe3+ persisted for greater than or equal to 16 h in air indicating that, in vivo, some iron in ferritin could be stored as Fe2+ and with Fe3+ could yield magnetite."

https://openalex.org/W1555097928,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a target hormone for growth hormone (GH) action, has been shown to regulate rat GH gene transcription. We further investigated its direct action on the human GH gene transfected in human choriocarcinoma cells (JEG3) which possess abundant IGF-I receptors. The 2.6 kilobase (kb) hGH gene (EcoRI fragment) in pUC18 (phGH) was transfected into cells by calcium-phosphate-dimethyl sulfoxide shock. The cells were subsequently treated for 72 h, when GH gene expression was measured. 8-Bromo-cAMP (Br-cAMP, 2.5 mM) and hydrocortisone (100 nM), respectively, stimulated GH secretion in transfected cells by 50% over unstimulated control cells, while combined treatment with these two agents caused a 340% increase of GH secretion as measured by radioimmunoassay. IGF-I (6.5 nM) did not suppress the basal level of Gh secretion but did inhibit the stimulated GH secretion by over 50%. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that 8-Br-cAMP + hydrocortisone markedly increased newly synthesized 22-kDa [35S]GH. This de novo GH synthesis was inhibited by IGF-I. Northern gel analysis of poly(A) RNA showed that 8-Br-cAMP + hydrocortisone induced a 1.0-kb mRNA species as detected with 32P-labeled hGH-cDNA. IGF-I suppressed the GH mRNA induced by cAMP + hydrocortisone as well as suppressing a larger 2.2-kb GH mRNA precursor. The results show that the transfected human GH gene was expressed and regulated in homologous cells. The 2.6-kb hGH fragment therefore contains non-tissue-specific cis-acting regulatory elements responsive to cAMP, hydrocortisone, and IGF-I. Specific IGF-I-responsive GH DNA sequences may therefore reside in the 0.5-kb 5'-flanking region, or in an intron, as described for hydrocortisone."
https://openalex.org/W1510752969,"Abstract Individual molecules of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), a protein likely to be important in the visual cycle, were visualized by means of electron microscopy. IRBP was coated with a very thin layer of tungsten and photographed by dark-field imaging. IRBP is seen to be a flexible, elongated molecule about 24 nm in length by 3-4 nm in width (statistical modes). These dimensions agree very well with those calculated from the frictional ratio obtained from sedimentation data. Approximately half of these rod-shaped IRBP molecules are straight, and half are bent in the middle, usually with an angle of 60-90 degrees between the two arms. A representation of IRBP as a bendable string of beads yields calculations of dimensions and of hydrodynamic parameters consistent with the electron microscopic and sedimentation data; the sedimentation coefficients derived from this representation are nearly insensitive to molecular bending. When IRBP is bound to saturating amounts of its endogenous ligands, all-trans- or 11-cis-retinol, its sedimentation behavior is unchanged, and the same types of particles are visualized by electron microscopy as with the free protein; however, a greater proportion of the molecules are bent. Deglycosylation of IRBP (with peptide:N-glycosidase F) results in a somewhat smaller molecule that retains its rod-like shape, as shown by gel filtration and sedimentation data. The results indicate that IRBP is an elongated molecule and suggest that a structural change may occur upon ligand binding."

Wheat germ 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase does not hydrolyze 2',3'-cyclic esters in cyclic phosphate-terminated oligoribonucleotides or in nucleoside 5'-phosphate, 2',3'-cyclic phosphate (pN greater than p). This is in contrast to the 3'-phosphodiesterase activity associated with a wheat germ RNA ligase which hydrolyzes cyclic phosphate-terminated oligonucleotides and pN greater than p substrates much more efficiently than nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphates. The enzyme characterized in this work appears to be the only known 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase specific for 2',3'-cyclic mononucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1589355384,"Abstract Recent observations have indicated that eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2 and GTP or GDP normally bind to 60 S ribosomal subunits in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and that when eIF-2 alpha is phosphorylated and polypeptide chain initiation is inhibited, eIF-2 X GDP accumulates on 60 S subunits due to impaired dissociation that is normally mediated by the reversing factor (eIF-2B). Current findings now indicate that inhibition due to phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha is mediated, at least in part, by the inability to dissociate eIF-2 X GDP from the 60 S subunit of complete initiation complexes. At the onset of inhibition, there is an accumulation of Met-tRNA(f) and eIF-2 on the polysomes, despite a marked reduction in Met-tRNA(f) bound to 40 S subunits and Met-peptidyl-tRNA bound to the polysomes. This initial effect is not associated with the formation of half-mers (polysomes containing an extra unpaired 40 S subunit), and the 40 S X Met-tRNA(f) complexes, though reduced, still sediment at 43 S. When inhibition is maximal and the polysomes are largely disaggregated, there is an accumulation of 48 S complexes consisting of a 40 S subunit and Met-tRNA(f) bound to globin mRNA as well as small polysomal half-mers, such that residual protein synthesis occurs to about the same degree on 1 1/2s and 2 1/2s as on mono-, di-, and triribosomes. Exogenous eIF-2B increases protein synthesis on mono-, di-, and triribosomes and decreases that on half-mers. This is associated with reduced binding of Met-tRNA(f) and eIF-2 to ribosomal particles sedimenting at 80 S and greater and a shift from 48 S to 43 S complexes. These results suggest that eIF-2B must normally promote dissociation of eIF-2 X GDP from the 60 S subunit of complete initiation complexes before they can elongate but cannot when eIF-2 alpha is phosphorylated, resulting in the accumulation of these complexes, some of which dissociate into Met-tRNA(f) X 40 S X mRNA and 60 S X eIF-2 X GDP."
https://openalex.org/W1495900571,"We report here studies of the synthesis of lyso(bis)-phosphatidic acid [L(b)PA] by normal and BCG-elicited rabbit alveolar macrophages. This study was prompted by our earlier observations that 1) alveolar macrophages did not synthesize L(b)PA de novo despite its abundance in these cells, 2) BCG-elicited cells contained only one-quarter the amount of L(b)PA as normal cells, and 3) the turnover of arachidonate in L(b)PA led to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene synthesis. We found that exogenous phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was specifically converted to L(b)PA by both types of cells although BCG-elicited cells had only one-quarter the synthetic capacity of normal cells. Other phospholipids were found to become cell associated but were not significantly metabolized. Both glycerol moieties and the phosphate were incorporated into the product L(b)PA. However, substitution of the ester with an alkyl linkage in position 1 blocked the conversion of PG to L(b)PA. Most of the alkylphosphatidylglycerol was converted to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. This result implied that catabolism of the acyl group in position 1 was essential for L(b)PA synthesis. Because alveolar macrophages are present in a surfactant-rich milieu, we suggest that surfactant provides a source of PG for macrophage synthesis of L(b)PA in situ. It is interesting that the surfactants from rabbits challenged with BCG have a significant decrease in PG content.—Waite, M.; Roddick, V.; Thornburg, T; King, L.; Cochran, F.

https://openalex.org/W89888706,"We have investigated the genetic control of murine catalase expression by analyzing catalase transcription and translation products from the tissues of control (Csa) and acatalasemic (Csb) mouse strains. Csb animals possess nearly normal catalase enzyme activity levels in liver, while displaying approximately 20 and 1% of normal activity levels in kidney and red blood cells, respectively. Immunoblot analyses of catalase in these tissues have revealed reduced levels of immunologically reactive catalase protein in Csb kidney and red blood cells, paralleling the reduction of catalase enzyme activity in these tissues. In order to determine the molecular basis for Csb acatalasemia, we have isolated a cDNA clone for murine catalase and have used this probe to analyze Csa and Csb genomic DNA and catalase mRNA. These studies have revealed: 1) no restriction fragment length polymorphisms between Csa and Csb genomic DNAs; 2) no differences in the levels of Csa and Csb catalase mRNA within a single tissue; and 3) no differences in the sizes of Csa and Csb catalase mRNAs. These observations suggest that the genetic defect that produces the tissue-specific reduction of catalase expression in Csb mice is not due to a marked rearrangement of DNA within the Csb catalase structural gene. Furthermore, the Csb mutation does not act at the level of gene transcription or mRNA stability, but rather at the level of mRNA translation and/or catalase protein turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1547375488,"The light chain of kallikrein-cleaved human high molecular weight kininogen is solely responsible for its cofactor activity in blood clotting. Sequencing of the NH2-terminal region of the light chain reported herein identified the third kallikrein cleavage site of high molecular weight kininogen as Arg-437. The co-factor activity of high molecular weight kininogen consists of the capacity to bind to negatively charged surfaces and to factor XI or prekallikrein. Chemical modification of the histidines by either photooxidation or ethoxyformic anhydride affected the equivalent of 14-16 of 23 histidines available and resulted in over 90% loss in procoagulant activity. The modified protein had drastically reduced surface- and zinc-binding capacity, but it bound successfully to either factor XI or prekallikrein. In contrast, modification of two carboxyl groups, which led to approximately 80-90% loss of procoagulant activity, seriously compromised protein binding but left surface binding unaffected. All 3 tryptophans were modified at pH 4.0 with N-bromosuccinimide with a 70% reduction in procoagulant activity, but only 1 tryptophan was available for reaction at pH 7.35, resulting in a 50% loss in activity. Tryptophan modification at acidic pH affected protein binding but did not modify surface or zinc binding. Modification of both available tyrosine and 9 of 18 available lysine residues did not have a significant effect on the procoagulant activity of the light chain. These studies indicate that histidines participate in surface binding and that free carboxyl groups and tryptophan side chains are involved in binding of high molecular weight kininogen to other clotting factors."
https://openalex.org/W1555761509,"H1 histone of mouse lymphoma L5178Y was fractionated into five subtypes, I-V, by Bio-Rex 70 column chromatography. The rates of synthesis of subtypes III and V were higher than those of I, II, and IV, as determined by the measurement of [3H]lysine incorporation. The degradation of the subtype was estimated assuming first order kinetics; subtypes III and V had half-lives of 18 h and 25 h, respectively, and the three other subtypes all had half-lives of 63 h. The syntheses of these subtypes during the cell cycle were examined using synchronized cultures. The syntheses of subtypes I, II, and IV started at the beginning of S phase, whereas those of III and V started in mid-S phase. The syntheses of III and V were at least 1.5-2 times more rapid than those of I, II, and IV, and their active synthesis was accompanied by their rapid degradation. The five subtypes of H1 were further characterized in relation to phosphorylation. Each showed characteristic differences in its synthetic pattern or phosphorylation, and we concluded that each H1 subtype has its own specific function at least in the process of replication of chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1607963885,"Cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells were subjected to amino acid restriction to examine its effects on the level of expression of the nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase components of the multienzyme complex which was previously characterized (Mirande, M., Le Corre, D., and Waller, J.-P. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 147, 281-289). Lowering the methionine concentration in the medium from 100 to 1 microM led to growth arrest, rapid deacylation of tRNAMet, and progressive 2-fold elevation of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase level, as assessed by specific activity measurements and immunotitration. The levels of the other eight aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were not affected. Total methionine deprivation led to the additional derepression of the leucyl- and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase components, whereas the corresponding tRNAs remained fully acylated. These pleiotropic responses to total methionine restriction were abolished in the presence of 2 mM methioninol, suggesting that amino acid transport systems may play a role in the regulation of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase expression. The effect of total deprivation of arginine, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, or proline from the culture medium on the level of expression of the corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases was also examined. In all cases, no elevation of the level of the corresponding synthetase was observed. The behavior of methionyl-tRNA synthetase from Chinese hamster ovary cells displaying a 2-fold increased level of the enzyme due to methionine restriction was examined in detail. Failure to detect a free form of the enzyme by gel filtration, as well as the finding that the isolated complex displayed twice the amount of methionyl-tRNA synthetase relative to the other components, indicates that this multienzyme structure can accommodate at least one additional copy of one of its components."
https://openalex.org/W1962846800,"We have studied the changes in amino acid transport in fetal erythroid cells isolated from rat fetal liver at different gestation days. Our results show that System A transport as measured by the Na+-dependent uptake of 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB) was conspicuous at day 13 but virtually disappeared between days 16 and 18. In contrast, the activity of System ASC measured by the Na+-dependent uptake of MeAIB-insensitive threonine uptake increased after day 14 and was optimal between days 16 and 18. This transport system regressed in activity with further maturation, but remained conspicuously saturable in the matured red blood cell. Interestingly, the newly discovered Na+-independent System asc (Vadgama, J. V., and Christensen, H.N. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2912-2921), selective for the uptake of test substrates threonine, serine, and alanine, was present in these erythroid cells. Its activity increased during gestation days 16-18. System L transport was present simultaneously with the Na+-independent System asc. As we had previously demonstrated for the pigeon red blood cell, these two transport systems are kinetically independent as confirmed with inhibition studies and the special selectivity of System L to trans stimulation. Tryptophan uptake could be attributed predominantly to System L, as also observed for the nucleated pigeon red blood cells and certain other cells. Arginine showed its familiar Na+-independent mode of uptake as a cation throughout the interval of study. An exceptional Na+-dependent component of arginine uptake emerged after day 14, peaked at day 18, and then disappeared on further maturation of the erythroid cell."
https://openalex.org/W1652726795,"Abstract An endogenous RNA (designated as PIVB RNA), which is capable of associating with the 4 S glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to generate the 6 S form, has been purified from AtT-20 cells (Ali, M., and Vedeckis, W. V. (1987) J. Biol. Chem., 262, 6771-6777). We describe here the physiochemical properties, GR-RNA interaction characteristics, and the chemical identification of PIVB RNA. 32P-Labeled PIVB RNA was similar to transfer RNA (tRNA) in its sedimentation coefficient (4 S) on sucrose gradients, electrophoretic mobility on formaldehyde-agarose gels, and receptor binding characteristics. The amino acid acceptor activity of PIVB RNA displayed a typical tRNA-dependent saturation curve and was 2-3-fold higher than that of homologous rabbit liver tRNA when tested using rabbit liver aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The purified [3H] aminoacyl-PIVB complex was also capable of binding to the 4 S GR to generate the 6 S form. The analysis of PIVB RNA on an acrylamide-urea sequencing gel revealed that it contained a major tRNA of 76 nucleotides and other minor tRNA species of 74 and 78 nucleotides. The identity of the tRNA present in the PIVB RNA was indirectly deduced by analyzing the 3H-amino acids, liberated from the [3H]aminoacyl-PIVB RNA (tRNA) complex, and subsequent analysis on an amino acid analyzer. PIVB RNA mainly contained tRNAArg (51.8%), tRNALys (17.1%), and tRNAHis (9.2%) which together accounted for 78% of the total PIVB tRNA. The remaining 22% of tRNA was contributed by threonine, valine, aspartic acid, alanine, and phenylalanine tRNAs. The GR displayed no species specificity, and tRNA samples from mouse, cow, rabbit, yeast, and Escherichia coli can bind to the mouse 4 S GR to generate the 6 S form. However, PIVB RNA did not affect the sedimentation profiles of albumin, chymotrypsinogen, and histone, indicating that PIVB RNA does not bind to all proteins. Thus, there may exist some specificity both at the level of protein (GR) and the selection of RNA (tRNA). The GR binding to PIVB RNA occurred at low (nM) receptor concentration, and PIVB RNA showed limited capacity to shift 4 S GR to the 6 S form. 22.4 X 10(-11) mol of PIVB RNA can completely shift 4.8 X 10(-13) mol of 4 S GR to 6 S. That is, PIVB RNA has to be in a 500-600-fold excess over the amounts of GR to observe a stable 6 S GR X RNA complex on sucrose gradients. These results conclusively demonstrate that the transformed GR specifically binds to endogenous tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1531128963,"In previtellogenic oocytes of Xenopus laevis, nearly all tRNA is included in nucleoprotein particles (thesaurisomes) sedimenting at 42 S. We evaluate the possibility of a tRNA exchange between the particles and the ribosomes during protein synthesis. We find that the particles take up tRNA after a very short incubation in vitro. In the absence of ATP, the particles preferentially bind charged tRNA. In the presence of ATP, more tRNA binds to the particles, and the sedimentation coefficient of the integrated tRNA is displaced to 45 S. When added to nonfractionated homogenates of oocytes together with ATP, poly(U) strongly stimulates the incorporation of radioactive phenylalanine into tRNA and protein. The labeled protein (polyphenylalanine) cosediments with the ribosomes, whereas most of phenylalanyl tRNA cosediments with the thesaurisomes. These data suggest that the thesaurisomes participate to some extent in protein synthesis. They release charged tRNA, thereby supplying the ribosomes with activated amino acids. Discharged tRNA is then taken up, reacylated, and stored in the particles until the next round of peptide bond formation. The aminoacylation and storage functions are probably carried out by two very unequal populations of particles. The main subclass of particles (42 S) binds and stores tRNA in an ATP-independent manner. A much smaller subclass of particles (45 S) is responsible for reacylation of discharged tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1480792921,"Binding of chicken erythrocyte linker histones H1/H5 to the core nucleosome has been studied. Histones H1/H5 bind very efficiently to the isolated core nucleosome in vitro. The binding of linker histones to the core nucleosome is associated with aggregation of the particles. Approximately one molecule of linker histone binds per core nucleosome in the aggregates, irrespective of the concentration of the linker histones and the salt used. Histone H5 shows greater binding affinity to the core nucleosome as compared to H1. The carboxyl-terminal fragment of the linker histones binds strongly to the core nucleosome while the binding of the central globular domain is weak. Each core nucleosome is capable of binding two molecules of carboxyl-terminal fragment of linker histone. The core nucleosome containing one molecule of carboxyl-terminal fragment of linker histone requires higher salt concentration for aggregation while the core nucleosome containing two molecules of carboxyl-terminal fragment of linker histone can self-associate even at lower salt concentrations. On the basis of these results we are proposing a novel mechanism for the condensation of chromatin by linker histones and other related phenomena."

In this paper we report studies concerning the relationship between N-linked oligosaccharide structure and [3H]palmitate incorporation into proteins of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We have compared the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into proteins of wild-type and four different mutant CHO cell lines defective in various steps of N-linked protein glycosylation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoretic analysis showed that three of the mutants exhibited increased [3H]palmitate incorporation into several CHO cellular proteins (approximately 30,000-38,000 molecular weight) as compared to the wild-type cells. One of the affected mutants which accumulates the Man5Gn2Asn intermediate structure was examined in detail. In agreement with earlier reports, virtually all of the [3H] palmitate-labeled proteins of both wild-type and mutant cell lines are membrane-bound. Pretreatment of the mutant cell line with tunicamycin blocked the increased [3H]palmitate incorporation into the two specific proteins (both of approximately 30,000 molecular weight) observed in untreated cells; the decreased incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the 30,000 molecular weight species was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into two proteins of approximately 20,000 molecular weight. Pretreatment of wild-type cells with tunicamycin also caused increased [3H]palmitate incorporation into the 20,000 molecular weight species. Endoglycosidase H treatment of [3H]palmitate-labeled extracts from the mutant cell line resulted in the disappearance of the heavily labeled 30,000 molecular weight species and the appearance of intensely labeled 20,000 molecular weight species. Pretreatment of the mutant cell line with either castanospermine or deoxynojirimycin reduced the [3H]palmitate incorporation in to the 30,000 molecular weight species increased in untreated cells, but did not cause increased [3H]palmitate incorporation into the 20,000 molecular weight species. Our results indicate that perturbation of N-linked oligosaccharide structure results in altered incorporation of [3H]palmitate into specific proteins in CHO cells."
https://openalex.org/W1482662405,"We evaluated the effects of unsubstituted and hydroxymonocarboxylic acids on the kinetics of Na+-dependent L-lactate uptake in brush-border membrane vesicles prepared from the whole cortex of rabbit kidney. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate reversibly inhibited Na+-dependent L-lactate influx with [I]0.5 values of 5.5, 0.50, and 0.25 mM, respectively. Dixon plots (1/V versus acetate, propionate, and butyrate) were curved concavely downward, indicating partial inhibition. The Hill coefficients were approximately 1.0, suggesting that these anions interact at a single site on the Na+-L-lactate cotransporter. Acetate and the two other unsubstituted short-chain fatty acids tested decreased Na+-dependent L-lactate influx by increasing Km and decreasing Vmax, indicating mixed-type inhibition. In contrast, Na+-dependent L-lactate uptake was competitively inhibited by alpha-hydroxybutyrate and D-lactate. Finally, evidence is presented to show that D-lactate and alpha-hydroxybutyrate are mutually exclusive inhibitors of Na+-dependent L-lactate influx. Results from this and recent studies are interpreted as indicating that distinct transport systems serve for unsubstituted and alpha-hydroxymonocarboxylic acids in renal brush-border membrane vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1647175666,"Twenty-one isolated, perfused, spontaneously rhythmic guinea pig hearts (Langendorff preparation) were used to investigate the effects of coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) on the coronary vasoactive response to a continuous infusion of histamine. Heart rate (HR), coronary perfusate flow (CPF), left ventricular pressure, dp/dtmax, oxygen extraction, and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) were measured at constant CPP of 40 (n = 9), 53 (n = 6), and 65 cm H2O (n = 6) in the absence and presence of continuous intracoronary infusion of histamine [0.9 +/- 0.2 microgram/(min X g)]. At 40 cm H2O histamine caused significant coronary vasodilation. At 65 cm H2O histamine caused significant coronary vasoconstriction. At an intermediate pressure of 53 cm H2O histamine had no effect on CPF. At all three pressures HR, left ventricular pressure, dp/dtmax, and oxygen extraction increased significantly in response to histamine. MVO2 was unchanged by histamine at 65 cm H2O (flow was reduced but extraction increased. MVO2 increased modestly but significantly at 53 cm H2O (12% increase; flow unchanged but extraction increased), and increased prominently at 40 cm H2O (50% increase; flow and extraction increased). We conclude that the coronary vascular effects of continuously infused histamine are dependent on the preexisting, steady-state level of CPP in the isolated perfused guinea pig heart."
