https://openalex.org/W2888609501,"CD47 is a widely expressed cell surface protein that functions as an immune checkpoint in cancer. When expressed by tumor cells, CD47 can bind SIRPα on myeloid cells, leading to suppression of tumor cell phagocytosis and other innate immune functions. CD47-SIRPα signaling has also been implicated in the suppression of adaptive antitumor responses, but the relevant cellular functions have yet to be elucidated. Therapeutic blockade of the CD47 pathway may stimulate antitumor immunity and improve cancer therapy. To this end, a novel CD47-blocking molecule, ALX148, was generated by fusing a modified SIRPα D1 domain to an inactive human IgG1 Fc. ALX148 binds CD47 from multiple species with high affinity, inhibits wild type SIRPα binding, and enhances phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages. ALX148 has no effect on normal human blood cells in vitro or on blood cell parameters in rodent and non-human primate studies. Across several murine tumor xenograft models, ALX148 enhanced the antitumor activity of different targeted antitumor antibodies. Additionally, ALX148 enhanced the antitumor activity of multiple immunotherapeutic antibodies in syngeneic tumor models. These studies revealed that CD47 blockade with ALX148 induces multiple responses that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. ALX148 stimulates antitumor properties of innate immune cells by promoting dendritic cell activation, macrophage phagocytosis, and a shift of tumor-associated macrophages toward an inflammatory phenotype. ALX148 also stimulated the antitumor properties of adaptive immune cells, causing increased T cell effector function, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and a reduction in the number of suppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment. Taken together, these results show that ALX148 binds and blocks CD47 with high affinity, induces a broad antitumor immune response, and has a favorable safety profile."

It is a recognized predictor for neck nodal metastasis and local recurrence, the associated risk is not well defined. The aim of this study was to explore the risk of occult neck nodal metastasis and local recurrence in relation to depth in early stage squamous cell carcinoma of oral tongue.We have evaluated records of 179 patients with early tongue cancer treated in our unit from 2006-2015 with a mean age of 57.92 ± 11.93 years. Treatment modalities used were surgery (26%), surgery followed by radiotherapy (64%) and chemo-radiation (10%). Neck dissection was ipsilateral in 94% and bilateral in 6% of the patients. Patients were grouped according to the AJCC cut off points in 8th edition for depth; group A: 1-5 mm (35%), group B: 6-10 mm (47%) and group C: > 10 mm (18%).Risk of local recurrence and nodal metastasis for Group A was 15% (10/63) and 23% (15/63), group B 20% (17/84) and 34% (29/84), and group C 40% (13/32) and 53% (17/32).Depth more than 10 mm is associated with significantly increased risk of recurrence and nodal metastasis. Elective neck dissection should be a consideration for tumors having depth less than 5mm."
https://openalex.org/W2888136771,"T cells generate adaptive immune responses mediated by the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex comprising an αβ TCR heterodimer noncovalently associated with three CD3 dimers. In early T cell activation, αβ TCR engagement by peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is first communicated to the CD3 signaling apparatus of the TCR-CD3 complex, but the underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. It is possible that pMHC binding induces allosteric changes in TCR conformation or dynamics that are then relayed to CD3. Here, we carried out NMR analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both the α and β chains of a human antiviral TCR (A6) that recognizes the Tax antigen from human T cell lymphotropic virus-1 bound to the MHC class I molecule HLA-A2. We observed pMHC-induced NMR signal perturbations in the TCR variable (V) domains that propagated to three distinct sites in the constant (C) domains: 1) the Cβ FG loop projecting from the Vβ/Cβ interface; 2) a cluster of Cβ residues near the Cβ αA helix, a region involved in interactions with CD3; and 3) the Cα AB loop at the membrane-proximal base of the TCR. A biological role for each of these allosteric sites is supported by previous mutational and functional studies of TCR signaling. Moreover, the pattern of long-range, ligand-induced changes in TCR A6 revealed by NMR was broadly similar to that predicted by the MD simulations. We propose that the unique structure of the TCR β chain enables allosteric communication between the TCR-binding sites for pMHC and CD3."

However, little is known about whether berberine can be a bioactive molecule toward carbohydrate-active enzymes, which play numerous vital roles in the life process. In this study, berberine and its analogs were discovered to be competitive inhibitors of glycoside hydrolase family 20 β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidase (GH20 Hex) and GH18 chitinase from both humans and the insect pest Ostrinia furnacalis. Berberine and its analog SYSU-1 inhibit insect GH20 Hex from O. furnacalis (OfHex1), with Ki values of 12 and 8.5 μm, respectively. Co-crystallization of berberine and its analog SYSU-1 in complex with OfHex1 revealed that the positively charged conjugate plane of berberine forms π–π stacking interactions with Trp490, which are vital to its inhibitory activity. Moreover, the 1,3-dioxole group of berberine binds an unexplored pocket formed by Trp322, Trp483, and Val484, which also contributes to its inhibitory activity. Berberine was also found to be an inhibitor of human GH20 Hex (HsHexB), human GH18 chitinase (HsCht and acidic mammalian chitinase), and insect GH18 chitinase (OfChtI). Besides GH18 and GH20 enzymes, berberine was shown to weakly inhibit human GH84 O-GlcNAcase (HsOGA) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae GH63 α-glucosidase I (ScGluI). By analyzing the published crystal structures, berberine was revealed to bind with its targets in an identical mechanism, namely via π–π stacking and electrostatic interactions with the aromatic and acidic residues in the binding pockets. This paper reports new molecular targets of berberine and may provide a berberine-based scaffold for developing multitarget drugs.

As for the black-legged tick, I. scapularis Say, global warming may also favor northward expansion of other species of medically important ticks. The aims of this study were to determine (1) current diversity and abundance of ticks of public health significance other than I. scapularis, (2) sex and age of the human population bitten by these ticks (3), and the seasonal and geographic pattern of their occurrence. From 2007 to 2015, twelve tick species other than I. scapularis were submitted in the Québec passive tick surveillance program. Of these 9243 ticks, 91.2% were Ixodes cookei, 4.1% were Dermacentor variabilis, 4.0% were Rhipicephalus sanguineus and 0.7% were Amblyomma americanum. The combined annual proportion of submitted I. cookei, D. variabilis, R. sanguineus and A. americanum ticks in passive surveillance rose from 6.1% in 2007 to 16.0% in 2015 and an annual growing trend was observed for each tick species. The number of municipalities where I. cookei ticks were acquired rose from 104 to 197 during the same period. Of the 862 people bitten by these ticks, 43.3% were I. cookei ticks removed from children aged < 10 years. These findings demonstrate the need for surveillance of all the tick species of medical importance in Québec, particularly because climate may increase their abundance and geographic ranges, increasing the risk to the public of the diseases they transmit."

We show that it also reacts rapidly with hypobromous acid, bromamines, and hypoiodous acid, indicating that R19-S responds to these reactive halogen species as well as HOCl. Hypothiocyanous acid and taurine chloramine were unreactive, however, and ammonia chloramine and dichloramine reacted only very slowly. MS analyses revealed additional products from the reaction of HOCl with R19-S, including a chlorinated species as a minor product. Of note, phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan or Staphylococcus aureus by neutrophils was accompanied by an increase in R19 fluorescence. This increase depended on NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase activities, and detection of chlorinated R19-S confirmed its specificity for HOCl. Using live-cell imaging to track individual phagosomes in single neutrophils, we observed considerable heterogeneity among the phagosomes in the time from ingestion of a zymosan particle to when fluorescence was first detected, ranging from 1 to >30 min. However, once initiated, the subsequent fluorescence increase was uniform, reaching a similar maximum in ∼10 min. Our results confirm the utility of R19-S for detecting HOCl in real-time and provide definitive evidence that isolated neutrophils produce HOCl in phagosomes.

They also showed that, in contrast to some of the other probes, R19-S is not a direct substrate for MPO. However, none of these probes has been tested for specificity against hypobromous acid (HOBr), hypoiodous acid (HOI), and hypothiocyanous (HOSCN), which are generated by MPO and other mammalian peroxidases, or against the chloramines or bromamines that are produced in secondary reactions with amines or ammonia (Reactions I and II for HOCl). HOCl+RNH2→RNHCl+H2OReactionI HOCl+RNHCl→RNCl2+H2OReactionII We have extended the initial studies with R19-S to characterize the products of the reaction using MS and to establish that the probe can react with some of these other peroxidase products. We have also used it for in-depth studies of MPO-dependent HOCl production by phagocytosing neutrophils. We show that R19-S oxidation can be followed by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy to track intracellular and extracellular HOCl, and with live-cell imaging to follow production in real-time in individual phagosomes. This has revealed heterogeneity between individual phagosomes in the time course of HOCl production following ingestion of zymosan particles, with some showing a rapid increase in fluorescence and others remaining nonfluorescent over the 30-min recording period. Chen et al. (13Chen X. Lee K.A. Ha E.M. Lee K.M. Seo Y.Y. Choi H.K. Kim H.N. Kim M.J. Cho C.S. Lee S.Y. Lee W.J. Yoon J.

Commun. 2011; 47: 4373-437510.1039/c1cc10589bCrossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) have shown that R19-S reacts with HOCl to give the fluorescent product, R19 (Fig. 1). To gain an appreciation of whether multiple products are formed, we analyzed the reaction using LC-MS. R19-S (mass 430 Da, Fig. 2A) gave a peak at 15 min with m/z of 431 representing the singly charged ion. Addition of HOCl at a molar ratio of 0.5:1 resulted in loss of a quarter of the R19-S peak, consistent with a 2:1 HOCl:R19-S stoichiometry. One major product peak was observed at 12.8 min, which contained three main ion species with m/z of 415, 430, and 447 (Fig. 2B). The highest intensity m/z 415 peak can be assigned to the singly charged [M+H]+ of R19 (mass 414 Da). The other ions are consistent with the doubly charged [M+2H]2+ of a covalent R19-S dimer (mass 2 × 430 −2H) and singly charged [M+H]+ of R19+O (mass 430 + 16). Although the structures of the product species were not characterized further, the dimer could be a disulfide and the M+16 peak a sulfoxide, likely intermediates or products in the multistep oxidation of R-19S. At high ratios of HOCl:R19-S, R19 underwent further oxidation to nonfluorescent species. Upon HOCl treatment, a small shoulder appeared at 15.8 min. This contained ions with the m/z of 465 and 467 at a ratio of 3:1, consistent with the singly charged [M+H]+ of the two isotopes of a chlorinated R19-S species, designated as R19S-Cl (Fig. 2B). Although a minor product, the definitive chlorine 3:1 footprint is a marker of oxidation by HOCl. To determine how effectively R19-S can compete for HOCl in the presence of physiological targets, we carried out the reaction in the presence of varying concentrations of a range of compounds that react with HOCl with known rate constants. For the reaction of 5 μm HOCl with 10 μm R19-S, the addition of N-α-acetyl-Lys (k = 7.9 × 103 m−1 s−1), taurine (k = 4.8 × 105 m−1 s−1), or N-acetyl-Trp (k = 1.1 × 104 m−1 s−1) (20Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Absolute rate constants for the reaction of hypochlorous acid with protein side chains and peptide bonds.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14 (11599938): 1453-146410.1021/tx0155451Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) at 20 μm, caused almost complete inhibition. However, as shown in Fig. 3, the data did not fit a simple competitive model, with N-α-acetyl-Lys showing the same inhibition curve with 10 μm as with 100 μm R19-S. This could be explained by the reaction of R19-S involving multiple steps, with a faster first step generating an intermediate, which is scavenged by the other compounds. Further kinetic analyses are required to elucidate the mechanism and obtain rate constants. However, the observation that low concentrations of amino acids were able to inhibit fluorescence indicates that one step may be relatively slow, and at concentrations typically used in cell studies R19-S would have to compete with multiple physiological targets. We compared the reactivity R19-S with HOCl, HOBr, HOSCN, HOI, chloramines, and bromamines. With equimolar HOCl and R19-S, the reaction was rapid and complete within 5 min (Fig. 4). HOBr also reacted rapidly but gave only half the fluorescence yield of HOCl. HOSCN gave almost no reaction even after 1 h, although a gradual response was seen at higher concentrations. HOI reacted rapidly to give very high fluorescence, with absorbance changes indicating that (possibly iodinated) products other than R19 were formed. To test for chloramine and bromamine reactivity, we selected taurine derivatives, as they are among the less reactive amino acid haloamines, and the highly reactive mono- and di-chloramines of ammonia (21Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Cytotoxicity of chloramines.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132 (3547027): 585-59310.1016/S0076-6879(86)32043-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Coker M.S. Hu W.P.

Taurine chloramine did not react with R19-S, and although the ammonia chloramines did react, their reactions were very slow and at 1 h gave only 12 and 16%, respectively, of the fluorescence seen with HOCl within 5 min. However, taurine bromamine reacted rapidly and gave twice the yield seen with HOCl. The reason for the different yields with the brominated oxidants was not explored but it is likely that they reflect formation of different proportions of R19 and the other nonfluorescent products. It is apparent from our results that R19-S is not specific for HOCl, and in systems where other peroxidase products are generated, they should be considered as potential probe oxidants. However, with neutrophils it is reasonable to assume that the probe detects HOCl production. HOBr and HOI are minor MPO products at physiological bromide and iodide concentrations. Although chloramines are likely to be formed from HOCl in neutrophils (23Green J.N. Chapman A.L.P. Bishop C.J. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Neutrophil granule proteins generate bactericidal ammonia chloramine on reaction with hydrogen peroxide.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2017; 113 (29055823): 363-37110.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.10.343Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), their low or negligible reactivity means they should contribute little to probe oxidation. On the other hand, eosinophil peroxidase and peroxidasin use bromide as a favored substrate, and R19-S will detect HOBr and bromamines in systems where these peroxidases are active. We confirmed previous findings (13Chen X. Lee K.A. Ha E.M. Lee K.M. Seo Y.Y. Choi H.K. Kim H.N. Kim M.J. Cho C.S. Lee S.Y. Lee W.J. Yoon J. A specific and sensitive method for detection of hypochlorous acid for the imaging of microbe-induced HOCl production.Chem. Commun. 2011; 47: 4373-437510.1039/c1cc10589bCrossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) that R19-S does not react with H2O2 or with MPO in the absence of chloride, and observed that the fluorescence yield was similar when HOCl was added as a reagent or was generated by MPO, chloride, and an equivalent concentration of H2O2 (not shown). It has recently been reported that a pH of 8.5–9 is achieved within neutrophil phagosomes (12Foote J.R. Levine A.P. Behe P. Duchen M.R. Segal A.W. Imaging the neutrophil phagosome and cytoplasm using a ratiometric pH indicator.J. Vis. Exp. 2017; 10.3791/55107Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the reactivity of HOCl with R19-S at a higher pH. Under conditions similar to those in Fig. 4 the fluorescence yield at pH 8.5 was 110 ± 10% of that at pH 7.4. At pH 8.5, H2O2 (100 μm) still gave no reaction. The original study with R19-S used live cell imaging to detect HOCl in neutrophils (13Chen X. Lee K.A. Ha E.M. Lee K.M. Seo Y.Y. Choi H.K. Kim H.N. Kim M.J. Cho C.S. Lee S.Y. Lee W.J. Yoon J. A specific and sensitive method for detection of hypochlorous acid for the imaging of microbe-induced HOCl production.Chem. Commun. 2011; 47: 4373-437510.1039/c1cc10589bCrossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We tested whether it could be used with fluorimetry or flow cytometry. For fluorimetry, neutrophils were stimulated to ingest opsonized zymosan in the presence of R19-S in 96-well plates. Little fluorescence was seen in resting cells, but with zymosan added there was an initial lag, then a progressive increase in R19 fluorescence over time (Fig. 5A). The NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), completely suppressed the response. This method measures both intracellular HOCl and HOCl produced by the neutrophils and released into the medium. To measure predominantly intracellular HOCl, we added methionine, an efficient HOCl scavenger that should act outside the cells and have little intracellular impact. Most of the signal was suppressed. Furthermore, when the cells and supernatant were separated at the end of the experiment, the majority of the fluorescence was extracellular and prevented by methionine (Fig. 5B). The lower fluorescence of the cell fraction was relatively resistant to methionine. Thus neutrophil HOCl production can be measured by this method, but it is difficult to detect intracellular events. For flow cytometry, opsonized zymosan (20:1) was added to the neutrophils, with methionine included to scavenge extracellular HOCl. There was a pronounced increase in R19-S fluorescence in the stimulated but not resting cells that was totally inhibited by DPI (Fig. 6, A and B). Imaging of the neutrophils after 30 min showed phagocytosis of multiple zymosan particles and R19-S fluorescence associated with most but not all phagosomes (Fig. 6B). By flow cytometry, two populations of cells with different fluorescent intensity were apparent, perhaps representing varying degrees of phagocytosis or NOX activity. Cellular R19-S fluorescence increased rapidly after zymosan addition and slowed down by 30 min (Fig. 6C). A shorter lag was seen than in Fig. 5, probably because phagocytosis was more efficient in the rotating tubes used for these experiments than in the more static plate format. Consistent with the signal being due to HOCl, fluorescence was much lower when the neutrophils were suspended in chloride-free buffer (Fig. 6C). Definitive proof that HOCl was responsible for oxidation was obtained by LC-MS analysis of the R19-S oxidation products. Both R19 and the chlorinated product R19S-Cl were detected and decreased in parallel in the presence of DPI (Fig. 6D). An increase in intracellular R19 fluorescence was also detectable in neutrophils following phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 6E). The response followed a similar time course to that with zymosan. The signal with bacteria was lower, consistent with their smaller size giving smaller phagosomes. When neutrophils from a severely MPO-deficient individual (2–3% of normal activity) (24Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Superoxide-dependent hydroxylation by myeloperoxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (8006021): 17146-17151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were stimulated with S. aureus, the fluorescence response was less than 15% of that with normal neutrophils, thus establishing MPO-dependence. We also determined the effect on intracellular HOCl production of two potent inhibitors of MPO: 2-thioxanthine TX1, which acts as a suicide inhibitor, and hydroxamate HX1, which is a tight binder (25Tidén A.K.

Flow cytometry analyses following ingestion of S. aureus (Fig. 6F) showed that both TX1 and HX1 decreased fluorescence by ∼50%. Previously, these inhibitors have been shown to fully inhibit HOCl production by MPO (27Forbes L.V. Kettle A.J. A multi-substrate assay for finding physiologically effective inhibitors of myeloperoxidase.Anal. Biochem. 2018; 544 (29258826): 13-2110.1016/j.ab.2017.12.022Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we measured complete inhibition of extracellular R19 fluorescence with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated cells (not shown). Compared with the near complete lack of R19-S oxidation in MPO-deficient cells, these potent inhibitors were unable to completely suppress the activity of MPO released into the neutrophil phagosome. A possible explanation is low permeability, but other contributors may be the high MPO concentration in the phagosome (6Winterbourn C.C. Hampton M.B. Livesey J.H. Kettle A.J. Modeling the reactions of superoxide and myeloperoxidase in the neutrophil phagosome: implications for microbial killing.J. Biol.

Superoxide reacts directly with HOCl and interacts with MPO to modulate HOCl production (28Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Superoxide modulates the activity of myeloperoxidase and optimizes the production of hypochlorous acid.Biochem. J. 1988; 252 (2843172): 529-53610.1042/bj2520529Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 29Kettle A.J. Maroz A. Woodroffe G. Winterbourn C.C. Anderson R.F.

To test whether these interactions affect HOCl production in the phagosome, where large amounts of superoxide are generated, we attached SOD to the surface of the zymosan so that it would be taken up during phagocytosis and examined the effect on R19-S fluorescence. Analyses performed with dihydroethidium as a superoxide detector (30Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Zhang H. Joseph J. Nithipatikom K. Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Superoxide reacts with hydroethidine but forms a fluorescent product that is distinctly different from ethidium: potential implications in intracellular fluorescence detection of superoxide.Free Radic. Biol.

Coupled SOD gave a small but significant increase in R19 fluorescence above either normal zymosan, or zymosan coupled to inactivated SOD. These results are consistent with the superoxide generated in the phagosome causing a slight decrease but not a major impact on the availability of HOCl in the phagosome. The images in Fig. 6B show clearly that R19-S fluorescence is closely associated with individual phagosomes following ingestion of zymosan particles. To gain a greater insight into HOCl production within the neutrophils, time-lapse videos were taken (see Movie S1) with a sequence of shots taken over a 30-min period as shown in Fig. 8A. Over time, more neutrophils and zymosan particles entered the frame as they settled to the base of the dish, with 15 neutrophils visible by 30 min in the field shown. Each neutrophil sequentially took up multiple particles into individual phagosomes, and after a lag period there was a progressive increase in fluorescence intensity. This process appeared to occur independently in each phagosome. To gain quantitative data on the time course of ingestion and fluorescence, we used imaging software to track individual phagosomes. Two parameters were monitored, the time between phagocytosis and detectable fluorescence, and the time between detectable and maximal fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 8B, the lag-time between zymosan ingestion and detectable fluorescence varied widely. Most phagosomes became fluorescent within 10 min of ingestion (average lag-time 5.8 min) but some took longer and remained nonfluorescent at the end of the video recording. The observed variability existed within each neutrophil rather than between neutrophils. As shown in Fig. 8C, for the cells in which multiple phagosomes were followed, some showed uniformly short lags, but those containing phagosomes that responded slowly invariably contained others that showed a rapid response. Development of fluorescence within each phagosome was much more uniform (Fig. 8D). As soon as the signal was detectable, it increased rapidly over about 2 min, then continued to increase at a slower rate to reach a maximum that remained steady for the duration of the time-lapse events. The whole process was complete within about 10 min. A possible explanation for the plateauing of fluorescence is that all the R19-S was consumed. However, this is unlikely because when MPO was partially inhibited by TX1, both the rate of increase and the maximum fluorescence in each phagosome were decreased (64 and 52%, respectively) but the kinetic profile was similar (Fig. 8D). The percentage of fluorescent phagosomes was not altered on addition of TX1. Furthermore, R19-S was still detectable by LC-MS in the experiment described in Fig. 6D, indicating that it should not have been limiting. It is likely, therefore, that the R19 fluorescence signal monitors the duration of HOCl production in each phagosome. Our results provide good validation of R19-S as a detector of real-time HOCl production in neutrophils. We have also shown that the probe reacts well with HOBr and bromamines. This extends its usefulness for monitoring systems such as eosinophils or collagen IV-producing cells, where these species are produced by eosinophil peroxidase or peroxidasin. The nonspecificity of the probe is unlikely to be an issue with isolated neutrophils. However, in more complex systems such as whole animals it will not distinguish which oxidant is being detected. We have shown that R19 is not the only product, and that competing reactions in a physiological environment should result in R19-S capturing only a fraction of the HOCl being generated. Although this makes absolute quantification difficult, it has an advantage for neutrophil studies, as otherwise the probe could be consumed too rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W2888626615,"Background In Ethiopia, neonatal mortality remains high and accounts for about half of the under-five mortality. However, there is limited data on the knowledge and practice of mothers about newborn care at the community level, particularly in urban settings. Therefore, this study aimed to assess knowledge and practice of mothers on Essential Newborn Care in urban communities. Methods A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in December 2016 in Mekelle City, Northern Ethiopia. A total of 456(weighted) postpartum mothers were included in this study. A three-stage cluster sampling was used to select the study subjects in which districts, Kebeles and respondents formed the first, second and third stage, respectively. Postnatal mothers were recruited from each cluster/Kebele until the required sample size was achieved. They were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Mothers who responded correctly to at least 75% of the knowledge and practice questions were considered to have good knowledge and practice, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the knowledge and practice of Essential Newborn Care. Results In this study, 36.1% of mothers had good knowledge and 81.1% had a good practice on Essential Newborn Care. Newborn care practice was positively associated with those mothers who were educated [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.94; 95% CI (1.07, 3.50)], counseled during delivery and postpartum [AOR = 4.97; 95% CI (1.93, 12.76)], who had good knowledge of newborn care [AOR = 2.32; 95%CI (1.18, 4.55)] and who had good knowledge of newborn danger signs [AOR = 2.43; 95%CI (1.21, 4.87)]. Conclusions A substantial number of postpartum mothers had poor knowledge and practice on Essential Newborn Care in Mekelle City. Therefore, improving quality and access to maternal health services and home visit using the urban health extension workers at the community level should be encouraged."

Here, we show that Bcl3 expression is increased in human OC tissues. Surprisingly, however, we found that in addition to promoting survival, proliferation, and migration of OC cells, Bcl3 promotes both constitutive and interferon-γ (IFN)-induced expression of the immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1. The Bcl3 expression in OC cells is further increased by IFN, resulting in increased PD-L1 transcription. The mechanism consists of an IFN-induced, Bcl3- and p300-dependent PD-L1 promoter occupancy by Lys-314/315 acetylated p65 NF-κB. Blocking PD-L1 by neutralizing antibody reduces proliferation of OC cells overexpressing Bcl3, suggesting that the pro-proliferative effect of Bcl3 in OC cells is partly mediated by PD-L1. Together, this work identifies PD-L1 as a novel target of Bcl3, and links Bcl3 to IFNγ signaling and PD-L1-mediated immune escape."
https://openalex.org/W2888564385,"Nature exposure has been linked to a plethora of health benefits, but the mechanism for this effect is not well understood. We conducted two studies to test a new model linking the health benefits of nature exposure to reduced impulsivity in decision-making (as measured by delay discounting) via psychologically expanding space perception. In study 1 we collected a nationwide U.S. sample (n = 609) to determine whether nature exposure was predictive of health outcomes and whether impulsive decision-making mediated the effect. Results indicated that Nature Accessibility and Nature Exposure From Home significantly predicted reduced scores on the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) (p < .001, p = .03, respectively) and improved general health and wellbeing (p < .001, p < .01, respectively). Nature Accessibility also predicted reduced impulsive decision-making (p < .01), and Nature Accessibility showed significant indirect effects through impulsive decision-making on both the DASS (p = .02) and general health and wellbeing (p = .04). In Study 2, a lab-based paradigm found that nature exposure expanded space perception (p < .001), and while the indirect effect of nature exposure through space perception on impulsive decision-making did not meet conventional standards of significance (p < .10), the pattern was consistent with hypotheses. This combination of ecologically-valid and experimental methods offers promising support for an impulsivity-focused model explaining the nature-health relationship."

We have recently shown that complement inhibition by decay-accelerating factor (DAF) protects brain from blast-overpressure (BOP)-induced damage. This study was conducted to determine the effect of DAF on acute lung injury induced by BOP exposure and to elucidate its possible mechanisms of action.Anesthetized adult male Sprague-Daley rats were exposed to BOP (120 kPa) from a compressed air-driven shock tube. Rats were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: 1) Control (no BOP and no DAF treatment), 2) BOP (120 kPa BOP exposure), and 3) BOP followed by treatment with rhDAF (500μg/kg, i.v) at 30 minutes after blast. After a recovery period of 3, 24, or 48 hours, animals were euthanized followed by the collection of blood and tissues at each time point. Samples were subjected to the assessment of cytokines and histopathology as well as for the interaction of high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, NF-κB, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), C3a, and C3aR.BOP exposure significantly increased in the production of systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and obvious pathological changes as characterized by pulmonary edema, inflammation, endothelial damage and hemorrhage in the lungs. These alterations were ameliorated by early administration of rhDAF. The rhDAF treatment not only significantly reduced the expression levels of HMGB1, RAGE, NF-κB, C3a, and C3aR, but also reversed the interaction of C3a-C3aR and nuclear translocation of HMGB1 in the lungs.Our findings indicate that early administration of DAF efficiently inhibits systemic and local inflammation, and mitigates blast-induced lung injury. The underlying mechanism might be attributed to its potential modulation of C3a-C3aR-HMGB1-transcriptional factor axis. Therefore, complement and/or HMGB1 may be potential therapeutic targets in amelioration of acute lung injury after blast injury."

Methods The study was conducted in the population-based Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) pilot cohort (n = 1015, age 50–64 years, 51.2% women). NAFLD was defined as computed tomography liver attenuation ≤40 Hounsfield Units, excluding other causes of liver fat. Coronary artery calcification score (CACS) was assessed using the Agatston method. Carotid plaques and intima media thickness (IMT) were measured by ultrasound. Metabolic status was based on assessments of glucose homeostasis, serum lipids, blood pressure and inflammation. A propensity score model was used to balance NAFLD and non NAFLD groups with regards to potential confounders and associations between NAFLD status and ASCVD variables in relation to metabolic status were examined by logistic and generalized linear regression models. Results NAFLD was present in 106 (10.4%) of the subjects and strongly associated with obesity-related traits. NAFLD was significantly associated with CACS after adjustment for confounders and metabolic risk factors (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.07–2.94), but not with carotid plaques and IMT. The strongest association between NAFLD and CACS was observed in subjects with few metabolic risk factors (n = 612 [60% of all] subjects with 0–1 out of 7 predefined metabolic risk factors; OR 5.94, 95% CI 2.13–16.6). Conclusions NAFLD was independently associated with coronary artery calcification but not with measures of carotid atherosclerosis in this cohort. The association between NAFLD and CACS was most prominent in the metabolically healthy subjects."

Root explants on DKW medium supplemented with 2.26μM 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) and 4.65μM kinetin (KIN) induced highest percentage (70%) of embryogenic calli. Average number of globular embryos per root derived callus produced within 6 weeks of culture initiation on MS media with different plant growth regulators (PGRs) ranged from 2.27±0.12 to 8.80±0.17 and that of cotyledonary embryos ranged from 0.00 to 2.53±0.20. On DKW medium comparatively more globular embryos (2.70±0.15 to 14.53±0.23) and cotyledonary embryos (0.00 to 8.90±0.17) were produced than that of MS medium. Regeneration of complete plantlets was highest (76.67%) when embryogenic calli with mature somatic embryos were grown on DKW medium containing 2.32μM KIN and 2.22μM 6-Benzyladenine (BA). Plants were primarily hardened in humidity, temperature and light controlled chamber and finally in a greenhouse showed 70% survival ability.

There is the demand for searching plant species containing these iridoids or developing biotechnological methods to obtain the compounds. The present study investigated the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJa, 50 μM), ethephon (Eth, 50 μM) and L-phenylalanine (L-Phe, 2.4 g/L of medium), added to previously selected variant of Murashige and Skoog medium (supplemented with plant growth regulators: 6-benzylaminopurine 1.0 mg/L, α-naphthaleneacetic acid 0.5 mg/L, gibberellic acid 0.25 mg/L) on the accumulation of harpagide and 8-O-acetyl-harpagide in Melittis melissophyllum L. agitated shoot cultures. Plant material was harvested 2 and 8 days after the supplementation. Iridoids were quantitatively analyzed by the UPLC-MS/MS method in extracts from the biomass and the culture medium. It was found that all of the variants caused an increase in the accumulation of harpagide. In the biomass harvested after 2 days, the highest harpagide content of 247.3 mg/100 g DW was found for variant F (L-Phe and Eth), and the highest 8-O-acetyl-harpagide content of 138 mg/100 g DW for variant E (L-Phe and MeJa). After 8 days, in some variants, a portion of the metabolites was released into the culture medium. Considering the total amount of the compounds (in the biomass and medium), the highest accumulation of harpagide, amounting to 619 mg/100 g DW, was found in variant F, and the highest amount of 8-O-acetyl-harpagide, of 255.4 mg/100 g DW, was found in variant H (L-Phe, MeJa, Eth) when harvested on the 8th day. These amounts were, respectively, 24.7 and 4.8 times higher than in the control culture, and were, respectively, 15 and 6.7 times higher than in the leaves of the soil-grown plant. The total amount of the two iridoids was highest for variant F (0.78% DW) and variant H (0.68% DW) when harvested on the 8th day. The results indicate that the agitated shoot cultures of M. melissophyllum can be a rich source of harpagide and 8-O-acetyl-harpagide, having a potential practical application. To the best of our knowledge we present for the first time the results of the quantitative UPLC-MS/MS analysis of harpagide and 8-O-acetyl-harpagide in M. melissophyllum shoot cultures and the enhancement of their accumulation by means of medium supplementation with elicitors and precursor."

Patients with the diagnosis of type II diabetes but without DR were selected from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. Patients who received cataract surgery between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010, were included in the case group, and the control group was matched to the case group by age, sex, and index year. The postoperative incidence rates of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and diabetic macular edema (DME) were the main outcomes studied and were adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities, and statin, fibrate, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA), and insulin use. In our cohort, patients who had dyslipidemia and used statins were more likely to undergo cataract surgery. Among diabetic patients without previous DR, patients receiving cataract surgery had a higher risk of NDPR development (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.48, 95% confidence interval = 1.15–1.91). No statistical difference was observed in PDR or DME development between operative and nonoperative groups. In additional stratified analyses, female sex, older age, comorbidities, surgery within 5 years, statin, ACEI, OHA, and insulin use increased the risk of NPDR development. In an adjusted Cox regression model, cataract surgery, OHA and insulin use were found to be risk factors for NPDR development. Cataract surgery with complications increased post-operative risks for NPDR were even higher, and the significant influence from cataract surgery persisted 5 years after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2888534924,"Squamate reptiles are a major component of vertebrate biodiversity whose crown-clade traces its origin to a narrow window of time in the Mesozoic during which the main subclades diverged in rapid succession. Deciphering phylogenetic relationships among these lineages has proven challenging given the conflicting signals provided by genomic and phenomic data. Most notably, the placement of Iguania has routinely differed between data sources, with morphological evidence supporting a sister relationship to the remaining squamates (Scleroglossa hypothesis) and molecular data favoring a highly nested position alongside snakes and anguimorphs (Toxicofera hypothesis). We provide novel insights by generating an expanded morphological dataset and exploring the presence of phylogenetic signal, noise, and biases in molecular data. Our analyses confirm the presence of strong conflicting signals for the position of Iguania between morphological and molecular datasets. However, we also find that molecular data behave highly erratically when inferring the deepest branches of the squamate tree, a consequence of limited phylogenetic signal to resolve this ancient radiation with confidence. This, in turn, seems to result from a rate of evolution that is too high for historical signals to survive to the present. Finally, we detect significant systematic biases, with iguanians and snakes sharing faster rates of molecular evolution and a similarly biased nucleotide composition. A combination of scant phylogenetic signal, high levels of noise, and the presence of systematic biases could result in the misplacement of Iguania. We regard this explanation to be at least as plausible as the complex scenario of convergence and reversals required for morphological data to be misleading. We further evaluate and discuss the utility of morphological data to resolve ancient radiations, as well as its impact in combined-evidence phylogenomic analyses, with results relevant for the assessment of evidence and conflict across the Tree of Life."
https://openalex.org/W2888377732,"The erlin1/2 complex is a ∼2-MDa endoplasmic reticulum membrane–located ensemble of the ∼40-kDa type II membrane proteins erlin1 and erlin2. The best defined function of this complex is to mediate the ubiquitination of activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and their subsequent degradation. However, it remains unclear how mutations of the erlin1/2 complex affect its cellular function and cause cellular dysfunction and diseases such as hereditary spastic paraplegia. Here, we used gene editing to ablate erlin1 or erlin2 expression to better define their individual roles in the cell and examined the functional effects of a spastic paraplegia–linked mutation to erlin2 (threonine to isoleucine at position 65; T65I). Our results revealed that erlin2 is the dominant player in mediating the interaction between the erlin1/2 complex and IP3Rs and that the T65I mutation dramatically inhibits this interaction and the ability of the erlin1/2 complex to promote IP3R ubiquitination and degradation. Remarkably, we also discovered that the erlin1/2 complex specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, that erlin2 binds this phospholipid much more strongly than does erlin1, that the binding is inhibited by T65I mutation of erlin2, and that multiple determinants within the erlin2 polypeptide comprise the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate–binding site. Overall, these results indicate that erlin2 is the primary mediator of the cellular roles of the erlin1/2 complex and that disease-linked mutations of erlin2 can affect both IP3R processing and lipid binding. The erlin1/2 complex is a ∼2-MDa endoplasmic reticulum membrane–located ensemble of the ∼40-kDa type II membrane proteins erlin1 and erlin2. The best defined function of this complex is to mediate the ubiquitination of activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and their subsequent degradation. However, it remains unclear how mutations of the erlin1/2 complex affect its cellular function and cause cellular dysfunction and diseases such as hereditary spastic paraplegia. Here, we used gene editing to ablate erlin1 or erlin2 expression to better define their individual roles in the cell and examined the functional effects of a spastic paraplegia–linked mutation to erlin2 (threonine to isoleucine at position 65; T65I). Our results revealed that erlin2 is the dominant player in mediating the interaction between the erlin1/2 complex and IP3Rs and that the T65I mutation dramatically inhibits this interaction and the ability of the erlin1/2 complex to promote IP3R ubiquitination and degradation. Remarkably, we also discovered that the erlin1/2 complex specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, that erlin2 binds this phospholipid much more strongly than does erlin1, that the binding is inhibited by T65I mutation of erlin2, and that multiple determinants within the erlin2 polypeptide comprise the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate–binding site. Overall, these results indicate that erlin2 is the primary mediator of the cellular roles of the erlin1/2 complex and that disease-linked mutations of erlin2 can affect both IP3R processing and lipid binding.

Eight occurred amongst free-ranging wild herds, with three more in camp-raised orphans and two in captive-born calves. All were confirmed to have high levels of Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesvirus type 1A (EEHV1A) DNA detected within gross pathological lesions from necropsy tissue by multi-locus PCR DNA sequencing. The strains involved were all significantly different from one another and from nine previously described cases from Southern India (which included one example of EEHV1B). Overall, eight selected dispersed PCR loci totaling up to 6.1-kb in size were analyzed for most of the 22 cases, with extensive subtype clustering data being obtained at four hypervariable gene loci. In addition to the previously identified U48(gH-TK) and U51(vGPCR1) gene loci, these included two newly identified E5(vGPCR5) and E54(vOX2-1) loci mapping far outside of the classic EEHV1A versus EEHV1B subtype chimeric domains and towards the novel end segments of the genome that had not been evaluated previously. The high levels of genetic divergence and mosaic scrambling observed between adjacent loci match closely to the overall range of divergence found within 45 analyzed North American and European cases, but include some common relatively unique polymorphic features and preferred subtypes that appear to distinguish most but not all Indian strains from both those in Thailand and those outside range countries. Furthermore, more than half of the Indian cases studied here involved calves living within wild herds, whereas nearly all other cases identified in Asia so far represent rescued camp orphans or captive-born calves."
https://openalex.org/W2888422351,"Background Globally, anemia in pregnancy increases maternal, fetal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. According to 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey, 22% of pregnant women in Ethiopia were reported to be anemic. However, since the Ethiopian population is diverse with regard to culture, religion and other characteristics, this evidence may not represent the condition in our study area. So, we aimed to determine the prevalence of anemia and its associated factors among women receiving Antenatal Care (ANC) in Debre Berhan Town Hospitals and Clinics. Methods We conducted an institution based cross sectional study among women receiving ANC at hospitals and clinics in Debre Berhan Town, Ethiopia from September to November, 2013. Antenatal care providers in the respective health facilities collected the data by interview and observation using closed and open-ended questions. We computed frequencies and percentages to describe the data. We performed bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with anemia in pregnancy. STATA version 12 was used to carry out the analyses. Results A total of 295 participants completed the study, with a response rate of 89%. This study demonstrated a 10% prevalence of anemia out of which 64.3%, 32% and 4% of the respondents were with mild, moderate and severe anemia respectively. Anemia was statistically significantly associated with education and occupation. Conclusion The prevalence of anemia in our study area is lower than previous studies’ findings. Literacy and job status of the women were predictors of anemia in pregnancy. Since this study was conducted on women who had an opportunity to visit health facilities, it is more valuable to conduct community based research to better understand the problem in the study area and thus propose future deliverable."
https://openalex.org/W2888086751,"Jellyfish blooms are a significant environmental problem that is increasing and may be influenced by anthropocentric practices such as overfishing, pollution, eutrophication, translocation, climate change, and ocean acidification. Many jellyfish have unknown life cycles leading to these blooms. We describe for the first time, the life cycle of scyphozoan jellyfish Rhizostoma luteum from the planula to the young medusa stages, based on laboratory observations. We also provide a preliminary assessment of temperature related to life stages. Comparisons were made with early life history stages of its sibling species Rhizostoma pulmo and Rhizostoma octopus. The life cycle of R. luteum follows the general pattern of metagenesis of scyphozoans. Scyphistoma culture was maintained in filtered seawater at 17–17.5 °C, salinity 37 and light photoperiod (12:12 h light:dark). Scyphistomae were exposed to an experimental temperature descent for two days to test their survival capacity under severe winter conditions. Only one asexual reproduction mode was observed, which is employed for propagation, consisting of podocyst formation with excystment, subsequent development of scyphistoma, strobilation and liberation of viable ephyra. The development of the ephyra to metaephyra was photodocumented, reaching the metaephyra stage in approximately 21–25 days. Young medusae grow rapidly and maturity was reached after a 3-month post-liberation period with a mean bell diameter of 13.27 ± 2.26 cm and wet weight of 181.53 ± 53 g. The life cycle of R. luteum resembles that of its congeners, with the distinction that it has the unique features of being a brooding species (internal fertilisation with subsequent release of planulae) and under the conditions tested, the predominantly strobilation type observed was monodisc, and not polydisc as with the other two species in the genus Rhizostoma. As R. luteum shows sufficient requisite to form blooms if environmental circumstances change, it is important to understand its life cycle."

The oncogenic effects of v-Src have been intensively studied; however, its effects on chromosomal integrity are not fully understood. Here, using HeLa S3/v-Src cells having inducible v-Src expression, we found that v-Src causes mitotic slippage in addition to cytokinesis failure, even when the spindle assembly checkpoint is not satisfied because of the presence of microtubule-targeting agents. v-Src's effect on mitotic slippage was also observed in cells after a knockdown of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), a protein-tyrosine kinase that inhibits Src-family kinases and was partially inhibited by PP2, an Src-family kinase inhibitor. Proteomic analysis and in vitro kinase assay revealed that v-Src phosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) at Tyr-15. This phosphorylation attenuated Cdk1 kinase activity, resulting in a decrease in the phosphorylation of Cdk1 substrates. Furthermore, v-Src–induced mitotic slippage reduced the sensitivity of the cells to microtubule-targeting agents, and cells that survived the microtubule-targeting agents exhibited polyploidy. These results suggest that v-Src causes mitotic slippage by attenuating Cdk1 kinase activity via direct phosphorylation of Cdk1 at Tyr-15. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model for v-Src–induced oncogenesis, in which v-Src–promoted mitotic slippage due to Cdk1 phosphorylation generates genetic diversity via abnormal cell division of polyploid cells and also increases the tolerance of cancer cells to microtubule-targeting agents.

https://openalex.org/W2888268252,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for a large number of nosocomial infections. The P. aeruginosa respiratory chain contains the ion-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NQR). This enzyme couples the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone to the pumping of sodium ions across the cell membrane, generating a gradient that drives essential cellular processes in many bacteria. In this study, we characterized P. aeruginosa NQR (Pa-NQR) to elucidate its physiologic function. Our analyses reveal that Pa-NQR, in contrast with NQR homologues from other bacterial species, is not a sodium pump, but rather a completely new form of proton pump. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that cation selectivity could be determined by the exit ion channels. We also show that Pa-NQR is resistant to the inhibitor 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO). HQNO is a quinolone secreted by P. aeruginosa during infection that acts as a quorum sensing agent and also has bactericidal properties against other bacteria. Using comparative analysis and computational modeling of the ubiquinone-binding site, we identified the specific residues that confer resistance toward this inhibitor. In summary, our findings indicate that Pa-NQR is a proton pump rather than a sodium pump and is highly resistant against the P. aeruginosa–produced compound HQNO, suggesting an important role in the adaptation against autotoxicity. These results provide a deep understanding of the metabolic role of NQR in P. aeruginosa and provide insight into the structural factors that determine the functional specialization in this family of respiratory complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2888366874,"Introduction Cancer and other life-limiting non-communicable diseases are on the increase in Africa affecting younger populations frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims for ‘healthy life and wellbeing for all at all ages’, though there is a limited understanding of wellbeing particularly from patients’ and families’ perspectives in these populations. Palliative care is an approach which aims to improve the quality of life for patients and families affected by life-limiting disease, though access to palliative care has been described as an issue which is ‘largely ignored’ on the global health agenda. The aim of this Photovoice study was to explore patient and family perspectives of wellbeing and the contribution of palliative care following a diagnosis of advanced cancer in Blantyre, Malawi. Methods Between November 2016 and February 2017, 13 co-researchers (6 patients receiving palliative care for advanced cancer and 7 un-paid family caregivers) gathered photographs to depict aspects of their daily lives. Participatory analysis was conducted and an advocacy event (including photographic exhibits) held. Results Wellbeing was described as seeing improvements in the patients’ function facilitating inclusion in activities of daily living (including income generation) that had not previously been possible due to their illness. Family caregivers, neighbours and community members play a key role as ‘courage givers’ supported by health workers and religious groups, though discrimination in the form of social exclusion was also reported to be significant with patients expressing that they may be considered ‘prematurely dead’ in their community. Palliative care improves wellbeing by providing pain and symptom management enabling patients and / or family caregivers to return to household and income generating tasks. Through close interaction with households and ongoing counselling palliative care services assist to reduce fear and discrimination. Conclusions To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 for patients and families affected by life limiting illnesses in low resource settings, further understanding of the frequency and impact of discrimination is required as well as improved access to palliative care."

We also stratified the analyses into multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant (XDR-TB). Results Among 3,729 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 39% (n = 1,445) died. Of the patients that died, 53% (n = 766) were male, 68% (n = 982) had MDR-TB, 72% (n = 1,038) were HIV co-infected, and median age was 37 years (Interquartile Range [IQR] 30–46). Patients were at higher risk of mortality during DR-TB treatment if they were HIV co-infected not on antiretroviral treatment (ART) (adjusted incidence risk ratio [aIRR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9–3.8), were 60 years or older (aIRR 1.7, 95%CI 1.5–2.0), had a diagnosis of XDR-TB (aIRR 1.6, 95%CI 1.5–1.7), or had been hospitalised at treatment start (aIRR 1.7, 95%CI 1.5–1.8). Among MDR-TB patients, risk of mortality was higher if patients were HIV co-infected not on ART (aIRR 3.9, 95%CI 3.3–4.6), were 60 years or older (aIRR 1.9, 95%CI 1.6–2.3), or had been hospitalised at start of MDR-TB treatment (aIRR 1.7, 95%CI 1.5–1.9). Among XDR-TB patients, risk of mortality was higher in patients who were HIV co-infected not on ART (aIRR 1.8, 95%CI 1.5–2.2), or had been hospitalised at the start of XDR-TB treatment (aIRR 1.5, 95%CI 1.3–1.8). Conclusion HIV co-infected not on ART, older age, XDR-TB and hospital admission for DR-TB treatment were independent risk factors for DR-TB mortality. Integration of TB and HIV services, with focus on voluntary HIV testing and counselling of DR-TB patients with unknown HIV status, and provision of ART for all co-infected patients may reduce DR-TB mortality in the Eastern Cape."
https://openalex.org/W2888094041,"Fluid overload is one of the major characteristics and complications in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is related to fluid status and fluid distribution. The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between NT-proBNP and fluid status in adverse clinical outcomes of late stages of CKD.We enrolled 239 patients with CKD stages 4-5 from January 2011 to December 2011 and followed up until June 2017. Fluid status was presented as hydration status (HS) value measured by body composition monitor, while HS>7% was defined as fluid overload. Clinical outcomes included renal outcomes (commencing dialysis and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline>3 ml/min/1.73 m2/year), all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs).During a mean follow-up of 3.3±2.0 years, 129(54.7%) patients commenced dialysis, 88(37.3%) patients presented rapid renal function decline, and 48(20.3%) had MACEs or died. All patients were stratified by HS of 7% and the median of plasma NT-proBNP. The adjusted risks for commencing dialysis was significantly higher in patients with high plasma NT-proBNP and HS>7% compared to those with low plasma NT-proBNP and HS≦7%. There was a significant interaction between plasma NT-proBNP and HS in commencing dialysis (P-interaction = 0.047). Besides, patients with high plasma NT-proBNP and HS>7% had greater risks for MACEs or all-cause mortality than others with either high plasma NT-proBNP or HS>7%.NT-proBNP and fluid overload might have a synergistic association of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with late stages of CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2888148158,"The mealybug, Phenacoccus manihoti, is a leading pest of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), damaging this crop globally. Although the biological control of this mealybug using natural predators has been established, resistance breeding remains an important means of control. Understanding plant responses to insect herbivory, by determining and identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), is a vital step towards the understanding of molecular mechanisms of defence responses in plants and the development of resistant cultivars by gene editing. Morphological and molecular analysis confirmed the mealybug identity as Phenacoccus manihoti (Matile-Ferrero). The transcriptome response of the green mite resistant cassava genotype AR23.1 was compared to P40/1 with no known resistance at 24 and 72 hours of mealybug infestation compared to non-infested mock. A total of 301 and 206 genes were differentially expressed at 24 and 72 of mealybug infestation for AR23.1 and P40/1 genotypes respectively, using a log2 fold change and P-value ≤ 0.05. Gene ontology functional classification revealed an enrichment of genes in the secondary metabolic process category in AR23.1 in comparison with P40/1, while genes in the regulation of molecular function, cellular component biogenesis and electron carrier categories were more significantly enriched in P40/1 than in AR23.1. Biological pathway analysis, based on KEGG, revealed a significant enrichment of plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormonal signal transduction pathways for a cohort of up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs in both genotypes. Defence-related genes such as 2-oxogluterate, gibberellin oxidase and terpene synthase proteins were only induced in genotype AR23.1 and not in P40/1, and subsequently validated by RT-qPCR. The study revealed a difference in response to mealybug infestation in the two genotypes studied, with AR23.1 showing a higher number of differentially expressed transcripts post mealybug infestation at 24 and 72 hours. Candidate defence-related genes that were overexpressed in the AR23.1 genotype post mealybug infestation will be useful in future functional studies towards the control of mealybugs."
https://openalex.org/W2888683948,"Centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack.) is a perennial, warm-season C4 grass species that shows great potential for use as a low-maintenance turfgrass species in tropical and subtropical regions. However, limited genetic and genomic information is available for this species, which has impeded systematic studies on the enhancement of its turf quality and resistance against biotic and abiotic stress. In this study, Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to generate centipedegrass transcriptome sequences. A total of 352,513 assembled sequences were used to search for simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci, and 64,470 SSR loci were detected in 47,638 SSR containing sequences. The tri-nucleotides were the most frequent repeat motif, followed by di-nucleotides, tetra-nucleotides hexnucleotides, and pentanucleotides. A total of 48,061 primer pairs were successfully designed in the flanking sequences of the SSRs, and 100 sets of primers were randomly selected for the initial validation in four centipedegrass accessions. In total, 56 (56.0%) of the 100 primer pairs tested successfully amplified alleles from all four centipedegrass accessions, while 50 were identified as polymorphic markers and were then used to assess the level of genetic diversity among 43 centipedegrass core collections. The genetic diversity analysis exhibited that the number of alleles (Na) per locus ranged from 3 to 13, and the observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.17 to 0.83. The polymorphism information content (PIC) value of the markers ranged from 0.15 to 0.78, and the genetic distances (coefficient Nei72) between the accessions varied from 0.07 to 0.48. The UPGMA-based dendrogram clustered all 43 core collections into two main groups and six subgroups, which further validated the effectiveness of these newly developed SSR markers. Hence, these newly developed SSR markers will be valuable and potentially useful for future genetic and genomic studies of E. ophiuroides."
https://openalex.org/W2888201290,"Objective Biomechanics for rupture risk prediction in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are gaining popularity. However, their clinical applicability is still doubtful as there is lack of standardization. This study evaluates the added value of biomechanical indices in rupture risk assessment. Methods This study included 175 asymptomatic, 11 sAAA and 45 ruptured aneurysms. 3D-geometries were reconstructed using computer tomography angiographies. Subsequently, finite element models were made to calculate peak wall stress (PWS), peak wall rupture index (PWRI) and the rupture risk equivalent diameter (RRED). The indices were determined with a dedicated software to facilitate standardization. Results SAAAs showed a trend towards higher PWS, PWRI and RRED compared to asymptomatic AAAs, but PWS (22.0±5.8 vs. 33.4±15.8 N/cm2), PWRI (0.52±0.2 vs. 1.01±0.64), and RRED (65±60 vs. 98±51 mm) were significantly (p = 0.001) higher in ruptured. However, after diameter-matching no significant differences were seen. The ROC-curves for the maximum diameter and all biomechanical indices were similar but it slightly increased when diameter and biomechanical indices were combined. Conclusions This study showed no added value for biomechanical indices in AAA rupture risk assessment. Additionally, the difficulty of such an assessment increases. However, as symptomatic aneurysms show a trend towards higher biomechanical indices with similar diameters the indices may provide information about aneurysm growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W2888614983,"EUS-guided rendezvous technique (EUS-RV) is an effective salvage technique for failed biliary cannulation during ERCP. However, it is still difficult to achieve cannulation in some cases, especially using the intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) approach, which requires complicated guidewire manipulation. EUS-hybrid rendezvous technique (HRV) has been applied as a salvage technique for difficult guidewire placement during EUS-RV with IHBD approach. The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EUS-HRV using a retrospective study. Database analysis revealed 29 patients who underwent EUS-RV for difficult biliary cannulation. Among them, 8 patients underwent EUS-HRV as a salvage technique for difficult guidewire placement during EUS-RV with the IHBD approach. In EUS-HRV, a 6-French dilator was advanced into the biliary system for better guidewire manipulation. After successful guidewire placement, the EUS scope was exchanged for a duodenoscope, keeping the guidewire and dilator in place. The EUS-placed guidewire was retrieved through the duodenoscope, followed by cannulation over the guidewire. The dilator remained at the fistula until completion of the procedure. The analysis showed that the guidewire placement and the subsequent scope exchange and deep biliary cannulation after the retrieval of the EUS-placed guidewire were successfully conducted for all 8 patients. Mild pancreatitis was recognized as an adverse event in 1 patient. The overall success rate of EUS-RV combined with EUS-HRV was improved up to 90% (26/29). Our results suggested that EUS-HRV can be an effective and safe salvage technique in cases wherein guidewire placement is difficult during EUS-RV with IHBD approach."
https://openalex.org/W2888507442,"Intravaginal rings (IVRs) can deliver antiretroviral (ARV) agents for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), theoretically overcoming adherence concerns associated with frequent dosing. However, topical vaginal ARV drug delivery has not simultaneously led to sufficient rectal drug exposure to likely protect from HIV infection as a result of receptive anal intercourse (RAI). Unprotected RAI has a higher risk of infection per sex act and, for women, also can be associated with vaginal exposure during a single sexual encounter, especially in higher-risk subsets of women. The physiologically inflamed, activated, immune-cell dense colorectal mucosa is increasingly appreciated as the sexual compartment with highly significant risk; this risk is increased in the setting of co-infections. Ex vivo studies have shown that colorectal tissue and rectal fluid concentrations correlated with HIV protection. Given these important results, efforts to document colorectal compartment ARV drug concentration from pod-IVR delivery was assessed to determine if vaginal application could provide protective ARV levels in both compartments.A crossover clinical trial (N = 6) evaluated 7 d of continuous TDF pod-IVR use, a wash-out phase, followed by 7 d with a TDF-FTC pod-IVR. A subsequent clinical trial (N = 6) consisted of 7 d of continuous TDF-FTC-MVC pod-IVR use. Rectal fluids were collected on Day 7 at IVR removal in all three ARV-exposures (two Phase 1 trials) and drug concentrations quantified by LC-MS/MS. Median rectal fluid concentrations of TFV, the hydrolysis product of the prodrug TDF, were between 0.66 ng mg-1 (TDF pod-IVR group) and 1.11 ng mg-1 (TDF-FTC pod-IVR group), but below the analytical lower limit of quantitation in 5/6 samples in the TDF-FTC-MVC pod-IVR group. Unexpectedly, median FTC (TDF-FTC pod-IVR, 20.3 ng mg-1; TDF-FTC-MVC pod-IVR, 0.18 ng mg-1), and MVC rectal fluid concentrations (0.84 ng mg-1) were quantifiable and higher than their respective in vitro EC50 values in most samples. Due to participant burden in these exploratory trials, rectal fluid was used as a surrogate for rectal tissue, where drug concentrations are expected to be higher.The concentrations of FTC and MVC in rectal fluids obtained in two exploratory clinical trials of IVRs delivering ARV combinations exceeded levels associated with in vitro efficacy in HIV inhibition. Unexpectedly, MVC appeared to depress the distribution of TFV and FTC into the rectal lumen. Here we show that vaginal delivery of ARV combinations may provide adherence and coitally independent dual-compartment protection from HIV infection during both vaginal and receptive anal intercourse."
https://openalex.org/W2888079639,"Bacillus cereus strain G9241 was isolated from a patient with pneumonia who had an anthrax-like illness. Like Bacillus anthracis, the virulence of G9241 is dependent on two large plasmids. In G9241 those plasmids are pBCXO1 and pBC210. There is a multi-gene capsule locus on each of these virulence plasmids, and both capsules are produced by G9241 in vitro and in mice. The hasACB operon on pBCXO1 is responsible for production of a hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule. The locus on pBC210 encodes a putative tetrasaccharide (TS) capsule that assembles in a Wzy-dependent manner. We found that the pBC210 capsule locus is transcribed as two operons and identified the promoter regions responsible for transcription. We constructed isogenic mutants to assess the role of genes in the two TS capsule operons in production of the capsule. Spores of strains deficient in production of either the HA or TS capsule were inoculated subcutaneously or intranasally into A/J and C57BL/6 mice to determine the lethal dose 50% of each bacterial mutant by each route of infection. The loss of the HA capsule attenuated G9241 more than the loss of the TS capsule for both infection routes in both mouse strains. Overall, our data further characterize the unique TS capsule on pBC210 and demonstrate that the two capsules do not have the same impact on virulence of G9241."

Teaching these disciplines in a Bachelor’s Degree in Medicine is a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to describe two participatory teaching methods used in a yearlong second-year course that includes both Epidemiology and Statistics, and to analyze how these two methodologies affect the students’ perception of the course and their abilities related to these subjects. Both methodologies consist in carrying out a specific practical activity. The first practical activity is carried out using a website and aims to help students understand concepts and interpret information; the second involves analyzing a database using a statistical package and, subsequently, producing a scientific report. In addition, we prepared a questionnaire to find out the students’ perception of these issues. The nine questionnaire items were assessed using a rating scale and adapted to characteristics of the course, which covers Epidemiology and Statistics in an integrated manner. Then we assessed the differences in perception before and after the activities were carried out. The results show that the students’ perception improved significantly in the following items: “importance of Statistics and Epidemiology in Medicine”; “usefulness in clinical practice”; “understanding concepts”; “ability to perform a statistical analysis”; and “ability to sort data”. The difference was not significant in the remaining four items. In conclusion, the students’ perception of their ability in Statistics and Epidemiology significantly improved after completing the practical activities, and their perception of importance and usefulness of these subjects also improved."
https://openalex.org/W2888435715,"Characterization of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and the impact of the major identified allelic variants on the activity of one of the most dominating drug-metabolising enzymes is essential to increase drug safety and avoid adverse reactions. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to capture the dynamic signatures of this complex enzyme and five allelic variants with diverse enzymatic activity. In addition to the apo simulations, three substrates (bufuralol, veliparib and tamoxifen) and two inhibitors (prinomastat and quinidine) were included to explore their influence on the structure and dynamical features of the enzyme. Our results indicate that the altered enzyme activity can be attributed to changes in the hydrogen bonding network within the active site, and local structural differences in flexibility, position and shape of the binding pocket. In particular, the increased (CYP2D6*53) or the decreased (CYP2D6*17) activity seems to be related to a change in dynamics of mainly the BC loop due to a modified hydrogen bonding network around this region. In addition, the smallest active site volume was found for CYP2D6*4 (no activity). CYP2D6*2 (normal activity) showed no major differences in dynamic behaviour compared to the wild-type."

Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the impact of visceral fat area on postoperative short-term outcome and surgical characteristics. We analyzed 95 patients, who underwent intestinal resection for symptomatic Crohn's disease at an academic tertiary referral center between 2003 and 2008. Visceral fat area was measured on preoperative computed tomography scans. Postoperative morbidity was graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Visceral fat area was correlated with baseline characteristics, disease phenotype and 30-day morbidity. Body mass index and age were significantly associated with a higher visceral fat area (p = 0.001). Overall 19 (20.0%) postoperative complications were observed, of whom 7 (7.4%) patients required surgical re-intervention. No significant difference was found with regard to visceral fat area between patients with an uneventful and eventful postoperative course (no complications: median visceral fat area 52.0 cm2 SD 59.7, complications: 41.3 cm2 SD 42.8; p = 0.465). In contrast to current literature, we cannot support the role of visceral fat area for predicting postoperative course in Crohn's disease. In addition, no correlation of the visceral fat area and disease behavior was detected."

Adipose tissue content of TFAs is a biomarker of TFA intake and metabolism. Objective We investigated the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) associated with the adipose tissue content of total 18:1t, isomers of 18:1t (18:1 Δ6-10t and 18:1 Δ11t) and 18:2 Δ9c, 11t. Methods A case-cohort study, nested within the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort (n = 57,053), was conducted, which included a random sample (n = 3156) of the total cohort and all incident MI cases (n = 2148) during follow-up (14 years). Information on MI cases was obtained by linkage with nationwide registers and validated. Adipose tissue was taken from the participants buttocks and the fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography. Results Women with higher adipose tissue content of total 18:1t had a 57% higher MI rate (quintiles 5 versus 1, hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.12–2.20; P-trend = 0.011) and women with higher content of 18:1 Δ6-10t had a 76% higher MI rate (quintiles 5 versus 1, hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.23–2.51; P-trend = 0.002). No association between 18:1 Δ11t content and MI rate was observed. In men, no associations between adipose tissue content of total 18:1t and 18:1 Δ6-10t and MI rate were observed. However, men with higher content of 18:1 Δ11t had a 48% higher MI rate (quintiles 5 versus 1, hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–1.86; P-trend = 0.003). Adipose tissue content of 18:2 Δ9c, 11t was not associated with MI rate in women or men. Conclusions Adipose tissue content of 18:2 Δ9c, 11t was not associated with MI rate in women or men, whereas higher contents of isomers of 18:1t were associated with higher MI rates but the associations for individual 18:1t isomers differed, however, in women and men."
https://openalex.org/W2888419235,"A new isolate of the Spodoptera frugiperda granulovirus, SfGV ARG, was completely sequenced and analyzed. The SfGV ARG genome is 139,812 bp long and encodes 151 putative open reading frames. Of these ORFs, 56 were found in betabaculoviruses, 19 of which are present only in GVs closely related to SfGV. Seven ORFs found homologs in this small GV group and also in noctuid NPVs. ORF066 codes a 74 amino acid protein, overlapped with nudix gene, with several homologs in baculovirus, found by tblastn search. Comparison with the genome of the Colombian isolate SfGV VG008 resulted in SfGV being 1101 bp smaller and lacking a homologue of VG008 ORF084, which codes for Lef-7. However, we found that ORF051 shows remote homology to Lef-7 proteins. Moreover, analysis of ORF051 along with Lef-7 proteins coded by a group of noctuid specific GVs and NPVs indicated that Lef-7 proteins coded by these viruses include three F-box domains in contrast to the single one reported for AcMNPV Lef-7. SfGV ARG genome also contains a split photolyase as a distinct feature not found in VG008. BlastX analysis revealed that a complete photolyase is coded considering a putative frameshift in a poly-A tract, which resembles known slippery sequences involved in programmed ribosome frameshifting."

Sample Twenty-four women were included in this study: eight with vulvovaginal candidiasis, eight with cytolytic vaginosis and eight with no vaginal infections or dysbiosis (control group). Methods The lipid profile in vaginal discharge of the different study groups was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and further analyzed with MetaboAnalyst 3.0 platform. Main outcome measures Vaginal lipids concentration and its correlation with vulvovaginal candidiasis and cytolytic vaginosis. Results PCA, PLS-DA and hierarchical clustering analyses indicated 38 potential lipid biomarkers for the different groups, correlating with oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and integrity of the vaginal epithelial tissue. Among these, greater concentrations were found for Glycochenodeoxycholic acid-7-sulfate, O-adipoylcarnitine, 1-eicosyl-2-heptadecanoyl-glycero-3-phosphoserine, undecanoic acid, formyl dodecanoate and lipoic acid in the vulvovaginal candidiasis group; N–(tetradecanoyl)-sphinganine, DL-PPMP, 1-oleoyl-cyclic phosphatidic, palmitic acid and 5-aminopentanoic acid in the cytolytic vaginosis group; and 1-nonadecanoyl-glycero-3-phosphate, eicosadienoic acid, 1-stearoyl-cyclic-phosphatidic acid, 1-(9Z,12Z-heptadecadienoyl)-glycero-3-phosphate, formyl 9Z-tetradecenoate and 7Z,10Z-hexadecadienoic acid in the control group. Conclusions Lipids related to oxidative stress and apoptosis were found in higher concentrations in women with vulvovaginal candidiasis and cytolytic vaginosis, while lipids related to epithelial tissue integrity were more pronounced in the control group. Furthermore, in women with cytolytic vaginosis, we observed higher concentrations of lipids related to bacterial overgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2888682458,"Protein trafficking in the endosomal system involves the recognition of specific signals within the cytoplasmic domains (CDs) of transmembrane proteins by clathrin adaptors. One such signal is the phosphoserine acidic cluster (PSAC), the prototype of which is in the endoprotease furin. How PSACs are recognized by clathrin adaptors has been controversial. We reported previously that HIV-1 Vpu, which modulates cellular immunoreceptors, contains a PSAC that binds to the μ subunits of clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes. Here, we show that the CD of furin binds the μ subunits of AP-1 and AP-2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Moreover, we identify a potential PSAC in a cytoplasmic loop of the cellular transmembrane Serinc3, an inhibitor of the infectivity of retroviruses. The two serines within the PSAC of Serinc3 are phosphorylated by casein kinase II and mediate interaction with the μ subunits in vitro. The sites of these serines vary among mammals in a manner suggesting host–pathogen conflict, yet the Serinc3 PSAC seems dispensable for anti-HIV activity and for counteraction by HIV-1 Nef. The CDs of Vpu and furin and the PSAC-containing loop of Serinc3 each bind the μ subunit of AP-2 (μ2) with similar affinities, but they appear to utilize different basic regions on μ2. The Serinc3 loop requires a region previously reported to bind the acidic plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. These data suggest that the PSACs within different proteins recognize different basic regions on the μ surface, providing the potential to inhibit the activity of viral proteins without necessarily affecting cellular protein trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2888617857,"Web service has become irreplaceable for service-oriented application in both academia and industry in recent years. Quality of Service (QoS) is used to describe the nonfunctional characteristics of Web service. Identifying Web service QoS is crucial for service-oriented application designers because service users may obtain very different QoS performance of the same service in the client-side due to dynamic changes of Internet environment as well as user context. However, evaluating QoS performance of a large scale of Web services requires considerable time and resources in real-world. Existing methods can make a personalized prediction for average QoS values by employing historical data but fail to take into consideration the fluctuation feature of Web service QoS values. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for personalized QoS prediction of dynamic Web Services. First, a novel approach is used to extract feature points of QoS sequences and dynamic time warping distance is used to compute the similarity instead of Euclidean distance. By finding the most similar QoS sequences of the target QoS sequence, the missing QoS values can be predicted without extra Web services invoking. To validate our method, we conduct a large number of experiments based on real-world Web service QoS data set. The experimental studies show that our method has higher accuracy rate compared with the existing methods."

World Health Organization has called for increased operational research to evaluate HIV care processes particularly linkage to care. In this paper, we present project results of the time taken to link newly identified PLHIV to care after HHTC in the Manicaland and Midlands provinces of Zimbabwe.We retrospectively reviewed community-facility referral data from the Zimbabwe HIV Care and Treatment project for newly diagnosed PLHIV for the period March-September 2016. A referral slip was given to a client after receiving a positive HIV results and was presented and filed upon reaching a health facility. In July 2016, the project started working with trained expert clients to assist with linkage to care. Data was entered in a spreadsheet and then imported for descriptive statistical analysis with EpiInfoTM Version 7.2.0.1. Odd ratios were used to identify factors associated with linkage to care within seven days.Out of 1004 newly identified PLHIV between March and September 2016, 650 (64.7%) were linked to care. The median time taken to be linked to care was four days (Interquartile range 19 days). Overall, 63.1% (410) of PLHIV were linked to care within seven days of diagnosis and 85% within 30 days. PLHIV were more likely to be linked to care within seven days of diagnosis between July and September 2016 (OR = 4.1; p< 0.001), a period when ZHCT started working with expert clients to support linkage to care.HHTC resulted in almost 63% of newly diagnosed PLHIV being linked into care within seven days, and 85% within 30 days. Linkage to care within seven days was significantly associated with the period of engaging expert clients in the project. We recommend community based HIV testing programs to work with expert clients to ensure timely linkages of new PLHIV."

There was a significant increase in the ratio of the luminal to choroidal area in the macular area (67.2%) and in the peripapillary area (59.1%). Factors associated with the changes in the peripapillary choroidal area included decreases in the diastolic blood pressure and IOP.A reduction in the IOP after trabeculectomy led to increases in the macular and peripapillary choroidal areas. Observed changes in the choroidal area after trabeculectomy are primarily due to increases in the luminal areas."

Integrating information on species' traits can refine detectability models, and might be particularly valuable if these traits can help improve estimates of detectability where data on particular species are rare. Analysing data collected during line transect distance sampling surveys in Indonesia, we used a multi-species hierarchical distance sampling model to evaluate how plant height, leaf size, leaf shape, and survey location influenced plant species detectability in secondary tropical rainforests. Detectability of the exotic plant species increased with plant height and leaf size. Detectability varied among the different survey locations. We failed to detect a clear effect of leaf shape on detectability. This study indicates that information on traits might improve predictions about exotic species detection, which can then be used to optimise the allocation of search effort for efficient species management. The innovation of the study lies in the multi-species distance sampling model, where the distance-detection function depends on leaf traits and height. The method can be applied elsewhere, including for different traits that may be relevant in other contexts. Trait-based multispecies distance sampling can be a practical approach for sampling exotic shrubs, herbs, or grasses species in the understorey of tropical forests."
https://openalex.org/W2887998936,"In this study, we investigated the effects of resistance training (RT), caloric restriction (CR), and the association of both interventions in aortic vascular reactivity and morphological alterations, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity, insulin resistance and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in ovariectomized rats. Fifty female Holtzman rats were subjected to ovariectomy and Sham surgery and distributed into the following groups: Sham-sedentary, ovariectomized-sedentary, ovariectomized-resistance training, ovariectomized-caloric restriction, and ovariectomized-resistance training and caloric restriction groups. RT and 30% CR protocols were performed for 13 weeks. Analyses were conducted to evaluate the following: acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation of aortic rings, MMP-2 activity, insulin tolerance test, highlighting of the aorta wall cross-sectional area by hematoxylin-eosin stain, aorta vessel remodeling and SBP. We observed that ovariectomy decreased the potency of dependent and independent endothelium relaxation and MMP-2 activity, prevented insulin resistance, promoted aorta vessel remodeling in the cross-sectional area, and promoted the media-to-lumen ratio, the collagen content, and the alteration of the structure and elastic fibers of the vessel. The effects of the ovariectomy could contribute to SBP increases. However, the association of exercise and diet improved the relaxation potency in dependent and independent endothelium relaxation, elevated MMP-2 activity, ameliorate insulin sensitivity, increased the aorta cross-sectional area and media-to-lumen ratio, decreased collagen content and promoted histological parameters of the aorta vessel wall, preventing the increase of SBP.Our study revealed that the RT and CR separately, and even associatively, improved vascular function, activated MMP-2, and produced a beneficial hypertrophic remodeling, preventing the elevation of SBP in ovariectomized rats."
https://openalex.org/W2888186659,"Armed conflict, natural disaster, and forced displacement affect millions of children each year. Such humanitarian crises increase the risk of family separation, erode existing support networks, and often result in economic loss, increasing children's vulnerability to violence, exploitation, neglect, and abuse. Research is needed to understand these risks and vulnerabilities and guide donor investment towards the most effective interventions for improving the well-being of children in humanitarian contexts.The Assessment, Measurement & Evidence (AME) Working Group of the Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action (ACPHA) identified experts to participate in a research priority setting exercise adapted from the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI). Experts individually identified key areas for research investment which were subsequently ranked by participants using a Likert scale. Research Priority Scores (RPS) and Average Expert Agreement (AEA) were calculated for each identified research topic, the top fifteen of which are presented within this paper.Intervention research, which aims to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of standard child protection activities in humanitarian settings, ranked highly. Child labor was a key area of sector research with two of the top ten priorities examining the practice. Respondents also prioritized research efforts to understand how best to bridge humanitarian and development efforts for child protection as well as identifying most effective way to build the capacity of local systems in order to sustain child protection gains after a crisis.Rigorous, scientific research that assesses the scope of child protection risks, examines the effectiveness of interventions to improve child well-being, and translates evidence to practice is critical. Findings from this research priority setting exercise offer guidance for a global research agenda on child protection in humanitarian settings, encouraging cooperation among donors, implementers, and academics to pursue a coordinated approach to evidence generation."
https://openalex.org/W2888395665,"Marine ecosystems can be modified and shaped by irregular interannual variations in oceanic current patterns and temperatures, such as El Niño and La Niña. These large scale oceanic events have also been shown to influence environmental stressors such as invasive marine species (IMS). Our study indicates that there is a causative link between these climatic events, and atypical detections of native and IMS. Significant La Niña events between 1970 and 2014 were associated with sightings of tropical crab species in temperate waters following a lag period of 18-24 months from the onset of the event. We identified a total of 72 records of six tropical portunid crabs species (from both Charybdis and Scylla) in temperate waters of south-western Australia following these La Niña events, based on reports in published scientific literature, grey literature and museum records, as well as citizen science networks such as FishWatch and PestWatch apps. We suggest that La Niña conditions facilitated transportation and temporary establishment of crab larvae from their native tropical habitat to temperate regions. As the strength of La Niña events is likely to increase into the future due to the escalating effects of climate change, it is likely that there will be a growth in associated atypical establishment events of IMS. Consequently, biosecurity managers will need to reprioritise resources in order to accommodate the potential impacts of these large scale oceanic events as part of their surveillance programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2888035682,"Salmonella enterica serovar Napoli (serovar Napoli) is an emerging cause of human salmonellosis in Northern Italy. No specific reservoirs of serovar Napoli have been identified in Italy, so far. However, the environment, especially surface waters, has been hypothesized as an important source of infection based on the observation that genotypically different clusters of serovar Napoli are detected in different geographical macro-areas. To further support the hypothesis of a spatially-restricted pattern of serovar Napoli diffusion, a spatial segregation of serovar Napoli lineages should be observed also at smaller geographical scale. However, classical genotyping techniques used for Salmonella, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), did not possess enough discriminatory power to highlight spatial clustering of serovar Napoli within the macro-areas. To this purpose, we performed phylogeographical analyses based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms to test whether spatio-temporal evolution patterns of serovar Napoli in Northern Italy could be recognized with high geographical resolution, i.e. at local level. Specifically, we analyzed the local spread of the main PFGE clonal group, responsible for more than 60% of human infections in the study area, that did not show any geographical differentiation by PFGE within Northern Italy, i.e. the macro-area considered in the study. Both discrete and continuous phylogeography highlighted the existence of two main geographically-restricted clades: a Southern clade corresponding to the Po Valley and a Northern clade corresponding to the Pre-Alps area. Furthermore, the phylogeographical analyses suggested that the most probable site of origin of the clone was in an area of the Po Valley at the confluence of the Po and Ticino rivers, one of the most important Italian wetlands. These findings provide further support to the hypothesis that environmental transmission may play an important role in the ecology of serovar Napoli."
https://openalex.org/W2888598500,"Given that Chinese materia medica (CMM) is expensive and rare, people take tremendous risk to adulterate and falsify Cordyceps sinensis with counterfeit species with similar morphological features. It is thus essential to develop new methods to identify the authenticity of Cordyceps sinensis. It is hypothesized in this study that Cordyceps sinensis possesses certain protein biomarkers distinct from its counterfeits, which can be identified by proteomic technologies for authentication purposes. This is the first study that aims to optimize the conditions for extracting proteins from Cordyceps sinensis, a hybrid of fungal-animal CMM, and to compare the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) profiles between different Cordyceps species. Two different protein extraction buffer systems, namely, phenol/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer or lysis buffer, were evaluated, where the preparation using lysis buffer yielded better protein content. The results also showed that extraction with lysis buffer without pre- or post-washing of samples was the most effective protocol, with over 220% of protein yield and 819 protein spots detected on a 2-DE gel. Moreover, the results demonstrated that Cordyceps sinensis possesses protein biomarkers distinct from its counterfeits, and these biomarkers are not source- or origin-dependent, strongly supporting the feasibility of using identified biomarkers as indicators for authentication of Cordyceps species. The findings of this study warrant further investigations on the structural identification of protein biomarkers of Cordyceps species."
https://openalex.org/W2888692960,"Dental mesowear analysis can classify the diets of extant herbivores into general categories such as grazers, mixed-feeders, and browsers by using the gross wear patterns found on individual teeth. This wear presumably results from both abrasion (food-on-tooth wear) and attrition (tooth-on-tooth wear) of individual teeth. Mesowear analyses on extinct ungulates have helped generate hypotheses regarding the dietary ecology of mammals across space and time, and recent developments have expanded the use of dental mesowear analysis to herbivorous marsupial taxa including kangaroos, wombats, possums, koalas, and relatives. However, the diet of some of the most ubiquitous kangaroos (e.g., Macropus giganteus) along with numerous other species cannot be successfully classified by dental mesowear analysis. Further, it is not well understood whether climate variables (including precipitation, relative humidity, and temperature) are correlated with dental mesowear variables including various measures of shape and relief. Here, we examine the relationship between dental mesowear variables (including traditional methods scoring the sharpest cusp and a new potential assessment of multiple cusps) and climate variables in the grazers/mixed feeders Macropus giganteus and Macropus fuliginosus, and the obligate browser Phascolarctos cinereus. We find that dental mesowear of mandibular teeth is capable of differentiating the dietary habits of koalas and the kangaroo species. Furthermore, both Macropus giganteus and Phascolarctos cinereus exhibit mesowear correlated with mean minimum temperature, while Macropus fuliginosus dental mesowear is unaffected by temperature, despite significant differences in mean minimum and mean maximum temperature across their distribution (and in the specimens examined here). Contrary to expectations that individuals from drier regions would have blunter and lower relief teeth, dental mesowear is unrelated to proxies of relative aridity—including mean annual precipitation and relative humidity. Collectively, dental mesowear in these marsupials is related to feeding behavior with increased wear in cooler regions (in Macropus giganteus and Phascolarctos cinereus) potentially related to more or different food resources consumed."
https://openalex.org/W2888412610,"To quantify standard values of the discus interpubicus in healthy subjects and to determine reliability and repeatability using T2 relaxation time measurements at 3T.20 asymptomatic participants (10 male, 10 female; mean age: 27.3 years ±4.1, BMI: 22.2 ±1.8) underwent a 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the pelvic region in a supine position. We included sagittal and para-axial T2w sequences centred over the pubic symphysis in order to identify the complete discus interpubicus. For quantitative analysis, a multi-echo Turbo Spin Echo (TSE) sequence (including 12 echo times between 6.4 and 76.8 ms) was acquired and analysed by using an in-house developed quantification plugin tool (qMapIt) extending ImageJ. Two readers in consensus defined three central slices of the pubic symphysis with the greatest length. For each slice, both readers separately placed three regions-of-interest (ROI) covering the whole discus interpubicus. Both readers repeated the ROI placements in identical fashion after a four-week interval on the original MRI images. Statistical analysis included intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), nonparametric Wilcoxon test, Fisher exact test and mean relaxation time in ms and 95% confidence intervals.T2 relaxation time analysis was performed for all 20 participants. In total, a mean relaxation time of all analysed segments for both observers was 48.6 (±6.3 ms), with a mean relaxation time for observer 1 of 48.7 (±6.0 ms) and for observer 2 of 48.5 ms (±6.6ms). The calculated ICC comparing inter- and intrarater reproducibility was excellent in all segments (≥0.75).T2 mapping of the discus interpubicus demonstrates good inter- and intrarater repeatability as well as reliability. Mean relaxation times were calculated with 48.6ms in healthy volunteers."
https://openalex.org/W2888711832,"Data mining and search-based algorithms have been applied to various problems due to their power and performance. There have been several studies on the use of these algorithms for refactoring. In this paper, we show how search based algorithms can be used for sequence diagram refactoring. We also show how a hybridized algorithm of Kmeans and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms can aid each other in solving sequence diagram refactoring. Results show that search based algorithms can be used successfully in refactoring sequence diagram on small and large case studies. In addition, the hybridized algorithm obtains good results using selected quality metrics. Detailed insights on the experiments on sequence diagram refactoring reveal that the limitations of SA can be addressed by hybridizing the Kmeans algorithm to the SA algorithm."
