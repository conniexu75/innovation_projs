https://openalex.org/W2119975980,"Prostate epithelial cells from both normal and cancer tissues, grown in three-dimensional (3D) culture as spheroids, represent promising in vitro models for the study of normal and cancer-relevant patterns of epithelial differentiation. We have developed the most comprehensive panel of miniaturized prostate cell culture models in 3D to date (n = 29), including many non-transformed and most currently available classic prostate cancer (PrCa) cell lines. The purpose of this study was to analyze morphogenetic properties of PrCa models in 3D, to compare phenotypes, gene expression and metabolism between 2D and 3D cultures, and to evaluate their relevance for pre-clinical drug discovery, disease modeling and basic research. Primary and non-transformed prostate epithelial cells, but also several PrCa lines, formed well-differentiated round spheroids. These showed strong cell-cell contacts, epithelial polarization, a hollow lumen and were covered by a complete basal lamina (BL). Most PrCa lines, however, formed large, poorly differentiated spheroids, or aggressively invading structures. In PC-3 and PC-3M cells, well-differentiated spheroids formed, which were then spontaneously transformed into highly invasive cells. These cell lines may have previously undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is temporarily suppressed in favor of epithelial maturation by signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM). The induction of lipid and steroid metabolism, epigenetic reprogramming, and ECM remodeling represents a general adaptation to 3D culture, regardless of transformation and phenotype. In contrast, PI3-Kinase, AKT, STAT/interferon and integrin signaling pathways were particularly activated in invasive cells. Specific small molecule inhibitors targeted against PI3-Kinase blocked invasive cell growth more effectively in 3D than in 2D monolayer culture, or the growth of normal cells. Our panel of cell models, spanning a wide spectrum of phenotypic plasticity, supports the investigation of different modes of cell migration and tumor morphologies, and will be useful for predictive testing of anti-cancer and anti-metastatic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2134435470,"In vivo GITR ligation has previously been shown to augment T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, yet the underlying mechanisms of this activity, particularly its in vivo effects on CD4+ foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), have not been fully elucidated. In order to translate this immunotherapeutic approach to the clinic it is important gain better understanding of its mechanism(s) of action. Utilizing the agonist anti-GITR monoclonal antibody DTA-1, we found that in vivo GITR ligation modulates regulatory T cells (Tregs) directly during induction of melanoma tumor immunity. As a monotherapy, DTA-1 induced regression of small established B16 melanoma tumors. Although DTA-1 did not alter systemic Treg frequencies nor abrogate the intrinsic suppressive activity of Tregs within the tumor-draining lymph node, intra-tumor Treg accumulation was significantly impaired. This resulted in a greater Teff:Treg ratio and enhanced tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell activity. The decreased intra-tumor Treg accumulation was due both to impaired infiltration, coupled with DTA-1-induced loss of foxp3 expression in intra-tumor Tregs. Histological analysis of B16 tumors grown in Foxp3-GFP mice showed that the majority of GFP+ cells had lost Foxp3 expression. These ""unstable"" Tregs were absent in IgG-treated tumors and in DTA-1 treated TDLN, demonstrating a tumor-specific effect. Impairment of Treg infiltration was lost if Tregs were GITR(-/-), and the protective effects of DTA-1 were reduced in reconstituted RAG1(-/-) mice if either the Treg or Teff subset were GITR-negative and absent if both were negative. Our results demonstrate that DTA-1 modulates both Teffs and Tregs during effective tumor treatment. The data suggest that DTA-1 prevents intra-tumor Treg accumulation by altering their stability, and as a result of the loss of foxp3 expression, may modify their intra-tumor suppressive capacity. These findings provide further support for the continued development of agonist anti-GITR mAbs as an immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2157422108,"Environmental protection is critical to maintain ecosystem services essential for human well-being. It is important to be able to rank countries by their environmental impact so that poor performers as well as policy 'models' can be identified. We provide novel metrics of country-specific environmental impact ranks - one proportional to total resource availability per country and an absolute (total) measure of impact - that explicitly avoid incorporating confounding human health or economic indicators. Our rankings are based on natural forest loss, habitat conversion, marine captures, fertilizer use, water pollution, carbon emissions and species threat, although many other variables were excluded due to a lack of country-specific data. Of 228 countries considered, 179 (proportional) and 171 (absolute) had sufficient data for correlations. The proportional index ranked Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, Philippines and Netherlands as having the highest proportional environmental impact, whereas Brazil, USA, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia and Peru had the highest absolute impact (i.e., total resource use, emissions and species threatened). Proportional and absolute environmental impact ranks were correlated, with mainly Asian countries having both high proportional and absolute impact. Despite weak concordance among the drivers of environmental impact, countries often perform poorly for different reasons. We found no evidence to support the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis of a non-linear relationship between impact and per capita wealth, although there was a weak reduction in environmental impact as per capita wealth increases. Using structural equation models to account for cross-correlation, we found that increasing wealth was the most important driver of environmental impact. Our results show that the global community not only has to encourage better environmental performance in less-developed countries, especially those in Asia, there is also a requirement to focus on the development of environmentally friendly practices in wealthier countries."
https://openalex.org/W1965411537,"We recently demonstrated noninvasive detection of fetal aneuploidy by shotgun sequencing cell-free DNA in maternal plasma using next-generation high throughput sequencer. However, GC bias introduced by the sequencer placed a practical limit on the sensitivity of aneuploidy detection. In this study, we describe a method to computationally remove GC bias in short read sequencing data by applying weight to each sequenced read based on local genomic GC content. We show that sensitivity is limited only by counting statistics and that sensitivity can be increased to arbitrary precision in sample containing arbitrarily small fraction of fetal DNA simply by sequencing more DNA molecules. High throughput shotgun sequencing of maternal plasma DNA should therefore enable noninvasive diagnosis of any type of fetal aneuploidy."
https://openalex.org/W2054523261,"An optical trap has been combined with a Raman spectrometer to make high-resolution measurements of Raman spectra of optically-immobilized, single, live red (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC) under physiological conditions. Tightly-focused, near infrared wavelength light (1064 nm) is utilized for trapping of single cells and 785 nm light is used for Raman excitation at low levels of incident power (few mW). Raman spectra of RBC recorded using this high-sensitivity, dual-wavelength apparatus has enabled identification of several additional lines; the hitherto-unreported lines originate purely from hemoglobin molecules. Raman spectra of single granulocytes and lymphocytes are interpreted on the basis of standard protein and nucleic acid vibrational spectroscopy data. The richness of the measured spectrum illustrates that Raman studies of live cells in suspension are more informative than conventional micro-Raman studies where the cells are chemically bound to a glass cover slip."
https://openalex.org/W2089310643,"The murine KRAS promoter contains a G-rich nuclease hypersensitive element (GA-element) upstream of the transcription start site that is essential for transcription. Pulldown and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that this GA-element is bound by the Myc-associated zinc finger (MAZ) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) proteins. These proteins are crucial for transcription, because when they are knocked down by short hairpin RNA, transcription is down-regulated. This is also the case when the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of PARP-1 is inhibited by 3,4-dihydro-5-[4-(1-piperidinyl) butoxyl]-1(2H) isoquinolinone. We found that MAZ specifically binds to the duplex and quadruplex conformations of the GA-element, whereas PARP-1 shows specificity only for the G-quadruplex. On the basis of fluorescence resonance energy transfer melting and polymerase stop assays we saw that MAZ stabilizes the KRAS quadruplex. When the capacity of folding in the GA-element is abrogated by specific G → T or G → A point mutations, KRAS transcription is down-regulated. Conversely, guanidine-modified phthalocyanines, which specifically interact with and stabilize the KRAS G-quadruplex, push the promoter activity up to more than double. Collectively, our data support a transcription mechanism for murine KRAS that involves MAZ, PARP-1 and duplex-quadruplex conformational changes in the promoter GA-element.

Guanine-rich sequences have the potential to fold into intramolecular G-quadruplex (or G4-DNA) structures that are stabilized by planar arrays of four guanines paired by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (G-tetrad) (1.Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar).

Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1055-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Recent bioinformatic search analyses have shown a surprisingly high presence in the human genome of QFS, on the order of 3–4 × 105 (3.Huppert J.L. Balasubramanian S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 4.Todd A.K. Johnston M. Neidle S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2901-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The gene distribution of QFS is highly skewed because tumor suppressor genes have a very low level of QFS, whereas proto-oncogenes have a high level of such sequences (5.Eddy J. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3887-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). There seems to be a correlation between QFS and genomic instability; a low level of QFS in tumor suppressor genes is associated with genomic stability, and a high level is associated with genomic instability (5.Eddy J. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3887-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observation that QFS are often located in the region surrounding the transcription start sites of the genes and within cis-elements suggests that they may be involved in transcription regulation. This hypothesis has been formulated for a number of genes including CMYC, KRAS, C-MYB, VEGF, PDGFA, CKIT, and human insulin (6.Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L. Bearss D.J. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12508-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The best studied G-rich sequence folding into a G-quadruplex, whose function has been correlated with a mechanism of transcription regulation, is the one found in the promoter of the CMYC gene (6.Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L. Bearss D.J. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11593-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Upstream of the P1 promoter, controlling about 80% of transcription, there is a QFS that can fold into a G-quadruplex. When this quadruplex is destabilized by a G-to-A mutation, the basal transcription increases 3-fold, but when the G-quadruplex is stabilized by cationic porphyrins, transcription is repressed. From these data it has been suggested that the G-quadruplex formed in the CMYC promoter may function as a transcription repressor. A comprehensive review on the mechanism controlling transcription in CMYC has been recently reported (14.Brooks T.A. Hurley L.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Interestingly, G-rich elements do not seem to be a unique feature of mammalian genomes, as they are also overrepresented in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For instance, it has been reported that the gene promoters in this organism contain a level of G-rich sequences, which is 14-fold higher than the entire genome (15.Hershman S.G. Chen Q. Lee J.Y. Kozak M.L. Yue P. Wang L.S. Johnson F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A mutant of S. cerevisiae lacking the SGS1 gene, encoding for a helicase specific for quadruplex DNA, was characterized by a reduced expression of the genes in which open reading frames have a high potential to form quadruplexes (16.Lee S.K. Johnson R.E. Yu S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1999; 286: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae contains a quadruplex-forming 16-base pair G-rich sequence that is required to promote pilin antigenic variation of surface structures to avoid immune detection (17.Cahoon L.A. Seifert H.S. Science. 2009; 325: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Evidence that G4-DNA formed within the regulatory elements of promoters may be involved in transcription regulation has also been produced by other research groups (6.Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12508-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whether quadruplex DNA is formed inside the cell or whether it has any biological function in cellular events such as transcription or recombination is still a matter of debate. The role of G-quadruplex DNA on transcription is essentially based on the observation that G-quadruplex destabilizing point mutations or deletions bring about a significant enhancement of transcription, whereas G4-DNA ligands repress transcription (6.Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L. Bearss D.J. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11593-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar, 7.Cogoi S. Xodo L.E.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12508-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although these findings support the notion that G4-DNA may be a transcription repressor, they do not provide a conclusive answer about the cellular function of quadruplex DNA. Indeed, it can be argued that the mutations introduced into the guanine element of the promoter could abrogate the binding of proteins to DNA and consequently alter the level of transcription. It could also be that the quadruplex-stabilizing ligands affect transcription simply because they compete with the binding of the proteins to the promoter. To provide an answer to these questions, we have in the present paper extended our previous work (7.Cogoi S. Xodo L.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2536-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and analyzed the role played in transcription by a critical GA-element located in the promoter of the murine KRAS proto-oncogene (18.Hoffman E.K. Trusko S.P. Murphy M. George D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2705-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This promoter contains a 34-bp G-rich sequence between nucleotides −322 and −288 (−1 is the 3′ boundary of the exon 0), which is sensitive to nuclease S1 and able to fold into a parallel G-quadruplex conformation. This intramolecular quadruplex was characterized by circular dichroism and UV spectroscopy, dimethyl sulfate footprinting, polymerase stop assays, and electrophoresis (7.Cogoi S. Xodo L.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2536-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The GA-element contains two perfect copies of the consensus sequence for the myc-associated zinc finger (MAZ) transcription factor. By pulldown and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we demonstrated that not only MAZ but also PARP-1 is associated to the GA-element. Although MAZ binds to both duplex and quadruplex conformations of the GA-element, PARP-1 binds specifically only to the G-quadruplex. We provide here compelling evidence that MAZ and PARP-1 are transcription activators and propose that these proteins are recruited to the KRAS promoter by the G-quadruplex structure formed within the GA-element. quadruplex-forming sequence myc-associated zinc finger protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (3,4-dihydro-5-[4-(1-piperidinyl)butoxyl]-1(2H)-isoquinolinone) tetrakis-(diisopropyl-guanidine) phthalocyanine short hairpin RNA fluorescence resonance energy transfer chloramphenicol acetyltransferase 6-carboxyfluorescein guanidine-modified phthalocyanine chromatin immunoprecipitation cytomegalovirus electrophoretic mobility shift assay glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline dithiothreitol Tris borate EDTA bovine serum albumin tetrakis-(succinyl)phthalocyanines. Plasmid pKRS413 harboring the CAT gene driven by the murine KRAS promoter was subjected to PCR using primers 5′-TGCAGCCGCTCCCTCTCTCTCTCCTTCTCTCTCTCCCGCGCG and 5′-GAGGGAGCGGCTGCAGCGCTGGGAG (to introduce four G → A point mutations) and 5′-TGCAGCCGCTCCCTCACTCACTCCTTCCCT and 5′-GAGGGAGCGGCTGCAGCGCTGGGAG (to introduce two G → T point mutations). The mutant plasmid with two T residues was amplified with 5′-CTCACTCACTCCTTCACTCACTCCCGCGCG and 5′-GAAGGAGTGAGTGAGGGAGCGGCTGCAG to obtain a mutant with four T residues. PCR was performed with 3 ng/μl DNA template, 0.1 μm each primer, 0.05 units/μl AccuPrime pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in 1× AccuPrime pfx reaction mix for 3 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 5 min at 68 °C. Bacteria DIH 101 were transformed with PCR product, and DNA was extracted and sequenced (primer 5′-CCTCTCGGCACCACCCTC, accession number U49448, Entrez Nucleotide database (NCBI), bases 403–420). A 300-bp XmaI-AvaII fragment containing the KRAS murine promoter from the wild-type and mutant plasmids was subcloned in pGL3–1B basic in XmaI-HindIII blunted site in order to have the reporter firefly luciferase gene driven by wild-type and mutant KRAS promoters. The inserts were sequenced with pGL3for primer (5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC). The plasmids constructed in this way were pKRS413-luc, pKRS413-luc-2T, pKRS413-luc-4T, and pKRS413-luc-4A. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in exponential growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 20 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Euroclone, Milano, Italy). Cell viability was measured by resazurin assays following standard procedures. NIH 3T3 cells were seeded the day before transfection at 8000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. When the experiment involved a phthalocyanine treatment, this was done on cells let for adhesion for 16 h. Transfection was performed by mixing each vector 250 ng/well with control plasmid pRL-CMV expressing Renilla luciferase under control of the CMV promoter 10 ng/well using JetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus transfection) following the manufacturer's instructions. For cotransfection with pCMV-MAZ (19.Tsutsui H. Sakatsume O. Itakura K. Yokoyama K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), 150 ng of pKRS413-luc or mutant with 10 ng of pRL-CMV were transfected with either 150 ng of pCMV-MAZ or pcDNA3 plasmid (empty vector) as the mass for control transfections. Each transfection was performed in triplicate. Luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection with the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega, Milan, Italy) following instructions. Samples were read with Turner Luminometer and expressed as relative luciferase, i.e. RT/RC × 100, where RT and RC are (firefly luciferase)/(Renilla luciferase) in phthalocyanine-treated and untreated cells. Recombinant MAZ protein tagged to GST was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using plasmid pGEX-hMAZ (19.Tsutsui H. Sakatsume O. Itakura K. Yokoyama K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The bacteria were grown for 1–2 h at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5–2.0 before induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1.5 mm final concentration). Cells were allowed to grow for 7 h before harvesting. The cells were centrifuged at 5000 rpm, 4 °C, the supernatant was removed, and the cells washed twice with PBS. The pellet was resuspended in a solution of PBS with 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 m DTT, and protease inhibitor cocktails (for general use and for purification of histidine-tagged protein (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocols). The bacteria were lysed by sonication, added with Triton X-100 (1% final concentration), and incubated for 30 min on a shaker at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C at 20,000 rpm. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) (50% slurry in PBS) was added to the supernatant from the previous step and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C on a shaker. The mix was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, and the pellet was washed 5 times with PBS. The protein was eluted from the pellet with elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 10 mm reduced glutathione by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 g, 4 °C, and the tagged proteins collected from the supernatant were checked by SDS-PAGE.

Paramasivam M. Spolaore B. Xodo L.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3765-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 60 nm biotinylated G4-DNA (G4-biotin, prepared in 100 mm KCl) or biotinylated duplex (G4-biotin annealed with its complementary in 100 mm NaCl) (Table 1) in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 8% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 25 ng/ml poly(dI-dC), 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm zinc acetate. Then 250 μg of Streptavidin MagneSphere Paramagnetic Particles (Promega) pretreated for 30 min with 0.25 mg/ml BSA were added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Particles were captured with a magnet, and the proteins were eluted with the buffer containing 0.5 and 1 m NaCl. The eluted proteins were concentrated and desalted with Microcon YM-3 filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) for further analyses. The eluted proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted overnight in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol at 4 °C on a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with different antibodies: MAZ H-50 and PARP-1 H-300 diluted 1:200 (Santa Cruz). The secondary antibody used was rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000) (Calbiochem). The antibodies were diluted in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, and 5% BSA. The signal was developed with SuperSignal West Pico or Femto (Pierce) and detected with ChemiDOC XRS, Quantity One 4.6.5 software (Bio-Rad). NIH 3T3 cells were plated in 2 × 15-cm diameter plates, grown to 80% confluence (about 1.5 × 107 cells), and fixed in formaldehyde 1% in PBS for 2 or 5 min. Nuclei were isolated following the ChIP-ITTM Express kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium) and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Sonication was performed with a BioruptorTM sonicator (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium) following the manufacturer's instructions to obtain 200–500-bp fragments. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, washes, elution, reverse cross-linking, and proteinase K treatment were performed following the ChIP-ITTM Express kit manual. Antibodies used were MAZ H-50x and PARP-1 H-300 (Santa Cruz), 100 and 20 ng/μl, respectively. Control antibodies were RNA polymerase II mouse monoclonal antibody and negative control mouse IgG (ChIP-ITTM Control kit-mouse, Active Motif). About 15 μg of chromatin was used for each sample and fixed for 2 min for PARP-1 and 5 min for MAZ. The PCR reaction mixture was 1× PCR buffer (from the kit), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.4 μm primers, 0.04 units of Taq polymerase (EuroTaq Euroclone), and110 of the ChIP samples. Primers used were EF1-α control primers (from control kit), which give a 233-bp product, and 5′-CCTCTCGGCACCACCCTC and 5′-GATGCGCTCGGTGCTC (respectively, 403–420 and 561–546, sequence accession number U49448), which give a 160-bp product. PCR was performed as follows: 3 min at 94 °C, 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 59 °C for EF1-α amplification and 61 °C for KRAS promoter amplification, and 30 s at 72 °C, with a final elongation 10 min at 72 °C. Amplification products were separated by a 10% acrylamide gel in TBE and visualized with a Gel-DOC apparatus (Bio-Rad). Cells were seeded 20–50,000/well in a 24-well plate. The day after plating they were either treated with DPQ at the concentrations indicated, or shRNA plasmids were transfected 0.5 μg/well. Plasmids used are Control shRNA Plasmid-A, PARP-1 shRNA Plasmid (m), and MAZ shRNA Plasmid (m) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were collected 48 or 72 h after transfection. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA synthesis 5 μl of RNA in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (extracted from about 25,000 cells) was heated at 55 °C and placed in ice. The solution was added to 7.5 μl of mix containing (final concentrations) 1× buffer, 0.01 m DTT (Invitrogen), 1.6 μm primer dT (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany; d(T)16), 1.6 μm Random primers (Promega), 0.4 mm dNTPs solution containing equimolar amounts of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (Euroclone, Pavia, Italy), 0.8 units/μl RNase OUT, and 8 units/μl of Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and stopped with heating at 95 °C for 5 min. As a negative control the reverse transcription reaction was performed with 5 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate water. Real-time PCR reactions were performed with 1x iQTM SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 300 nm of each primer, 1 μl of reverse transcription reaction. The sequences of the primers used for amplifications are reported below. The PCR cycle was: 3 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles 10 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C with an iQ5 real-time PCR controlled by an Optical System software Version 2.0 or with CFX 96 controlled by Bio-Rad CFX Manager V1.5 (Bio-Rad). KRAS, MAZ, and PARP-1 expression are normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and β2-microglobulin. The PCR primers used are reported in supplemental Table S1). A linear DNA sequence of 80 nucleotides, named wtR-Mur80 (Table 1), containing the G-rich element of murine KRAS, was used as a template for Taq polymerase primer-extension reactions. The primer used was an 18-mer sequence named pMur80 (Table 1). This DNA sequence was purified by PAGE. The template (50 nm) was mixed with the labeled primer (25 nm) in 25 mm KCl, 1× Taq buffer and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The primer extension reactions were carried out for 1 h by adding 10 mm DTT, 100 μm dATP, dGTP, dTTP, dCTP, and 3.75 units of Taq polymerase (EuroTaq, Euroclone, Milan). The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of stop buffer (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaOH, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). The products were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide sequencing gel prepared in 1× TBE, 8 m urea. The gel was dried and exposed to autoradiography. Standard dideoxy sequencing reactions were performed to detect the points where DNA polymerase I was arrested. DNase I footprint was performed with the duplex obtained by annealing wtR-Mur80 with its complementary wtY-Mur80. The purine strand was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled duplex was preincubated at different ratios of MAZ-GST for 30 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 30 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 8% glycerol, 50 μm zinc acetate, either in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm EDTA, and digested with DNase I (1 μl of a solution containing 0.002 unit of DNase I (Takara Biomedicals, Japan), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 30 mm MnCl2). The reaction was conducted for 1 min at room temperature and stopped by adding to the reaction mixture 10 μl of stop solution (90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, bromphenol blue). The analyses were carried out in 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel prepared in 1× TBE, 8 m urea. After running, the gel was fixed and exposed to autoradiography (Hyperfilm, GE Healthcare) at −80 °C for few hours. A standard dimethyl sulfate G-reaction was performed with wtR-Mur80 purine strand to locate the binding of MAZ within murine duplex. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Microplate Spectrofluorometer System (Molecular Devices, Concorde, Canada) using a 96-well black plate in which each well contained 50 μl of 200-nm dual-labeled 28R in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, KCl as specified in legends for FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6. The samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C before measurements. The emission spectra were obtained setting the excitation wavelength at 475 nm, the cut-off was at 515 nm, and recording the emission was from 500 to 650 nm. FRET melting experiments were performed on a real-time PCR apparatus (CFX 96, Bio-Rad) using a 96-well plate filled with 50-μl solutions of dual-labeled 28R, called F-28R-T (Table 1) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and potassium chloride at different concentrations as specified on the figure.

This unusual structure serves as a platform for the binding of factors required for expression of pol II-transcribed genes, including the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene-specific Integrator complex. The pol II CTD specifically mediates recruitment of Integrator to the promoter of snRNA genes to activate transcription and direct 3′ end processing of the transcripts. Phosphorylation of the CTD and a serine in position 7 are necessary for Integrator recruitment. Here, we have further investigated the requirement of the serines in the CTD heptapeptide and their phosphorylation for Integrator binding. We show that both Ser2 and Ser7 of the CTD are required and that phosphorylation of these residues is necessary and sufficient for efficient binding. Using synthetic phosphopeptides, we have determined the pattern of the minimal Ser2/Ser7 double phosphorylation mark required for Integrator to interact with the CTD. This novel double phosphorylation mark is a new addition to the functional repertoire of the CTD code and may be a specific signal for snRNA gene expression.

The CTD 5The abbreviations used are: CTDcarboxyl-terminal domainpol IIRNA polymerase IIsnRNAsmall nuclear RNADNA-PKDNA-dependent protein kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferase. of the largest subunit of pol II is an evolutionary conserved structure, specific to eukaryotic organisms, which plays a fundamental role in transcription and RNA processing (1Hirose Y. Ohkuma Y. J. Biochem. 2007; 141: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It comprises multiple tandemly repeated heptapeptides with the consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7, with 52 repeats in the mammalian protein (2Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Hintermair C. Eick D. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 289-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The CTD serves as a scaffold for the interaction of a wide range of nuclear factors involved in various processes linked to transcription. The ability of the CTD to interact specifically with appropriate proteins during the transcription cycle in vivo is determined largely by the phosphorylation status of the three serine residues within the consensus heptapeptide (Ser2/Ser5/Ser7) (3Egloff S. Murphy S. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Different patterns of CTD serine phosphorylation correlate with the position of pol II along transcribed protein-coding genes and allow the recruitment of the appropriate factors at different stages of the transcription cycle. Differential modification thus enables a wide range of signaling combinations to be read as a code (3Egloff S. Murphy S. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 4Buratowski S. Nat. Struct.

Phosphorylation of Ser2 and phosphorylation of Ser5 are the best studied CTD modifications. Ser5 phosphorylation is directed by the CDK7 kinase as part of the TFIIH complex. Ser5 phosphorylation occurs early in the transcription cycle, is highest near the promoter, and activates capping of mRNAs. Ser2 phosphorylation, directed by the CDK9 kinase subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, occurs later in the transcription cycle and is generally highest toward the 3′ end of the genes. This modification plays roles in splicing and 3′ end processing of transcripts. There is some evidence that CTD heptapeptides can bear both Ser2 and Ser5 marks as factors implicated in transcription such as Set2 preferentially recognize a combination of both in vitro (3Egloff S.

Biol. 2005; 25: 3305-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Some Ser2 phosphorylation must therefore occur before the removal of the phosphate on Ser5. Recently, it has been shown that Ser7 of the heptapeptide repeat is also phosphorylated during transcription (7Akhtar M.S. Heidemann M. Tietjen J.R. Zhang D.W. Chapman R.D. Eick D. Ansari A.Z. Mol.

The demonstration that the snRNA gene-specific Integrator complex, which is required for 3′ box recognition, binds to the pol II CTD (20Baillat D. Hakimi M.A. Näär A.M. Shilatifard A. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2005; 123: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) provided a molecular link between transcription and 3′ processing of snRNA gene transcripts. More recently, we have shown that the serine in position 7 of the CTD heptapeptide plays a pivotal role in expression of snRNA genes (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser7 to alanine abolishes the association of the snRNA gene-specific Integrator complex to snRNA promoters and drastically affects transcription of snRNA genes and 3′ end processing of transcripts. In addition, we have shown that CTD phosphorylation is critical for efficient binding of the Integrator complex to the CTD (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, the precise mark on the CTD required for binding of the Integrator complex was not fully defined. Here, we precisely identify the CTD mark required for Integrator binding. We show that phosphorylation of both Ser2 and Ser7 is necessary for efficient binding of Integrator to the CTD. Interestingly, efficient binding requires two heptapeptide repeats and occurs when Ser7 in the first repeat and Ser2 in the second repeat are phosphorylated, providing a clear demonstration that recognition by some CTD-binding proteins spans more than a single heptapeptide repeat. This doubly phosphorylated mark may represent a novel gene type-specific CTD mark as Integrator complex recruitment is restricted to snRNA genes (20Baillat D. Hakimi M.A. Näär A.M. Shilatifard A.

Molecular weight protein standards were run through the same column under the same conditions. 0.1 μg of GST-CTD (25 repeats) was incubated with 20 μl of fraction or 0.2–1 μl of HeLa nuclear extract in a 40-μl final volume of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.4 μl of Sigma phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (kinase buffer) for 15 h at 30 °C. For recombinant DNA-PK (Promega) studies, 50 units were incubated with 0.1 mg of GST-CTD (25 repeats) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For inhibitor studies, wortmannin (Invitrogen) was preincubated with the reaction mix for 10 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of ATP and GST-CTD substrate. Activated calf thymus DNA (Sigma) was added to the reaction mix as indicated. Reactions were stopped by boiling in SDS buffer, and phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot with phospho-CTD-specific antibodies. GST-CTD pulldowns were performed as described previously (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S.

CTD peptides were synthesized (Cambridge Peptides) with one, two, or four repeats of YSPTSPS or YAPTSPA and amino-terminal biotinylation. Ser2/Ser7 phosphorylated peptides were also made.

The Integrator complex comprises 12 subunits totaling ∼2 MDa and has been shown to interact with the CTD of pol II in vitro (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D.

It is associated with U1 and U2 snRNA genes, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and is required for recognition of the snRNA gene-specific 3′ box (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D.

The Integrator complex may also play a role in activating transcription of snRNA genes, at a step downstream of pol II recruitment (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The role of most of the 12 Integrator subunits is unclear, but two subunits, Int9 and Int11, display sequence homology to the CPSF-100 and CPSF-73 subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor, respectively (20Baillat D. Hakimi M.A. Näär A.M. Shilatifard A. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2005; 123: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 23Dominski Z. Yang X.C. Purdy M. Wagner E.J. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Int11 is therefore thought to carry the endonuclease activity responsible for the first cleavage during the formation of the 3′ end of pre-snRNAs (20Baillat D. Hakimi M.A. Näär A.M. Shilatifard A. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2005; 123: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that in vitro binding of Int11 to the CTD requires phosphorylation of the CTD (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser7 in the heptapeptide consensus sequence affects the interaction between the CTD and Integrator in vitro and prevents its recruitment on snRNA genes in vivo, suggesting that Ser7 phosphorylation participates in Integrator recruitment to snRNA genes (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, the CTD is the site of multiple phosphorylations, with all three serines phosphorylated in vitro (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 phosphorylation, we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown analysis with GST-CTDs carrying 25 consensus (wild type), S2A, S5A, or S7A heptapeptide repeats (Fig. 1). For detection of the catalytic subunit, Int11 was used as a diagnostic for Integrator binding to the CTD. As expected, Integrator interacts strongly with the consensus repeats after phosphorylation of the CTD. Mutation of Ser2 and Ser7 to alanine has a drastic effect on Integrator binding, demonstrating that these residues are critical for this interaction. In contrast, mutation of Ser5 does not reduce the binding of Integrator but rather enhances it, excluding any positive role of Ser5 and Ser5 phosphorylation in this process. Together, these results demonstrate that Integrator binding to the CTD requires a serine in positions 2 and 7 of the CTD repeat and that phosphorylation of Ser2 and/or Ser7, but not Ser5, participates in this interaction. The requirement for CTD phosphorylation and serines at positions 2 and 7 can be explained by three distinct scenarios. Binding of the Integrator complex to the CTD requires: 1) a phospho-serine in position 2 and a serine in position 7; 2) a serine in position 2 and a phospho-serine in position 7; or 3) phospho-serines in positions 2 and 7. To discriminate between these possibilities, we separated Ser2 and Ser7 kinase activities in vitro. HeLa nuclear extract was fractionated on a Superose 6 size exclusion column, and the ability of each fraction to phosphorylate GST-CTD containing 25 consensus repeats in vitro was tested by Western blot with antibodies specific to phospho-Ser2, phospho-Ser5, and phospho-Ser7 (8Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The fractions were also tested for the presence of the CTD kinases CDK7 and CDK9, the cyclin T1 partner of CDK9, and the Int7 subunit of the Integrator complex. Interestingly, Ser7 kinase activity, which is present in fractions 16–36 and peaks in fractions 16 and 26–28, can be separated from Ser2 and Ser5 kinase activities, which are present in fractions 28–36, with only a small amount of Ser2 kinase activity in fraction 16. Thus, a high level of Ser7 kinase activity fractionates together with Cdk9, cyclin T1, and the large Integrator complex with an apparent molecular mass of >2 MDa (20Baillat D. Hakimi M.A. Näär A.M. Shilatifard A. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2005; 123: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). A second peak of Ser7 kinase activity fractionates with an apparent molecular mass of ∼500–700 kDa, whereas Ser2 and Ser5 kinases fractionate between 50 and 500 kDa. As expected, the pattern of Ser5 phosphorylation closely follows the two isoforms of Cdk7. In contrast, the two major isoforms of the Ser2 kinase Cdk9 do not closely correlate with the Ser2 phosphorylation pattern, although the antibody detects some bands between the two isoforms in the fractions active for Ser2 phosphorylation. Similarly, Ser7 phosphorylation does not correlate closely with the presence of either CDK7 or CDK9, as might be expected (7Akhtar M.S. Heidemann M. Tietjen J.R. Zhang D.W. Chapman R.D. Eick D.

Chem. 2009; 284: 26421-26426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although some Ser7 kinase activity is present in the fractions where CDK7 and CDK9 are detected. However, Ser7 kinase activity in fractions 16–30 correlates closely with the presence of the 460-kDa catalytic subunit of the DNA-activated kinase DNA-PK, which has CTD kinase activity (24Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and has been shown to phosphorylate CTD peptides on Ser7 (25Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Jackson S.P. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, the DNA-PK inhibitor, wortmannin (26Izzard R.A. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2581-2586PubMed Google Scholar), effectively and selectively inhibits Ser7 phosphorylation by nuclear extracts (Fig. 2B) and fractions 16, 26, 28, and 30 (data not shown). Furthermore, Ser7 phosphorylation by nuclear extracts (but not Ser2 or Ser5 phosphorylation) is enhanced by ∼4-fold by adding double-stranded DNA, as expected for DNA-PK (27Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). In addition, recombinant DNA-PK phosphorylates the GST-CTD fusion protein on Ser7, and this activity is inhibited by wortmannin and activated by double-stranded DNA (Fig. 2C). DNA-PK was also previously found to phosphorylate CTD peptides on Ser2 (25Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Jackson S.P. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA-PK also has some Ser2 kinase activity toward the GST-CTD substrate. However, this is neither inhibited by wortmannin nor activated by double-stranded DNA and is significantly lower than Ser7 kinase activity (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results indicate that under the conditions used, DNA-PK is the major Ser7 kinase in HeLa nuclear extract. Separation of Ser2 and Ser7 kinase activities by Superose 6 fractionation facilitated the study of Integrator binding to the CTD using fractions containing the Ser7 kinase but not the Ser2 kinase (fraction 26), the Ser2 kinase but not the Ser7 kinase (fraction 36), or both kinase activities (fraction 30). Fractions 26, 30, and 36 were independently used to phosphorylate a GST-CTD containing 48 consensus repeats. As expected, the GST-CTD is differentially modified depending on the fraction used for in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 3). CTDs were then tested for their ability to interact with Integrator using the binding assay described in Fig. 1. Interestingly, Int11 does not interact with the CTD phosphorylated with fractions 26 and 36, showing that Ser2 and Ser7 phosphorylation cannot independently support efficient Integrator binding (Fig. 3). In contrast, simultaneous phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser7 results in a strong interaction with Integrator. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Integrator binding to the CTD requires phosphorylation of both Ser2 and Ser7, raising the possibility that together, these modifications create a new CTD mark specifically recognized by the Integrator complex. As a final step, we designed a set of N-terminally biotinylated peptides to further characterize the Integrator binding motif on the CTD (Fig. 4). First, we determined the minimal number of CTD repeats required for efficient Int11 binding. CTD peptides consisting of 2–4 heptapeptide repeats were tested for their ability to interact with Integrator before or after in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). As expected, non-phosphorylated peptides were unable to bind Integrator. In contrast, Int11 interacts with in vitro phosphorylated CTD peptides comprising two and four repeats. This result demonstrates that two repeats are sufficient for Integrator binding and is in accordance with the previous demonstration in yeast that the basic unit of the CTD comprises two repeats (28Stiller J.W. Cook M.S. Eukaryot Cell. 2004; 3: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Importantly, an in vitro phosphorylated CTD peptide containing only one repeat failed to interact with Int11, as did an in vitro phosphorylated peptide carrying two repeats with alanine instead of serine at positions 2 and 7 (Fig. 4B). These controls demonstrate the specificity of the binding assay and confirm the requirement for Ser2 and Ser7 for binding. To more precisely characterize the motif required for Integrator binding, five CTD peptides consisting of two repeats with different combinations of phospho-Ser2/phospho-Ser7 were tested for their ability to bind Integrator (Fig. 4C). The peptide phosphorylated on both Ser2 and Ser7 residues (phosphates in positions 2, 7, 9, and 14) binds Integrator almost as well as the in vitro phosphorylated CTD peptide, suggesting that this peptide contains all the modifications required for Integrator binding. Although the peptides with phosphates in positions 2/7, 9/14, or 2/14 do not appreciably interact with Integrator, the peptide with phosphates in positions 7/9 interacts with Integrator, although less well than the double repeat with both Ser2 and Ser7 residues phosphorylated. These results demonstrate that the minimal mark required for Integrator binding is a phospho-Ser7 on the first CTD repeat followed by a phospho-Ser2 on the second CTD repeat. None of the other combinations of two phosphates are sufficient for Integrator binding. In addition, Integrator binding to peptides phosphorylated by incubation with nuclear extract is lost when either Ser7 in the first repeat or Ser2 in the second repeat is replaced by alanine, S7A and S9A, respectively (Fig. 4D), demonstrating the specificity of this new CTD motif. However, phosphorylation of an additional Ser2, Ser7, or both enhances binding. The RNA pol II CTD plays the role of scaffold for the recruitment of numerous factors involved in regulation of transcription and co-transcriptional RNA processing (3Egloff S. Murphy S. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of a new phosphorylation mark on serine 7 of the YSPTSPS CTD heptapeptide (3Egloff S. Murphy S. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 8Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) extends the repertoire of CTD modifications and raises the possibility of the existence of new regulatory phosphorylation combinations. The requirement for a double mark has only previously been demonstrated for factors that require phosphorylation of both Ser2 and Ser5, for example, Set2 (3Egloff S. Murphy S. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 6Kizer K.O. Phatnani H.P. Shibata Y. Hall H. Greenleaf A.L. Strahl B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3305-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The double mark comprising Ser7 phosphorylation on the first repeat of a CTD heptapeptide pair, followed by Ser2 phosphorylation on the second, is therefore the first example involving Ser7 phosphorylation and the first where different marks on two repeats are required for protein binding. Thus, this discovery emphasizes the increasing complexity of CTD modifications during RNA pol II transcription. Phosphorylation of both Ser2 and Ser7 occurs on snRNA genes (9Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Medlin J. Scurry A. Taylor A. Zhang F. Peterlin B.M.

Biol. 2009; 29: 4002-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the currently available antibodies specific for phosphorylation on each of the three serines are very useful in studying transcription, they are unable to give precise information about the juxtaposition of modifications on individual heptads (or pairs). It would therefore be of great interest to raise an antibody against the Ser7/Ser2-specific mark and test its presence on snRNA genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser7 is also detected at the 3′ end of human protein-coding genes (8Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 29Egloff S. Al-Rawaf H. O'Reilly D. Murphy S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4002-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but the Integrator complex is not. It is therefore possible that within the CTD, the location of phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser7 relative to each other differs from snRNA to protein-coding genes or that this mark works in synergy with promoter-specific factors/elements to specifically recruit Integrator to snRNA genes but not protein-coding genes. In addition, Ser5 and its phosphorylation appear to have a negative impact on the recognition of the double mark by Integrator, indicating that some phosphorylation marks interfere with CTD-protein interaction, adding a further layer of complexity to the CTD code. Surprisingly, our study also indicates that the majority of the in vitro Ser7 kinase activity in HeLa nuclear extract is attributable to the large kinase, DNA-PK. So far, no role for DNA-PK as a CTD Ser7 kinase in vivo has been demonstrated, and further investigation of this possibility is warranted. Nevertheless, the Ser7-specific activity obtained by fractionation of nuclear extract and recombinant DNA-PK will provide useful tools to selectively phosphorylate CTD heptapeptides in GST fusion proteins on Ser7, which would, for example, facilitate further studies of the role of this modification in recruitment of proteins to the CTD. We thank Zbig Dominski for the Int11 antibody and Dirk Eick for the phospho-Ser2, phospho-Ser5, and phospho-Ser7 antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2092076509,"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is important for innate antiviral responses; accordingly, many viruses target and inactivate IRF3. The ability of the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) immediate early protein ICP0 to inhibit IRF3 is controversial and has not been studied solely in the context of a wild type HSV-1 infection. Discrepancies in the literature surround the mechanism by which ICP0 antagonizes the IRF3 pathway, the cellular localization of ICP0 inhibitory activity and the ability of ICP0 to interfere with interferon and interferon-stimulated gene induction. In this study, we set out to investigate the role of ICP0 localization and the requirement of the proteasome during the inhibition of IRF3 activation within the context of an HSV-1 infection. Collectively, the results presented herein demonstrate that incoming wild type HSV-1 activates IRF3 and that de novo produced ICP0 prevents sustained IRF3 activation following its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. While previous studies implicate the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain of ICP0 in mediating its biological functions, including the inhibition of IRF3, we show that cytoplasmic ICP0 does not require the proteasome for this activity. Instead, proteasome function is required to localize ICP0 to the cytoplasm where it mediates its inhibitory effect independent of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The importance of these findings is discussed within the context of an HSV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W1975463383,"Bee venom contains a variety of peptides and enzymes, including serine proteases. While the presence of serine proteases in bee venom has been demonstrated, the role of these proteins in bee venom has not been elucidated. Furthermore, there is currently no information available regarding the melanization response or the fibrin(ogen)olytic activity of bee venom serine protease, and the molecular mechanism of its action remains unknown. Here we show that bee venom serine protease (Bi-VSP) is a multifunctional enzyme. In insects, Bi-VSP acts as an arthropod prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating factor (PPAF), thereby triggering the phenoloxidase (PO) cascade. Bi-VSP injected through the stinger induces a lethal melanization response in target insects by modulating the innate immune response. In mammals, Bi-VSP acts similarly to snake venom serine protease, which exhibits fibrin(ogen)olytic activity. Bi-VSP activates prothrombin and directly degrades fibrinogen into fibrin degradation products, defining roles for Bi-VSP as a prothrombin activator, a thrombin-like protease, and a plasmin-like protease. These findings provide a novel view of the mechanism of bee venom in which the bee venom serine protease kills target insects via a melanization strategy and exhibits fibrin(ogen)olytic activity."

Human Glo1 exists in various isoforms; however, the nature of its modifications and their distinct functional assignment is mostly unknown.We characterized native Glo1 purified from human erythrocytes by mass spectrometry. The enzyme was found to undergo four so far unidentified posttranslational modifications: (i) removal of the N-terminal methionine 1, (ii) N-terminal acetylation at alanine 2, (iii) a vicinal disulfide bridge between cysteine residues 19 and 20, and (iv) a mixed disulfide with glutathione on cysteine 139. Glutathionylation of Glo1 was confirmed by immunological methods. Both, N-acetylation and the oxidation state of Cys(19/20), did not impact enzyme activity. In contrast, glutathionylation strongly inhibited Glo1 activity in vitro. The discussed mechanism for enzyme inhibition by glutathionylation was validated by molecular dynamics simulation.It is shown for the first time that Glo1 activity directly can be regulated by an oxidative posttranslational modification that was found in the native enzyme, i.e., glutathionylation. Inhibition of Glo1 by chemical reaction with its co-factor and the role of its intramolecular disulfides are expected to be important factors within the context of redox-dependent regulation of glucose metabolism in cells."

The videos were customized for two audiences based on self-identification: either gay or non-gay men. The outcomes evaluated were 'intention to get tested' and 'HIV testing at the clinic.'In the non-gay identified group, 97 men were randomly assigned to the video-based intervention and 90 to the text-based intervention. Non-gay identified participants randomized to the video-based intervention were more likely to report their intention of getting tested for HIV within the next 30 days (62.5% vs. 15.4%, Relative Risk (RR): 2.77, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.42-5.39). After a mean of 125.5 days of observation (range 42-209 days), 11 participants randomized to the video and none of the participants randomized to text attended our clinic requesting HIV testing (p = 0.001). In the gay-identified group, 142 men were randomized to the video-based intervention and 130 to the text-based intervention. Gay-identified participants randomized to the video were more likely to report intentions of getting an HIV test within 30 days, although not significantly (50% vs. 21.6%, RR: 1.54, 95% CI: 0.74-3.20). At the end of follow up, 8 participants who watched the video and 10 who read the text visited our clinic for HIV testing (Hazard Ratio: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.40-2.85).This study provides some evidence of the efficacy of a video-based online intervention in improving HIV testing among non-gay-identified MSM in Peru.

They have become an essential tool to confirm and complement hypotheses made by biomedical scientists and also allow the re-examination of existing models, hence influencing future investigations. Particularly imaging live cells is crucial for an improved understanding of dynamic biological processes, however hitherto live cell imaging has been limited by the necessity to introduce probes within a cell without altering its physiological and structural integrity. We demonstrate herein that this hurdle can be overcome by effective cytosolic delivery.We show the delivery within several types of mammalian cells using nanometre-sized biomimetic polymer vesicles (a.k.a. polymersomes) that offer both highly efficient cellular uptake and endolysomal escape capability without any effect on the cellular metabolic activity. Such biocompatible polymersomes can encapsulate various types of probes including cell membrane probes and nucleic acid probes as well as labelled nucleic acids, antibodies and quantum dots.We show the delivery of sufficient quantities of probes to the cytosol, allowing sustained functional imaging of live cells over time periods of days to weeks. Finally the combination of such effective staining with three-dimensional imaging by confocal laser scanning microscopy allows cell imaging in complex three-dimensional environments under both mono-culture and co-culture conditions. Thus cell migration and proliferation can be studied in models that are much closer to the in vivo situation."
https://openalex.org/W2129386317,"The rapid evolution of influenza viruses occurs both clonally and non-clonally through a variety of genetic mechanisms and selection pressures. The non-clonal evolution of influenza viruses comprises relatively frequent reassortment among gene segments and a more rarely reported process of non-homologous RNA recombination. Homologous RNA recombination within segments has been proposed as a third such mechanism, but to date the evidence for the existence of this process among influenza viruses has been both weak and controversial. As homologous recombination has not yet been demonstrated in the laboratory, supporting evidence, if it exists, may come primarily from patterns of phylogenetic incongruence observed in gene sequence data. Here, we review the necessary criteria related to laboratory procedures and sample handling, bioinformatic analysis, and the known ecology and evolution of influenza viruses that need to be met in order to confirm that a homologous recombination event occurred in the history of a set of sequences. To determine if these criteria have an effect on recombination analysis, we gathered 8307 publicly available full-length sequences of influenza A segments and divided them into those that were sequenced via the National Institutes of Health Influenza Genome Sequencing Project (IGSP) and those that were not. As sample handling and sequencing are executed to a very high standard in the IGSP, these sequences should be less likely to be exposed to contamination by other samples or by laboratory strains, and thus should not exhibit laboratory-generated signals of homologous recombination. Our analysis shows that the IGSP data set contains only two phylogenetically-supported single recombinant sequences and no recombinant clades. In marked contrast, the non-IGSP data show a very large amount of potential recombination. We conclude that the presence of false positive signals in the non-IGSP data is more likely than false negatives in the IGSP data, and that given the evidence to date, homologous recombination seems to play little or no role in the evolution of influenza A viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2042306674,"Adult schistosomes are intravascular parasites that metabolize imported glucose largely via glycolysis. How the parasites get rid of the large amounts of lactic acid this generates is unknown at the molecular level. Here, we report that worms whose aquaporin gene (SmAQP) has been suppressed using RNAi fail to rapidly acidify their culture medium and excrete less lactate compared to controls. Functional expression of SmAQP in Xenopus oocytes demonstrates that this protein can transport lactate following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with low apparent affinity (Km = 41±5. 8 mM) and with a low energy of activation (Ea = 7.18±0.7 kcal/mol). Phloretin, a known inhibitor of lactate release from schistosomes, also inhibits lactate movement in SmAQP-expressing oocytes. In keeping with the substrate promiscuity of other aquaporins, SmAQP is shown here to be also capable of transporting water, mannitol, fructose and alanine but not glucose. Using immunofluorescent and immuno-EM, we confirm that SmAQP is localized in the tegument of adult worms. These findings extend the proposed functions of the schistosome tegument beyond its known capacity as an organ of nutrient uptake to include a role in metabolic waste excretion."

Four biomarkers, estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki-67, were examined simultaneously on breast cancer cells and human breast cancer tissues. The MMIHC method improved immunoreaction, reducing time and reagent consumption. Moreover, it showed the availability of semi-quantitative analysis by comparing Western blot. Concordance study proved strong consensus between conventional whole-section analysis and MMIHC (n = 105, lowest Kendall's coefficient of concordance, 0.90). To demonstrate the suitability of MMIHC for scarce samples, it was also applied successfully to tissues from needle biopsies.The microfluidic system, for the first time, was successfully applied to human clinical tissue samples and histopathological diagnosis was realized for breast cancers. Our results showing substantial agreement indicate that several cancer-related proteins can be simultaneously investigated on a single tumor section, giving clear advantages and technical advances over standard immunohistochemical method. This novel concept will enable histopathological diagnosis using numerous specific biomarkers at a time even for small-sized specimens, thus facilitating the individualization of cancer therapy."

In isolated plasma under static conditions, phosphatidylserine (PS)-exposing platelets support coagulation factor activation and thrombin generation; however, their role in supporting coagulation factor binding under shear conditions remains unclear. We sought to determine where activated factor X (FXa), (pro)thrombin, and fibrin(ogen) are localized in thrombi formed under venous shear.Fluorescence microscopy was used to study the accumulation of platelets, FXa, (pro)thrombin, and fibrin(ogen) in thrombi formed in vitro and in vivo. Co-perfusion of human blood with tissue factor resulted in formation of visible fibrin at low, but not at high shear rate. At low shear, platelets demonstrated increased Ca(2+) signaling and PS exposure, and supported binding of FXa and prothrombin. However, once cleaved, (pro)thrombin was observed on fibrin fibers, covering the whole thrombus. In vivo, wild-type mice were injected with fluorescently labeled coagulation factors and venous thrombus formation was monitored in mesenteric veins treated with FeCl(3). Thrombi formed in vivo consisted of platelet aggregates, focal spots of platelets binding FXa, and large areas binding (pro)thrombin and fibrin(ogen).FXa bound in a punctate manner to thrombi under shear, while thrombin and fibrin(ogen) distributed ubiquitously over platelet-fibrin thrombi. During thrombus formation under venous shear, thrombin may relocate from focal sites of formation (on FXa-binding platelets) to dispersed sites of action (on fibrin fibers)."
https://openalex.org/W2157831747,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate bidirectional transport of proteins, RNAs, and ribonucleoproteins across the double-membrane nuclear envelope. Although there are many studies that look at the traffic in the nucleus and through the nuclear envelope we propose a method to detect the nucleocytoplasmic transport kinetics in an unperturbed cell, with no requirement for specific labeling of isolated molecules and, most important, in the presence of the cell milieu.The pair correlation function method (pCF) measures the time a molecule takes to migrate from one location to another within the cell in the presence of many molecules of the same kind. The spatial and temporal correlation among two arbitrary points in the cell provides a local map of molecular transport, and also highlights the presence of barriers to diffusion with millisecond time resolution and spatial resolution limited by diffraction. We use the pair correlation method to monitor a model protein substrate undergoing transport through NPCs in living cells, a biological problem in which single particle tracking (SPT) has given results that cannot be confirmed by traditional single-point FCS measurements because of the lack of spatial resolution.We show that obstacles to molecular flow can be detected and that the pCF algorithm can recognize the heterogeneity of protein intra-compartment diffusion as well as the presence of barriers to transport across NE."
https://openalex.org/W2012372770,"Background Exotic species have been hypothesized to successfully invade new habitats by virtue of possessing novel biochemistry that repels native enemies. Despite the pivotal long-term consequences of invasion for native food-webs, to date there are no experimental studies examining directly whether exotic plants are any more or less biochemically deterrent than native plants to native herbivores. Methodology/Principal Findings In a direct test of this hypothesis using herbivore feeding assays with chemical extracts from 19 invasive plants and 21 co-occurring native plants, we show that invasive plant biochemistry is no more deterrent (on average) to a native generalist herbivore than extracts from native plants. There was no relationship between extract deterrence and length of time since introduction, suggesting that time has not mitigated putative biochemical novelty. Moreover, the least deterrent plant extracts were from the most abundant species in the field, a pattern that held for both native and exotic plants. Analysis of chemical deterrence in context with morphological defenses and growth-related traits showed that native and exotic plants had similar trade-offs among traits. Conclusions/Significance Overall, our results suggest that particular invasive species may possess deterrent secondary chemistry, but it does not appear to be a general pattern resulting from evolutionary mismatches between exotic plants and native herbivores. Thus, fundamentally similar processes may promote the ecological success of both native and exotic species."
https://openalex.org/W2031478032,"Mammalian thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is an NADPH-dependent homodimer with three redox-active centers per subunit: a FAD, an N-terminal domain dithiol (Cys59/Cys64), and a C-terminal cysteine/selenocysteine motif (Cys497/Sec498). TrxR has multiple roles in antioxidant defense. Opposing these functions, it may also assume a pro-oxidant role under some conditions. In the absence of its main electron-accepting substrates (e.g. thioredoxin), wild-type TrxR generates superoxide (O), which was here detected and quantified by ESR spin trapping with 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DEPMPO). The peroxidase activity of wild-type TrxR efficiently converted the O adduct (DEPMPO/HOO•) to the hydroxyl radical adduct (DEPMPO/HO•). This peroxidase activity was Sec-dependent, although multiple mutants lacking Sec could still generate O. Variants of TrxR with C59S and/or C64S mutations displayed markedly reduced inherent NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting that the Cys59/Cys64 dithiol is required for O generation and that O is not derived directly from the FAD. Mutations in the Cys59/Cys64 dithiol also blocked the peroxidase and disulfide reductase activities presumably because of an inability to reduce the Cys497/Sec498 active site. Although the bulk of the DEPMPO/HO• signal generated by wild-type TrxR was due to its combined NADPH oxidase and Sec-dependent peroxidase activities, additional experiments showed that some free HO• could be generated by the enzyme in an H2O2-dependent and Sec-independent manner.

The cytosolic (TrxR1) and mitochondrial (TrxR2) isoforms are the only proteins known to reduce their respective thioredoxin substrates (Trx1 and Trx2) (1Arnér E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 495-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The thioredoxins are normally maintained in the reduced form and are responsible for maintaining the thiols of many intracellular proteins in a reduced state (2Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). As such, the TrxR/Trx system has a critical role in maintaining intracellular thiol redox balance (3Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 421-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It donates electrons to ribonucleotide reductase and reduces a number of other proteins (e.g. protein-disulfide isomerase, peroxiredoxins, and methionine sulfoxide reductase) (1Arnér E.S. Biochim.

Trx also regulates some redox-sensitive transcription factors (1Arnér E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 495-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 3Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev.

In addition, TrxR can reduce selenite, dehydroascorbate, lipid hydroperoxides, α-lipoic acid, and disulfides in some other proteins (4Nordberg J. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol.

Sandalova T. Lindqvist Y. Arnér E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3998-4008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The Cys-Sec (Cys497/Sec498) active site is essential for the reduction of oxidized thioredoxins and plays a major role in the reduction of artificial disulfide substrates, such as DTNB (9Zhong L. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18121-18128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, some substrates (e.g. selenocystine, selenite, and lipoic acid) are perhaps not solely dependent on the Sec and may alternatively be reduced by the N-terminal dithiol, at least for the mitochondrial isoenzyme TrxR2 (10Lothrop A.P. Ruggles E.L. Hondal R.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When the enzyme is reduced by NADPH, the nucleophilic and highly reactive Sec residue becomes surface-exposed and prone to react with either substrates or inhibitors (1Arnér E.S. Biochim. Biophys.

The active site of TrxR can be inhibited by a number of compounds, including some gold-containing organics, cisplatin, nitrosoureas, dinitrohalobenzenes, and others (1Arnér E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 495-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 4Nordberg J. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar, 11Nordberg J.

Becker K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 452-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Interestingly, different gold compounds may bind to different sites. For example, inhibition by auranofin is strongly associated with the Sec, whereas aurothioglucose is less Sec-dependent and may have some effects on the N-terminal dithiol (10Lothrop A.P. Ruggles E.L. Hondal R.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains, including the flavin and Cys59/Cys64 dithiol of TrxR, resemble those in glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase, but only TrxR has the C-terminal Cys-Sec motif. However, the Cys59/Cys64 dithiol in TrxR may have multiple roles (10Lothrop A.P. Ruggles E.L. Hondal R.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that are not yet well understood. The TrxR/Trx system is normally considered to have broad antioxidant functions, not only through its reduction of other antioxidant enzyme active sites, lipoic acid, hydroperoxides, and dehydroascorbate (4Nordberg J. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar, 5Kumar S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. Eur. J.

Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 421-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 4Nordberg J. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). The inhibition of TrxR compromises Trx reduction and thus the peroxiredoxins that directly reduce H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxides (3Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 421-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 4Nordberg J. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). Recent reports note that peroxiredoxins in cells become oxidized when they are deprived of reducing equivalents from their respective thioredoxins (15Myers C.R. Myers J.M. Toxicology. 2009; 257: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Myers J.M. Myers C.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Overall, inhibition of the TrxR/Trx system can promote oxidant susceptibility and cell death (4Nordberg J. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). Given its important role in promoting cell survival, there is great interest in exploring the inhibition of TrxR as a potential strategy to kill cancer cells. For example, cisplatin irreversibly inhibits TrxR (17Arnér E.S. Nakamura H. Sasada T. Yodoi J. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and high levels of TrxR in A549 cells are critical to the effectiveness of cisplatin (18Eriksson S.E. Prast-Nielsen S. Flaberg E. Szekely L. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast to its antioxidant roles, TrxR may also have pro-oxidant functions under certain conditions. The inhibition of the active site of TrxR may promote pro-oxidant effects in cells, which may directly promote cell death as selenium-compromised thioredoxin reductase-derived apoptotic proteins (SecTRAPs) (1Arnér E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 495-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 19Anestål K. Prast-Nielsen S. Cenas N. Arnér E.S. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These cellular effects are not yet well understood, and it is not clear if all inhibitors of TrxR promote these effects. It has been shown that some chemicals promote O generation by TrxR. The electron flow of the natural catalytic cycle of mammalian TrxR (i.e. catalyzing the reduction of substrates, such as oxidized Trx or lipoic acid) may be diverted to O2 under certain conditions, converting the enzyme to a pro-oxidant NADPH oxidase. This was first described for the TrxR-mediated reduction of selenite to selenide, which, when reoxidized to selenite, can mimic a strong NADPH oxidase activity through oxygen-coupled redox cycling (5Kumar S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The first class of inhibitors described for this enzyme (dinitrohalobenzenes) was also found to facilitate and increase its NADPH oxidase activity, presumably by redox cycling of the covalently attached dinitrophenyl groups (11Nordberg J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Arnér E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10835-10842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 20Arnér E.S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3479-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a similar induction of NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR was shown for other low molecular weight compounds, including juglone (19Anestål K. Prast-Nielsen S. Cenas N. Arnér E.S. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Cenas N. Nivinskas H. Anusevicius Z. Sarlauskas J. Lederer F. Arnér E.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 10691-10697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the catalytic mechanisms of the non-induced inherent NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR have not yet been elucidated. These studies present an in-depth investigation of the inherent NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR1. A series of site-directed mutation studies and the use of inhibitors provided new insights into the role of the various redox centers of TrxR in its oxidase activity. The studies also provide further insights into its peroxidase activity, including the roles of the Sec and N-terminal dithiol. The ability of TrxR to reduce the O adduct of DEPMPO to the HO• adduct is also described and should reflect its Sec-dependent peroxidase capacity. Tris was from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH).

The PCRs were prepared using Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Finnzyme, Espoo, Finland) with the addition of 20 pmol of each primer and 10 ng of template plasmid in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were initiated at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification (95 °C, 10 s; 60 °C, 10 s; 72 °C, 3 min) and concluded at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR products were purified using the PCR purification kit (Fermentas), digested with Eco31I and DpnI (Fermentas), repurified with the PCR purification kit, and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas). The DNA was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells, and the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany). For the TrxR variants that contain the C-terminal -Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly motif (wild type, C59S, C64S, C59S/C64S, Y116I, and Y116T), the assistant plasmid pSUABC was co-transformed into the same host bacteria in order to increase selenoprotein yield as described previously (30Rengby O. Arnér E.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All Sec-containing TrxR1 variants were expressed in E. coli as described previously (25Cheng Q. Stone-Elander S. Arnér E.S. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The truncated and U498C variants of TrxR1, which lack the Sec residue, were expressed in E. coli using standard methods for recombinant protein production (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual Vol. 3. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 17.1-17.44Google Scholar). All TrxR1 recombinant proteins were purified using 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), followed by purification of the dimeric forms using gel filtration (ÄKTA-Explorer HPLC system equipped with Superdex 200 10/30 column, GE Healthcare) (32Rengby O. Cheng Q. Vahter M. Jörnvall H. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 46: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All enzymes were stored in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 30-kDa cut-off ultracentrifuge device (PALL). The enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficient of FAD (13,600 m−1 cm−1 at 463 nm), assuming one FAD per subunit. To remove polyvalent metal ion contaminants, solutions were pretreated with Chelex-100 (4% w/v) for >12 h before use. Experiments under aerobic conditions were conducted in 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes under room air. Experiments under anaerobic conditions were conducted in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI) (4–5% H2, balance N2) as described previously (33Myers C.R. Myers J.M. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Buffers and deionized water were preincubated in the anaerobic chamber for ≥24 h before use, and small volumes of more labile reagents (NADPH, DEPMPO, and TrxR) were pre-equilibrated for ≥4 h. The activity of purified TrxR was measured as the NADPH-dependent reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid (DTNB) (20Arnér E.S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3479-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The system included 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, with 5 mm EDTA, NADPH (0.4 mm), and DTNB (3 mm). Control experiments showed that 4 μm auranofin inhibited essentially all of the DTNB reductase activity in the enzyme preparations, as expected for pure wild-type enzyme (35Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species were assessed at fixed time points using ESR spin trapping essentially as described previously (36Borthiry G.R. Antholine W.E. Kalyanaraman B. Myers J.M. Myers C.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 738-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Solutions were pretreated with Chelex-100 resin for >12 h prior to use. The buffer (final concentration in assay of 0.15 m KCl, 2.5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.35), water, and 0.4 mm NADPH were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. TrxR and DEPMPO (14 mm) were added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times. In some experiments, 50 mm PBN plus 5% DMSO (v/v) were substituted for DEPMPO. The reactions were stopped by immersion in liquid nitrogen (77 K). Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen, typically for less than 1 week, until analysis by ESR. Freezing and thawing do not change the ESR spectra of DEPMPO adducts (37Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 38Tordo P. Gilbert B.C. Atherton N.M. Davies M.J. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance: Specialist Periodical Reports. Vol. 16. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1998: 116-144Google Scholar). For ESR analysis, samples were quickly thawed and placed in a quartz flat cell, and ESR spectra were obtained without delay at room temperature using a Bruker EMX spectrometer. Instrument settings are indicated under “Results.” ESR spectra were confirmed in replicate experiments. The hyperfine couplings were measured from the ESR data and were confirmed using the simulation software WinSim (version 0.95) (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health) (39Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The concentration of each species was obtained by double integration of the simulated spectra using WinSim software. 4-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl was used as the standard. In some experiments, the DEPMPO-superoxide adduct (DEPMPO/HOO•) was preformed, and its decay over time was examined in the presence or absence of various TrxR variants and NADPH. The KO2/18-crown-6 ether system as described by (40Hardy M. Chalier F. Finet J.P. Rockenbauer A. Tordo P. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 70: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 41Chalier F. Hardy M. Ouari O. Rockenbauer A. Tordo P. J. Org. Chem. 2007; 72: 7886-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used to generate O and trap it as DEPMPO/HOO•. Briefly, the system includes 10 mm KO2, 10 mm 18-crown-6, 10% DMSO, and 14 mm DEPMPO in 90 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (final concentrations). After 1 min at room temperature, SOD was added to a final concentration of 1000 units/ml. After 1 min, TrxR variants (to 1.07 μm) and/or NADPH (to 0.4 mm) were added, the sample was loaded into the flat cell, and 30 consecutive ESR spectra were collected, with an acquisition time of 2.8 min/spectrum (84 min total). In some experiments, DEPMPO/HO• was preformed, and its decay over time was examined in the presence or absence of various TrxR variants and NADPH. In 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 14 mm DEPMPO and 0.2 mm DTPA, HO• was generated by the addition of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 to 0.15 mm and H2O2 to 1.7 mm. After 1 min at room temperature, both catalase and SOD were added to 1000 units/ml each. After 1 min, NADPH (to 0.4 mm) and/or TrxR variants (to 1.07 μm) were added, the sample was loaded into the flat cell, and 30 consecutive ESR spectra were collected, with an acquisition time of 2.8 min/spectrum (84 min total). Statistical analyses of three or more groups of data were done using one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer post-test (Prism software, GraphPad). Analyses of two groups of data were done using an unpaired Student's t test (Prism software). Significance was assumed at p < 0.05. To characterize the inherent NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR, the spin trap DEPMPO was used to follow the generation of HO• and O under aerobic conditions in the absence of thioredoxin. In time course studies, the DEPMPO/HO• adduct was the predominant signal observed, and its intensity increased dramatically during the first 30 min (Fig. 1A). This signal matches that of DEPMPO/HO• generated by the positive control (Fig. 1B), and its hyperfine coupling constants (aP = 47.2 G, aH = 13.8 G, aN = 13.8 G) are consistent with those of DEPMPO/HO• (42Karoui H. Hogg N. Fréjaville C. Tordo P. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6000-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These signals were dependent on TrxR activity because they were not seen with just TrxR plus DEPMPO (no NADPH) (Fig. 1A) or with DEPMPO plus NADPH without TrxR (see below). There is a very minor component of the TrxR-generated signal (Fig. 1A) that aligns with that of the O-positive control (Fig. 1C) and whose hyperfine coupling constants match those of DEPMPO/HOO•. The DEPMPO/HOO• signal remained at a low level over time (Fig. 1, A, D, and E), whereas the DEPMPO/HO• component increased dramatically over the first 30–60 min (Fig. 1, A and D). In time courses extending from 5 min to 2 h (Fig. 1D) and from 30 min to 6 h (Fig. 1E), the DEPMPO/HO• signal reached a plateau around 1.5–3 h and was still substantial at 6 h. The in vitro half-lives for the spontaneous decay of the DEPMPO/HOO• and DEPMPO/HO• adducts have been reported as less than 30 min (37Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M.

If production of O or HO• ceased once the maximal intensity of the adduct signals had been reached, there would have been a noticeable decline in their signals at the later times. Their relatively constant levels at the later times imply a continued rate of production sufficient to offset expected in vitro decay. The signal intensity was directly correlated with the amount of TrxR present, and n"
https://openalex.org/W2004818856,"Development of the kidney is initiated when the ureteric bud (UB) branches from the Wolffian duct and invades the overlying metanephric mesenchyme (MM) triggering the mesenchymal/epithelial interactions that are the basis of organ formation. Multiple signaling pathways must be integrated to ensure proper timing and location of the ureteric bud formation.We have used gene targeting to create an Lrp4 null mouse line. The mutation results in early embryonic lethality with a subpenetrant phenotype of kidney agenesis. Ureteric budding is delayed with a failure to stimulate the metanephric mesenchyme in a timely manner, resulting in failure of cellular differentiation and resulting absence of kidney formation in the mouse as well as comparable malformations in humans with Cenani-Lenz syndrome.Lrp4 is a multi-functional receptor implicated in the regulation of several molecular pathways, including Wnt and Bmp signaling. Lrp4(-/-) mice show a delay in ureteric bud formation that results in unilateral or bilateral kidney agenesis. These data indicate that Lrp4 is a critical regulator of UB branching and lack of Lrp4 results in congenital kidney malformations in humans and mice."
https://openalex.org/W2030716084,"Podocyte damage is the basis of many glomerular diseases with ultrastructural changes and decreased expression of components of the slit diaphragm such as nephrin and podocin. Under physiological conditions it is likely that the slit diaphragm underlies permanent renewal processes to indemnify its stability in response to changes in filtration pressure. This would require constant reorganization of the podocyte foot process and the renewal of slit diaphragm components. Thus far, the mechanisms underlying the turnover of slit diaphragm proteins are largely unknown. In this manuscript we examined a mechanism of nephrin endocytosis via CIN85/Ruk(L)-mediated ubiquitination. We can demonstrate that the loss of nephrin expression and onset of the proteinuria in CD2AP(-/-) mice correlates with an increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and expression of CIN85/Ruk(L) in podocytes. In cultured murine podocytes CD2AP deficiency leads to an early ubiquitination of nephrin and podocin after stimulation with fibroblast growth factor-4. Binding assays with different CIN85/Ruk isoforms and mutants showed that nephrin and podocin are binding to the coiled-coil domain of CIN85/Ruk(L). We found that in the presence of CIN85/Ruk(L), which is involved in down-regulation of receptor-tyrosine kinases, nephrin is internalized after stimulation with fibroblast growth factor-4. Interestingly, coexpression of CIN85/Ruk(L) with CD2AP led to a decreased binding of CIN85/Ruk(L) to nephrin and podocin, which indicates a functional competition between CD2AP and CIN85/Ruk(L). Our results support a novel role for CIN85/Ruk(L) in slit diaphragm turnover and proteinuria."
https://openalex.org/W2131288360,"Insects experience a wide array of chemical pressures from plant allelochemicals and pesticides and have developed several effective counterstrategies to cope with such toxins. Among these, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are crucial in plant-insect interactions. Flavin-dependent monooxygenases (FMOs) seem not to play a central role in xenobiotic detoxification in insects, in contrast to mammals. However, the previously identified senecionine N-oxygenase of the arctiid moth Tyria jacobaeae (Lepidoptera) indicates that FMOs have been recruited during the adaptation of this insect to plants that accumulate toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Identification of related FMO-like sequences of various arctiids and other Lepidoptera and their combination with expressed sequence tag (EST) data and sequences emerging from the Bombyx mori genome project show that FMOs in Lepidoptera form a gene family with three members (FMO1 to FMO3). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that FMO3 is only distantly related to lepidopteran FMO1 and FMO2 that originated from a more recent gene duplication event. Within the FMO1 gene cluster, an additional gene duplication early in the arctiid lineage provided the basis for the evolution of the highly specific biochemical, physiological, and behavioral adaptations of these butterflies to pyrrolizidine-alkaloid-producing plants. The genes encoding pyrrolizidine-alkaloid-N-oxygenizing enzymes (PNOs) are transcribed in the fat body and the head of the larvae. An N-terminal signal peptide mediates the transport of the soluble proteins into the hemolymph where PNOs efficiently convert pro-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids into their non-toxic N-oxide derivatives. Heterologous expression of a PNO of the generalist arctiid Grammia geneura produced an N-oxygenizing enzyme that shows noticeably expanded substrate specificity compared with the related enzyme of the specialist Tyria jacobaeae. The data about the evolution of FMOs within lepidopteran insects and the functional characterization of a further member of this enzyme family shed light on this almost uncharacterized detoxification system in insects."
https://openalex.org/W2009371005,"The intentional re-introduction of Variola virus (VARV), the agent of smallpox, into the human population is of great concern due its bio-terroristic potential. Moreover, zoonotic infections with Cowpox (CPXV) and Monkeypox virus (MPXV) cause severe diseases in humans. Smallpox vaccines presently available can have severe adverse effects that are no longer acceptable. The efficacy and safety of new vaccines and antiviral drugs for use in humans can only be demonstrated in animal models. The existing nonhuman primate models, using VARV and MPXV, need very high viral doses that have to be applied intravenously or intratracheally to induce a lethal infection in macaques. To overcome these drawbacks, the infectivity and pathogenicity of a particular CPXV was evaluated in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). A CPXV named calpox virus was isolated from a lethal orthopox virus (OPV) outbreak in New World monkeys. We demonstrated that marmosets infected with calpox virus, not only via the intravenous but also the intranasal route, reproducibly develop symptoms resembling smallpox in humans. Infected animals died within 1–3 days after onset of symptoms, even when very low infectious viral doses of 5×102 pfu were applied intranasally. Infectious virus was demonstrated in blood, saliva and all organs analyzed. We present the first characterization of a new OPV infection model inducing a disease in common marmosets comparable to smallpox in humans. Intranasal virus inoculation mimicking the natural route of smallpox infection led to reproducible infection. In vivo titration resulted in an MID50 (minimal monkey infectious dose 50%) of 8.3×102 pfu of calpox virus which is approximately 10,000-fold lower than MPXV and VARV doses applied in the macaque models. Therefore, the calpox virus/marmoset model is a suitable nonhuman primate model for the validation of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Furthermore, this model can help study mechanisms of OPV pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2107624905,"Prolonged alcohol consumption in humans followed by abstinence precipitates a withdrawal syndrome consisting of anxiety, agitation and in severe cases, seizures. Withdrawal is relieved by a low dose of alcohol, a negative reinforcement that contributes to alcohol dependency. This phenomenon of 'withdrawal relief' provides evidence of an ethanol-induced adaptation which resets the balance of signalling in neural circuits. We have used this as a criterion to distinguish between direct and indirect ethanol-induced adaptive behavioural responses in C. elegans with the goal of investigating the genetic basis of ethanol-induced neural plasticity. The paradigm employs a 'food race assay' which tests sensorimotor performance of animals acutely and chronically treated with ethanol. We describe a multifaceted C. elegans 'withdrawal syndrome'. One feature, decrease reversal frequency is not relieved by a low dose of ethanol and most likely results from an indirect adaptation to ethanol caused by inhibition of feeding and a food-deprived behavioural state. However another aspect, an aberrant behaviour consisting of spontaneous deep body bends, did show withdrawal relief and therefore we suggest this is the expression of ethanol-induced plasticity. The potassium channel, slo-1, which is a candidate ethanol effector in C. elegans, is not required for the responses described here. However a mutant deficient in neuropeptides, egl-3, is resistant to withdrawal (although it still exhibits acute responses to ethanol). This dependence on neuropeptides does not involve the NPY-like receptor npr-1, previously implicated in C. elegans ethanol withdrawal. Therefore other neuropeptide pathways mediate this effect. These data resonate with mammalian studies which report involvement of a number of neuropeptides in chronic responses to alcohol including corticotrophin-releasing-factor (CRF), opioids, tachykinins as well as NPY. This suggests an evolutionarily conserved role for neuropeptides in ethanol-induced plasticity and opens the way for a genetic analysis of the effects of alcohol on a simple model system."
https://openalex.org/W2001021612,"Adult human heart mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has recently been shown to have a complex organization with abundant dimeric molecules, branched structures and four-way junctions. In order to understand the physiological significance of the heart-specific mtDNA maintenance mode and to find conditions that modify human heart mtDNA structure and replication, we analyzed healthy human heart of various ages as well as several different heart diseases, including ischemic heart disease, dilated as well as hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, and several mitochondrial disorders. By using one- and two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, various enzymatic treatments and quantitative PCR we found that in human newborns heart mtDNA has a simple organization, lacking junctional forms and dimers. The adult-type branched forms are acquired in the early childhood, correlating with an increase in mtDNA copy number. Mitochondrial disorders involving either mutations in the mtDNA polymerase gamma (PolGalpha) or mtDNA helicase Twinkle, while having no obvious cardiac manifestation, show distinct mtDNA maintenance phenotypes, which are not seen in various types of diseased heart or in mitochondrial disorders caused by point mutations or large-scale deletions of mtDNA. The findings suggest a link between cardiac muscle development, mtDNA copy number, replication mode and topological organization. Additionally, we show that Twinkle might have a direct role in the maintenance of four-way junctions in human heart mtDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2087033914,"The signaling molecule 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) has been described as the ""anti-inflammatory prostaglandin."" Here we show that substrates of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 accumulate in the nucleus in the presence of 15d-PGJ(2), identifying this prostaglandin as a regulator of CRM1-dependent nuclear protein export that can be produced endogenously. Like leptomycin B (LMB), an established fungal CRM1-inhibitor, 15d-PGJ(2) reacts with a conserved cysteine residue in the CRM1 sequence. This covalent modification prevents the formation of nuclear export complexes. Cells that are transfected with mutant CRM1 (C528S) are resistant to the inhibitory effects of LMB and 15d-PGJ(2), demonstrating that the same single amino acid is targeted by the two compounds. Inhibition of the CRM1 pathway by endogenously produced prostaglandin and/or exogenously applied 15d-PGJ(2) may contribute to its anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-viral effects."

Our prior work demonstrated that PF4−/− mice are protected from ECM, have reduced plasma cytokines, and have reduced T-cell trafficking to the brain. We now show that PF4 drives monocyte cytokine production in a Kruppel like factor 4 (KLF4) dependent manner. Monocyte depleted Plasmodium berghei infected mice have improved survival, and KLF4 is greatly increased in control, but not monocyte depleted mice. PF4−/− mice have less cerebral monocyte trafficking and no change in KLF4 expression. These data indicate that PF4 induction of monocyte KLF4 expression may be an important step in the pathogenesis of ECM."

Our goal was to investigate the effects of the site of OA (knee, hip, hand, foot, lower back or neck) on employment reduction due to OA (EROA). Methods and Findings This study involved a random sample of 6,000 patients with OA selected from the Medical Service Plan database in British Columbia, Canada. A total of 5,491 were alive and had valid addresses, and of these, 2,259 responded (response rate = 41%), from which 2,134 provided usable data. Eligible participants were 19 or older with physician diagnosed OA based on administrative data between 1992 and 2006. Data of 688 residents were used (mean age 62.1 years (27 to 86); 60% women). EROA had three levels: no reduction; reduced hours; and total cessation due to OA. The (log) odds of EROA was regressed on OA sites, adjusting for age, sex, education and comorbidity. Odds ratios (ORs) represented the effect predicting total cessation and reduced hours/total cessation. The strongest effect was found in lower back OA, with OR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.47, 2.94), followed by neck (OR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.27) and knee (OR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.01). We found an interaction between sex and foot OA (men: OR = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.59; women: OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.57, 1.39). No significant effect was found for hip OA (OR = 1.33) or hand OA (OR = 1.11). Limitations of this study included a modest response rate, the lack of an OA negative group, the use of administrative databases to identify eligible participants, and the use of patient self-reported data. Conclusions After adjusting for socio-demographic variables, comorbidity, and other OA disease sites, we find that OA of the lower back, neck and knee are significant predictors for EROA. Foot OA is only significantly associated with EROA in males. For multi-site combinations, ORs are multiplicative. These findings may be used to guide resource allocation for future development/improvement of vocational rehabilitation programs for site-specific OA."
https://openalex.org/W2070174719,"The Trypanosoma brucei genome has four highly similar genes encoding sphingolipid synthases (TbSLS1-4). TbSLSs are polytopic membrane proteins that are essential for viability of the pathogenic bloodstream stage of this human protozoan parasite and, consequently, can be considered as potential drug targets. TbSLS4 was shown previously to be a bifunctional sphingomyelin/ethanolamine phosphorylceramide synthase, whereas functions of the others were not characterized. Using a recently described liposome-supplemented cell-free synthesis system, which eliminates complications from background cellular activities, we now unambiguously define the enzymatic specificity of the entire gene family. TbSLS1 produces inositol phosphorylceramide, TbSLS2 produces ethanolamine phosphorylceramide, and TbSLS3 is bifunctional, like TbSLS4. These findings indicate that TbSLS1 is uniquely responsible for synthesis of inositol phosphorylceramide in insect stage parasites, in agreement with published expression array data (17). This approach also revealed that the Trypanosoma cruzi ortholog (TcSLS1) is a dedicated inositol phosphorylceramide synthase. The cell-free synthesis system allowed rapid optimization of the reaction conditions for these enzymes and site-specific mutagenesis to alter end product specificity. A single residue at position 252 (TbSLS1, Ser(252); TbSLS3, Phe(252)) strongly influences enzymatic specificity. We also have used this system to demonstrate that aureobasidin A, a potent inhibitor of fungal inositol phosphorylceramide synthases, does not significantly affect any of the TbSLS activities, consistent with the phylogenetic distance of these two clades of sphingolipid synthases. These results represent the first application of cell-free synthesis for the rapid preparation and functional annotation of integral membrane proteins and thus illustrate its utility in studying otherwise intractable enzyme systems."
https://openalex.org/W2030378841,"The prevalent way aphids accomplish colony defense against natural enemies is a mutualistic relationship with ants or the occurrence of a specialised soldier caste typical for eusocial aphids, or even both. Despite a group-living life style of those aphid species lacking these defense lines, communal defense against natural predators has not yet been observed there. Individuals of Aphis nerii (Oleander aphid) and Uroleucon hypochoeridis, an aphid species feeding on Hypochoeris radicata (hairy cat's ear), show a behavioral response to visual stimulation in the form of spinning or twitching, which is often accompanied by coordinated kicks executed with hind legs. Interestingly, this behaviour is highly synchronized among members of a colony and repetitive visual stimulation caused strong habituation. Observations of natural aphid colonies revealed that a collective twitching and kicking response (CTKR) was frequently evoked during oviposition attempts of the parasitoid wasp Aphidius colemani and during attacks of aphidophagous larvae. CTKR effectively interrupted oviposition attempts of this parasitoid wasp and even repelled this parasitoid from colonies after evoking consecutive CTKRs. In contrast, solitary feeding A. nerii individuals were not able to successfully repel this parasitoid wasp. In addition, CTKR was also evoked through gentle substrate vibrations. Laser vibrometry of the substrate revealed twitching-associated vibrations that form a train of sharp acceleration peaks in the course of a CTKR. This suggests that visual signals in combination with twitching-related substrate vibrations may play an important role in synchronising defense among members of a colony. In both aphid species collective defense in encounters with different natural enemies was executed in a stereotypical way and was similar to CTKR evoked through visual stimulation. This cooperative defense behavior provides an example of a surprising sociality that can be found in some aphid species that are not expected to be social at all."
https://openalex.org/W2034555774,"Background Lycopene, selenium, and vitamin E are three micronutrients commonly consumed and supplemented by men diagnosed with prostate cancer. However, it is not clear whether consumption of these compounds, alone or in combination, results in improved outcomes. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the effects of dietary lycopene (250 mg/kg diet), selenium (methylselenocysteine, 1 mg/kg diet), and vitamin E (γ-tocopherol, 200 mg/kg diet) alone and in combination on the growth of androgen-dependent Dunning R3327-H rat prostate adenocarcinomas in male, Copenhagen rats. AIN-93G diets containing these micronutrients were prefed for 4 to 6 weeks prior to tumor implantation by subcutaneous injection. Tumors were allowed to grow for ∼18 weeks. Across diet groups, methylselenocysteine consumption decreased final tumor area (P = 0.003), tumor weight (P = 0.003), and the tumor weight/body weight ratio (P = 0.003), but lycopene and γ-tocopherol consumption intake did not alter any of these measures. There were no significant interactions among nutrient combinations on tumor growth. Methylselenocysteine consumption also led to small, but significant decreases in body weight (P = 0.007), food intake (P = 0.012), and body weight gain/food intake ratio (P = 0.022). However, neither body weight nor gain/food intake ratio was correlated with tumor weight. Methylselenocysteine, lycopene, and γ-tocopherol consumed alone and in combination did not alter serum testosterone or dihydrotestosterone concentrations; tumor proliferation or apoptosis rates. In addition, the diets also did not alter tumor or prostate androgen receptor, probasin, selenoprotein 15, selenoprotein P, or selenium binding protein 2 mRNA expression. However, using castration and finasteride-treated tissues from a previous study, we found that androgen ablation altered expression of these selenium-associated proteins.

We here investigated whether angptl4 mRNA 1) could be a useful diagnostic and/or prognostic marker of ccRCC in a large and comprehensive retrospective series, 2) induction is dependent on the VHL status of tumors.Using in situ hybridization, we report that angptl4 mRNA is expressed in 100% of both sporadic (n = 102) and inherited (n = 6) primary ccRCCs, without any statistical association with nuclear grade (p = 0.39), tumor size (p = 0.09), stage grouping (p = 0.17), progression-free survival (p = 0.94), and overall survival (p = 0.80). Angptl4 mRNA was also expressed in 26 (87%) of 30 secondary ccRCCs but neither in any other secondary RCCs (n = 7). In contrast, angptl4 mRNA was neither expressed in 94% non-ccRCC renal tumors (papillary RCCs (n = 46), chromophobe RCCs (n = 28), and oncocytomas (n = 9)), nor in non-renal clear cell carcinomas (n = 39). Angptl4 expression was also examined in tumors associated (n = 23) or not associated (n = 66) with VHL disease. 40 (98%) hemangioblastomas expressed angptl4 whereas all pheochromocytomas (n = 23) and pancreatic tumors (n = 25) were angptl4-negative, whatever their VHL status.Angptl4 mRNA expression was highly associated with ccRCC (p = 1.5 10(-49), Chi square test) allowing to define its expression as a diagnosis marker for primary ccRCC. Moreover, angptl4 mRNA allows to discriminate the renal origin of metastases of clear-cell carcinomas arising from various organs. Finally, inactivation of VHL gene is neither necessary nor sufficient for angptl4 mRNA induction."
https://openalex.org/W2030714871,"Hsc70s are constitutively synthesized members of the 70-kDa chaperone family; they are essential for viability and conserved among all organisms. When eukaryotic cells recover from stress, hsc70s accumulate in nucleoli by an unknown mechanism. Our studies were undertaken to characterize the signaling events and the targeting sequence required to concentrate hsc70 in the nucleoli of human cells. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and MEK kinases as well as protein-tyrosine phosphatases abolished the stress-dependent nucleolar accumulation of hsc70. Furthermore, to identify the hsc70 nucleolar targeting sequence, green fluorescent protein-tagged fusion proteins with defined segments of hsc70 were generated and their subcellular distribution was analyzed in growing cells. These studies demonstrated that residues 225 to 297 serve as a heat-inducible nucleolar targeting signal. This segment directs green fluorescent protein to nucleoli in response to stress, but fails to do so under nonstress conditions. Fine mapping of the nucleolar targeting signal revealed that it has two separable functions. First, residues 225 to 262 direct reporter proteins constitutively to nucleoli, even without stress. Second, segment 263 to 287 functions as an autoinhibitory element that prevents hsc70 from concentrating in nucleoli when cells are not stressed. Taken together, PI 3-kinase and MEK kinase signaling as well as tyrosine dephosphorylation are essential for the accumulation of hsc70 in nucleoli of stressed cells. This process relies on a stress-dependent composite targeting signal that combines multiple functions."
https://openalex.org/W2083921018,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. Improvement of treatment efficacy and decreased side effects through tumor-targeted drug delivery would be desirable. By panning with a phage-displayed cyclic random peptide library we selected a peptide with strong affinity for RMS in vitro and in vivo. The peptide minimal binding motif Arg-X-(Arg/Lys)(Arg/Lys) identified by alanine-scan, suggested the target receptor to be a proprotein convertase (PC). Expression profiling of all PCs in RMS biopsies and cell lines revealed consistent high expression levels for the membrane-bound furin and PC7. Direct binding of RMS-P3 peptide to furin was demonstrated by affinity chromatography and supported by activity and colocalization studies. Treatment of RMS in mice with doxorubicin coupled to the targeting peptide resulted in a two-fold increase in therapeutic efficacy compared to doxorubicin treatment alone. Our findings indicate surface-furin binding as novel mechanism for therapeutic cell penetration which needs to be further investigated. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that specific targeting of membrane-bound furin in tumors is possible for and suggests that RMS and other tumors might benefit from proprotein convertases targeted drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2081809644,"Increased expression of metalloprotease-disintegrin ADAM12 is a hallmark of several pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and certain inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system or the muscoskeletal system. We show that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) is a potent inducer of ADAM12 mRNA and protein in mouse fibroblasts and in mouse and human mammary epithelial cells. Induction of ADAM12 is detected within 2 h of treatment with TGFbeta1, is Smad2/Smad3-dependent, and is a result of derepression of the Adam12 gene. SnoN, a negative regulator of the TGFbeta signaling pathway, is a master regulator of ADAM12 expression in response to TGFbeta1 stimulation. Overexpression of SnoN in NIH3T3 cells reduces the magnitude of ADAM12 induction by TGFbeta1 treatment. Down-regulation of SnoN expression by short hairpin RNA enhances TGFbeta1-induced expression of ADAM12. In a panel of TGFbeta1-responsive cancer cell lines with high expression of SnoN, induction of ADAM12 by TGFbeta1 is significantly impaired, suggesting that the endogenous SnoN plays a role in regulating ADAM12 expression in response to TGFbeta1. Identification of SnoN as a repressor of the ADAM12 gene should contribute to advances in the studies on the role of ADAM12 in tumor progression and in the development of other pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2043247292,"Background Repeated exposures to UVB of human keratinocytes lacking functional p16INK-4a and able to differentiate induce an alternative state of differentiation rather than stress-induced premature senescence. Methodology/Principal Findings A 2D-DIGE proteomic profiling of this alternative state of differentiation was performed herein at various times after the exposures to UVB. Sixty-nine differentially abundant protein species were identified by mass spectrometry, many of which are involved in keratinocyte differentiation and survival. Among these protein species was TRIpartite Motif Protein 29 (TRIM29). Increased abundance of TRIM29 following UVB exposures was validated by Western blot using specific antibody and was also further analysed by immunochemistry and by RT-PCR. TRIM29 was found very abundant in keratinocytes and reconstructed epidermis. Knocking down the expression of TRIM29 by short-hairpin RNA interference decreased the viability of keratinocytes after UVB exposure. The abundance of involucrin mRNA, a marker of late differentiation, increased concomitantly. In TRIM29-knocked down reconstructed epidermis, the presence of picnotic cells revealed cell injury. Increased abundance of TRIM29 was also observed upon exposure to DNA damaging agents and PKC activation. The UVB-induced increase of TRIM29 abundance was dependent on a PKC signaling pathway, likely PKCδ. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that TRIM29 allows keratinocytes to enter a protective alternative differentiation process rather than die massively after stress."
https://openalex.org/W2043886213,"The key gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is induced when Saccharomyces cerevisiae are starved of glucose. However, when glucose is added to cells that have been starved for 3 days, FBPase is degraded in the vacuole. FBPase is first imported to Vid (vacuole import and degradation) vesicles, and these vesicles then merge with the endocytic pathway. In this report we show that two additional gluconeogenic enzymes, isocitrate lyase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, were also degraded in the vacuole via the Vid pathway. These new cargo proteins and FBPase interacted with the TORC1 complex during glucose starvation. However, Tor1p was dissociated from FBPase after the addition of glucose. FBPase degradation was inhibited in cells overexpressing TOR1, suggesting that excessive Tor1p is inhibitory. Both Tco89p and Tor1p were found in endosomes coming from the plasma membrane as well as in retrograde vesicles forming from the vacuole membrane. When TORC1 was inactivated by rapamycin, FBPase degradation was inhibited. We suggest that TORC1 interacts with multiple cargo proteins destined for the Vid pathway and plays an important role in the degradation of FBPase in the vacuole.

https://openalex.org/W2076069243,"Iron deficiency and other stress conditions strongly impact photosynthetic apparatus in photosynthetic organisms. Two novel chlorophyll (Chl)-containing supercomplexes (F4 and F5) in addition to the photosystem (PS) I trimers (F3) were observed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation in Synechocystis PCC 6803 under extensive iron starvation. 77K fluorescence and Western blot analyses of these supercomplexes revealed that they all contained IsiA. The F4 was identified as an IsiA-PSI-PSII supercomplex, while the F5 was assigned as an IsiA-PSI supercomplex. Deletion of isiA resulted in diminishing the PSI trimers (including the PSI trimers in iron-replete cells) and the two novel PSI supercomplexes (F4 and F5), and a significant reduction in the saturated whole-chain electron transport rate. However, the maximum PSII activities remained at levels similar to those of the wild type under various light conditions. The isiA- mutant was defective in state transition and sensitive to high light. The sensitivity of the isiA- mutant to high light was correlated with a higher level of membrane peroxidation. These results demonstrated that IsiA is required for the formation of PSI trimers and other higher complexes, and that IsiA is critical for efficient state transition."
https://openalex.org/W2076735416,"Background Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; Kininase II; CD143) hydrolyzes small peptides such as angiotensin I, bradykinin, substance P, LH-RH and several others and thus plays a key role in blood pressure regulation and vascular remodeling. Complete absence of ACE in humans leads to renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD), a severe disorder of renal tubule development characterized by persistent fetal anuria and perinatal death. Methodology/Principal Findings Patient with RTD in Lisbon, Portugal, maintained by peritoneal dialysis since birth, was found to have a homozygous substitution of Arg for Glu at position 1069 in the C-terminal domain of ACE (Q1069R) resulting in absence of plasma ACE activity; both parents and a brother who are heterozygous carriers of this mutation had exactly half-normal plasma ACE activity compared to healthy individuals. We hypothesized that the Q1069R substitution impaired ACE trafficking to the cell surface and led to accumulation of catalytically inactive ACE in the cell cytoplasm. CHO cells expressing wild-type (WT) vs. Q1069R-ACE demonstrated the mutant accumulates intracellularly and also that it is significantly degraded by intracellular proteases. Q1069R-ACE retained catalytic and immunological characteristics of WT-ACE N domain whereas it had 10–20% of the nativity of the WT-ACE C domain. A combination of chemical (sodium butyrate) or pharmacological (ACE inhibitor) chaperones with proteasome inhibitors (MG 132 or bortezomib) significantly restored trafficking of Q1069R-ACE to the cell surface and increased ACE activity in the cell culture media 4-fold. Conclusions/Significance Homozygous Q1069R substitution results in an ACE trafficking and processing defect which can be rescued, at least in cell culture, by a combination of chaperones and proteasome inhibitors. Further studies are required to determine whether similar treatment of individuals with this ACE mutation would provide therapeutic benefits such as concentration of primary urine."

It is also involved in several human malignancies. Tyrosine phosphorylation at the Vav1 amino terminus plays a central role in regulating its activity; however, the role of carboxyl terminal tyrosine residues is unknown. We found that mutation of either Tyr-826 (Y826F) or Tyr-841 (Y841F) to phenylalanine led to loss of Vav1 GEF activity. When these Vav1 mutants were ectopically expressed in pancreatic cancer cells lacking Vav1, they failed to induce growth in agar, indicating loss of transforming potential. Furthermore, although Y841F had no effect on Vav1-stimulated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity, Y826F doubled NFAT activity when compared with Vav1, suggesting that Tyr-826 mediates an autoinhibitory effect on NFAT activity. SH2 profiling revealed that Shc, Csk, Abl, and Sap associate with Tyr-826, whereas SH2-B, Src, Brk, GTPase-activating protein, and phospholipase C-γ associate with Tyr-841. Although the mutations in the Tyr-826 and Tyr-841 did not affect the binding of the carboxyl SH3 of Vav1 to other proteins, binding to several of the proteins identified by the SH2 profiling was lost. Of interest is Csk, which associates with wild-type Vav1 and Y841F, yet it fails to associate with Y826F, suggesting that loss of binding between Y826F and Csk might relieve an autoinhibitory effect, leading to increased NFAT.

In addition to its importance in normal signal transduction, aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation has been observed in various pathological conditions, particularly in development and progression of cancer (6.Blume-Jensen P.

These modular domains serve to couple tyrosine phosphorylation to the assembly of signaling complexes and the relocalization of signaling proteins and thus play a central role in downstream signaling. By far the most abundant such module in humans is the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (10.Machida K. Mayer B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1747: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).

Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Vav1 encodes a unique protein with several motifs known to play a role in tyrosine-mediated signal transduction, including a diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DBL) homology (DH)2 domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an SH2 domain, and two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (13.Katzav S.

The best known function of Vav1 is as a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Rho/Rac, a function strictly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation (16.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Rho/Rac activation leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement during activation of T cells (17.Hornstein I. Alcover A.

Bautista D.M. Davidson L. Lewis R.S. Alt F.W. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vav1 also functions independently of its exchange activities, acting as a scaffold protein that leads to modulation of the JNK, ERK, Ras, NF-κB, and NFAT pathways (14.Tybulewicz V.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 15.Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These effects are likely mediated by the modular domains of Vav1 such as SH2 and SH3, which interact with other proteins, including Shc, NCK, SLP-76, ZAP-70, GRB2, and Crk (14.Tybulewicz V.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 15.Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The regulation of the activity of Vav1 is attributed in part to its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues at the amino terminus (Tyr-140, -160, -174). Substitution of the three tyrosines at the amino terminus to phenylalanine generated the Vav1 × 3YF mutant, which increased stimulation of NFAT transcription, enhanced GEF activity toward Rac, and promoted increased focus formation in agar when ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells and leading to its increased GEF activity (20.López-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A solution structure of the Vav1 DH domain, including residues 170–189 of the Ac region, shows that Tyr-174 lies within an α helix that binds to part of the GTPase interaction site, occluding access to the GTPase. Phosphorylation of Tyr-174 causes dissociation of this helix from the DH domain, relieving the autoinhibition (21.Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Internal dynamics are required for and control both basal activity and full activation of the autoinhibited DH domain (22.Li P. Martins I.R. Amarasinghe G.K. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recent high resolution x-ray structure of the DH-PH-C1 domains of Vav1 in complex with Rac1 revealed a novel mechanism of Vav1 regulation; the PH and C1 domains contribute to efficient GEF activity by stabilizing the DH domain structure rather than by direct contact with GTPase (23.Rapley J. Tybulewicz V.L. Rittinger K. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the contribution and importance of Tyr-142, -160, -174 have been studied in depth, the significance of other tyrosine residues in Vav1 has not been analyzed. Recently, several of the carboxyl Vav1 tyrosine residues were shown to be phosphorylated in cancer cells and in Jurkat T cells (24.Rikova K. Guo A. Zeng Q. Possemato A. Yu J. Haack H. Nardone J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50121-50130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells were then resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and grown for an additional 48 h before use in the various experiments. Transfection of HEK293T was performed using calcium phosphate reagents. To facilitate comparison of Vav1 mutants, we cloned all cDNAs in the same plasmid backbone. We utilized the pMEX vector, a noncommercial mammalian expression plasmid that regulates gene expression through the murine mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat promoter for studies in Jurkat T cells, J.Vav1, and Panc1. GST fusion proteins that we used were described previously (12.Machida K. Thompson C.M. Dierck K. Jablonowski K. Kärkkäinen S. Liu B. Zhang H. Nash P.D. Newman D.K. Nollau P. Pawson T. Renkema G.H.

Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli bacteria and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (32.Lazer G. Pe'er L. Schapira V. Richard S. Katzav S. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2479-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33.Katzav S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1757-1763PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-Vav1 antibodies were raised in rabbits against a specific peptide of Vav1, residues 528–541 (34.Groysman M. Nagano M. Shaanan B. Katzav S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1597-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used are anti-Tyr(P) (4G10) monoclonal anti-Vav1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); anti-Myc (clone 9E10), anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology; anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma); anti-CD28 (R&D Systems); anti-CD3 (OKT3, IgG2a; American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA); rabbit Anti-CSK polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology); and monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG and native peroxidase antibody produced in mouse (clone RabT-50, Sigma) that do not detect the heavy chain of the antibodies. Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously (32.Lazer G. Pe'er L. Schapira V. Richard S. Katzav S. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2479-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). J.Vav1 T cells were transfected as described (35.Katzav S. Cleveland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with the following plasmids (8 μg unless otherwise indicated): pSK115 encoding wild-type Vav1, empty vector, NFAT-luc, and Renilla. Eighteen hours later, cells were activated with anti-CD3 for 6 h and then lysed. Luciferase activity was measured with a Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9506; Berthold Technology). Relative luciferase activity was defined as the ratio of firefly luc activity to Renilla luc activity. Panc1 cells (2.5 × 106) were transfected with 4 μg of empty vector, Vav1, or Vav1 mutants together with 1 μg of FLAG epitope-tagged Rac plasmid as indicated. The extent of GTP-bound Rac to P21-activated kinase was determined as described previously (36.Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The soft agar assay was carried out in 6-well culture dishes. The bottom of each well was coated with 3 ml of medium containing 0.8% soft agar. Triplicates of 1 × 105 cells were plated on top in 3 ml of medium containing 0.3% soft agar. Experiments were repeated three times. Cells were fed every 3rd day with 0.3 ml of medium. After 14 days, colonies were counted. Mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenesis was performed on a plasmid encoding wild-type Vav1 in pMEX, a vector capable of driving high levels of protein expression via its mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat. The primers used were as follows (the substituted nucleotide is bold and underlined): Y826F, 5′-GGGGAAATCTTTGGCCGGGTTGGCTG-3′ and 3′-CCACCACTCCCCTTTAGAAACCGGCC-5′; Y836F, 5′-GCCAACTTCGTGGAGGAAGATTATTCTG-3′ and 3′-CCAAGGGACGGTTGAAGCACCTCCTTC-5′; Y841F, 5′-GATTTTTCTGAATACTGCTGAGCCCTGGTG-3′ and 3′-GCACCTCCTTCTAAAAAGACTTATGACGAC-5′; Y844F, 5′-GAATTCTGCTGAGCCCTGGTGCCTTGGC-3′ and 3′-CTACTAAGACTTAAGACGACTCGGGACC-5′. The plasmids were sequenced to verify the introduction of the appropriate mutations. N-terminal biotinylated peptides corresponding to human Vav1 Tyr-826 (RGEIYGRVGWFP) and Tyr-841 (ANYVEEDYSEYC), both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms, were synthesized (GL Biochem Ltd. and CASLO Laboratory ApS, respectively). A nitrocellulose membrane with pore size 0.1 μm (BA79, Schleicher & Schuell) was coated with 0.5% gelatin (G-2500, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Peptides were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide, diluted in spotting solution (180 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 6% SDS, 15% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% bromphenol blue) at 15 mm, and manually spotted onto the dried membrane in multiple duplicate arrays (0.1 μl/spot). After drying, the arrayed membrane was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate-buffered saline solution at room temperature for 5 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in equilibration buffer (10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 20% methanol) for 30 min, and then blocked for 1 h in TBST (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% nonfat milk, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm NA3VO4. N-terminal GST-tagged human SH2/PTB domains were prepared and labeled as described (12.Machida K. Thompson C.M. Dierck K. Jablonowski K. Kärkkäinen S. Liu B. Zhang H. Nash P.D. Newman D.K. Nollau P.

Mayer B.J. Nollau P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 527 (ix): 131-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Each SH2/PTB probe was incubated at a concentration of 4 μg/ml with a set of peptide spots in separate wells of a 96-well chamber plate. After ECL-based detection and densitometric quantitation, resulting values were used to compare different peptides and SH2/PTB probes. Vav1 encodes four tyrosine residues at its most carboxyl terminus: Tyr-826, Tyr-836, Tyr-841, and Tyr-844 (Fig. 1A). Tyr-826 and Tyr-836 are embedded within the carboxyl SH3 region of Vav1, whereas Tyr-841 and Tyr-844 are located outside of the SH3 region (Fig. 1A). All four of these tyrosine residues are conserved among mammalian Vav1 proteins (Fig. 1B), suggesting their importance. However, only Tyr-836 is conserved between human Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3 proteins (Fig. 1C). To explore the role of these C-terminal tyrosines in the physiological functions of Vav1, we substituted phenylalanine for tyrosine at each of these residues individually, creating the mutants Y836F, Y844F, Y826F, and Y841F. Because Vav1 participates in multiple signaling pathways with very different outcomes, we used two different experimental systems to assess the effects of these tyrosine mutants. T cells, where Vav1 is normally expressed, serve as a model for the physiological actions of Vav1 (13.Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 14.Tybulewicz V.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 15.Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells, in which Vav1 is usually absent but might be ectopically expressed in human malignancies, are a model for its pathological actions (29.Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Gonzalez-Paz N.C. Weiss E. Savoy D.N. Molina J.R. Fonseca R. Smyrk T.C. Chari S.T. Urrutia R. Billadeau D.D. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 38.Hornstein I. Pikarsky E. Groysman M. Amir G. Peylan-Ramu N. Katzav S. J.

We first analyzed whether the mutants that we created are phosphorylated following activation of Vav1 in T cells. For that purpose, J.Vav1 cells, derivatives of Jurkat T cells in which Vav1 expression was knocked down (28.Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D.D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), were transfected with an empty vector, Vav1, Y826F, Y836F, Y841F, or Y844F (Fig. 2A) and activated using anti-CD3 and CD28 mAbs to stimulate the T cell receptor (TCR). Western blotting revealed no difference in overall tyrosine phosphorylation between Vav1 and any of the mutant proteins. This is probably because phosphorylation at other tyrosine residues in Vav1 masks any change in phosphorylation at the single residues that we mutated (Fig. 2A). Vav1 appears to be necessary for full activation of the transcription factor NFAT following TCR stimulation (35.Katzav S. Cleveland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To analyze the ability of our Vav1 tyrosine mutants to stimulate NFAT, we co-transfected J.Vav1 cells with a luciferase reporter driven by a promoter containing NFAT binding sites and plasmids encoding either Vav1 or the Vav1 mutants (Fig. 2B). Following activation of the TCR by anti-CD3 and CD28 mAbs, we assessed luciferase activity in cell extracts. As expected, in cells transfected with Vav1, luciferase activity increased significantly following TCR activation. In cells transfected with the Vav1 mutants Y836F, Y841F, and Y844F, TCR activation induced luciferase activity to levels similar to those obtained with wild-type Vav1. Surprisingly, transfection with Y826F doubled the luciferase activity when compared with Vav1, suggesting that this tyrosine residue contributes to an autoinhibitory effect on Vav1-stimulated NFAT activity (Fig. 2B). We and others have detected ectopic expression of Vav1 in neuroblastoma (38.Hornstein I. Pikarsky E. Groysman M. Amir G. Peylan-Ramu N. Katzav S. J. Pathol. 2003; 199: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (29.Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Gonzalez-Paz N.C. Weiss E. Savoy D.N. Molina J.R. Fonseca R. Smyrk T.C. Chari S.T. Urrutia R. Billadeau D.D. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and lung cancer (39.Lazer G. Idelchuk Y. Schapira V. Pikarsky E. Katzav S. J. Pathol. 2009; 219: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Vav1 plays a role as a signal transducer protein in these malignancies, and amino acid substitutions of tyrosines at the amino terminus of Vav1 have been shown to enhance its ability to transform fibroblasts (20.López-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to analyze whether the C-terminal Tyr mutants maintain transforming ability. Panc1 cells, pancreatic cancer cells that do not express Vav1, were previously shown to be highly useful in analyzing the transforming ability of Vav1 and several of its mutants (29.Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Gonzalez-Paz N.C. Weiss E. Savoy D.N. Molina J.R. Fonseca R. Smyrk T.C. Chari S.T. Urrutia R. Billadeau D.D. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Panc1 cells were transfected with an empty vector, Vav1, Y826F, Y836F, Y841F, or Y844F and stimulated with EGF (Fig. 3A). Vav1 and all of the mutants were highly phosphorylated in Panc1 cells following EGF treatment. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 and the mutants was more dramatic following stimulation of Panc1 cells with EGF than following TCR stimulation in J.Vav1 cells (Fig. 3A versus Fig. 2A). This may stem from the fact that there are several kinases in J.Vav1 cells (Lck, Fyn, hematopoietic cell kinase, and more) that phosphorylate Vav1 in the absence of stimulation, creating higher basal levels of phosphorylation. These kinases are not expressed in Panc1 cells. To test whether substitution of any of the C-terminal Tyr residues affects the transforming potential of Vav1, we assessed the effect of our mutants on Panc1 growth in soft agar. Although Panc1 cells transfected with Vav1 exhibit enhanced growth in agar when compared with cells transfected with vector only as reported previously (29.Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Gonzalez-Paz N.C. Weiss E. Savoy D.N. Molina J.R. Fonseca R. Smyrk T.C. Chari S.T. Urrutia R. Billadeau D.D. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), cells transfected with the Vav1 C-terminal tyrosine mutants did not; the number of foci formed in cells transfected with any of the mutants was not significantly different from cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the size of the foci formed by Panc1 cells transfected with vector only or with any of the Vav1 mutants was considerably smaller than those formed by cells transfected with wild-type Vav1 (Fig. 3C). Thus, all four of the tyrosine residues at the carboxyl terminus of Vav1 are required for its transforming activity in Panc1 cells. We chose to investigate two of these carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues, Tyr-826 and Tyr-841, more completely for the following reasons. Bioinformatics analysis predicts that Tyr-826 and Tyr-841 are the likeliest to be phosphorylated (0.95 and 0.969 score respectively; NetPhos 2.0 Server). In addition, these tyrosine residues are conserved in Vav1 but not in Vav2 and Vav3 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that they are important for a Vav1-specific function. Tyr-826 is within the SH3 region, whereas Tyr-841 is outside it (Fig. 1B). One of the characteristic functions of Vav1 is its ability to regulate Rac1 activity (16.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 199"
https://openalex.org/W2066091561,"Background Hong Kong is an affluent subtropical city with a well-developed healthcare infrastructure but an intermediate TB burden. Declines in notification rates through the 1960s and 1970s have slowed since the 1980s to the current level of around 82 cases per 100 000 population. We studied the transmission dynamics of TB in Hong Kong to explore the factors underlying recent trends in incidence. Methodology/Principal Findings We fitted an age-structured compartmental model to TB notifications in Hong Kong between 1968 and 2008. We used the model to quantify the proportion of annual cases due to recent transmission versus endogenous reactivation of latent infection, and to project trends in incidence rates to 2018. The proportion of annual TB notifications attributed to endogenous reactivation increased from 46% to 70% between 1968 and 2008. Age-standardized notification rates were projected to decline to approximately 56 per 100 000 in 2018. Conclusions/Significance Continued intermediate incidence of TB in Hong Kong is driven primarily by endogenous reactivation of latent infections. Public health interventions which focus on reducing transmission may not lead to substantial reductions in disease burden associated with endogenous reactivation of latent infections in the short- to medium-term. While reductions in transmission with socio-economic development and public health interventions will lead to declines in TB incidence in these regions, a high prevalence of latent infections may hinder substantial declines in burden in the longer term. These findings may therefore have important implications for the burden of TB in developing regions with higher levels of transmission currently."

Vacuolar antiporters have been shown to play significant roles in salt tolerance; however the relatively low Vmax of the Na+/H+ exchange of the Na+/H+ antiporters identified could limit its application in the molecular breeding of salt tolerant crops. In this study, we applied DNA shuffling methodology to generate and recombine the mutations of Arabidopsis thaliana vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter gene AtNHX1. Screening using a large scale yeast complementation system identified AtNHXS1, a novel Na+/H+ antiporter. Expression of AtNHXS1 in yeast showed that the antiporter localized to the vacuolar membrane and that its expression improved the tolerance of yeast to NaCl, KCl, LiCl, and hygromycin B. Measurements of the ion transport activity across the intact yeast vacuole demonstrated that the AtNHXS1 protein showed higher Na+/H+ exchange activity and a slightly improved K+/H+ exchange activity.

Measurements of the ion transport activity across the intact yeast vacuole demonstrated that the AtNHXS1 protein showed higher Na+/H+ exchange activity and a slightly improved K+/H+ exchange activity. To cope with salt stress and the toxic effect of sodium, plants have developed several adaptive mechanisms including osmotic adjustment and ion homeostasis (1.Bohnert H.J. Nelson D.E. Jensen R.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Because plants lack Na+-ATPases, Na+ homeostasis depends mainly on the expression and activities of Na+/H+ antiporters. Plants use two mechanisms to remove the excess of cytosolic Na+; (i) plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporters (SOS1-type) that remove Na+ out of the plant cells (2.Shi H. Lee B.H. Wu S.J. Zhu J.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), (ii) the transport of Na+ into the vacuolar compartments, mediated by vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporters (NHX1-type) (3.Apse M.P. Blumwald E. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane and the vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporters are driven by the proton-motive force generated by the plasma membrane H+-adenosine triphosphatase and the vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphatase and H+-inorganic pyrophosphatase, respectively (3.Apse M.P. Blumwald E. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The sequestration of Na+ into the vacuoles is a significant and cost-effective strategy for reducing cytosol Na+ content that also contributes to the cellular osmotic adjustment for water uptake, cell turgor, and expansion (4.Chinnusamy V. Jagendorf A. Zhu J.K. Crop Sci. 2005; 45: 437-448Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporters have been also shown to play significant roles in endosomal pH regulation (5.Yamaguchi T. Fukada-Tanaka S. Inagaki Y. Saito N. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Iida S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), Na+ homeostasis, vesicular trafficking, and protein targeting (6.Apse M.P. Sottosanto J.B. Blumwald E.

The first plant vacuole Na+/H+ antiporter gene AtNHX1 was cloned and characterized from Arabidopsis thaliana (9.Gaxiola R.A. Rao R. Sherman A. Grisafi P. Alper S.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Showing significant sequence homology with the Na+/H+ antiporters ScNHX1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, AtNHX1 is functionally analogous to ScNHX1 and localized to the plant vacuole membrane fractions (9.Gaxiola R.A.

The overexpression of AtNHX1 conferred salt tolerance in the transgenic plants and the salt tolerance was correlated with increased vacuolar Na+/H+ exchange activity and vacuolar sodium accumulation. These studies suggested that plant vacuole Na+/H+ antiporter genes play a significant role in plant salt tolerance (11.Apse M.P. Aharon G.S. Snedden W.A. Blumwald E.

Some advances have been achieved toward understanding the structure-function relationships of the Na+/H+ antiporter in yeast (16.Kinclová O. Ramos J. Potier S. Sychrová H. Mol.

Studies indicated that the C terminus of plant Na+/H+ antiporter play an important role in the regulation of the antiporter activity. The AtNHX1 C terminus was found to regulate the activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter via its interaction with AtCaM15 in a pH- and Ca2+-dependent manner (21.Yamaguchi T. Apse M.P. Shi H. Blumwald E.

Although the overexpression of plant vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporters conferred enhanced salt tolerance to the transgenic plants, the relatively low Vmax of the cloned Na+/H+ antiporters are a limitation for the application of the Na+/H+ antiporter genes for crop molecular breeding. DNA shuffling is a powerful process for directed evolution, which generates diversity by recombination, combining useful mutations from individual genes (24.Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). DNA shuffling followed by screening or selection has proved to be a useful approach for the evolution of single gene products with enhanced activity, altered substrate specificity, or improving protein folding and of entire operons with improved function (25.Crameri A. Raillard S.A. Bermudez E. Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In this study, we applied DNA shuffling methodology combined with the heterologous expression of the shuffled gene products in yeast to screen novel Na+/H+ antiporter genes conferring improved activity and enhanced tolerance of yeast to high NaCl concentrations. One shuffled Na+/H+ antiporter gene obtained showed a 1-fold improved NaCl resistance. The yeast strain harboring the shuffled Na+/H+ antiporter gene accumulated more sodium than that expressing AtNHX1. Furthermore, The shuffled Na+/H+ antiporter displayed higher Vmax of the Na+/H+ exchange across the yeast vacuole membrane, thus indicating that the novel Na+/H+ antiporter gene possesses enhanced sodium transport activity. S. cerevisiae mutant Δena1–2 (Δena1–2::HIS3) and Δena1–4Δnhx1 (Δena1–4::HIS3, Δnhx1:: TRP1) were derived from W303–1B(MATα'ura3–1′leu2–3′trp1–1′his3–11′ade2–1,can1–100), NHX1 deletion mutant TY001 (Δnhx1::TRP1) were derived from the vacuolar protease-deficient strain MM476 (MATα′pep4–3′leu2′trp1′ura3–52′prb1–1122). Yeast cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract/2% peptone/2% glucose). Salt tolerance tests were performed in APG medium, which is synthesis medium containing 10 mm arginine, 8 mm phosphoric acid, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2% (w/v) glucose, trace vitamins, and minerals (26.Rodríguez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, NaCl, LiCl, KCl, or hygromycin B was added, or the pH was adjusted to 5.5 with acetic acid. The cDNA of AtNHX1 was amplified from the pGM-T-AtNHX1 construct with the two primers: Atr1 and Atf1 (Table 1), and the product was purified using Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification (Promega).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequenceaNew restriction sites are underlined, mutated nucleotides are in lowercase letters.At f1TCCCCCGGGATGTTGGATTCTCTAGTGAt r1GCGTCGACTCAAGCCTTACTAAGATCAGGAt f2TCCCCCGGGATGTTGGATTCTCTAGAt r2CCGGAATTCAGCCTTACTAAGATCAGGGFP3 fCCGGAATTCATGAGTAAAGGCGAAGAACGFP3 rCGGGGTACCTTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGAtS1 r2CCGGAATTCGTCATCAGATAACATGCTCAt L29P fGTTGAATCTCTTTGTTGCACCtCTTTGTGCAt L29P raGGTGCAACAAAGAGATTCAACGCAACCAt S158P fCCATATTTGCTGCAACAGATcCAGTATGTACAt S158P rTGgATCTGTTGCAGCAAATATGGCACCAt CDL296 rGCGTCGACTCAGTCATCAGATAACATGCTCa New restriction sites are underlined, mutated nucleotides are in lowercase letters. Open table in a new tab The shuffling procedure was performed as described (24.Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 27.Zhao H. Arnold F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1307-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Total 2-μg products were digested by DNase I for 2 min, and the fragments between 100 and 200 bp were confirmed on a 2% agarose gel before purification by Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up system (Promega). The purified fragments (1 μg) were reassembled by PCR without primer. The PCR program was as follow: 60 s, 94 °C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s 94 °C, 30 s 50 °C, 30 s 72 °C, followed by 7 min at 72 °C. 1 μl of this reaction was used as template in a 30-cycle PCR reaction to amplify the reassembled products. PCR program was conducted as follow: 60 s, 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s 94 °C, 60 s 58 °C, 30 s 72 °C, followed by 7 min at 72 °C. This program produces a single band with the correct size. The reassembled fragment of the correct size were purified by Wizard SV Gel and PCR clean-up system, and digested by SalI and SmaI before purification. The purified products were ligated into the yeast express vector pYPGE15, which was digested by the same enzymes. The constructs were transformed into the double mutant yeast strain Δena1–4::HIS3 Δnhx1::TRP1 using lithium acetate method as described before (28.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The strains were screened on the APG selective medium supplemented with 100 mm NaCl at pH 5.5. The growth was at 30 °C for 4 days. For the second selection, the yeast clones obtained from the first screening were grown to A600 = 0.5, and 5 μl of the cells were loaded onto APG-selective medium supplemented with 125 mm NaCl at pH 5.5. To compare salt tolerance of shuffled Na+/H+ antiporter gene with that of the wild-type gene, the open-reading frame of AtNHX1 was cloned into the yeast express vector pYPGE15 using SalI and SmaI. The construct was introduced into the yeast double mutant strain W303–1B Δena1–4::HIS3 Δnhx1::TRP1. Whereas the yeast wild-type strain W303–1B, yeast mutant strains W303–1B Δena1–2::HIS3 and W303–1BΔena1–4::HIS3 Δnhx1::TRP1 were all transformed with empty pYPGE15. For drop tests, the cells of different strains were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended into APG medium, adjusted to A600 of 0.5. Serial 5-time dilutions were made, and 5 μl of the cells were loaded onto APG medium with different salt supplements. The total Na+ and K+ content of the different yeast cells grown in APG medium supplemented with 70 mm NaCl was determined as described before (29.Venema K. Belver A. Marin-Manzano M.C. Rodríguez-Rosales M.P. Donaire J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22453-22459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30.Montiel V. Ramos J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2007; 7: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The yeast cells were collected by centrifugation and then washed twice with ice-cold 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm HEPES. Intracellular ions were extracted by HCl and analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrometer. C terminus GFP3-tagged AtNHX1 and AtNHXS1 were constructed separately. GFP3 with stop codon was subcloned into the pYPGE15 vector, digested by EcoRI and KpnI enzymes. The new construct was named pYPGE15-GFP3. The AtNHX1 and AtNHXS1 open-reading frames without the stop codon were separately inserted between EcoRI and SmaI site of pYPGE15-GFP3. These constructs were introduced into the yeast mutant strain TY001, respectively. Drop tests were performed as described above, and cells were placed onto YPD medium with 10 μg/ml hygromycin B. Exponentially growing cells were labeled with 16 μm FM4-64 for 30 min and mounted on the coverslips. Confocal images were acquired with a Leica TCSP5 confocal laser microscope system and a 63× oil immersion objective. The empty pYPGE15, pYPGE15-AtNHX1, and pYPGE15-AtNHXS1 were introduced into the vacuolar protease-deficient strain TY001. Intact vacuoles were isolated as described before (21.Yamaguchi T. Apse M.P. Shi H. Blumwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12510-12515Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The intact vacuoles were collected at the top of the gradient and resuspended in 10 mm MES-Tris 2The abbreviations used are: MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidNHX1Na+/H+ antiporterGFPgreen fluorescent protein. (pH 7.5). The highly purified vacuoles were almost free of contamination by unbroken spheroplasts and lipid granules. Protein concentrations were determined by the Protein Assay (Tiangen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Na+/H+ antiporter green fluorescent protein. The fluorescence quenching of acridine orange was used to monitor the establishment and dissipation of vacuolar inside acidic pH gradients as described before (21.Yamaguchi T. Apse M.P. Shi H. Blumwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12510-12515Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The time-dependent fluorescence changes were monitored on a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 540 nm, respectively, and a slit width of 5 nm with a 1% transmittance filter. Initial rates were measured as the slope of the relaxation of the quench over a period of 25 s. Rates were reported as percent quench per min per mg of protein. Curves were fitted to the mean rate values at each concentration. To explore the effects of the amino acids mutations and the deleted C terminus on the functions of Na+/H+ antiporters, the L29P, S158P mutants and the C-terminal-deleted mutant were constructed. The pGM-T-AtNHX1 was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis. All amino acid substitutions were generated by PCR methods using the appropriate base changes in the synthetic primers. The C-terminal deletion was obtained by PCR amplification with the primer Atf1 and AtCDL296r (Table 1). Mutagenesis and deletion mutants were cloned into the expression vector pYPGE15 digested by SalI and SmaI enzymes and were confirmed by sequencing. These constructs were introduced into the yeast double mutant strain W303–1B Δena1–4::HIS3 Δnhx1::TRP1, drop tests were performed as described above, onto APG plates with different NaCl or KCl or LiCl supplements at pH 5.5 or onto YPD medium with 10 μg/ml hygromycin B. The growth of these strains in the liquid APG medium with salt or the liquid YPD medium with hygromycin B was also investigated for quantitation. Vectors expressing AtNHX1 bearing the mutations L29P or S158P or CDL296 were introduced into the vacuolar protease-deficient strain TY001. Vacuoles were isolated as described above and cation-dependent proton transport was performed by monitoring the fluorescence quenching of acridine orange as described. The wild-type AtNHX1 gene was amplified by PCR when the random mutants were produced and was fragmented by DNaseI. After the combination, the column-purified 100–200-bp fragments were assembled through PCR without primer to a single gene product of the correct size. The results of the gene fragmentation, reassembly, and amplification are shown as Fig. 1. After being ligated into the yeast expression vector pYPGE15 and then introduced into the yeast double mutant strain W303–1BΔena1–4Δnhx1, which lacks Na+-ATPase genes ENA1–4 (31.Blumwald E. Aharon G.S. Apse M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. 2000; 1465: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) and the endosomal Na+/H+ antiporter gene NHX1 (32.Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), the shuffled gene library was expressed and screened on APG medium supplied with 100 mm NaCl at pH 5.5. The transformation rate was about 103-104/μg plasmid DNA, and about 105 shuffled gene mutants were constructed by a one-time operation. For screening, 25 plates containing 400–600 clones per plate were screened simultaneously, allowing for an efficient large scale method for the identification of yeast carrying improved forms of the vacuolar antiporter With the NaCl selective pressure, more than two hundred clones grew normally on the plates with NaCl selective pressure, and the clone showing best grow (clone 25) during the second selection was selected for further characterization (Fig. 2A). The shuffled gene expressed in this yeast clone was named AtNHXS1.FIGURE 2NaCl tolerance of AtNHX1 and shuffled AtNHXS1 gene in expressed in the Δean1–4 Δnhx1 yeast double mutant.

The different yeast strains were grown on the APG medium supplemented with different NaCl concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2B, the yeast mutant strain Δena1–4Δnhx1 lacking the endogenous Na+/H+ antiporter was more sensitive to NaCl than that of the wild-type W303–1B and single mutant strain Δena1–2. Expression of AtNHX1 in the yeast mutant partially recovered the mutant phenotype, indicating that AtNHX1 functions as a Na+/H+ antiporter. The shuffled AtNHX1 conferred the yeast mutant a tolerance to salt to up to 125 mm NaCl, whereas the yeast cells expressing the wild-type gene was only able to tolerate the presence of 75 mm NaCl in the growth medium. The liquid salt tolerance test showed that the salt tolerance of yeast expressing AtNHXS1 was improved about 1-fold as compared with the yeast carrying AtNHX1 (Fig. 2C). The total ion contents of the yeast cells were determined. In the presence of 70 mm NaCl in the growth medium, the yeast strain harboring AtNHXS1 was able to accumulate more Na+ than the wild type (Fig. 2D). The K+ contents of the yeast expressing AtNHXS1 was slightly higher than that of yeast harboring AtNHX1 (Fig. 2E). These results would suggest that the yeast strain expressing AtNHXS1 have a higher ability to sequester Na+ into the vacuole, and a concomitant improved NaCl tolerance. Previous studies have been shown that AtNHX1 localized in the vacuolar membrane fraction of yeast cells (9.Gaxiola R.A. Rao R. Sherman A. Grisafi P. Alper S.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1480-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 10.Quintero F.J. Blatt M.R. Pardo J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To verify the localization of shuffled AtNHX1, GFP was fused downstream with the Na+/H+ antiporter, which did not change the protein function. The expression of AtNHX1-GFP fused version in S. cerevisiae TY001 resulted in the improved tolerance to hygromycin B (Fig. 3B). Similar to that of AtNHX1-GFP3, the fluorescence of the GFP3-tagged AtNHXS1 was predominant in membranes of the vacuole and endosomes, whereas GFP3 distributed around the yeast cells, indicating its cytosolic localization (Fig. 3A). To test the effect of the C terminus and mutations of some AtNHXS1 amino acids on the regulation of the antiporter activity, proton-dependent sodium movements were monitored by monitoring the fluorescence quenching of acridine orange. As shown in Fig. 4A, vacuolar vesicle acidification was initiated by the addition of ATP, and after a steady-state acidic-inside pH gradient was attained, the activity of the H+-ATPase was partially inhibited by the addition of Bafilomycin A. The addition of Na+-gluconate or K+-gluconate resulted in a cation-dependent H+ movement and the alkalinization of the vacuole lumen (recovery of the fluorescence). The addition of 0.02% Triton X-100 resulted in the collapse of the ΔpH across the tonoplast. AtNHX1 and AtNHXS1 displayed both Na+- and K+-coupled H+ transport activity. In all cases, these two transporters showed a Michaelis-Menten-type saturation kinetics. The shuffled AtNHX1 displayed a significantly higher apparent Vmax of the Na+/H+ with about 1-fold increase (from 6.65 to 11.4 Q % min−1 mg−1 protein) (Fig. 4, B and C), while the Vmax of the K+/H+ was slightly higher (from 4.05 to 4.56 Q % min−1 mg−1 protein) compared with that of the wild-type AtNHX1 (Fig. 4, D and E). AtNHXS1 displayed a higher Na+/K+ selectivity (Vmax(Na+)/Vmax(K+) = 2.5) than AtNHX1 (Vmax(Na+)/Vmax(K+) = 1.6) and a minor decrease in affinity for Na+ (48.5 mm and 43 mm in AtNHXS1 and AtNHX1, respectively) and K+ (32.5 mm and 29.2 mm). A comparison of AtNHXS1 with AtNHX1 showed that the AtNHXS1 gene has seven nucleic acids mutations and forty-two nucleic acids deletions, which resulted in the presence of a premature termination code (Table 2). In the amino acid sequence of AtNHXS1, there are four substitutions, leucine for proline at the first putative transmembrane segment (L29P), proline for serine at the fifth transmembrane domain (S158P), tyrosine for praline (Y241P), and phenylalanine for leucine (F242L) at the end of the shuffled protein, and there is one truncation of 296 amino acids in the C terminus (Fig. 5).TABLE 2DNA substitutions and deletion in shuffled AtNHX1 geneBaseBase substitution86T → C472T → C691C → A850T → C1099G → A1498T → C1555T → C720–753Deletion Open table in a new tab To elucidate which amino acid residues and/or the partial deletion of the partial C terminus in AtNHXS1 is indispensable to attain the increased activity of the shuffled Na+/H+ antiporter, the different mutagenesis, and deletion mutants of AtNHX1 were constructed and expressed in the yeast double mutants. As shown in Fig. 6, yeast cells expressing AtNHX1 protein with the mutation L29P, or the mutation S158P, or with a 296 amino acids C-terminal deletion, conveyed NaCl tolerance as effectively as that resulting from the expression of the AtNHXS1 protein. Also, the expression of the NHX1 mutations L29P, S158P, and the C-terminal truncation displayed similar enhancement of tolerance to KCl, LiCl, and hygromycin B, a compound that its toxicity has been correlated with yeast membrane depolarization (33.Madrid R. Gómez M.J. Ramos J. Rodríguez-Navarro A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14838-14844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The cation-dependent H+ transport was also measured in vacuoles isolated from yeast expressing AtNHX1 molecules bearing L29P or S158P or CDL296 mutations. Notably, the initial rates of Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchange of each antiporter was similar to that of AtNHXS1 (Fig. 6C). DNA shuffling is a powerful tool for molecular directed evolution which has been adopted widely for the improvement of the stability and activity of enzymes, changing the affinity of the substrate, enzyme turnover, etc (25.Crameri A. Raillard S.A. Bermudez E. Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 34.Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Because plant Na+/H+ antiporters play a very important role in ion homeostasis and salt tolerance (35.Yamaguchi T. Blumwald E. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 615-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), the molecular evolution of Na+/H+ antiporters not only could potentially increased the application of these genes in salt tolerance-crop breeding, but can be also helpful to understand the mechanism(s) of transport and regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporters. In this study, AtNHX1 was the substrate for DNA shuffling. Because the gene is about 1.6 kb in length, 100–200-bp fragments were recycled and were successfully recombined through primerless PCR. An appropriate digested fragment length is crucial for a successful shuffling. In addition, a suitable selective model and expression system are key factors for successful mutant screening. We applied DNA shuffling methodology combined with heterologous expression in yeast to screen novel Na+/H+ antiporter shuffled genes with improved activity and enhanced NaCl tolerance. The selection of transformed yeast in medium containing high NaCl allowed for the simultaneous large-scale screening of a large number of shuffled genes (≈104). More than 200 clones were obtained after the first screening cycle, and one clone (25.Crameri A. Raillard S.A. Bermudez E. Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) was chosen to further analysis after the second selection test. Yeast complementation tests showed that this shuffled clone displayed enhanced tolerance to NaCl, KCl, LiCl, and hygromycin B (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). When expressed in yeast, C-terminal green fluorescent protein-tagged AtNHXS1 remained localized to the vacuole (Fig. 3). The yeast expressing the shuffled Na+/H+ antiporter accumulated more sodium than that containing the wild type form of AtNHX1 (Fig. 2D), and AtNHXS1 had higher sodium transport activity across the intact yeast vacuole as compared with that of AtNHX1 (Fig. 4). These results suggested that the amino acid mutations and C-terminal partial deletion in AtNHXS1 did not alter the localization of the antiporter and increased the antiporter Na+/H+ exchange activity, thus enabling a higher NaCl tolerance. On the other hand, AtNHXS1 displayed a lesser increment in the Vmax of K+/H+ exchange, and there was some increase in yeast KCl tolerance. Some progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of ion transport and regulation of Na+/H+ antiporter in Escherichia coli, yeast, and mammals (36.Landau M. Herz K. Padan E. Ben-Tal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37854-37863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the mammal NHE1 contains an autoinhibitory region, and the interaction of this region with CaM-regulatory proteins restored optimal Na+/H+ antiporter activity (37.Kemp G. Young H. Fliegel L. Channels. 2008; 2: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon was found in yeast (16.Kinclová O. Ramos J. Potier S. Sychrová H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 656-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In A. thaliana, the deletion of vacuolar AtNHX1 C terminus doubled the Na+/K+ selectivity ratio in yeast, also suggesting a regulatory role of the C terminus on the antiporter activity (21.Yamaguchi T. Apse M.P. Shi H. Blumwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12510-12515Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that the cation selectivity of AtNHX1 can be modified through the interaction of its C terminus with AtCaM15, a calmodulin (CaM)-like protein in a pH- and Ca2+- dependent manner (22.Yamaguchi T. Aharon G.S. Sottosanto J.B. Blumwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16107-16112Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Increased pH values weakened the binding of CaM to the C terminus and favored Na+ transport without affecting significantly K+ transport into the vacuole. In this study, AtNHXS1 contains four amino acid substitutions; L29P in the first transmembrane domain, S158P in the fifth transmembrane domain, Y241P and F242L at the end of the shuffled protein and the deletion of 296 amino acids of its C terminus. Taking into consideration the topology proposed for AtNHX1 (21.Yamaguchi T. Apse M.P. Shi H. Blumwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12510-12515Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), AtNHXS1 would comprise only seven transmembrane domains (Fig. 5), lacking the 8–12 transmembrane domains and the hydrophilic tail of the C terminus containing the CaM-binding domain. L29P resides in the first transmembrane domain of AtNHX1. Leu29 and Leu30 in AtNHX1 are similar to Leu110 and Leu111 in the second transmembrane domain of NHE1, a region postulated to participate in the formation of path for cation transport (36.Landau M. Herz K. Padan E. Ben-Tal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37854-37863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). S158P is located in a region containing amino acids 147–193, a highly conserved region among Na+/H+ antiporters of mammals (NHE1), yeast (Nhx1), and plants (AtNHX1). This region has been postulated to contain the putative cation-binding domain as mapped by homology to other antiporters (23.Hernández A. Jiang X. Cubero B. Nieto P.M. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14276-14285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Y241P and F242L would not play any role in cation or proton transport. The shuffled Na+/H+ antiporter, AtNHXS1, displayed an improved Na+/H+ exchange activity, and its expression conferred a significantly higher NaCl tolerance to yeast. Our data support the notion that the C-terminal deletion and the mutations in the putative cation transport path and the mutations in the cation-binding domain of the Na+/H+ antiporter increased Na+/H+ exchange activity and Na+ selectivity, while decreasing Na+ and K+ affinity. A few critically conserved charged amino acids may be responsible for the cation binding and coordination by Na+/H+ exchanger proteins. For example, the polar amino acids are usually pH sensors and mutants of these amino acids usually results in the change of the Na+/H+ activities under different pH conditions (38.Wiebe C.A. DiBattista E.R. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39.Wiebe C.A. Rieder C. Young P.G. Dibrov P. Fliegel L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 254: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 40.Kinclova-Zimmermannova O. Zavrel M. Sychrova H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Asp138 of the Na+/H+ antiporter from Synechocystis species PCC6803 was found to be necessary for the cation transport activity. The related mutants lead to the lost of transport function (41.Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study, the L29P and S158P mutations, localized in the predicted transmembrane domains, were found to increase the salt tolerance of AtNHX1, significantly. As proline is a helix breaker that can disrupt the α-helical structure (42.Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), it is possible that the L29P or S158P substitutions resulted in the alteration of Na+/H+ antiporter structure, favoring Na+/H+ exchange. Notably, when each of the mutations L29P, S158P, and the C-terminal deletion CDL296 were expressed, the cation-H+ exchange activity did not differ from that displayed by AtNHXS1. These results would suggest that similar to the mammalian antiporter NHE1, there is an interaction between the TM1 and the cation-binding domain in AtNHX1. Moreover, the effects seen in the mutant bearing the C-terminal deletion confirmed the proposed regulatory role of the C terminus on antiporter cation selectivity and transport activity (22.Yamaguchi T. Aharon G.S. Sottosanto J.B. Blumwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16107-16112Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we used DNA shuffling methodology combined with a large scale yeast complementation system to evolve the plant Na+/H+ antiporter gene AtNHX1 and obtained one novel Na+/H+ antiporter gene AtNHXS1, containing four amino acid substitutions and a C-terminal deletion. These mutations and deletion did not alter the vacuolar localization of the Na+/H+ antiporter but increased the Na+/K+ selectivity. Furthermore, AtNHXS1 displayed a higher Na+/H+ transport activity, which enabled yeast to accumulate more Na+ and K+ in the vacuole and increased its salt tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2011462787,"The Macrourid fish roundnose grenadier, Coryphaenoides rupestris, is one of the most common benthopelagic fishes on the northern mid-Atlantic Ridge. The ecology of the species is comparatively well studied in continental slope waters of the North Atlantic, but not on the mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is a central mid-ocean area of its distribution. In total, 166 specimens from the RV G.O. Sars cruise in July 2004 were examined. The diet mainly comprised cephalopods, pelagic shrimps and fish. Pelagic and benthopelagic copepods were the most numerous prey, but did not contribute much on a weight basis. Cephalopods were by far the most important prey of the small grenadiers, while shrimps and fish became increasingly significant with increasing size. Previous studies from other areas have also found pelagic prey to be important, but in contrast to this study, cephalopods were generally of less importance.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock that inflicts severe economic losses. Although the current whole-virus chemically inactivated vaccine has proven effective, it has led to new outbreaks of FMD because of incomplete inactivation of the virus or the escape of infectious virus from vaccine production premises. We have previously shown that serial passages of FMD virus (FMDV) C-S8c1 at high multiplicity of infection in cell culture resulted in virus populations consisting of defective genomes that are infectious by complementation (termed C-S8p260).Here we evaluate the immunogenicity of C-S8p260, first in a mouse model system to establish a proof of principle, and second, in swine, the natural host of FMDV C-S8c1. Mice were completely protected against a lethal challenge with FMDV C-S8c1, after vaccination with a single dose of C-S8p260. Pigs immunized with different C-S8p260 doses and challenged with FMDV C-S8c1 either did not develop any clinical signs or showed delayed and mild disease symptoms. C-S8p260 induced high titers of both FMDV-specific, neutralizing antibodies and activated FMDV-specific T cells in swine, that correlated with solid protection against FMDV.The defective virus-based vaccine did not produce detectable levels of transmissible FMDV. Therefore, a segmented, replication-competent form of a virus, such as FMDV C-S8p260, can provide the basis of a new generation of attenuated antiviral vaccines with two safety barriers. The design can be extended to any viral pathogen that encodes trans-acting gene products, allowing complementation between replication-competent, defective forms."
https://openalex.org/W2000479735,"Background Endovascular technique has benefits vis-a-vis surgical access to organs with less accessible anatomical locations. To minimize surgical risk we propose a novel endovascular technique, to create parenchymal access through endovascular methods. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed, manufactured and tested an endovascular catheter with a depth limiting collar and a penetrating tip that is used to perforate vessels, thereby creating a working channel to the extra-vascular space. Computer simulations and subsequent interventions have been performed ex vivo and in vivo in both small and large animals by testing different prototypes. All tests were designed for testing extravascular hemostasis and absence of thrombo-embolic complications when exiting the vessels from the inside to the extra vascular space. We have deposited prototypes after intervention in vascular walls over a period of 14 days in rat with no impairment on blood flow and no signs of thrombo-embolic complications upon re-exploration (n = 7). We have also incorporated the catheter system with clinically available systems both in an ex vivo simulator setting and in a full scale clinical angiographical setting in rabbit were no bleeding (0%) in any of the interventions performed (n = 40). To prevent hemorrhage during termination of the procedure, a hollow electrolysis detachment-zone leaves the distal tip in the vessel-wall after the intervention. This has also been tested with absolute hemostasis in large animals (n = 6). Conclusions/Significance We have developed and tested a new system for transvascular tissue access in simulations, ex vivo and in vivo in small and large animals, integrating it with standard clinical catheters and angiographical environment, with absolute hemostasis and without thromboembolic complications. In a clinical setting for stem cell transplantation, local substance administration or tissue sampling, the benefit should be greatest in organs that are difficult or high-risk to access with other techniques, such as the pancreas, the central nervous system (CNS) and the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2145594777,"A central goal of cancer biology is to understand how cells from this family of genetic diseases undergo specific morphological and physiological changes and regress to a de-regulated state of the cell cycle. The fact that tumors are unable to perform most of the specific functions of the original tissue led us to hypothesize that the degree of specialization of the transcriptome of cancerous tissues must be less than their normal counterparts. With the aid of information theory tools, we analyzed four datasets derived from transcriptomes of normal and tumor tissues to quantitatively test the hypothesis that cancer reduces transcriptome specialization. Here, we show that the transcriptional specialization of a tumor is significantly less than the corresponding normal tissue and comparable with the specialization of dedifferentiated embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the drop in specialization in cancerous tissues is largely due to a decrease in expression of genes that are highly specific to the normal organ. This approach gives us a better understanding of carcinogenesis and offers new tools for the identification of genes that are highly influential in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2008467711,"The high levels of variation characterising the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule are due ultimately to its high average mutation rate; moreover, mtDNA variation is deeply structured in different populations and ethnic groups. There is growing interest in selecting a reduced number of mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNPs) that account for the maximum level of discrimination power in a given population. Applications of the selected mtSNP panel range from anthropologic and medical studies to forensic genetic casework.This study proposes a new simulation-based method that explores the ability of different mtSNP panels to yield the maximum levels of discrimination power. The method explores subsets of mtSNPs of different sizes randomly chosen from a preselected panel of mtSNPs based on frequency. More than 2,000 complete genomes representing three main continental human population groups (Africa, Europe, and Asia) and two admixed populations (""African-Americans"" and ""Hispanics"") were collected from GenBank and the literature, and were used as training sets. Haplotype diversity was measured for each combination of mtSNP and compared with existing mtSNP panels available in the literature. The data indicates that only a reduced number of mtSNPs ranging from six to 22 are needed to account for 95% of the maximum haplotype diversity of a given population sample. However, only a small proportion of the best mtSNPs are shared between populations, indicating that there is not a perfect set of ""universal"" mtSNPs suitable for all population contexts. The discrimination power provided by these mtSNPs is much higher than the power of the mtSNP panels proposed in the literature to date. Some mtSNP combinations also yield high diversity values in admixed populations.The proposed computational approach for exploring combinations of mtSNPs that optimise the discrimination power of a given set of mtSNPs is more efficient than previous empirical approaches. In contrast to precedent findings, the results seem to indicate that only few mtSNPs are needed to reach high levels of discrimination power in a population, independently of its ancestral background."
https://openalex.org/W2051178020,"Rps15p, an essential ribosomal protein, was previously shown to be critical for nuclear export of small subunit pre-particles. We have designed a synthetic lethal screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify its genetic partners and further elucidate its role during ribosomal biogenesis. Our screen revealed interactions with mutants affected at various stages during ribosome biogenesis, from early nucleolar steps to nuclear export. Mutations were identified in genes encoding proteins involved in early ribosome biogenesis steps, like the small subunit processome component Utp15p, the 90S pre-ribosome factor Slx9p and the H/ACA snoRNP core protein Nhp2p. In addition, we found a synthetic lethality with BUD23, a gene encoding a methyltransferase involved both in rRNA modification and small subunit nuclear export. Interestingly, deletion of snR36 or snR85, two H/ACA snoRNAs that direct modifications close to Rps15p's binding site on the rRNA, produces mild and opposite effects on growth in an rps15 hypomorphic background. These data uncover an unreported link between a ribosomal protein and rRNA modification machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2010357012,"In the radiotherapy treatment planning of a lesion located in the head region with small field radiation beams, the heterogeneity corrections play an important role. In this work, we investigated the influence of a bony heterogeneity on dose profile inside a soft tissue phantom containing a bony material. PDD curves were obtained by simulation using the Monte Carlo code EGSnrc and employing Eclipse(R) treatment planning system algorithms (Batho, Modified Batho, Equivalent TAR and Anisotropic Analytic Algorithm) for a 15 MV photon beam and field sizes of 2x2 and 10x10 cm(2). The Equivalent TAR method exhibited better agreement with Monte Carlo simulations for the 2x2 cm(2) field size. The magnitude of the effect on PDD due to the bony heterogeneity for 1x1, 2x2 and 10x10 cm(2) field sizes increases to 10, 5 and 3%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1973386905,"Background We aimed to determine whether family practices' achievement of diabetes quality of care targets is associated with diabetic retinal disease in registered patients. Methods Data for achievement of diabetes quality of care targets, including the proportion of patients with HbA1c≤7.5%, for 144 family practices in London UK, for the years 2004/5 to 2007/8, were linked to data from a population-based diabetes eye screening programme collected from September 2007 to February 2009. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, duration and type of diabetes, unadjusted diabetes prevalence, ethnicity and deprivation category. Results Data were analysed for 24,458 participants with one or more eye screening results in the period. There were 9,332 (38%) with any diabetic retinopathy and 2,819 (11.5%) with sight threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR), including 2,654 (10.9%) with maculopathy. Among participants registered at 13 family practices that were in the highest quartile for achievement of the HbA1c quality of care target for all four years of study, the relative odds of any diabetic retinopathy were 0.78 (0.69 to 0.88) P<0.001. For participants at 12 practices consistently in the lowest quartile of HbA1c achievement, the relative odds of any diabetic retinopathy were 1.16 (1.03 to 1.30), P = 0.015. In the highest achieving practices, the relative odds of maculopathy were 0.74 (0.62 to 0.89), P = 0.001 and STDR 0.77 (0.65 to 0.92), P = 0.004. Conclusions The risk of diabetic retinopathy might be lower at family practices that consistently achieve highly on diabetes quality of care targets for HbA1c."
