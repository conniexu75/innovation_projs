https://openalex.org/W1973238993,"The three-dimensional structure of human serum albumin has been determined crystallographically to a resolution of 2.8 Ã…. It comprises three homologous domains that assemble to form a heart-shaped molecule. Each domain is a product of two subdomains that possess common structural motifs. The principal regions of ligand binding to human serum albumin are located in hydrophobic cavities in subdomains IIA and IIIA, which exhibit similar chemistry. The structure explains numerous physical phenomena and should provide insight into future pharmacokinetic and genetically engineered therapeutic applications of serum albumin."

https://openalex.org/W1992853665,"Hundreds of specimens of spirally coiled, megascopic, carbonaceous fossils resembling Grypania spiralis (Walcott), have been found in the 2.1-billion-year-old Negaunee Iron-Formation at the Empire Mine, near Marquette, Michigan. This occurrence of Grypania is 700 million to 1000 million years older than fossils from previously known sites in Montana, China, and India. As Grypania appears to have been a photosynthetic alga, this discovery places the origin of organelle-bearing eukaryotic cells prior to 2.1 billion years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2106341310,"IgE-binding protein (epsilon BP) was originally identified by virtue of its affinity for IgE. It is now known to be a beta-galactoside-binding lectin with the characteristic of an S-type carbohydrate recognition domain. The protein is composed of two domains: the amino-terminal domain consisting of tandem repeats and the carboxyl-terminal domain containing sequences shared by other S-type carbohydrate recognition domains. The amino-terminal domain also contains a number of potential recognition sites for collagenase cleavage. In this study, human epsilon BP was first expressed in Escherichia coli, and the carboxyl-terminal domain (epsilon BP-C) was then generated by collagenase digestion of epsilon BP. By equilibrium dialysis, the association constants of epsilon BP and epsilon BP-C for lactose were found to be similar (6.0 +/- 0.70) x 10(4) M-1 and (4.7 +/- 0.27) x 10(4) M-1, respectively. Both polypeptides contain only one lactose-binding site/molecule. By an assay involving binding of 125I-labeled epsilon BP or epsilon BP-C to solid phase IgE, and inhibition of this binding by saccharides, it was determined that epsilon BP-C retains the saccharide specificity of epsilon BP. Importantly, although unlabeled epsilon BP-C inhibited the binding of the radiolabeled epsilon BP to IgE, unlabeled epsilon BP caused increased binding to IgE, suggesting self-association among epsilon BP molecules. Oligomeric structures resulting from self-association of epsilon BP were confirmed by chemical cross-linking studies. Furthermore, epsilon BP possesses hemagglutination activity on rabbit erythrocytes, whereas epsilon BP-C lacks such activity. Based on these results, we propose a structural model for multivalency of epsilon BP: dimerization or oligomerization of epsilon BP occurs through intermolecular interaction involving the amino-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W2141601422,"Mutants of sperm whale myoglobin were constructed at position 29 (B10 in helix notation) to examine the effects of distal pocket size on the rates of ligand binding and autooxidation. Leu29 was replaced with Ala, Val, and Phe using the synthetic gene and Escherichia coli expression system of Springer and Sligar (Springer, B. A., and Sligar, S. G. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 8961-8965). Structures of the ferric forms of Val29 and Phe29, and the oxy form of Phe29 myoglobin were determined to 1.7 A by x-ray crystallography. The ferric mutant proteins are remarkably isomorphous with the wild type protein except in the immediate vicinity of residue 29. Thus, the protein structure in the distal pocket of myoglobin can accommodate either a large ""hole"" (i.e. Ala or Val) or a large side chain (i.e. Phe) at position 29 without perturbation of tertiary structure. Phe29 oxymyoglobin is also identical to the native oxy protein in terms of overall structure and interactions between the bound O2 and His64, Val68, Phe43, and Ile107. The distance between the nearest side chain atom of residue 29 and the second atom of the bound oxygen molecule is 3.2 A in the Phe29 protein and 4.9 A in native myoglobin. The equilibrium constants for O2 binding to Ala29, Val29, and Leu29 (native) myoglobin are the same, approximately 1.0 x 10(6) M-1 at 20 degrees C, whereas that for the Phe29 protein is markedly greater, 15 x 10(6) M-1. This increase in affinity is due primarily to a 10-fold decrease in the O2 dissociation rate constant for the Phe29 mutant and appears to be the result of stabilizing interactions between the negative portion of the bound O2 dipole and the partially positive edge of the phenyl ring. Increasing the size of residue 29 causes large decreases in the rate of autooxidation of myoglobin: k(ox) = 0.24, 0.23, 0.055, and 0.005 h-1 for Ala29, Val29, Leu29 (native), and Phe29 myoglobin, respectively, in air at 37 degrees C. Thus, the Leu29----Phe mutation produces a reduced protein that is remarkably stable and is expressed in E. coli as 100% MbO2. The selective pressure to conserve Leu29 at the B10 position probably represents a compromise between reducing the rate of autooxidation and maintaining a large enough O2 dissociation rate constant to allow rapid oxygen release during respiration."
https://openalex.org/W1597848417,Quantitative and qualitative changes in acetylcholinesterase confer resistance to insecticides. We have constructed several Drosophila melanogaster strains producing various amounts of enzyme by P-mediated transformation. Toxicological analysis of these strains demonstrates that resistance to organophosphorus insecticides is correlated with the amount of acetylcholinesterase in the central nervous system. Resistance may also be qualitatively determined. Comparison of the Drosophila acetylcholinesterase gene between a resistant strain caught in the wild and a wild type susceptible strain only revealed one nucleotide transition resulting in the replacement of a phenylalanine by a tyrosine. Flies mutant for acetylcholinesterase and rescued with a minigene mutagenized for this same transition produced an altered enzyme which renders flies resistant to pesticides.

https://openalex.org/W1601462184,"Abstract Human furin is a calcium-dependent serine endoprotease that can efficiently cleave many precursor proteins on the carboxyl side of the consensus cleavage sequence, -Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg-, both in vivo and in vitro. Analysis of furin proteins in extracts of cells infected with a vaccinia recombinant expressing human furin show that the enzyme is present as two prominent forms of 90 and 96 kDa. Because the structurally related bacterial subtilisins require endoproteolytic removal of the NH2-terminal pro-region by an autocatalytic intramolecular cleavage, we speculated that the size heterogeneity in the furin doublet similarly may result from a proteolytic removal of an NH2-terminal pro-region. Here we report identification of the 90-kDa furin NH2 terminus and, based on the reported sequence of the furin cDNA, demonstrate that this furin protein is derived from a larger precursor by an endoproteolytic cleavage on the COOH-terminal side of a consensus furin cleavage site, -Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg107-. Expression of mutant furin molecules containing an altered cleavage site (Arg104----Ala or Arg107----Gly) resulted in the production of only the 96-kDa furin protein. Assays of furin-dependent cleavage of a protein substrate in vitro showed that proteolytic activity was associated with the 90-kDa and not the 96-kDa furin protein, demonstrating that removal of the NH2-terminal pro-region is required for furin activity. Expression of a third furin construct containing a mutation of the active site aspartate (Asp153----Asn) similarly resulted in the expression of only the 96-kDa protein, suggesting that furin activation occurs by an autoproteolytic cleavage. Finally, the production of 90-kDa furin from either site-directed furin mutant could not be potentiated by overexpressing active furin, suggesting that the autoproteolytic activation was an intramolecular event."
https://openalex.org/W1748919512,"Oxidatively modified low density lipoproteins (LDL) have recently been proposed to play a role in atherogenesis by promoting foam cell formation and endothelial cell toxicity. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether modified LDL could also induce macrophage release of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), a cytokine which enhances vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, another feature of the atherosclerotic process. LDL were oxidatively modified by incubation with either Cu2+ (Cu(2+)-LDL) or human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (M-LDL). Incubation of these modified LDL with macrophages (6 x 10(6) cells/culture) resulted in a dose-dependent induction of IL-1 beta release. At 300 micrograms protein/ml, Cu(2+)-LDL and M-LDL induced 422 and 333 pg of IL-1 beta/culture, respectively. Saponified Cu(2+)-LDL and M-LDL were shown to contain 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), lipid oxidation products of linoleate. When tested for activity in macrophage culture (3 x 10(6) cells/culture), it was found that 9-HODE and 13-HODE (final concentration 33 microM) induced the release of 122 and 43 pg of IL-1 beta/culture, respectively, whereas untreated cells released only 4 pg of IL-1 beta/culture. Incubation of macrophages with cholesteryl-9-HODE also induced IL-1 beta release; however, the degree of induction of IL-1 beta release by 9-HODE or its cholesteryl ester relative to modified LDL suggests that other components in oxidized LDL may also contribute to IL-1 beta induction. 9-HODE was rapidly taken up by macrophages, and the kinetics were similar to IL-1 beta release. A 1.5- to 6-fold increase in the level of IL-1 beta mRNA was detected as little as 3-h post-9-HODE treatment. The induction of IL-1 beta release from human monocyte-derived macrophages by 9-HODE and cholesteryl-9-HODE suggests a role for modified LDL, and its associated linoleate oxidation products, in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1503015871,"Ca2+ extrusion was measured simultaneously with the free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) from single pancreatic acinar cells placed in microdroplets of extracellular solution (Tepikin, A. V., Voronina, S. G., Gallacher, D. V., and Petersen, O. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3569-3572). Submaximal stimulation with cholecystokinin usually evoked discrete cytosolic Ca2+ spikes and each of these spikes was associated with a discrete and virtually synchronous pulse of Ca2+ extrusion into the extracellular microdroplet solution. When ACh evoked repetitive discrete [Ca2+]i spikes, each spike was also accompanied by a discrete pulse of Ca2+ extrusion. The velocity of Ca2+ extrusion oscillated with a time course similar to that of [Ca2+]i. The extracellular solution in our experiments had a low total calcium concentration (15-35 microM) and only a limited number of [Ca2+]i spikes (2-8) could be evoked. The magnitudes of the [Ca2+]i spikes and the amounts of Ca2+ extruded during each spike gradually decreased in each experiment. During the first cholecystokinin-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ spike the Ca2+ extrusion corresponded to a loss of 15-70% (mean value 39% +/- 12) of the mobilizable cellular calcium pool. The substantial pulsatile Ca2+ extrusion occurring synchronously with the receptor-activated cytosolic Ca2+ spikes is therefore an important element in repetitively bringing back [Ca2+]i to the resting level."
https://openalex.org/W1493824392,"A 25-kDa homodimeric protein was purified from demineralized bovine bone extract and identified as activin A. The bovine bone activin enhanced formation of ectopic bone in rat subcutis when implanted in combination with partially purified bovine bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2, BMP-3) in collagen/ceramic carrier. The implants, removed at 14 days, contained markedly elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase activity. Histological examination revealed an extensive formation of woven bone with very little cartilage. In contrast, a combination of transforming growth factor-beta 2 and BMP promoted formation of bone with an abundance of cartilage. The implants with BMP alone exhibited some osteoinductive activity, while the implants with activin alone showed no activity. These results demonstrate that bone is a rich source of activin and that activin plays an important role in modulating bone formation."

https://openalex.org/W1594006822,"The activation of human blood coagulation factor VII can occur by the feedback activity of either factor VIIa (autoactivation) or factor Xa. Both of these reactions are known to be enhanced by the presence of tissue factor, an integral membrane protein and the cofactor for factor VIIa. We examine here the activation of 125I-factor VII by both factor VIIa and factor Xa employing a mutant soluble form of tissue factor which has had its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains deleted (sTF1-219). This mutant soluble tissue factor retains cofactor activity toward factor VIIa in a single-stage clotting assay but shows a strong dependence on initial plasma levels of factor VIIa (from 1 to 10,000 ng/ml) when compared to wild-type tissue factor. We show that this dependence is due to a deficiency of sTF1-219 in ability to both promote autoactivation and enhance the factor Xa-catalyzed activation of 125I-factor VII. sTF1-219 does not, however, inhibit the tissue factor-independent activation of 125I-factor VII by factor Xa. The results strongly suggest that the phospholipid anchoring region of tissue factor is essential for autoactivation and beneficial for factor Xa-catalyzed activation of 125I-factor VII. In addition, when taken together with the dependence of clotting times on initial factor VIIa levels observed with sTF1-219, these results indicate that factor VII autoactivation may be of greater importance in the initiation of blood coagulation via tissue factor than has been previously realized."
https://openalex.org/W1603103758,"A previously described 43-kDa plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein (FABPPM) was not observed by immunohistochemical methods in proliferating 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. However, it was detectable in plasma membranes by the second day of confluent growth, prior to accumulation of visible lipid droplets, and was strongly expressed in 8-day differentiated adipocytes. These observations were confirmed by extraction of plasma membrane proteins and subsequent immunoblotting. Kinetics of initial [3H]oleate uptake by both fibroblasts and adipocytes consisted of the sum of a saturable and a non-saturable component. During differentiation the saturable component increased progressively. Vmax increased from 3 to 25 to 110 pmol.s-1.mg cell protein-1 between the fibroblast, the 4-day, and 8 day adipocyte stages; Km was 24 nM in fibroblasts and approximately 55 nM in both 4- and 8-day differentiated adipocytes. By contrast, the rate constant for nonsaturable oleate influx decreased progressively from 0.026 to 0.010 ml.s-1.mg protein-1 between the fibroblast and 8 day adipocyte stages. In 8-day adipocytes saturable oleate uptake was inhibited by up to 55% by antibodies against rat liver FABPPM; these antibodies had no effect on uptake of 2-deoxyglucose or the medium chain fatty acid octanoate. They also had no effect on oleate uptake by fibroblasts. These studies support the hypothesis that FABPPM is a component of a saturable transport mechanism for long chain fatty acids."

https://openalex.org/W1525629218,"We have reported previously that incubation of the immunopurified transformed hormone-free glucocorticoid receptor with rabbit reticulocyte lysate reconstitutes the receptor complex with hsp90 and that reconstitution is accompanied by concomitant repression of DNA binding activity and regeneration of the steroid binding conformation (Scherrer, L. C., Dalman, F. C., Massa, E., Meshinchi, S., and Pratt, W. B. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21397-21400). In this work we further characterize this system by defining the small M(r) components of reticulocyte lysate required for both structural and functional reconstitution of the receptor-hsp90 complex. Reconstitution is ATP-dependent and there is a direct relationship between the extent of hsp90 binding to the receptor and the number of specific steroid binding sites that are generated. Dialysis of reticulocyte lysate inactivates its reconstituting activity. Addition of an ATP-regenerating system or readdition of small M(r) lysate components (in the form of a Centricon C30 filtrate) has little effect, but the presence of both restores full reconstituting activity to dialyzed lysate, as assayed by steroid binding activity and by the binding of hsp90 and hsp70 to the receptor. The small M(r) activity is heat-stable, and it can be completely replaced by NH+4, K+, and Rb+, with K+ producing a maximal effect at the concentration normally present in undialyzed lysate. Na+ and Li+ have no reconstituting activity. This ion selectivity demonstrates that a monovalent cation binding site is involved in receptor heterocomplex reconstitution. It is intriguing that the protein unfoldase (e.g. clathrin uncoating ATPase) activity of hsp70 is known to have a similar monovalent cation dependence, and that under all conditions where hsp90 becomes bound to the receptor, we find that hsp70 is also bound."
https://openalex.org/W1506187368,"Zona pellucida (ZP)-induced acrosomal exocytosis in mammalian spermatozoa is thought to be mediated by signal transduction cascades similar to those found in hormonally responsive cells. In order to characterize this process further, we have examined the role of GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) in coupling sperm-ZP interaction to intracellular second messenger systems in mouse sperm. An in vitro signal transduction assay was developed to assess ZP-G protein dynamics in sperm membrane preparations. Guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), a poorly hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, bound to these membranes in a specific and concentration-dependent fashion which reached saturation at 100 nM. Incubation of the membrane preparations with heat-solubilized ZP resulted in a significant increase in specific GTP gamma S binding in a concentration-dependent fashion with a half-maximal response at 1.25-2 ZP/microliters. Solubilized ZP also caused a significant increase in high affinity GTPase activity in the membranes over basal levels. Mastoparan increased specific GTP gamma S binding to the sperm membranes and stimulated high-affinity membrane GTPase activity to levels consistently greater than that seen with the solubilized ZP. Mastoparan, together with solubilized ZP, gave the same level of stimulation of GTP gamma S binding as mastoparan alone. Pertussis toxin completely inhibited the ZP-stimulated GTP gamma S binding, but only decreased mastoparan-stimulated GTP gamma S binding by 70-80%. Purified ZP3, the ZP component which possesses quantitatively all of the acrosomal exocytosis-inducing activity of the intact ZP, stimulated GTP gamma S binding to the same level as solubilized ZP; ZP1 and ZP2 did not stimulate GTP gamma S binding. ZP from fertilized eggs (ZPf), which does not possess acrosome reaction-inducing activity, also failed to stimulate GTP gamma S binding to sperm membranes. These data demonstrate the direct activation of a Gi protein in sperm membrane preparations in response to the ZP glycoprotein, ZP3, that induces the acrosome reaction. These data imply that Gi protein activation is an early event in the signal sequence leading to sperm acrosomal exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1572281772,"DNA replication occurs in vivo with very high processivity, meaning that the replication complex assembles at the origin(s) of replication and then performs template-directed synthesis of DNA over virtually the entire genome without dissociation. Such processivity also characterizes reconstituted replication holoenzyme complexes in vitro. However, the isolated DNA polymerases are much less processive, especially under physiological conditions. In this paper we monitor the degree of processivity displayed by the bacteriophage T4-coded DNA polymerase while in its proofreading mode by asking whether an isolated polymerase can edit-out the 3'-terminal nucleotide from the primer (using the 3'----5'-exonuclease activity of the polymerase) and then into the synthesis mode without dissociating from the DNA template. This switch experiment is accomplished by using mismatched primer/template substrates as an experimental tool to mimic the situation that T4 DNA polymerase encounters after a misincorporation event has occurred. By performing experiments under single-turnover conditions (obtained using a heparin trap), we demonstrate that T4 DNA polymerase, upon encountering a misincorporated base, neither synthesizes the next base nor dissociates into solution. Instead, with a greater than 80% probability, it removes the misincorporated base and then continues synthesis in a fully processive manner. We also show that the removal of a doubly mispaired sequence from the 3'-terminus of the primer, followed by synthesis, is comparably processive. In contrast, the apparent processivity of removing a triply mispaired terminus is much reduced. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the notion that the active site of the T4 enzyme optimally accommodates only two unpaired nucleotide residues. Our results do not support the idea that the exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase is highly selective for mismatched termini; they suggest instead that the dwell time at a misincorporated base determines overall editing efficiency. The integrated results of this study provide additional insight into the structure of the T4 DNA polymerase, as well as into the interactions between the polymerase and the polymerase accessory proteins that are required to provide the holoenzyme complex with full processivity."
https://openalex.org/W1604714717,"The major surface glycoprotein of Leishmania, gp63, a fibronectin-like molecule, plays a key role in parasite-macrophage interaction. Binding of gp63 to macrophage receptors is inhibited by Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS)-containing synthetic peptides of fibronectin and by antibodies to these peptides. However, gp63 lacks an RGDS tetrapeptide. We sought to identify the region of gp63 that antigenically and functionally mimics the RGDS-containing region of fibronectin. We thus synthesized on polyethylene rods overlapping tetracosapeptides covering the whole sequence of Leishmania major gp63. gp63 affinity-purified antibodies raised against fibronectin and against the RGDS-containing fibronectin decapeptide RGDSPASSKP bound specifically to gp63 residues 241-264. Subsequently, by the use of smaller peptides, the gp63 tetrapeptide 252-255 (SRYD) was identified as the minimum antibody binding segment. Single residue substitution peptide analogues showed that indeed Tyr and Gly can be alternatively substituted in the SRYD- and RGDS-containing peptides of gp63 and fibronectin, respectively, without major effects on their antibody binding capacity. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of an SRYD peptide on promastigote-macrophage interaction in vitro; treatment of macrophages with an SRYD-containing gp63 octapeptide efficiently inhibited parasite attachment to macrophage receptors. Thus, the conserved among species sequence SRYD of gp63, with significant hydrophilicity, flexibility, and beta-turn propensity features, mimics antigenically and functionally the RGDS sequence of fibronectin. We suggest that this segment constitutes the putative gp63 adhesion site."

https://openalex.org/W1507206691,"Recently we have detected and partially purified a 15-kDa cytosolic L-alpha-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-binding protein (LPABP), which stimulates export of LPA from mitochondria (Vancura, A., Carroll, M. A., and Haldar, D. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 175, 339-343). Now we have purified this protein to homogeneity. By Western immunoblot analysis, amino acid sequence analysis, and binding characteristics we have shown that LPABP is identical with liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP). This protein binds LPA, and stimulates mitochondrial and microsomal glycerophosphate acyltransferase (GAT) and the export of LPA from both the organelles. The mitochondrially synthesized LPA exported by L-FABP can be converted to phosphatidic acid by microsomes. L-FABP also stimulates microsomal conversion of LPA to phosphatidic acid but strongly inhibits this reaction in mitochondria. However, in the absence of L-FABP mitochondria predominantly synthesize PA. Taken together, these findings are suggestive that L-FABP plays a major role in mitochondrial and microsomal phospholipid metabolism by regulating both the synthesis and utilization of LPA."
https://openalex.org/W1597081910,"It has previously been shown that the M (E1) glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) contains only O-linked oligosaccharides and localizes to the Golgi region when expressed independently. A detailed pulse-chase analysis was made of the addition of O-linked sugars to the M protein; upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, three different electrophoretic forms could be distinguished that corresponded to the sequential acquisition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), and sialic acid (SA). A fourth and fifth form could also be detected which we were unable to identify. Following Brefeldin A treatment, the M protein still acquired GalNAc, Gal, and SA, but the fourth and fifth forms were absent, suggesting that these modifications occur in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In contrast, in the presence of BFA, the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which contains N-linked oligosaccharides, acquired Gal and fucose but not SA. These results are consistent with earlier published data showing that Golgi compartments proximal to the TGN, but not the TGN itself, relocate to the endoplasmatic reticulum/intermediate compartment. More importantly, our data argue that, whereas addition of SA to N-linked sugars occurs in the TGN the acquisition of both SA on O-linked sugars and the addition of fucose to N-linked oligosaccharides must occur in Golgi compartments proximal to the TGN. The glycosylation of the M protein moreover indicates that it is transported to trans-Golgi and TGN. This was confirmed by electron microscopy immunocytochemistry, showing that the protein is targeted to cisternae on the trans side of the Golgi and co-localizes, at least in part, with TGN 38, a marker of the TGN, as well as with a lectin specific for sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1545772254,"The effect of temperature on the apparent equilibrium constant of creatine kinase (ATP:creatine N-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.3.2)) was determined. At equilibrium the apparent K' for the biochemical reaction was defined as [formula: see text] The symbol sigma denotes the sum of all the ionic and metal complex species of the reactant components in M. The K' at pH 7.0, 1.0 mM free Mg2+, and ionic strength of 0.25 M at experimental conditions was 177 +/- 7.0, 217 +/- 11, 255 +/- 10, and 307 +/- 13 (n = 8) at 38, 25, 15, and 5 degrees C, respectively. The standard apparent enthalpy or heat of the reaction at the specified conditions (delta H' degree) was calculated from a van't Hoff plot of log10K' versus 1/T, and found to be -11.93 kJ mol-1 (-2852 cal mol-1) in the direction of ATP formation. The corresponding standard apparent entropy of the reaction (delta S' degree) was +4.70 J K-1 mol-1. The linear function (r2 = 0.99) between log10 K' and 1/K demonstrates that both delta H' degree and delta S' degree are independent of temperature for the creatine kinase reaction, and that delta Cp' degree, the standard apparent heat capacity of products minus reactants in their standard states, is negligible between 5 and 38 degrees C. We further show from our data that the sign and magnitude of the standard apparent Gibbs energy (delta G' degree) of the creatine kinase reaction was comprised mostly of the enthalpy of the reaction, with 11% coming from the entropy T delta S' degree term. The thermodynamic quantities for the following two reference reactions of creatine kinase were also determined. [formula: see text] The delta H degree for Reaction 2 was -16.73 kJ mol-1 (-3998 cal mol-1) and for Reaction 3 was -23.23 kJ mol-1 (-5552 cal mol-1) over the temperature range 5-38 degrees C. The corresponding delta S degree values for the reactions were +110.43 and +83.49 J K-1 mol-1, respectively. Using the delta H' degree of -11.93 kJ mol-1, and one K' value at one temperature, a second K' at a second temperature can be calculated, thus permitting bioenergetic investigations of organs and tissues using the creatine kinase equilibria over the entire physiological temperature range."
https://openalex.org/W1578795160,"Abstract We demonstrate that although the guinea pig liver cytosolic beta-glucosidase does not catalyze the hydrolysis of gentiobiose, it does hydrolyze, disaccharide-containing glycosides such as p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-gentiobioside (Glc beta 1----6Glc beta-pNP) and mandelonitrile-beta-D-gentiobioside (amygdalin). Furthermore, we establish that the enzyme attacks disaccharide glycosides exolytically; specifically, we document the exolytic deglucosylation of amygdalin and the generation of the intermediate monosaccharide glycoside mandelonitrile-beta-D-glucoside prior to the formation of the aglycone (mandelonitrile). We also show that the cytosolic beta-glucosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of various phenolic (e.g. arbutin and salicin) and cyanogenic plant glucosides (e.g. prunasin). Using the everted gut-sack technique, we demonstrate that the plant glucosides, amygdalin, prunasin, and vicine, are transported across the small intestine of the guinea pig efficiently and without being hydrolyzed. Based on these data we speculate that the cytosolic beta-glucosidase may participate in biotransformation of toxic plant glucosides."

https://openalex.org/W1502944813,"In a recent study demonstrating the cell-free reconstitution of the pp60v-src-hsp90 complex, we found that the tyrosine kinase-hsp90 complex is stabilized by molybdate (Hutchison, K. A., Brott, B. K., De Leon, J. H., Perdew, G. H., Jove, R., and Pratt, W. B. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2902-2908). In this paper, we examine in detail the stabilization of this protein-protein interaction by transition metal oxyanions. The pp60v-src-hsp90 complex is stabilized by sodium molybdate with the same concentration dependence as the glucocorticoid receptor-hsp90 complex. As with the steroid receptor heterocomplexes, vanadate and tungstate also stabilize the pp60v-src-hsp90 interaction. Passage of cytosol through a Chelex-100 metal-chelating resin destabilizes the native pp60v-src-hsp90 complex, suggesting that the complex is normally stabilized by an endogenous metal factor. Readdition of either the heat-stable components of cytosol or a partially purified endogenous metal factor stabilizes the metal-depleted complex. Molybdate also stabilizes the presence of p50, a known hsp90-associated protein, in the pp60v-src heterocomplex. Given the identical effects of transition metal oxyanions on both pp60v-src- and steroid receptor-hsp90 complexes and the lack of any sequence homology between pp60v-src and the receptors, it seems very likely that it is the common component, hsp90, that contains the site of the metal interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1490370363,"Transcription of the narGHJI operon (encoding nitrate reductase) in Escherichia coli is primarily dependent on the activation of the pleiotropic transacting factor Fnr, which interacts with the promoter through a cis element (Fnr box) located near the transcription start site. Further stimulation of transcription occurs in the presence of nitrate and is dependent on activation of the transacting factor NarL and a cis-acting sequence (NarL box) located approximately 200 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site. To define the structure of the NarL box, alterations in the NarL box region, generated by saturation mutagenesis of the sequence from positions -184 to -202 in the narGHJI promoter of a narG::lacZ fusion-bearing plasmid, were analyzed for their effects on NarL-mediated stimulation of transcription. Single base substitutions that significantly reduced the NarL-mediated stimulation were restricted to a 6-base sequence, TACTCC, located at positions -193 to -198 in the narGHJI promoter. When 2 bases were modified, NarL-mediated stimulation was severely reduced when one or both alterations were located within the 6-base sequence. Attempts to restore NarL-mediated stimulation with an inverted NarL box were not successful. Although previous studies suggested that NarL-mediated stimulation of transcription may occur by a DNA looping mechanism, the results presented here demonstrate that it does not involve the passive formation of a simple DNA loop. Replacement of 94 or 108 bases of the approximately 150 base sequence between the Fnr box and the NarL box with an unrelated sequence resulted in elimination of NarL-mediated stimulation of transcription. Furthermore, shifting of most of the intervening sequence or defined segments of the sequence by 4 bases while maintaining the position of the NarL box relative to sequences required for Fnr-dependent, anaerobic transcription also eliminated the NarL-mediated stimulation. We conclude that in addition to the 6-base NarL box located on a specific face of the promoter DNA, the stimulation of transcription by NarL requires some specific sequences and/or higher order structure specified by the DNA that separates the NarL box from the Fnr box."
https://openalex.org/W1585025162,"The topography of rapid equilibrium complexes formed between G-actin and myosin subfragment-1, which are the first kinetic intermediates in the polymerization process into F-acto-S1 filaments, has been probed by chemical cross-linking. In the absence of ATP, cross-linking of G-actin-S1 complexes by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) yielded a major 165-170-kDa and a fainter 200-205-kDa doublet polypeptide. The actin:S1 molar ratio was 1 in the EDC-cross-linked complexes, using either double labeling techniques or the method combining EDC + N-hydroxysuccinimide. Chemical cleavages of the covalently cross-linked complexes by formic acid and N-hydroxylamine (Sutoh, K. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 1579-1585) showed that in the main cross-linked 165-kDa polypeptide, the 1-12 acidic N-terminal region of actin was covalently linked to the lysine-rich region connecting the central 50-kDa domain to the C-terminal 20-kDa domain of S1, as in F-acto-S1 complexes. G-actin, but not F-actin, was covalently cross-linked to S1 by N,N'-paraphenylenedimaleimide (p-PDM). A major 195-kDa and a minor 165-kDa polypeptide were obtained, could be separated from actin and S1 by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and did not exhibit actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity. Both EDC-cross-linked and p-PDM-cross-linked complexes between G-actin and S1 could be incorporated into F-acto-S1 decorated filaments. The C-terminal cysteine 374 of actin is involved in the p-PDM cross-linked 195-kDa complex. Accordingly, a covalent photocross-linked 200-kDa conjugate was formed between S1 heavy chain and benzophenone-G-actin, obtained by covalent modification of Cys374 by benzophenonemaleimide (Tao, T., Lamkin, M., and Scheiner, C. J. (1985) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 240, 627-634). These results demonstrate that (i) G-actin-S1 and F-actin-S1 complexes display a large similarity in the EDC-cross-linked electrostatic close contacts and (ii) a change in the environment of Cys374 is linked to the polymerization into F-actin-S1 decorated filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1482013463,"We have previously shown that the electrophoretic mobility of complexes formed in vitro between nuclear proteins and the regulatory domains of interferon-inducible genes is altered by an extranuclear protein present in elevated levels in the myeloid cells of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Interferon-alpha reduces the level of this activity only in the cells of patients who are clinically sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of interferon-alpha. We have purified this protein to homogeneity and found it to be a 57-kDa protein which corresponds to an isoform of protein disulfide isomerase. Protein disulfide isomerase is an oxidoreductase which catalyzes the interconversion between the reduced and oxidized states of proteins which contain multiple sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds. These studies suggest that this protein may play an important role in the transcriptional activation of interferon-inducible genes, perhaps through redox mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1827809351,"Proteoglycan aggregates were extracted from Swarm rat chondrosarcoma tissue in the native state and compared with proteoglycan aggregates isolated dissociatively with 4 M guanidine HCl. Purified aggregates were examined with a variety of electron microscopic techniques. In some cases they showed a structure of the central filament identical to that of the link-stabilized central filament observed in earlier experiments where the separated constituents were allowed to reconstitute (Morgelin, M., Paulsson, M., Hardingham, T. E., Heinegard, D., and Engel, J. (1988) Biochem. J. 253, 175-185). The tight packing of proteoglycan monomers along the hyaluronate with a minimum distance of 12 nm between adjacent E1 strands also could thus be confirmed for never dissociated aggregates. The results therefore show that the organization of proteoglycan aggregates assembled in vitro from the participating molecules is representative for conditions in situ. An additional structural type of central filament was observed in the preparations. This contained long stretches of free hyaluronate interspaced by short stretches of central filament with condensed arrays of link protein-proteoglycan. Chemical cross-linking in combination with low shear electron microscopical techniques showed that this discontinuous central filament structure is not an artifact of specimen preparation. The addition of suprastoichiometric amounts of exogenous link protein did not affect the central filament structure with the low packing density. Densely and loosely packed types of central filament were isolated in varying relative amounts with different associative and dissociative solvents."

https://openalex.org/W1599426550,"We report the development of a quantitative assay for measuring SH2 domain binding in vitro. Using this assay we have analyzed the binding of purified recombinant SH2 domains from ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) and the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85) to proteins from epidermal growth factor-stimulated and v-src-transformed cells. The purified recombinant SH2 domains from GAP and p85 bind to the tyrosine phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor with nanomolar affinities. Moreover, competition studies suggest that these two proteins bind to equivalent or overlapping sites on this receptor. In v-src-transformed cells the purified recombinant SH2 domains from GAP and p85 bind to distinct but overlapping sets of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1492114650,"When synthesized in Escherichia coli, the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) precursor accumulates in inclusion-like bodies (Abad, M. S., Oblong, J. E., and Lamppa, G. K. (1991) Plant Physiol. 96, 1220-1227). In this study we show that after solubilization in 6 M urea and dialysis into 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) the recombinant LHCP precursor (preLHCP) was not found as a monomer (31 kDa), but instead produced a heterogeneous population of oligomeric complexes, ranging from 60-300 kDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that the oligomers had folded structure, and that it was composed of both alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Approximately half of recombinant preLHCP found in these complexes was cleavable at the transit peptide-mature protein junction by a soluble chloroplast-processing enzyme in an organelle-free reaction. At 1.5 microM the recombinant precursor inhibited the import of radiolabeled preLHCP and the precursor of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase generated by reticulocyte lysate translations. When chloroplasts were preincubated with the precursor, followed by their reisolation, import was still blocked, providing evidence that competition between recombinant preLHCP and these substrates occurred at the chloroplast per se. Recombinant preLHCP was visualized on the envelope by immunofluorescence microscopy, and its presence there was mediated by a thermolysin-sensitive factor."

https://openalex.org/W1510195812,"The mechanism of facilitated lipid transfer by insect or mammalian plasma lipid transfer proteins has not been elucidated. Transfer catalysts may act as carriers of lipid between donor and acceptor lipoproteins or, alternatively, transfer may require formation of a ternary complex. This study was designed to determine if Manduca sexta hemolymph lipid transfer particle (LTP) can facilitate net vectorial transfer of lipid without concomitant contact between donor and acceptor lipoproteins and LTP. M. sexta [3H]diacylglycerol-high density lipophorin-larval ([3H]DAG-HDLp-L) and human low density lipoprotein (LDL) were covalently bound to Sepharose matrices and packed into separate columns. In incubations lacking LTP, greater than 98% of the recovered DAG remained associated with HDLp-L. An unrelated hemolymph storage protein, arylphorin, was unable to catalyze the transfer of DAG between solid-phase lipoproteins. Facilitated transfer of DAG from HDLp-L to LDL was observed when LTP was circulated between the columns. Under these conditions, facilitated transfer occurred at a rate of 2.24 ng of DAG/h (versus 0.16 microgram of DAG/h in the control), and after 16 h greater than 26% of recovered labeled DAG was transferred to LDL. This corresponds to a 14-fold rate enhancement induced by LTP. The LTP-specific transfer of DAG between physically separated lipoproteins demonstrates the ability of LTP to facilitate net lipid transfer via a carrier-mediated mechanism in the absence of a ternary complex involving donor, acceptor, and catalyst. In experiments aimed at assessing the relative contribution of ternary complex formation to DAG transfer, acceptor LDL was circulated with HDLp-L remaining immobilized. Under these conditions, LTP induced a 13-fold rate enhancement from 1.3 to 16.3 micrograms of DAG/h. The similar rate enhancements observed with both lipoproteins bound and only donor bound suggest the overall contribution of ternary complex formation to facilitated lipid transfer is insignificant. The described system should prove useful in mechanistic studies of other transfer proteins as well as studies of transfer of other lipids."

https://openalex.org/W1615946381,"A positive cis-acting element, the B element, located between -83 and -61 in the mouse alpha 1(III) collagen promoter, binds a factor present in nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. We have purified this factor using ion exchange chromatography, sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel fractionation. The DNA sequence used for the affinity chromatography was a single-base substitution in the B element that increased the stability of the B element-protein complex by 50%. Purification of the B element-binding factor (BBF) by DNA affinity chromatography resulted in the apparent loss of most or all of the DNA-binding activity of this factor. The DNA-binding activity could, however, be reconstituted by combining two chromatographic fractions: the high-salt eluate and the column flow-through. When the partially purified high-salt eluate was size-fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with subsequent renaturation of gel fractions from guanidine HCl, the purified BBF (apparent molecular weight of about 95,000) bound to the B element with high affinity. These results suggest that during DNA affinity purification of BBF a factor that inhibits BBF DNA binding was co-eluted with BBF. This inhibition of BBF DNA binding was reversed by the addition of the DNA affinity column flow-through. The binding of BBF to the B element of the mouse alpha 1(III) collagen promoter is therefore an apparently complex process involving interactions between BBF and other protein factors."
