Kistler et al. applied genomic analysis to ancient and extant South American maize lineages to investigate the genetic changes that accompanied domestication (see the Perspective by Zeder). The origin of modern maize cultivars likely involved a “semidomesticated” lineage that moved out of Mexico. Later improvements then occurred among multiple South American populations, including those in southwestern Amazonia. Science , this issue p. 1309 ; see also p. 1246"

IgE antibodies (and the B cells generating them) are rare and thus poorly characterized. Croote et al. performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood B cells from patients with peanut allergies and delineated each cell's gene expression, splice variants, and antibody sequences (see the Perspective by Gould and Ramadani). Unlike other isotypes, circulating IgE B cells were mostly immature plasmablasts. Surprisingly, certain IgE antibodies manifested identical gene rearrangements in unrelated individuals. These IgE antibodies showed high affinity and unexpected cross-reactivity to peanut allergens. Science , this issue p. 1306 ; see also p. 1247"

https://openalex.org/W2905542822,"We previously reported1 the presence of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) deposits in individuals with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) who had been treated during childhood with human cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone (c-hGH) contaminated with prions. The marked deposition of parenchymal and vascular Aβ in these relatively young individuals with treatment-induced (iatrogenic) CJD (iCJD), in contrast to other prion-disease patients and population controls, allied with the ability of Alzheimer’s disease brain homogenates to seed Aβ deposition in laboratory animals, led us to argue that the implicated c-hGH batches might have been contaminated with Aβ seeds as well as with prions. However, this was necessarily an association, and not an experimental, study in humans and causality could not be concluded. Given the public health importance of our hypothesis, we proceeded to identify and biochemically analyse archived vials of c-hGH. Here we show that certain c-hGH batches to which patients with iCJD and Aβ pathology were exposed have substantial levels of Aβ40, Aβ42 and tau proteins, and that this material can seed the formation of Aβ plaques and cerebral Aβ−amyloid angiopathy in intracerebrally inoculated mice expressing a mutant, humanized amyloid precursor protein. These results confirm the presence of Aβ seeds in archived c-hGH vials and are consistent with the hypothesized iatrogenic human transmission of Aβ pathology. This experimental confirmation has implications for both the prevention and the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, and should prompt a review of the risk of iatrogenic transmission of Aβ seeds by medical and surgical procedures long recognized to pose a risk of accidental prion transmission2,3. Archived vials of cadaveric human growth hormone contain substantial levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and can seed Aβ plaques in susceptible mice, suggesting that this material could have transmitted Aβ pathology to humans."

Studer et al. selected progressively more-proficient variants of a small protein derived from a computationally designed zinc-binding peptide. The resulting enzyme could perform the trained reaction at rates typical for naturally evolved enzymes and serendipitously developed a strong preference for a single enantiomer of the substrate. A structure of the final catalyst highlights how small, progressive changes can remodel both catalytic residues and protein architecture in unpredictable ways. Science , this issue p. 1285"

Strigolactone hormones can be used to initiate germination of Striga seeds when no host crop is present, which causes the nascent Striga plants to die. Unfortunately, strigolactones are also used by crop plants to establish beneficial mutualisms. Uraguchi et al. developed a hybrid molecule that can initiate Striga germination without interfering with strigolactone-dependent events in the host (see the Perspective by Bouwmeester). The compound has the potential to diversify routes toward protecting fields from Striga infestation. Science , this issue p. 1301 ; see also p. 1248"
https://openalex.org/W2905554921,"Pinpointing the role of geometric phase During chemical reactions, electrons usually rearrange more quickly than nuclei. Thus, theorists often adopt an adiabatic framework that considers vibrational and rotational dynamics within single electronic states. Near the regime where two electronic states intersect, the dynamics get more complicated, and a geometric phase factor is introduced to maintain the simplifying power of the adiabatic treatment. Yuan et al. conducted precise experimental measurements that validate this approach. They studied the elementary H + HD reaction at energies just above the intersection of electronic states and observed angular oscillations in the product-state cross sections that are well reproduced by simulations that include the geometric phase.

Over the last glacial period, atmospheric 14C/12C ranges from values similar to modern values to values 1.70 times higher (42,000 to 39,000 years ago). The latter correspond to 14C ages 5200 years less than calibrated ages and correlate with the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion followed by Heinrich Stadial 4. Millennial-scale variations are largely attributable to Earth's magnetic field changes and in part to climate-related changes in the oceanic carbon cycle. A progressive shift to lower 14C/12C values between 25,000 and 11,000 years ago is likely related, in part, to progressively increasing ocean ventilation rates."

The combination of spin-orbit coupling with electronic correlations could lead to exotic effects; however, these two types of interactions are rarely found to be strong in the same material. Gotlieb et al. used spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to map out the spin texture in the cuprate Bi2212. Surprisingly, they found signatures of spin-momentum locking, not unlike that seen in topological insulators. Thus, in addition to strong electronic correlations, this cuprate also has considerable spin-orbit coupling. Science , this issue p. 1271"
https://openalex.org/W2904330796,"Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapies provide survival benefits to breast cancer patients, in particular in estrogen receptor negative (ER−) cancers, by reducing rates of recurrences. It is assumed that the benefits of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy are due to the killing of disseminated, residual cancer cells, however, there is no formal evidence for it. Here, we provide experimental evidence that ER− breast cancer cells that survived high-dose Doxorubicin and Methotrexate based chemotherapies elicit a state of immunological dormancy. Hallmark of this dormant phenotype is the sustained activation of the IRF7/IFN-β/IFNAR axis subsisting beyond chemotherapy treatment. Upregulation of IRF7 in treated cancer cells promoted resistance to chemotherapy, reduced cell growth and induced switching of the response from a myeloid derived suppressor cell-dominated immune response to a CD4+/CD8+ T cell-dependent anti-tumor response. IRF7 silencing in tumor cells or systemic blocking of IFNAR reversed the state of dormancy, while spontaneous escape from dormancy was associated with loss of IFN-β production. Presence of IFN-β in the circulation of ER− breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant Epirubicin chemotherapy correlated with a significantly longer distant metastasis-free survival. These findings establish chemotherapy-induced immunological dormancy in ER− breast cancer as a novel concept for (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy activity, and implicate sustained activation of the IRF7/IFN-β/IFNAR pathway in this effect. Further, IFN-β emerges as a potential predictive biomarker and therapeutic molecule to improve outcome of ER− breast cancer patients treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy."

The plasma membrane is considered the major site for α-secretase–mediated APP cleavage, but other cellular locations have not been rigorously investigated. Here, we report that APP is processed by endogenous α-secretase at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of both transfected HeLa cells and mouse primary neurons. We have previously shown the adaptor protein complex, AP-4, and small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor–like GTPase 5b (Arl5b) are required for efficient post-Golgi transport of APP to endosomes. We found here that AP-4 or Arl5b depletion results in Golgi accumulation of APP and increased secretion of the soluble α-secretase cleavage product sAPPα. Moreover, inhibition of γ-secretase following APP accumulation in the TGN increases the levels of the membrane-bound C-terminal fragments of APP from both α-secretase cleavage (α-CTF, named C83 according to its band size) and BACE1 cleavage (β-CTF/C99). The level of C83 was ∼4 times higher than that of C99, indicating that α-secretase processing is the major pathway and that BACE1 processing is the minor pathway in the TGN. AP-4 silencing in mouse primary neurons also resulted in the accumulation of endogenous APP in the TGN and enhanced α-secretase processing. These findings identify the TGN as a major site for α-secretase processing in HeLa cells and primary neurons and indicate that both APP processing pathways can occur within the TGN compartment along the secretory pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2904955638,"The E3 ligase membrane-associated ring-CH-type finger 6 (MARCH6) is a polytopic enzyme bound to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. It controls levels of several known protein substrates, including a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, squalene monooxygenase. However, beyond its own autodegradation, little is known about how MARCH6 itself is regulated. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing, MARCH6 overexpression, and immunoblotting, we found here that cholesterol stabilizes MARCH6 protein endogenously and in HEK293 cells that stably express MARCH6. Conversely, MARCH6-deficient HEK293 and HeLa cells lost their ability to degrade squalene monooxygenase in a cholesterol-dependent manner. The ability of cholesterol to boost MARCH6 did not seem to involve a putative sterol-sensing domain in this E3 ligase, but was abolished when either membrane extraction by valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) or proteasomal degradation was inhibited. Furthermore, cholesterol-mediated stabilization was absent in two MARCH6 mutants that are unable to degrade themselves, indicating that cholesterol stabilizes MARCH6 protein by preventing its autodegradation. Experiments with chemical chaperones suggested that this likely occurs through a conformational change in MARCH6 upon cholesterol addition. Moreover, cholesterol reduced the levels of at least three known MARCH6 substrates, indicating that cholesterol-mediated MARCH6 stabilization increases its activity. Our findings highlight an important new role for cholesterol in controlling levels of proteins, extending the known repertoire of cholesterol homeostasis players.

https://openalex.org/W2904731075,"Chronic exposure of pancreatic β cells to high concentrations of free fatty acids leads to lipotoxicity (LT)-mediated suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This effect is in part caused by a decline in mitochondrial function as well as by a reduction in lysosomal acidification. Because both mitochondria and lysosomes can alter one another's function, it remains unclear which initiating dysfunction sets off the detrimental cascade of LT, ultimately leading to β-cell failure. Here, we investigated the effects of restoring lysosomal acidity on mitochondrial function under LT. Our results show that LT induces a dose-dependent lysosomal alkalization accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial mass. This increase is due to a reduction in mitochondrial turnover as analyzed by MitoTimer, a fluorescent protein for which the emission is regulated by mitochondrial clearance rate. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, citrate synthase activity, and ATP content are all reduced by LT. Restoration of lysosomal acidity using lysosome-targeted nanoparticles is accompanied by stimulation of mitochondrial turnover as revealed by mitophagy measurements and the recovery of mitochondrial mass. Remarkably, re-acidification restores citrate synthase activity and ATP content in an insulin secreting β-cell line (INS-1). Furthermore, nanoparticle-mediated lysosomal reacidification rescues mitochondrial maximal respiratory capacity in both INS-1 cells and primary mouse islets. Therefore, our results indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is downstream of lysosomal alkalization under lipotoxic conditions and that recovery of lysosomal acidity is sufficient to restore the bioenergetic defects.—Assali, E.

https://openalex.org/W2905586358,"Trichodesmium, a filamentous bloom-forming marine cyanobacterium, plays a key role in the biogeochemistry of oligotrophic ocean regions because of the ability to fix nitrogen. Naturally occurring in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the contribution of Trichodesmium to the nutrient budget may be of the same order as that entering the system via catchment runoff. However, the cyclicity of Trichodesmium in the GBR is poorly understood and sparsely documented because of the lack of sufficient observations. This study provides the first systematic analysis of Trichodesmium spatial and temporal occurrences in the GBR over the decade-long MERIS ocean color mission (2002–2012). Trichodesmium surface expressions were detected using the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) applied to MERIS satellite imagery of the GBR lagoonal waters. The MCI performed well (76%), albeit tested on a limited set of images (N = 25) coincident with field measurements. A north (Cape York) to south (Fitzroy) increase in the extent, frequency and timing of the surface expressions characterized the GBR, with surface expressions extending over several hundreds of kilometers. The two southernmost subregions Mackay and Fitzroy accounted for the most (70%) bloom events. The bloom timing of Trichodesmium varied from May in the north to November in the south, with wet season conditions less favorable to Trichodesmium aggregations. MODIS-Aqua Sea Surface Temperature (SST) datasets, wind speed and field measurements of nutrient concentrations were used in combination with MCI positive instances to assess the blooms’ driving factors. Low wind speed (<6 m.s-1) and SST > 24°C were associated with the largest surface aggregations. Generalized additive models (GAM) indicated an increase in bloom occurrences over the 10-year period with seasonal bloom patterns regionally distinct. Interannual variability in SST partially (14%) explained bloom occurrences, and other drivers, such as the subregion and the nutrient budget, likely regulate Trichodesmium surface aggregations in the GBR."
https://openalex.org/W2952665968,"Dyscalculia, a specific learning disability that impacts arithmetical skills, has previously been associated to a deficit in the precision of the system that estimates the approximate number of objects in visual scenes (the so called ‘number sense’ system). However, because in tasks involving numerosity comparisons dyscalculics’ judgements appears disproportionally affected by continuous quantitative dimensions (such as the size of the items), an alternative view linked dyscalculia to a domain-general difficulty in inhibiting task-irrelevant responses. To arbitrate between these views, we evaluated the degree of reciprocal interference between numerical and non-numerical quantitative dimensions in adult dyscalculics and matched controls. We used a novel stimulus set orthogonally varying in mean item size and numerosity, putting particular attention into matching both features’ perceptual discriminability. Participants compared those stimuli based on each of the two dimensions. While control subjects showed no significant size interference when judging numerosity, dyscalculics’ numerosity judgments were strongly biased by the unattended size dimension. Importantly however, both groups showed the same degree of interference from the unattended dimension when judging mean size. Moreover, only the ability to discard the irrelevant size information when comparing numerosity (but not the reverse) significantly predicted calculation ability across subjects. Overall, our results show that numerosity discrimination is less prone to interference than discrimination of another quantitative feature (mean item size) when the perceptual discriminability of these features is matched, as here in control subjects. By quantifying, for the first time, dyscalculic subjects’ degree of interference on another orthogonal dimension of the same stimuli, we are able to exclude a domain-general inhibition deficit as explanation for their poor / biased numerical judgement. We suggest that enhanced reliance on non-numerical cues during numerosity discrimination can represent a strategy to cope with a less precise number sense."

In this study, we demonstrated that synthetic miR-2110 mimic had a generic effect on reducing cell survival in neuroblastoma cell lines with distinct genetic backgrounds, although the induction of cell differentiation traits varied between cell lines. In investigating the mechanisms underlying such functions of miR-2110, we identified that among its predicted target genes down-regulated by miR-2110, knockdown of Tsukushi (TSKU) expression showed the most potent effect in inducing cell differentiation and reducing cell survival, suggesting that TSKU protein plays a key role in mediating the functions of miR-2110. In investigating the clinical relevance of miR-2110 and TSKU expression in neuroblastoma patients, we found that low tumor miR-2110 levels were significantly correlated with high tumor TSKU mRNA levels, and that both low miR-2110 and high TSKU mRNA levels were significantly correlated with poor patient survival. These findings altogether support the oncosuppressive function of miR-2110 and suggest an important role for miR-2110 and its target TSKU in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and in determining patient prognosis."

Poor oral hygiene status, gingivitis and socio-demographic determinants have been shown to be associated with periodontal diseases. There is limited information on the gingivitis and oral hygiene status among Iranian children. In the present study, the status of gingivitis, oral hygiene status, and their association with socio-demographic determinants among schoolchildren aged 7-12 years old in Hamadan were investigated.In this cross-sectional study, 988 primary school students aged 7-12 years old were selected. The oral hygiene status was measured through Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) and Community Periodontal Index (CPI) was used to evaluate gingival bleeding and calculus. CPI was measured using a standardized protocol to investigate gum bleeding and calculus. The oral hygiene was classified as good, fair or poor based on calculus and debris measurements. Age, gender, educational level, occupation and residence district of parents, dental pain experience in the last year and whether parents supervised their children while brushing were assessed by the questionnaires. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis.The oral hygiene status was good in 644 students (65.20%), fair in 341 (34.50%) and poor in three (0.30%). Moreover, the results of CPI depicted that 639 students (64.07%) had healthy periodontium, 320 (32.40%) had periodontal bleeding and 29 (2.9%) were with calculus. Higher percentage of the boys in the age group of 12 years old had periodontal bleeding and fewer good oral hygiene. The results of CPI and OHI-S scores depicted that more than half of the primary school students had healthy gums and periodontium (64.1%) and good oral hygiene status (65.2%). There were significant statistical associations between age and residence district with calculus measured by the CPI, also between gender, age, residence district, and mother's occupation with the gingival bleeding measured by the CPI. Furthermore, age and mother's occupation were significantly associated with OHI-S index.In general, the periodontal health status is poorer in students attending suburban schools compared to those in urban schools in Hamadan. Since there are significant associations between gender, school districts and mother's occupation with oral hygiene index among schoolchildren in primary schools, considering them in schools' oral health program design might be useful."
https://openalex.org/W2903599381,"Molecular techniques allow non-invasive dietary studies from faeces, providing an invaluable tool to unveil ecological requirements of endangered or elusive species. They contribute to progress on important issues such as genomics, population genetics, dietary studies or reproductive analyses, essential knowledge for conservation biology. Nevertheless, these techniques require general methods to be tailored to the specific research objectives, as well as to substrate- and species-specific constraints. In this pilot study we test a range of available primers to optimise diet analysis from metabarcoding of faeces of a generalist aquatic insectivore, the endangered Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus, É. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1811, Talpidae), as a step to improve the knowledge of the conservation biology of this species. Twenty-four faeces were collected in the field, DNA was extracted from them, and fragments of the standard barcode region (COI) were PCR amplified by using five primer sets (Brandon-Mong, Gillet, Leray, Meusnier and Zeale). PCR outputs were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, sequences were processed, clustered into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) using UPARSE algorithm and BLASTed against the NCBI database. Although all primer sets successfully amplified their target fragments, they differed considerably in the amounts of sequence reads, rough OTUs, and taxonomically assigned OTUs. Primer sets consistently identified a few abundant prey taxa, probably representing the staple food of the Pyrenean desman. However, they differed in the less common prey groups. Overall, the combination of Gillet and Zeale primer sets were most cost-effective to identify the widest taxonomic range of prey as well as the desman itself, which could be further improved stepwise by adding sequentially the outputs of Leray, Brandon-Mong and Meusnier primers. These results are relevant for the conservation biology of this endangered species as they allow a better characterization of its food and habitat requirements."

Whereas higher eukaryotes such as plants and mammals hardly survive a deuterium content of >30%, many microorganisms can grow on fully deuterated media, albeit at reduced rates. Very little is known about how the H/D replacement influences life at the systems level.

We could quantify >1800 proteins under all conditions, several 100 of which exhibited strong regulation during both adaptation processes. The adaptation to minimal medium strongly up-regulated amino acid synthesis and sugar metabolism and down-regulated translational proteins on average by 9%, concomitant with a reduction in growth rate from 1.8 to 0.67 h−1.

Important applications of deuteration comprise labeling for NMR, neutron scattering, and MS, increasing the stability of pharmacological compounds as well as the study of fundamental determinants of kinetics and stability in biomolecular systems. Although it is obvious that the detrimental biological effects of deuteration are based on the altered physicochemical properties of deuterated compounds, no particular biomolecular function has been identified that would preclude life under deuteration. protium deuterium kinetic isotope effect hydrogen bond tricarboxylic acid Clusters of Orthologous Groups (database) Gene Ontology (database) sodium deoxycholate.

In turn, the shorter bonds exhibit lower bond polarization and reduced acidity. Thus the pK of water increases from 13.995 in H2O to 14.951 in D2O (11Haynes W.M. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2009Google Scholar), whereas the pK values of single deprotonation reactions for common acids increase typically by about 0.4 (12Krezel A. Bal W.

The shortening of the covalent bond length of hydrogen bond (H-bond) donors also leads to an increase of the donor to acceptor distance in H-bonds on the order of 0.01–0.04 Å, commonly known as the classical Ubbelohde effect (13Ubbelohde A.R.

In contrast to these relatively small equilibrium effects, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) in hydrogen transfer reactions can be considerably larger. The primary KIEs defined by the ratio kH/kD of the hydron transfer rates are typically in the range of 1–10, which can be explained by semiclassical theories via the differences in zero point vibrations (15Westheimer F.H.

However, KIEs may also reach values of up to ∼80 because of quantum mechanical tunneling (16Knapp M.J. Rickert K. Klinman J.P.

The consequences of these physicochemical effects on the cellular function of biomolecules are not well-understood. D2O and deuteration certainly affect the stability of biomolecules, but the size of the effects is relatively small. Thus D2O solvent marginally increases the melting temperature of dsDNA by about 2 K (18Izzo V. Fornili S.L. Cordone L.

These observations for both proteins and lipids hint at a reduction of attractive van der Waals interactions under deuteration. Compared with these moderate changes in stability, the stronger kinetic isotope effects, i.e. the reduction of hydrogen transfer rates (15Westheimer F.H.

Most of these observations have not been analyzed further by modern high-resolution techniques. Of note, the inhibition of mitosis has been investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy (33Lamprecht J. Schroeter D. Paweletz N. Derangement of microtubule arrays in interphase and mitotic PtK2 cells treated with deuterium oxide (heavy water).J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98 (1650376): 463-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro assays of isolated microtubules (34Panda D. Chakrabarti G. Hudson J. Pigg K. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Himes R.H.

The latter show increased microtubule polymerization and decreased rates of microtubule growth and GTP hydrolysis in D2O (34Panda D. Chakrabarti G. Hudson J. Pigg K. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Himes R.H.

On the level of general cellular functions, a reduction of protein translation and an accumulation of mRNA induced by D2O have been observed in cell-free protein expression assays (35Hohlefelder L.S. Stögbauer T. Opitz M. Bayerl T.M. Rädler J.O. Heavy water reduces GFP expression in prokaryotic cell-free assays at the translation level while stimulating its transcription.Biomed Res. Int. 2013; 2013 (24455706): 1-910.1155/2013/592745Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Besides one report indicating effects of D2O on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the C1 metabolic pathways in Escherichia coli (36Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Deuterium isotope effects on the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli cells grown on a D2O-containing minimal medium.J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17 (10909864): 33-4210.1023/A:1008329124672Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), no systematic metabolomics studies have been undertaken. With the advent of modern omics techniques and the increase in resolution of structural techniques, a much more comprehensive description of the deuteration effect on life becomes feasible. As a first step toward such a description at the system level, we have followed the morphology and the response of the E. coli proteome during adaptation to a highly deuterated (≥99% atom-D) minimal growth medium. As a byproduct, we have also characterized the proteome response from a protonated full medium to a protonated minimal medium. These responses occur within several hours and are faster than a possible modification of the genome by genetic selection. Very strong and distinct proteome changes accompanied by reductions in growth rates are observed for both processes, whereas cell size and subcellular organization remain largely unaffected. The transition from full to minimal medium predominantly up-regulates proteins involved in amino acid synthesis and glucose utilization, but down-regulates translational proteins. The change to the deuterated medium further reduces translational proteins in agreement with the further reduced growth rate. In contrast to the adaptation to minimal medium, the changes under deuteration are much more widespread and occur across almost all protein functional categories. Very often these changes affect enzymes involved in hydrogen transfer reactions. Thus the KIE appears as the major mechanism to influence and limit cellular function under deuteration. To study the effect of a deuterated environment on E. coli under well-controlled conditions, we compared growth on protonated and deuterated minimal media, which can be easily generated from D2O and deuterated glucose as the sole hydrogen sources (besides trace amounts of vitamins and EDTA). Very reproducible adaptation of E. coli to such a highly deuterated (≥99%) environment was achieved in a stepwise manner (Fig. 1). Cells were initially seeded in protonated full (LB) medium and then transferred sequentially to protonated M9 minimal medium (M9H1), 70% D2O M9 medium (M9D2), and finally perdeuterated M9 medium (99.8% D2O, 97% deuterated glucose-d7, M9D3). At each step, cells were grown within the exponential phase to an A600 of about 0.3–0.6 for typically five generations. For a stringent comparison, protonated M9H3 cultures were also generated as two consecutive cultures in protonated M9 medium from the M9H1 cells to match the total number of generations to the M9D3 cultures. To study the influence of the growth phase, samples for analysis were taken both from the exponential phase as well as from an extended cultivation of the cells to the early stationary phase (A600 ≥ 1.2, Table S1). The transfer to the minimal and deuterated medium increased the growth rate ( = ln(2)/generation time) from 1.8 ± 0.2 h−1 (LB), over 0.67 ± 0.02 h−1 (M9H1 and M9H3) to 0.37 ± 0.01 h−1 (M9D3). The nearly 2-fold decrease in growth rate in the deuterated medium provides manifest evidence of the severe deuterium isotope effects on E. coli cellular functions. As early reports indicated strong changes in morphology and cell size of microorganisms induced by D2O (1Katz J.J. Crespi H.L. Deuterated organisms: Cultivation and uses.Science. 1966; 151 (5325694): 1187-119410.1126/science.151.3715.1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Flaumenhaft E. Bose S. Crespi H.L. Katz J.J. Deuterium isotope effects in cytology.Int. Rev. Cytol. 1965; 18 (5337037): 313-36110.1016/S0074-7696(08)60557-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate this phenomenon by modern microscopic techniques. Cells from exponentially grown M9H3 and M9D3 cultures were indistinguishable with respect to their general appearance by phase-contrast light microscopy (Fig. 2A). A quantitative analysis (Fig. 2B) revealed a slight decrease in mean length (2.60 ± 0.02 μm → 2.41 ± 0.02 μm) and a slight increase in mean width (0.764 ± 0.003 μm → 0.823 ± 0.004 μm) because of the change from protonated to deuterated medium. These changes are minor relative to the observed variations of length and width within the cell populations (0.4 μm, 0.1 μm). To detect changes at higher resolution, we also analyzed plunge-frozen samples by cryo-EM. For both cultures, inner membrane, peptidoglycan layer, as well as the outer membrane were distinctly observable in the micrographs (Fig. 2C), but again indicated a very similar overall organization and size of the cell envelope in M9D3e compared with M9H3e cultures. Also, no particular differences are observable in the cellular interior and its visible ribosomal particles. Thus our results, in contrast to the early literature reports, indicate that growth on the deuterated medium does not induce strong effects on shape and cellular organization of E. coli. To follow the adaptation to D2O at a detailed molecular level, we have analyzed the proteome of E. coli grown on protonated full (LB), protonated minimal (M9H3), and deuterated minimal (M9D3) media using shotgun LC-MS/MS of proteolyzed samples. A high accuracy of the relative protonated and deuterated protein abundances was obtained by combining protonated and deuterated proteolyzed samples as 1:1 mixtures into single samples for combined LC-MS/MS. The acquired LC-MS/MS data were subjected to a combined search and quantification of protonated and deuterated peptides taking into account the reduced retention times of deuterated peptides yielding a high correlation between the detected protonated and deuterated proteins (r2 = 0.859, see “Materials and methods” for details). To verify the accuracy of the detected mass intensity changes, we analyzed different ratios of protonated and deuterated peptide mixtures in the range of 0.1 to 10 (Fig. 3A). The ratios of detected deuterated versus protonated mass intensities showed an excellent linear correlation (r2 = 0.9999) with the relative input concentrations of deuterated and protonated peptides. Thus our detection procedure accurately determines relative abundances of deuterated and protonated proteins over at least two orders of magnitude. In total 1849 proteins were detected in common among all media conditions for samples obtained from the exponential- and also stationary-phase cultures (denoted by the appendices “e” and “s”, respectively). Triplicate, independent cell cultures yielded very good reproducibility of the protein abundances with very similar distributions of their coefficients of variation (CV, relative standard deviations) for all conditions and median CV values in the 10% range (Fig. 3B). A comparison between the different conditions showed highly significant effects. Thus 496 proteins exhibited at least 2-fold abundance changes with a q-value ≤ 0.01 when moving from the LB medium (LBe) to the protonated minimal medium (M9H3e) (Fig. 3C, left panel). The subsequent adaptation to the deuterated (M9D3e) minimal medium caused similarly strong changes for 384 proteins (Fig. 3C, right panel). Within these sets of regulated proteins, 143 are common between the adaptations from LBe to M9H3e and from M9H3e to M9D3e. Very similar abundance changes were observed between stationary-phase LBs and M9H3s as well as M9H3s and M9D3s cultures. The intensities and statistics of all detected proteins are listed in Table S2. A principal component analysis of the total variations of protein abundances reveals that all three conditions of full (LB), protonated minimal (M9H3), and deuterated minimal (M9D3) media are separated into distinct clusters within the first and second principal components (Fig. 4). The high reproducibility within the triplicate cell cultures indicates a uniform and robust adaptation to the different conditions. Variations between exponential- and stationary-phase cultures are also small within both minimal media conditions (M9H3e/s, M9D3e/s), but are larger for the protonated full medium (LBe/s). Interestingly the position of LBs within the first two principal components is located on a line from LBe toward M9H3e/s at about one fifth of their distance. This points at a nutrient limitation under the stationary LB conditions, which is similar to, but not yet as severe as in, M9 medium. In strong contrast, the positions of M9D3e/s are clearly not collinear with the line connecting LBe and M9H3e/s. Thus the proteome changes because of deuteration are highly distinct from those caused by the nutrient limitations of the minimal medium. Because the total of proteins detected by the present mass spectrometric analysis covers almost the entire cellular expressed protein content (37Schmidt A. Kochanowski K. Vedelaar S. Ahrne E. Volkmer B. Callipo L. Knoops K. Bauer M. Aebersold R. Heinemann M. The quantitative and condition-dependent Escherichia coli proteome.Nat.

To obtain an overview of the proteome allocation to different functional categories, we summed the protein signals detected within the 22 categories of the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) database (39Tatusov R.L.

Across each condition, the largest fraction of the detected proteome belongs to the COG translation category J, which comprises the ribosomal proteins and amounts to 36% of the total protein mass for LBe (30% for LBs) (Fig. 5A). Upon change to protonated minimal medium (M9H3e/s), this fraction is reduced to 27%, and the second largest category E associated to amino acid metabolism is up-regulated to 13% from the 7% in LB. This is consistent with the absence of amino acids in the minimal medium, which need to be synthesized by E. coli. However, the reduced supply of amino acids apparently still limits translation and in consequence reduces the a"
https://openalex.org/W2904896149,"Globalization is defined for individuals as their connectivity in global networks. Social identity is conceptualized as attachment and identification with a group. We measure individual involvement with global networks and local, national, and global social identity through a questionnaire. Propensity to cooperate is measured in experiments involving local and global others. Firstly, we analyze possible determinants of global social identity. Overall, attachment to global identity is significantly lower than national and local identity, but there is a significant positive correlation between global social identity and an index of individual global connectivity. Secondly, we find a significant mediating effect of global social identity between individual global connectivity and propensity to cooperate at the global level. This is consistent with a cosmopolitan hypothesis of how participation in global networks reshapes social identity: Increased participation in global networks increases global social identity and this in turn increases propensity to cooperate with others. We also show that this model receives more support than alternative models substituting either propensity to associate with others or general generosity for individual global connectivity. We further demonstrate that more globalized individuals do not reduce contributions to local accounts while increasing contributions to global accounts, but rather are overall more generous. Finally, we find that the effect of global social identity on cooperation is significantly stronger in countries at a relatively low stage of globalization, compared to more globalized countries."
https://openalex.org/W2904150188,"Macroscale loading of bone generates a complex local mechanical microenvironment that drives osteogenesis and bone mechanoadaptation. One such mechanical stimulus generated is hydrostatic pressure (HP); however, the effect of HP on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the mechanotransduction mechanisms utilized by these cells to sense this stimulus are yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclic HP is a potent mediator of cytoskeletal reorganization and increases in osteogenic responses in MSCs. In particular, we demonstrate that the intermediate filament (IF) network undergoes breakdown and reorganization with centripetal translocation of IF bundles toward the perinuclear region. Furthermore, we show for the first time that this IF remodeling is required for loading-induced MSC osteogenesis, revealing a novel mechanism of MSC mechanotransduction. In addition, we demonstrate that chemical disruption of IFs with withaferin A induces a similar mechanism of IF breakdown and remodeling as well as a subsequent increase in osteogenic gene expression in MSCs, exhibiting a potential mechanotherapeutic effect to enhance MSC osteogenesis. This study therefore highlights a novel mechanotransduction mechanism of pressure-induced MSC osteogenesis involving the understudied cytoskeletal structure, the IF, and demonstrates a potential new therapy to enhance bone formation in bone-loss diseases such as osteoporosis.—Stavenschi, E., Hoey, D.

However, differences in the mouse and human molecules might result in differential engagement of this pathway. Here, we report the crystal structure of mouse 4-1BBL and of the mouse 4-1BB/4-1BBL complex, which together provided insights into the molecular mechanism by which m4-1BBL and its cognate receptor recognize each other. Unlike all human or mouse tumor necrosis factor ligands that form noncovalent and mostly trimeric assemblies, the m4-1BBL structure formed a disulfide-linked dimeric assembly. The structure disclosed that certain differences in the amino acid composition along the intramolecular interface, together with two specific residues (Cys-246 and Ser-256) present exclusively in m4-1BBL, are responsible for this unique dimerization. Unexpectedly, upon m4-1BB binding, m4-1BBL undergoes structural changes within each protomer; moreover, the individual m4-1BBL protomers rotate relative to each other, yielding a dimerization interface with more inter-subunit interactions. We also observed that in the m4-1BB/4-1BBL complex, each receptor monomer binds exclusively to a single ligand subunit with contributions of cysteine-rich domain 1 (CRD1), CRD2, and CRD3.

Most members of the TNFR family are monomeric and share a similar topology composed of several cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) within the extracellular domain and TRAF-binding motifs in their cytoplasmic regions (9Locksley R.M.

The TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies: integrating mammalian biology.Cell. 2001; 104 (11239407): 487-50110.1016/S0092-8674(01)00237-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). A typical CRD is composed of cysteine residues that form intra-molecular (and intra-domain) disulfide bonds, and according to their number and topological connectivity, each CRD can contain any of three modules A1, A2, and B2 (10Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Modularity in the TNF-receptor family.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23 (9538693): 74-7910.1016/S0968-0004(97)01164-XAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The ectodomain of human and mouse 4-1BB contains 10 intra-disulfide bonds that maintain the structural and functional integrity of the protein. Human 4-1BB contains an additional cysteine at position 121 in CRD4 that forms an inter-molecular disulfide bond between two adjacent monomers (11Bitra A. Doukov T. Croft M. Zajonc D.M.

The CRD1 region of both human and mouse 4-1BB is partial, and it lacks a conserved anti-parallel β-strand motif. The CRD2 contains A1 and B2 modules made up of antiparallel β-strands with 1–3 and 2–4 disulfide connectivity, and the CRD3 contains A1 and A2 modules. Although both 4-1BB molecules exhibit ∼30% sequence identity with other characterized TNFR members, the CRD3 and CRD4 regions do not superimpose with any other receptor. This is due to the bend in the central hinge region of both human and mouse 4-1BB that joins CRD2 and CRD3, which changes the relative orientation of CRD3 and CRD4 distinctly with respect to corresponding regions of other TNFR members (12Bitra A.

However, they exhibit structural diversity in the way the individual subunits assemble with respect to each other. In this regard, the TNF ligands were originally described to fall into three sub-families based on their sequence variance and structural organization (14Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J.

The majority of molecules are considered as conventional family ligands and contain longer loops connecting CD, DE, and EF strands and are assembled as compact bell-shaped trimers (15An H.-J.

In contrast, the EF-disulfide family ligands (APRIL, TWEAK, BAFF, and EDA) are more globular because of shorter CD and EF loops, and they bind to very small atypical TNFRSF members (13Chattopadhyay K.

The divergent family members are unique as they exhibit very low sequence similarity with other TNF ligands.

Based on sequence diversity, human 4-1BBL was previously categorized within the latter group. However, two recent crystal structures of h4-1BBL revealed that h4-1BBL forms a compact bell-shaped trimer characteristic of conventional TNF ligands (11Bitra A. Doukov T. Croft M. Zajonc D.M.

All conventional ligands bind to their cognate receptors in a similar manner, and they all contain a conserved hydrophobic residue that acts as a “hot spot” in their DE loop that is shown to be energetically important for receptor binding (13Chattopadhyay K. Lazar-Molnar E. Yan Q. Rubinstein R. Zhan C. Vigdorovich V. Ramagopal U.A. Bonanno J. Nathenson S.G. Almo S.C. Sequence, structure, function, immunity: structural genomics of costimulation.Immunol.

However, the crystal structure of OX40/OX40L revealed that the binding energy is distributed equally on both sides of the interaction interface, and there is no significant hydrophobic contact between the DE loop of the ligand and the receptor (18Compaan D.M.

Interestingly, although human 4-1BBL exhibits all the features of the conventional ligands, the hydrophobic residues in the DE loop are not conserved. Additionally, recent crystal structures showed that the DE loop residues are not contributing toward binding affinity, suggesting that h4-1BB, although forming a bell-shaped trimer, is still unique in its interaction with h4-1BBL (11Bitra A.

Although many TNF/TNFR complexes have been crystallized, until recently, very little was known about 4-1BB/4-1BBL interactions. Our recent characterization of the interaction between human 4-1BB and 4-1BBL led us to hypothesize a distinct mechanism of h4-1BB signaling, in which covalent receptor dimerization would favor the formation of a 2D-signaling network to initiate robust signaling (11Bitra A.

Added to this, our earlier biochemical studies suggested that recombinant m4-1BBL could form a covalent dimer rather than the conventional trimer (12Bitra A. Doukov T. Wang J. Picarda G. Benedict C.A. Croft M. Zajonc D.M. Crystal structure of murine 4-1BB and its interaction with 4-1BBL support a role for galectin-9 in 4-1BB signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29242193): 1317-1329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This supports a different mechanism of human and mouse 4-1BBL to both engage and cluster 4-1BB, using unique protein-binding sites and resulting in different oligomeric assemblies that would affect the signal strength. To elucidate the molecular features underlying the differential behavior of m4-1BB and m4-1BBL, we have determined the crystal structure of m4-1BBL itself as well as in complex with its receptor m4-1BB. Together, our findings identify structural details related to ligand/receptor interactions but also the assembly of the unique m4-1BBL. Mouse 4-1BBL (m4-1BBL) is a type II transmembrane protein composed of an N-terminal cytoplasmic region and a C-terminal ectodomain separated by a transmembrane domain. The ectodomain can be divided into a tail region and the THD (Fig. 1A). The THD is responsible for the interaction with its cognate receptor m4-1BB. Two N-linked glycosylation sites are present, one at the N-terminal end (Asn-161) and the other at the C-terminal end (Asn-293) of the THD (Fig. 1A). We crystallized the THD of m4-1BBL along with several additional C-terminal tail residues (amino acids 140–309) and determined the structure by molecular replacement using h4-1BBL (PDB code 6D3N) as a search model (Table 1). The asymmetric unit in the crystal contained four copies of m4-1BBL, and in the final model, the amino acids at the N- and C-terminal ends and some of the surface-exposed loops were disordered due to their high flexibility. In all four copies, we were able to build N-glycans at Asn-161; however, we have not observed obvious electron density for glycans at Asn-293. The global superposition of all copies of m4-1BBL in the asymmetric unit indicates high similarity in their structure with marginal variation in their loop regions (root mean square deviation value (RMSD) of 0.124 Å) and conserved orientation of the N-glycans.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsm4-1BB ligandm4-1BB/4-1BBL complex PDB code6MKB6MKZData collection statistics Space groupP31P 21 21 21 Cell dimension a, b, c, (Å)77.3, 77.3, 118.261.5, 88.4, 155.1 α, β, γ (°)90.00, 90.00, 120.0090.00, 90.00, 90.00 Resolution range (Å) (outer shell)50.0–2.50 (2.59–2.50)76.9–2.62 (2.69–2.62) No. of unique reflections27,191 (2727)25,447 (1263) Rmeas (%)8.1 (83.2)24.0 (101.2) Rpim (%)2.5 (25.6)6.7 (38.1) Multiplicity10.4 (10.4)13.7 (7.5) Average I/σ23 (2.0)5.6 (1.7) Completeness (%)99.7 (99.9)97.6 (71.0)Refinement statistics No. of atoms57064202 Protein51753926 Water286198 Glycerol/sodium/sulfate/N-glycans24578 Ramachandran plot (%) Favored95.994.4 Allowed4.05.1 Outliers0.20.6 RMSD Bonds (Å)0.0090.010 Angles (°)1.181.24 B factors (Å2) Protein56.360.5 Water58.161.4 Glycerol/sodium/Cl/sulfate/N-glycans64.653.7 R factor (%)18.820.4 Rfree (%)24.123.8 Open table in a new tab Each m4-1BBL monomer adopts a canonical β-sandwich jellyroll fold composed of two anti-parallel inner and outer β-sheets formed by AHCF strands and B′BGDE strands, respectively (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal A′ strand present in other human or mouse TNF ligands is substituted by the longer AB′ loop in m4-1BBL. The THD of m4-1BBL shares modest sequence identity (∼40%) with its human homologue, h4-1BBL, but they both display considerable topological similarity at their β-strand regions (with an RMSD of 0.8 Å on equivalent CA atoms) (Fig. 1C). The only pronounced differences between the monomeric m4-1BBL and h4-1BBL structures are present in the conformations of the side chains and the surface loops that connect the β-strands. The length of the THD of m4-1BBL is ∼55 Å, which is comparable with that found in canonical TNFs like RANKL, CD154, and others. In addition, m4-1BBL also contains extended C, D, E, and F strands and elongated loops connecting these strands. In summary, the protomers of both m4-1BBL and h4-1BBL are structurally very similar and also share structural details with members of the conventional TNF family. To date, all the characterized conventional human or mouse TNF ligands organize into a symmetrical trimeric bell–shape to form a functional biological unit. Recently, we and others reported the structure of h4-1BBL that also assembles as a trimeric bell-shape despite its low-sequence similarity with conventional members (11Bitra A. Doukov T. Croft M.

However, m4-1BBL self-assembled as a 2-fold symmetrical homodimer, in which both protomers are covalently connected by a disulfide bond (Fig. 2A). The dimeric interface is formed by inner sheet β-strands of both protomers that pack against each other with a total buried surface area of 1617 Å2. At the top of the dimer, the EF loop of both protomers are placed nearby, and as a consequence, their surface-exposed cysteine residues (Cys-246) interact to form an inter-molecular disulfide linkage between them. Unexpectedly, other than the disulfide bond between two protomers, the m4-1BBL dimer lacks any intersubunit contacts at the upper and middle half of the protomers. But, at the lower half of the dimer, the residues Tyr-199, Phe-201, Phe-300, Val-302, and Phe-148 from both protomers form a hydrophobic core to mediate strong stabilizing interactions (Fig. 2B). In addition, at the lower end, the N-terminal Pro-146 of one protomer interacts with the C-terminal Pro-304 of the second protomer via van der Waals contacts, thereby closing the tunnel-like opening that is running downward from the top of the dimer. Throughout the structure, we have not seen any potential hydrogen bonds at the monomer–monomer interface, whereas most of the TNF ligands possess around 10–15 hydrogen-bonding interactions promoting stabilization of the trimeric interface. Although the individual protomers of mouse and human 4-1BBL are largely comparable, superposition of dimeric m4-1BBL with the corresponding regions on the h4-1BBL trimer results in higher RMSD values due to the variation in the alignment of its individual protomers with respect to each other (Fig. S1A). In h4-1BBL, the trimer is arranged such that the E and F strand of all three protomers packed against the inner sheet of its adjacent protomer, and thus the hydrophobic and polar residues from inner β-strands A, C, E, F, and H mediate stabilization of the trimer (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1B). In addition, the surface loop connecting the strands E and F also contribute residues that mediate potential hydrogen bonding or salt bridge interactions in the trimeric interface (11Bitra A. Doukov T. Croft M. Zajonc D.M. Crystal structures of the human 4-1BB receptor bound to its ligand 4-1BBL reveal covalent receptor dimerization as a potential signaling amplifier.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29720398): 9958-996910.1074/jbc.RA118.003176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). However, because of the disparity in subunit orientation, only hydrophobic residues from A, C, and H strands form the dimeric interface in m4-1BBL (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1C). None of the E and F strand residues or the surface loops partake in mediating interactions between two subunits, and so the top and central portion of the dimer lacks intersubunit contacts. As a consequence, the contact surface area between the m4-1BBL protomers is considerably reduced with the interfacial organization formed by a total of ∼20 residues, although in the h4-1BBL, many more residues (∼40) are involved in trimer interactions. A structure-based sequence alignment of both mouse and human 4-1BB shows that most of the residues mediating trimerization in h4-1BBL are present in m4-1BBL (Fig. 2D). Also, at the lower half of the monomer–monomer interface, all of those residues involved in the hydrophobic core are substantially similar, and ∼80% of them are even conserved in both species (Fig. 2D). However, at the middle half of the dimer, m4-1BBL contains a hydrophilic residue (Ser-256) on the F strand, whereas h4-1BBL features a phenylalanine residue (Phe-199) at this position (Fig. 2D). The structure of trimeric h4-1BBL reveals that the aromatic side chain of Phe-199 from all three subunits protrudes toward the interior to form a hydrophobic triad (Fig. 2C). Structural alignment with other TNF ligands demonstrates that this hydrophobic core located on the “F” strand is conserved in hTRAIL, hTNF, and hTL1A (either a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue) but not in m4-1BBL, hRANKL, and hCD40L (Fig. 2E). In the absence of hydrophobic residues, the corresponding amino acid facilitates polar contacts between protomers. For instance, in hRANKL, the equivalent Asn-276 from all three protomers interact via hydrogen bonding to promote intersubunit contacts, whereas similar type of interactions are not observed in m4-1BBL (using Ser-256). These data suggest that although m4-1BBL contains most of the characteristic features required for packing into a bell-shaped trimer, the lack of stabilizing interactions from the E/F strands and the unique EF loop may interfere with trimerization and instead result in an atypical dimeric structure. Therefore, to explore the contribution of Cys-246 and Ser-256 in mediating the dimerization of m4-1BBL, we sequentially mutated the Cys-246 to serine and Ser-256 to phenylalanine. In addition, we also made a double mutant of m4-1BBL carrying both of these mutations. The SDS-PAGE analysis of all of these variants revealed that under nonreducing conditions, the C246S and C246S/S256F mutants of m4-1BBL migrate as a double band with equal intensity corresponding to the monomer size of ∼26 kDa, whereas the S256F mutant migrates similarly to the dimeric WT m4-1BBL of ∼56 kDa (Fig. 3A). As expected, removal of Cys-246 abrogates the covalent dimerization. However, the S256F variant with Cys-246 intact still forms a covalent dimer, suggesting that the S256F mutation is not sufficient to prevent the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bond. Because the m4-1BBL subunit has a calculated molecular mass of ∼20 kDa plus additional mass from N-glycans, treatment of the m4-1BBL monomer variants with PNGase F now results in m4-1BBL migrating at a single band of ∼20 kDa suggesting that the double band was due to differential glycosylation of both m4-1BBL protomers. Correspondingly, size-exclusion chromatography combined with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), using a standardized HPLC column, more accurately assigned a molecular mass of 45.3 kDa for WT m4-1BBL and, similarly, 45.8 kDa for the m4-1BBL S256F mutant. As the disulfide-linked m4-1BB ligand dimer is unique among TNF family members, we next determined its interaction with its cognate receptor m4-1BB using X-ray crystallography. We determined the crystal structure of the m4-1BB/4-"

Design Retrospective cohort study Methods Study population—A total 8,775 eyes having laser refractive laser procedures for myopia (in4,623 patients). Observation procedures–Using a prospective database of refractive procedures performed over the span of 13 years, variables such as gender, age, type of surgery, date of surgery, pre-operative corneal thickness and Spherical Equivalent (SEQ) were evaluated. Main outcome measures—Proportion of patients with Safety index higher than 0.85 and Efficacy index higher than 0.80. Results 91.9% and 86.0% of all evaluated eyes were above the safety and efficacy cut-off levels, respectively. Younger age was significantly correlated with safety and efficacy indices above the cut-off levels (p<0.001). Male gender was significantly correlated with efficacy above the cut-off level (p<0.001). Myopic eyes with lower SEQ were associated with both safety (p = 0.002) and efficacy (p<0.001) indices above the cut-offs. The surgical procedure was found to significantly affect the outcome only using univariate analysis: Safety was higher in Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK), while Efficacy was higher in Laser Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) (p<0.001, respectively) but no difference was found using multivariate analysis. Safety index above the cut-off level increased over the years (p<0.001). Conclusions Efficacy in refractive surgery for myopia is correlated with younger age, male gender and low myopia. Safety is correlated with younger age, low myopia and increases over the years. Multivariate analysis found no differences between PRK and LASIK regarding safety and efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2903917462,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are common pathogens that can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and ocular infections. They are divided into seven species containing 85 genotypes. Straightforward typing systems might help epidemiological investigations. As homologous recombination frequently shapes the evolution of HAdVs, information on a single gene is seldom sufficient to allow accurate and precise typing, and complete genome-based methods are recommended. Even so, complete genome analyses are not always easy to perform for practical reasons, and in such cases a multigene system can provide considerably more information about the strain under investigation than single-gene-based methods. Here we present a rapid, generic, multigene typing system for HAdVs based on three main deterministic regions of these viruses. Three PCR systems were used to amplify the genes encoding the DNA polymerase, the penton base hypervariable Arg-Gly-Asp-containing loop, and the hexon loop 1 (hypervariable region 1–6). Using this system, we typed 281 clinical isolates, detected members of six out of seven HAdV species (Human mastadenovirus A–F), and could also detect not only divergent strains of established types but also a new recombinant strain with a previously unpublished combination of adenovirus genomes. This strain was accepted by the Human Adenovirus Working Group as a novel genotype: HAdV-86. Seven strains that could not be typed with sufficient accuracy were also investigated using a PCR based on part of the fiber gene. By analysis of corresponding sequences of the 86 known HAdV genotypes, we determined that the proposed typing system should be able to distinguish all non-recombinant types, and with additional fiber information, all known HAdV genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2905231631,"Muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas are divided into various molecular subtypes with basal and luminal subtypes being the prominent ones. The basal muscle-invasive urothelial carcinomas are generally more aggressive at presentation and significantly enriched with squamous features. Our laboratory has developed an in-vitro model of urothelial cancer by transforming the immortalized cell line UROtsa with arsenite (As3+) and cadmium (Cd2+). In this study, we characterized the tumors formed by these transformed cell lines as more basal-like based on their gene expression patterns with increased expression of KRT1, KRT5, KRT6, KRT14, KRT16, KRT17 and CD44. In addition, histological examination of these tumor transplants showed squamous features enriched in basal muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas. The expression of these genes increased in the transformed cell lines as well as in the urospheres, which are putative cancer initiating cells/stem cells derived from the cell lines. There was also increased expression of these genes in the urospheres derived from the parent UROtsa cell line. Thus, our data shows that the As3+ and Cd2+-transformed cell lines and their derived tumor transplants have gene expression profiles similar to the basal subtype of muscle invasive bladder carcinomas with tumors having enriched squamous features. The increased expression of basal markers in the urospheres suggests that stem cells may be involved in the development of squamous differentiation seen in some of the muscle invasive bladder carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2903694985,"Rationale HSP90B1, also known as gp96, is a chaperone for multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and is necessary for TLR-mediated inflammatory responses in murine myeloid cells. The molecule is also expressed in T-cells though its specific role is unknown. We hypothesized that human HSP90B1 regulates monocyte and T-cell responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and that its variants are associated with susceptibility to TB disease. Methods We screened 17 haplotype-tagging SNPs in the HSP90B1 gene region for association with BCG-induced T-cell cytokine responses using both an ex-vivo whole blood assay (N = 295) and an intracellular cytokine staining assay (N = 180) on samples collected 10 weeks after birth. Using a case-control study design, we evaluated the same SNPs for association with TB disease in a South African pediatric cohort (N = 217 cases, 604 controls). A subset of these SNPs was evaluated for association with HSP90B1 expression in human monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and T-cells using RT-PCR. Lastly, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knock down HSP90B1 expression in a human monocyte cell line (U937). Knockdown and control cell lines were tested for TLR surface expression and control of Mtb replication. Results We identified three SNPs, rs10507172, rs10507173 and rs1920413, that were associated with BCG-induced IL-2 secretion (p = 0.017 for rs10507172 and p = 0.03 for rs10507173 and rs1920413, Mann-Whitney, dominant model). SNPs rs10507172 and rs10507173 were associated with TB disease in an unadjusted analysis (p = 0.036 and 0.025, respectively, dominant model) that strengthened with sensitivity analysis of the definite TB cases, which included only those patients with microbiologically confirmed Mtb (p = 0.007 and 0.012, respectively). Knockdowns of HSP90B1 in monocyte cell lines with CRISPR did not alter TLR2 surface expression nor influence Mtb replication relative to controls. Conclusion Among infants, an HSP90B1 gene-region variant is associated with BCG-induced IL-2 production and may be associated with protection from TB disease. HSP90B1 knockdown in human monocyte-like cell lines did not influence TLR2 surface localization nor Mtb replication. Together, these data suggest that HSP90B1 regulates T-cell, but not monocyte, responses to mycobacteria in humans."

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to ascertain exposure to selected metals from metal fumes in a series of typical workplaces of contemporary tractor production.Ninety-eight (median age 41 (interquartile range (IQR) 23) years, all men) workers from Minsk Tractor Plant were categorized into four groups, including assembly shop workers (group 1); thermal shop staff (group 2); steelmakers (group 3) and welders (group 4). Hair samples (0.25 g) of each worker were tested for Ca, Mg, P, Cu, Fe, Zn, Al, Mn, Cr, Ni, Pb and Cd using atomic emission spectrophotometry. We then tested between-group differences of log-transformed element concentrations using analysis of variance, followed by logistic regression to determine the odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) of high exposure for four selected groups.The median work duration in workers was 6 (IQR 15) years, more in group 1 (10 (IQR 23)). Eight out of 12 included elements yielded significant between-group differences, including Mg, P, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni and Cd. Steelmakers had higher Mn hair concentrations (F-ratio 10.41, p<0.001); whereas Fe (F-ratio 12.48, p<0.001), P (F-ratio 12.68, p<0.001), Zn (F-ratio 6.07, p<0.001) and Cr (F-ratio 20.54, p<0.001) were higher in welders. OR of high exposure to Mg in group 3 was 10.00 (95% CI 1.14-87.52), whereas the OR of high exposure to P in group 4 was 18.64 (95% CI 2.22-156.85) compared to group 1.In the modern full-cycle tractor production, welders may have higher exposure to Fe, P, Zn and Cr, as opposed to steelmakers with higher Mn hair concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2905039340,"The glycolipid transfer protein, GLTP, can be found in the cytoplasm, and it has a FFAT-like motif (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) that targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have previously shown that GLTP can bind to a transmembrane ER protein, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAP-A), which is involved in a wide range of ER functions. We have addressed the mechanisms that might regulate the association between GLTP and the VAP proteins by studying the capacity of GLTP to recognize different N-linked acyl chain species of glucosylceramide. We used surface plasmon resonance and a lipid transfer competition assay to show that GLTP prefers shorter N-linked fully saturated acyl chain glucosylceramides, such as C8, C12, and C16, whereas long C18, C20, and C24-glucosylceramides are all bound more weakly and transported more slowly than their shorter counterparts. Changes in the intrinsic GLTP tryptophan fluorescence blueshifts, also indicate a break-point between C16- and C18-glucosylceramide in the GLTP sensing ability. It has long been postulated that GLTP would be a sensor in the sphingolipid synthesis machinery, but how this mechanistically occurs has not been addressed before. It is unclear what proteins the GLTP VAP association would influence. Here we found that if GLTP has a bound GlcCer the association with VAP-A is weaker. We have also used a formula for identifying putative FFAT-domains, and we identified several potential VAP-interactors within the ceramide and sphingolipid synthesis pathways that could be candidates for regulation by GLTP."
https://openalex.org/W2905340064,"Sediments in streams that drain agricultural watersheds may be sinks that can adsorb P from the stream or sources that can release P to the stream. Sediment characteristics and environmental factors, including the oxidation-reduction (redox) potential of the water associated with the sediment, determine whether P will be adsorbed or released by the sediment. We investigated P adsorption and release by four sediments [three Holocene-age sediments (Camp Creek, Roberts Creek and Gunder) as well as Pre-Illinoian-age Till] that occur in Walnut Creek, a second-order stream in Jasper County, Iowa, that is representative of many small streams in the glaciated upper Midwest of the US. The effects of two redox potentials on phosphorus buffering capacity (PBC) and equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC) were evaluated in batch adsorption experiments. We also simulated aerobic and anerobic conditions over a 24-day period and measured solution-phase P concentrations in stirred systems where the sediments were isolated from the water by dialysis tubing. The batch experiment indicated that the EPCs of the three Holocene-age sediments were similar to one another and increased with decreasing redox potential. In the stirred flow reactors, more dissolved P was released from the Camp Creek and Roberts Creek sediments under anaerobic conditions than from the other sediments. This observation suggests that these two sediments, which are younger and higher in the stratigraphic sequence, are more likely to be P sources in suboxic settings. The P buffering capacity was greatest in the till. Where it is in contact with the stream water, the till is likely to serve as an adsorbing sink for P in the water column."
https://openalex.org/W2904814977,"Objective Overcrowding is common in most emergency departments (ED). Despite the use of validated triage systems, some patients are at risk of delayed medical evaluation. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a patient-flow physician coordinator (PFPC) on the proportion of patients offered medical evaluation within time limits imposed by the Swiss Emergency Triage Scale (SETS) and on patient flow within the emergency department of a teaching urban hospital. Methods In this before-after retrospective cohort study, we compared the proportions of patients who received their first medical contact within SETS-imposed time limits, mean waiting times before first medical consultation, mean length of stay, and number of patients who left without being seen by a physician, between two periods before and after introducing a PFPC. The PFPC was a senior physician charged with quickly assessing in the waiting area patients who could not immediately be seen and managing patient flow within the department. Results Before introducing the PFPC position, 33,605 patients were admitted, versus 36,288 after. Introducing a PFPC enabled the department to increase the proportion of patients seen within the SETS-imposed time limits from 60.1% to 69.0% (p <0.0001). Waiting times until first medical consultation were reduced on average by 27.7 minutes (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 25.9–29.5, p < .0001). No significant differences were observed as to length of stay or number of patients who left without being seen between the two study periods. Conclusions Introducing a physician dedicated to managing patient flow enabled waiting times until first medical consultation to be reduced, yet had no significant benefit for patient flow within the ED, nor did it reduce the number of patients who left without being seen."
https://openalex.org/W2904956887,"Intrauterine crowding (IUC) considerably influences postnatal traits in a polytocous species such as the pig. Previously, our group described how IUC affects locomotion during the piglet’s first days of life (until 96 h after birth). We noted a reduced motor performance in piglets with a low birth weight and low vitality (L piglets), compared to piglets with a normal birth weight and normal vitality (N piglets), indicating L piglets are unable to produce enough force. Our current study investigates whether this observed force deficit in L piglets is caused by a reduced force generating capacity in the muscles and/or a lower percentage of type II (fast-contracting) fibers. Volume and fiber length of the main extensor muscles of the hind limb were used to estimate the physiological cross-sectional area (PSCA) and hence calculate the maximal isometric force generating capacity (Fiso-max) of the hind limb. To check for developmental differences between the muscles of L and N piglets, Fiso-max was normalized to body weight (BW), thus yielding a dimensionless variable F’iso-max. To check for differences in muscle composition, m. vastus lateralis was stained immunohistochemically in order to determine the percentage of type II fibers through image analysis. Our results indicate that L piglets have a reduced absolute force generating capacity due to a lesser muscle mass, compared to N piglets. However, when normalized to BW L piglets actually show a larger force generating capacity, suggesting their muscles are more voluminous, given their body mass, than those of N piglets. However, no differences between L and N piglets were detected with regard to muscle composition of the m. vastus lateralis. Based on our data, we can say that neither normalized force generating capacity, nor muscle composition (of the m. vastus lateralis) can explain the observed force deficit in L piglets and as such the effect of IUC on locomotor performance."
https://openalex.org/W2904488532,"The size distribution of manufactured sand particles has a significant influence on the quality of concrete. To overcome the shortcomings of the traditional vibration-sieving method, a manufactured sand casting/dispersing system was developed, based on the characteristics of the sand particle contours (as determined by backlit image acquisition) and an extraction mechanism. Algorithms for eliminating particles from the image that had be repeatedly captured, as well as for identifying incomplete particles at the boundaries of the image, granular contour segmentation, and the determination of an equivalent particle size, are studied. The hardware and software for the image-based detection device were developed. A particle size repeatability experiment was carried out on the single-grade sands, grading the size fractions of the manufactured sand over a range of 0.6–4.75 mm. A method of particle-size correction is proposed to compensate for the difference in the results obtained by the image-based method and those obtained by the sieving method. The experimental results show that the maximum repeatability error of single-grade fractions is 3.46% and the grading size fraction is 0.51%. After the correction of the image method, the error between the grading size fractions obtained by the two methods was reduced from 7.22%, 6.10% and 5% to 1.47%, 1.65%, and 3.23%, respectively. The accuracy of the particle-size detection can thus satisfy real-world measuring requirements."

Both are categorized as category B priority pathogens because of the low infectious dose, capability for aerosol transmission, and resistance to antibiotics (3Rhodes K.A. Schweizer H.P.

By contrast, Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen that primarily infects immunocompromised patients (7Scoffone V.C. Chiarelli L.R. Trespidi G. Mentasti M. Riccardi G. Buroni S.

B. thailandensis is much less virulent despite conservation of many genes involved in virulence (10Haraga A. West T.E. Brittnacher M.J. Skerrett S.J. Miller S.I.

For example, NADPH oxidase generates superoxide radicals (O2̇̄), which give rise to H2O2. H2O2 may in turn oxidize ferrous iron to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH•) (11Fang F.C.

ROS can target bacterial DNA, protein, or membrane lipids and thus can attenuate bacterial survival and proliferation in the host environment (13Imlay J.A. The molecular mechanisms and physiological consequences of oxidative stress: lessons from a model bacterium.Nat. Rev.

Transition metals, such as Cu(II) and Zn(II), can also cause microbial poisoning when in excess (14Lemire J.A. Harrison J.J. Turner R.J.

In addition, Cu(II) can participate in the Fenton reaction and cause elevated intracellular ROS production. Bacterial responses to ROS by transcriptional regulators such as MarR family proteins have been described, including in Burkholderia species (15Gupta A. Fuentes S.M. Grove A. Redox-sensitive MarR homologue BifR from Burkholderia thailandensis regulates biofilm formation.Biochemistry. 2017; 56 (28406615): 2315-232710.1021/acs.biochem.7b00103Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 16Pande A.

The redox-active Cu(II) has also been implicated in modification of MarR proteins by inducing formation of disulfide linkages between separate dimers, but with distinct outcomes (15Gupta A.

B. thailandensis encodes 12 annotated MarR homologs, all of which are conserved in B. pseudomallei and B. mallei (19Gupta A. Pande A. Sabrin A. Thapa S.S. Gioe B.W. Grove A. MarR family transcription factors from Burkholderia species: hidden clues to control of virulence-associated genes.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2019; 83 (30487164)e00039-e0001810.1128/MMBR.00039-18Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One of these is encoded by BTH_I0021, which is upstream of a gene encoding an EmrB/QacA family transport protein. This genomic locus is conserved among pathogenic species such as B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, and B. cenocepacia (19Gupta A. Pande A. Sabrin A. Thapa S.S. Gioe B.W. Grove A. MarR family transcription factors from Burkholderia species: hidden clues to control of virulence-associated genes.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2019; 83 (30487164)e00039-e0001810.1128/MMBR.00039-18Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Based on the identified roles of this MarR family protein in oxidant sensing and control of a transporter, we have assigned the name OstR (oxidant-sensing transport regulator). We report here differential and OstR-dependent expression of BTH_I0022 encoding the EmrB family transporter under reducing and oxidizing conditions and that OstR employs a novel response to oxidants involving vicinal cysteines. Notably, disruption of BTH_I0022 confers sensitivity to trimethoprim, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with sulfamethoxazole to treat Burkholderia infections. Unexpectedly, disruption of BTH_I0022 also confers increased resistance to tetracycline, a resistance that correlates with up-regulation of an RND efflux pump. The gene encoding OstR is immediately upstream of BTH_I0022, which encodes an EmrB/QacA family drug resistance transporter (Fig. 1A). A model of OstR was predicted using SwissModel and 4AIK (Yersinia pseudotuberculosis RovA (20Quade N. Mendonca C. Herbst K. Heroven A.K. Ritter C. Heinz D.W. Dersch P. Structural basis for intrinsic thermosensing by the master virulence regulator RovA of Yersinia.J. Biol.

This model shows the expected homodimer, which consists of a dimerization region formed by N- and C-terminal α1, α5, and α6 helices from both subunits and a DNA-binding region that includes recognition helices α4/α4′ (arrow; Fig. 1B). In addition, each monomer contains N- and C-terminal extensions beyond the conserved core fold that is represented in the modeled structure, with the core fold spanning residues Ser28–Ala164 (Fig. 1B; terminal residues in gray space-filling representation). The electrostatic surface potential of the OstR core was calculated by Swiss PDB Viewer. Notably, one lobe of the dimeric protein is predicted to be highly positively charged (Fig. 1C). The other lobe features a more usual distribution of charges, being electropositive surrounding the recognition helix and the wing regions, a common feature that would promote interaction with the negatively charged cognate DNA. The unusual surface charge distribution within one protein lobe appears to derive from a constellation of five Arg and Lys residues, which is not balanced by equivalent negative charge (Fig. 1D); salt bridges between Glu75 and Arg71/Arg78 are predicted, whereas the side chain of Glu27′ is predicted to be >8 Å from the other positively charged side chains (Lys36′, Arg67, and Lys79). Another notable feature of the OstR sequence is the presence of three cysteine residues per monomer, two vicinal cysteines (Cys3 and Cys4) in the N-terminal extension that precedes the core MarR fold and Cys169 in the C-terminal extension (Fig. 1E). With six cysteines per dimer, regulation of OstR function by oxidation would be possible. To assess whether OstR participates in regulation of emrB, we obtained and verified B. thailandensis E264 mutant strains in which ostR or emrB genes were disrupted by the insertion of transposons at position 98 of ostR and position 89 of emrB open reading frames, respectively, to generate ΔostR and ΔemrB strains (Fig. 1A) (21Gallagher L.A. Ramage E. Patrapuvich R. Weiss E. Brittnacher M. Manoil C. Sequence-defined transposon mutant library of Burkholderia thailandensis.MBio. 2013; 4 (24194535)e00604-e0061310.1128/mBio.00604-13Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Relative transcript levels of emrB were measured in both WT and ΔostR strains. emrB was up-regulated 25.2 ± 0.7-fold in the ΔostR strain (Fig. 2A), suggesting that OstR is a repressor of emrB. Complementation of ΔostR was attempted using plasmid-encoded ostR. Because a gentamicin-resistant derivative of the broad host range vector pBBR1-MCS5 was used for this purpose, WT cells were transformed with empty pBBR1-MCS5 (generating strain WTe) to control for any effects of gentamicin on gene expression. However, restoration of WT levels of emrB expression was not achieved in ΔostR transformed with pBBR1-MCS5-ostR (ΔostRc) and grown with gentamicin, only an ∼20% reduction in expression compared with WTe. To address the possible reason, expression of ostR was determined in WTe grown with gentamicin and found to be significantly reduced (Fig. 2B). Consistent with a gentamicin-mediated reduction in ostR expression, emrB expression was ∼7-fold higher in WTe compared with WT cells (Fig. 2A). This suggests that gentamicin negatively regulates the expression of ostR, a consequence of which is increased emrB expression. Many MarRs are autoregulatory (1Deochand D.K. Grove A. MarR family transcription factors: dynamic variations on a common scaffold.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2017; 52 (28670937): 595-61310.1080/10409238.2017.1344612Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether any autoregulation of ostR by OstR occurs, we analyzed expression of the gene fragment that is upstream of the point of transposon insertion (position 98 of the ostR ORF). There was no significant difference in expression between WT and ΔostR, indicating that expression of ostR is not regulated by OstR (Fig. 2B). By contrast, analysis of ostR expression using primers, which amplify a fragment that is downstream of the transposon insertion, showed no expression in ΔostR consistent with transposon-mediated gene disruption (Fig. 2B, gel inset); combined with the ∼25-fold increase in emrB expression in ΔostR, this experiment also shows that emrB is expressed under the control of its own promoter. To determine the effect of oxidants on the expression of emrB, WT and ΔostR strains were grown to mid-log phase followed by incubation with a 2 mm concentration of the oxidant H2O2 or CuCl2 for 30 min. RNA was isolated, and cDNA was made using gene-specific primers for analysis of relative transcript levels by quantitative RT-PCR. In the presence of 2 mm H2O2, emrB expression was increased 3.5 ± 0.4-fold, whereas incubation with 2 mm CuCl2 resulted in significant reduction in emrB expression (0.4 ± 0.01-fold; Fig. 2C). To determine whether redox-inactive metals also regulate emrB expression, we assessed Zn2+-dependent transcriptional regulation of emrB. Gene expression analysis revealed an ∼2-fold increase in emrB expression in the presence of 2 mm ZnCl2. No significant change in emrB expression was observed in the ΔostR strain in the presence of oxidants or ZnCl2, suggesting that the observed changes in gene expression in WT cells depend on OstR (Fig. 2D). For clues to the substrate for EmrB, the WT, ΔostRX, and ΔemrBX strains (in which antibiotic resistance cassettes were removed from transposons) were serially diluted and spotted on LB-agar plates containing antibiotics. It was previously reported that expression of the corresponding B. cepacia EmrB protein (named BcrA) in E. coli resulted in resistance to tetracycline and nalidixic acid (22Wigfield S.M. Rigg G.P. Kavari M. Webb A.K. Matthews R.C. Burnie J.P. Identification of an immunodominant drug efflux pump in Burkholderia cepacia.J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2002; 49 (11909835): 619-62410.1093/jac/49.4.619Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nalidixic acid was seen to be toxic to WT cells and to ΔemrBX, whereas the ΔostRX strain was more resistant (Fig. 3B). A minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was estimated by growing the respective strains in liquid culture containing serially diluted antibiotics; this analysis indicated a similar MIC for WT and ΔemrBX cells, whereas the MIC for ΔostRX cells was higher (Table 1). The increased resistance exhibited by ΔostRX would be consistent with up-regulation of emrB and more efficient export of nalidixic acid.Table 1MIC in LB mediumB. thailandensis E264 derivativeConcentrationNalidixic acidTetracyclineGentamicinTrimethoprimμg/mlWT6422,00064ΔostRX256832,000>1,000ΔemrBX64416,00016 Open table in a new tab Resistance to tetracycline was likewise elevated in the ΔostRX strain, consistent with export through EmrB; however, resistance was also increased in the ΔemrBX strain (Fig. 3C and Table 1). Expression of two operons encoding RND efflux systems (BpeEF-OprC and AmrAB-OprA) was previously reported to be induced by the tetracycline derivative doxycycline (23Biot F.V. Lopez M.M. Poyot T. Neulat-Ripoll F. Lignon S. Caclard A. Thibault F.M. Peinnequin A. Pagès J.M. Valade E. Interplay between three RND efflux pumps in doxycycline-selected strains of Burkholderia thailandensis.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (24386333): e8406810.1371/journal.pone.0084068Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); a possible explanation for the increased resistance to tetracycline in the ΔemrBX strain is therefore that failure to export tetracycline through EmrB might lead to elevated intracellular concentrations and induction of one or both of these RND efflux systems. We therefore grew ΔemrBX and ΔostRX strains in the presence of different concentrations of tetracycline and measured expression of amrB and bpeF (Fig. 4). Expression of amrB was greater in ΔemrBX cells grown with at least 10 μg/ml tetracycline, whereas expression of bpeF was reduced. In contrast, expression of both amrB and bpeF was reduced in ΔostRX cells grown with tetracycline. This is consistent with the inference that the increased resistance to tetracycline characteristic of ΔemrBX cells is due to induction of the operon that encodes AmrAB-OprA. High concentrations of gentamicin were tolerated by WT cells, with a further increase in resistance in ΔostRX cells (Fig. 3D and Table 1). Because increased resistance was also observed in ΔemrBX cells, one possibility is that failure to export gentamicin by EmrB may result in induction of an alternate exporter, as seen for tetracycline. Notably, EmrB appears to be a primary efflux system for trimethoprim; at a concentration of the antibiotic where growth of WT and ΔostRX was largely unaffected, as estimated by plate assays, growth of ΔemrBX was severely compromised (Fig. 3E). Consistent with EmrB being important for trimethoprim efflux, the MIC for ΔemrBX cells was lower than the MIC for WT cells (Table 1). Because emrB expression was sensitive to redox state (Fig. 2C), the strains were exposed to either 5 mm H2O2 or CuCl2 and plated on LB-agar plates. Whereas the ΔemrBX strain exhibited similar sensitivity to either oxidant as WT cells, ΔostRX was more sensitive to H2O2 but less sensitive to CuCl2 (Fig. 3, F and G). This differential sensitivity is intriguing, and it parallels the opposite effects of either oxidant on emrB expression, suggesting that gene regulation by oxidized OstR depends on the identity of the oxidant. Exposure to ZnCl2, however, resulted in a phenotype similar to that observed on treatment with tetracycline and gentamicin (Fig. 3H). OstR was examined in vitro, focusing on responses to the inducers of differential emrB expression in vivo. The gene encoding OstR was cloned, and the protein was expressed in E. coli and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid–agarose column to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 5 (E and F), lanes 2). The calculated molecular mass of monomeric OstR is ∼21 kDa. Far-UV CD spectroscopy showed that the predicted secondary structure composition of OstR is about 37% α-helix, 25% β-sheet, and 38% random coils (Fig. 5A). By comparison, the structure of Deinococcus radiodurans HucR, which also has an N-terminal extension beyond the conventional MarR fold, reveals ∼55% α-helix, a helical content that is also reflected in its CD spectrum; the lower α-helical content for OstR may reflect that its unique N- and C-terminal extensions are not helical (24Bordelon T. Wilkinson S.P. Grove A. Newcomer M.E. The crystal structure of the transcriptional regulator HucR from Deinococcus radiodurans reveals a repressor preconfigured for DNA binding.J. Mol.

Biosyst. 2016; 12 (27282811): 2417-242610.1039/C6MB00304DCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary structure of OstR was predicted using the PSIPRED Protein Analysis Workbench (26Jones D.T. Cozzetto D. DISOPRED3: precise disordered region predictions with annotated protein-binding activity.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 (25391399): 857-86310.1093/bioinformatics/btu744Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar); disorder prediction using DISOPRED3 revealed that the extensions beyond the core MarR fold represent intrinsically disordered regions and that they likely participate in protein interaction, both with high confidence scores (Fig. 5C). A thermal stability assay in which SYPRO Orange was used as a fluorescent reporter of protein unfolding as a function of temperature showed that reduced OstR exhibited a one-step melting transition with a relatively low Tm = 34.1 ± 0.1 °C (Fig. 5B). Protein stability was found to increase in the presence of DNA (Tm = 39.3 ± 0.2 °C) and Zn2+ (Tm = 37.2 ± 0.1 °C) or upon oxidation (Tm ∼39 °C; Table S1). Incubation of OstR with bipyridyl prior to measurement of thermal stability did not affect the Tm, indicating that purified OstR had no metal ions already bound. To verify binding to metal ions, OstR was incubated with 2 mm ZnCl2 followed by treatment with 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR). The metallochromic indicator PAR chelates zinc ions released from the protein upon its denaturation, which results in an absorbance peak at ∼520 nm, whereas uncomplexed PAR has an absorbance maximum at 416 nm (27Kushwaha A.K. Deochand D.K. Grove A. A moonlighting function of Mycobacterium smegmatis Ku in zinc homeostasis?.Protein Sci. 2015; 24 (25450225): 253-26310.1002/pro.2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). As shown by the marked absorbance at 520 nm, OstR binds Zn2+ (Fig. 5D). Each OstR monomer harbors three cysteine residues, all within the N- and C-terminal extensions (Fig. 1E). Reduced OstR was therefore incubated with increasing concentration of H2O2 and CuCl2, and oxidation products were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. When oxidized with H2O2, OstR formed dimers and oligomeric species as well as intramolecular disulfide bonds, as indicated by a species with a faster migration than reduced monomeric protein. In addition, OstR formed three dimeric forms with distinct mobility, likely reflecting different disulfide-bonded species (Fig. 5E). OstR was also oxidized by CuCl2. Whereas the appearance of multiple dimeric species was more evident on H2O2-mediated oxidation, intramolecular disulfide bonds and oligomeric species were also seen upon oxidation with CuCl2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed to determine OstR binding upstream of emrB. Reduced OstR bound the 146-bp DNA spanning ostR and emrB forming multiple complexes (Fig. 6A). The apparent dissociation constant Kd was 6.7 ± 0.8 nm with Hill coefficient nH = 1.9 ± 0.3, indicating positive cooperativity of binding (Table S2 and Fig. 6C). At lower protein concentration, the faster-migrating complex C1 was visible, whereas the slower-migrating complex C3 remained predominant across a greater range of concentration. Nonspecific binding may occur at even higher protein concentration, leading to slower migration of the complexes. To address whether OstR bound specifically to the emrB promoter, increasing concentration of competitor DNA was added in the reaction with specific labeled DNA and a constant concentration of the protein. Specific unlabeled DNA competed efficiently for OstR binding (Fig. 6F, lanes 3–8). Nonspecific DNA did not compete as efficiently for OstR binding to its cognate DNA (Fig. 6F, lanes 10–15; note that the highest concentration of specific competitor DNA represents a 250-fold excess over specific labeled DNA, whereas the highest concentration of the 5,368-bp pET28b represents an almost 2,000-fold excess). OstR was oxidized with 2 mm H2O2, and DNA binding was visualized by EMSA (Fig. 6, B and D). The affinity of H2O2-"

We sought to gain a detailed understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic in Mexico, the country with the highest number of confirmed CHIKV cases in the Americas, and to characterise viral evolution at the population and intra-host level. Analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of 2,739 diagnosed cases in Mexico from December 2014 to December 2015 showed a rapid nationwide expansion of the epidemic with focalisation in the South West of the country. We sequenced the envelope glycoprotein 1 gene (E1) from 25 patients using the Illumina MiSeq platform and report synonymous and non-synonymous consensus mutations. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using 249 Asian lineage E1 sequences gave updated estimates of nucleotide substitution rates for E1 and time to most recent common ancestor of major lineages. The analysis indicates phylogenetically-related emergent Latin American clusters in South Western Mexico, Nicaragua and Honduras and transmission of American strains in the Pacific islands. Detailed analysis showed that intra-host changes in E1 mainly occurred in two variable regions (E1:189–220 and E1:349–358) in domains II and III, respectively, in residues involved in inter and intra-envelope spike interactions. At the population level, this study sheds light on the introduction and evolutionary dynamics of CHIKV in the Americas. At the intra-host level, this study identifies mutational hotspots of the E1 protein with implications for understanding the relationship between the CHIKV quasispecies, viral fitness and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2887489727,"Chronic livestock diseases cause large financial loss and affect animal health and welfare. Controlling these diseases mostly requires precise information on both individual animal and population dynamics to inform the farmer’s decisions, but even successful control programmes do by no means assure elimination. Mathematical models provide opportunities to test different control and elimination options rather than implementing them in real herds, but these models require robust parameter estimation and validation. Fitting these models to data is a difficult task due to heterogeneities in livestock processes. In this paper, we develop an infectious disease modeling framework for a livestock disease (paratuberculosis) that is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Infection with MAP leads to reduced milk production, pregnancy rates, and slaughter value and increased culling rates in cattle and causes significant economic losses to the dairy industry. These economic effects are particularly important motivations in the control and elimination of MAP. In this framework, an individual-based model (IBM) of a dairy herd was built and MAP infection dynamics was integrated. Once the model produced realistic dynamics of MAP infection, we implemented an evaluation method by fitting it to data from three dairy herds from the Northeast region of the US. The model fitting exercises used least-squares and parameter space searching methods to obtain the best-fitted values of selected parameters. The best set of parameters were used to model the effect of interventions. The results show that the presented model can complement real herd statistics where the intervention strategies suggest a reduction in MAP prevalence without elimination. Overall, this research not only provides a complete model for MAP infection dynamics in a dairy herd but also offers a method for estimating parameters by fitting IBM models."

To our knowledge, sulfonation as a therapeutic means of regulating transmitter activity has not been explored. Here, we describe the discovery of a SULT1A3 allosteric site that can be used to inhibit the enzyme. The structure of the new site is determined using spin-label-triangulation NMR. The site forms a cleft at the edge of a conserved ∼30-residue active-site cap that must open and close during the catalytic cycle. Allosteres anchor into the site via π-stacking interactions with two residues that sandwich the planar core of the allostere and inhibit the enzyme through cap-stabilizing interactions with substituents attached to the core. Changes in cap free energy were calculated ab initio as a function of core substituents and used to design and synthesize a series of inhibitors intended to progressively stabilize the cap and slow turnover. The inhibitors bound tightly (34 nm to 7.4 μm) and exhibited progressive inhibition. The cap-stabilizing effects of the inhibitors were experimentally determined and agreed remarkably well with the theoretical predictions. These studies establish a reliable heuristic for the design of SULT1A3 allosteric inhibitors and demonstrate that the free-energy changes of a small, dynamic loop that is critical for SULT substrate selection and turnover can be calculated accurately.

Allosteres anchor into the site via π-stacking interactions with two residues that sandwich the planar core of the allostere and inhibit the enzyme through cap-stabilizing interactions with substituents attached to the core. Changes in cap free energy were calculated ab initio as a function of core substituents and used to design and synthesize a series of inhibitors intended to progressively stabilize the cap and slow turnover. The inhibitors bound tightly (34 nm to 7.4 μm) and exhibited progressive inhibition. The cap-stabilizing effects of the inhibitors were experimentally determined and agreed remarkably well with the theoretical predictions. These studies establish a reliable heuristic for the design of SULT1A3 allosteric inhibitors and demonstrate that the free-energy changes of a small, dynamic loop that is critical for SULT substrate selection and turnover can be calculated accurately. It is estimated that 1 in 5 individuals worldwide will suffer from major depression, a depressive episode lasting at least 2 weeks (1Merikangas K.R. He J.P. Burstein M. Swanson S.A. Avenevoli S.

SULT1A3 harbors two allosteric sites through which it communicates with catecholamine biosynthetic pathway metabolites (18Cook I. Wang T. Leyh T.S. Tetrahydrobiopterin regulates monoamine neurotransmitter sulfonation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

While studying allosteres that bind these sites, we discovered an allostere that did not bind either site but inhibited with high affinity and isoform specificity. Here, we present the structure of that allostere bound to SULT1A3 and demonstrate that the allostere slows turnover by stabilizing the enzyme’s active-site cap, a conserved stretch of ∼30 residues that is intimately involved in SULT substrate selection and turnover. A computational method that predicts the effects of inhibitors on cap stabilization is developed and used to design inhibitors with varying degrees of stabilization. The inhibitors were synthesized. These are the first man-made, isoform-specific allosteric SULT inhibitors; they bound tightly, and their inhibition characteristics correlated remarkably well with the predicted values. Thus, the behavior of this small, catalytically important active-site cap is predictable and can be reliably incorporated into SULT1A3 inhibitor designs. SULTs harbor two physically distinct, noninteracting allosteric binding sites, the so-called catechin- and NSAID-binding sites (18Cook I. Wang T. Leyh T.S. Tetrahydrobiopterin regulates monoamine neurotransmitter sulfonation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Rev. 1955; 99: 559-56610.1103/PhysRev.99.559Crossref Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). The residues that line these sites differ in each SULT isoform, which begs the hypothesis that the sites evolved to enable isoforms to communicate with metabolites within their metabolic domains. This hypothesis was born out using the SULT1A3 isoform (18Cook I. Wang T. Leyh T.S. Tetrahydrobiopterin regulates monoamine neurotransmitter sulfonation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28630292): E5317-E532410.1073/pnas.1704500114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). While testing the initial rate inhibition characteristics of compounds designed to inhibit SULT1A3 by binding at its catechin site, a high-affinity, high-specificity inhibitor that did not appear to bind either of the known sites was discovered: compound 8 (CMP8). The potency and specificity of CMP8 are demonstrated in Fig. 1. The Ki of CMP8 for SULT1A3 is 34 nm, and CMP8 does not detectably inhibit the other major SULT isoforms found in the liver and brain at concentrations as high as 2 μm. CMP8 proved to be a partial inhibitor; at saturation, its binding reduces SULT1A3 turnover to 46% of that in the absence of inhibitor. Partial inhibitors alleviate inhibition when used competitively against total inhibitors that bind at the same site. CMP8 did not alleviate inhibition by epigallochatechin gallate or mefenamic acid, which are near-total inhibitors that bind the catechin and NSAID sites, respectively (19Wang T. Cook I. Leyh T.S. The NSAID allosteric site of human cytosolic sulfotransferases.J. Biol.

Given these favorable characteristics, we reasoned that the CMP8-binding site offered a new target that could be used to control 1A3 activity. Consequently, the solution structure of the CMP8-binding site was determined using spin-label-triangulation NMR. We have developed a method (spin-label-triangulation NMR) that allows the solution structure of a SULT ligand-binding pocket to be determined without the use of high-resolution NMR or crystallography and regardless of the molecular mass of the protein (18Cook I. Wang T. Leyh T.S. Tetrahydrobiopterin regulates monoamine neurotransmitter sulfonation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The method relies on the distance-dependent line broadening of peaks in the ligand’s solution one-dimensional NMR spectrum, which occurs when a ligand docks within ∼25 Å of a spin label covalently attached to the protein. Using three spatially well-separated spin labels, it is possible to triangulate the position of each ligand proton with respect to the protein surface. Spin label insertion sites are identified by first screening for line-broadening effects using a previously defined set of six sites that when spin-labeled coat the entire surface of the SULT dimer in a paramagnetic field of sufficient strength to broaden the NMR line width of the ligand regardless of where it binds (18Cook I. Wang T. Leyh T.S. Tetrahydrobiopterin regulates monoamine neurotransmitter sulfonation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Based on the findings of the screen, the spin label insertion sites can then be optimized as needed (20Cook I. Wang T. Girvin M. Leyh T.S. The structure of the catechin-binding site of human sulfotransferase 1A1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It is critical that the initial rate and inhibition parameters of the spin-labeled protein closely match those of the native protein (see Table S1). Having positioned ligand protons on the protein surface, the structure is then refined using NMR distance-constrained molecular dynamics docking. The distance dependence of the magnetic interactions between an unpaired electron and a nuclear spin are well-understood (21Solomon I. Relaxation processes in a system of two spins.Phys.

Given the effect of an unpaired electron spin on the line width of a ligand nucleus (R2), interspin distances can be calculated using the Solomon–Bloembergen equation (21Solomon I. Relaxation processes in a system of two spins.Phys. Rev. 1955; 99: 559-56610.1103/PhysRev.99.559Crossref Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). The 1H NMR line widths of protein-bound ligands are typically too broad to measure directly; however, the line-broadening effect of the electron can be obtained from a ligand’s solution spectrum if the frequency of ligand exchange between bulk solution and the protein is comparable to or greater than the difference in the resonant frequencies of the free and bound ligand (21Solomon I.

In such cases, solution line widths provide observed transverse relaxation rates, R2obs, that depend linearly on the fraction of bound ligand, FB, according to Equation 1, R2obs=(R2B−R2F)FB+R2F+R2ex(Eq. 1) where R2B and R2F are the transverse relaxation rates for bound and free protons, and R2ex is the chemical exchange contribution to the relaxation (21Solomon I.

To isolate the contribution of the electron, a diamagnetic control is created for each spin-labeled construct in which the paramagnetic (PROXYL) moiety of the spin label is replaced with a diamagnetic homologue (i.e. a cyclohexyl moiety). The contribution of the unpaired electron is obtained by subtracting the slopes of the paramagnetic and diamagnetic R2obs versus FB plots. A representative study characterizing the interaction of the C5 proton of CMP8 with the three spin-labeled constructs and diamagnetic control is presented in Fig. 2. The study was performed at saturating concentrations of CMP8 and PAP (see the legend to Fig. 2). The structure of CMP8 and its associated 1H NMR spectrum and peak assignments are shown in A. The line broadening of the C5 peak as a function of the percentage of bound CMP8 is shown in B. The construct used in the panel B study was spin-labeled at position 234. The line widths obtained from the spectra in B are plotted versus fraction-CMP8-bound in C (red dots). Similar studies were performed for the remaining two spin-labeled constructs (positions 198 and 116) and diamagnetic control (CTRL). As discussed above, the slope associated with the diamagnetic control was subtracted from those of the spin-labeled constructs to obtain the contribution of the spin label unpaired electron to the line broadening of the C5 proton, which was then used to calculate distances. Similar studies were performed on the C3, C3′, C4, C7, and C8 protons (see Fig. S1). The inter-spin distances from each proton to each of the three spin labels are compiled, along with the measurement errors, in Table S2. Each NMR-determined distance represents a vector between the time-averaged position of the spin label oxygen (calculated using GROMACS) and the given proton. Three such vectors are associated with each proton, each originates at the oxygen of a different spin label, and all three intersect at the proton. The errors associated with these three measurements constitute an error ellipsoid that centers on the proton and whose principal axis magnitudes are given by the S.E. values (±1 σ) of the NMR measurements. Docking is constrained by applying a 50-kJ mol−1 Å−1 restoring force (using distance_restraints, GROMACS (24Van Der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.J.

Fig. 3A provides an at-a-distance view of the complex and reveals that CMP8 binds in a crux of the protein where the cap helix connects to the base. Whereas the majority of residues that are in direct contact with CMP8 reside in the base, CMP8 directly contacts the cap at residue 235. The residues linearly aligned along the left-facing edge of the cap helix (Fig. 3A) either directly contact CMP8 or layer immediately over direct-contact residues; these interactions likely contribute to the CMP8-induced cap stabilization. Fig. 3B offers a more detailed view of the CMP8 interactions. The quininoid base of CMP8 is engaged in π-stacking interactions with planar residues (Phe-222 and His-226) on both of its faces. A hydrophobic interaction with Leu-67 anchors the CMP8 isobutyl moiety and is geometrically positioned such that CMP8 can hydrogen-bond with Gln-225. The structure was validated by testing its ability to predict the consequences of mutations on the initial rate parameters of the enzyme. The effects of binding-site mutations on the initial rate parameters of SULT1A3 are compiled in Table 1. Consistent with the structure, replacing the isobutyl moiety of Leu-67 with a proton (L67G) results in a significant (5.3-fold) increase in KiCMP8, and replacing the planar moieties at positions 226 and 222 with methyl groups (F222A/H226A) causes a significantly greater (60-fold) increase in KiCMP8. With one exception (N71H), the SULT1A3 residues that directly contact CMP8 are identical to those of its evolutionary precursor, SULT1A1 (9Dajani R. Hood A.M. Coughtrie M.W. A single amino acid, glu146, governs the substrate specificity of a human dopamine sulfotransferase, SULT1A3.Mol.

Reconstructing the SULT1A1 pocket in the SULT1A3 scaffold, by replacing Asn-71 with His caused KiCMP8 to increase beyond the detectible limit (i.e. no inhibition detected at 100 μm CMP8); thus, this single residue swap appears to determine the CMP8 specificity of the isoform.

https://openalex.org/W2904378708,"Although the natural haptic perception of textures includes active finger movements, it is unclear how closely perception and movements are linked. Here we investigated this question using oriented textures. Textures that are composed of periodically repeating grooves have a clear orientation defined by the grooves. The direction of finger movement relative to texture orientation determines the availability of temporal cues to the spatial period of the texture. These cues are absent during movements directed in line with texture orientation, whereas movements orthogonal to texture orientation maximize the temporal frequency of stimulation. This may optimize temporal cues. In Experiment 1 we tested whether texture perception gets more precise the more orthogonal the movement direction is to the texture. We systematically varied the movement direction within a 2IFC spatial period discrimination task. As expected, perception was more precise (lower discrimination thresholds) when finger movements were directed closer towards the texture orthogonal as compared to in parallel to the texture. In Experiment 2 we investigated whether people adjust movement directions to the texture orthogonal in free exploration. We recorded movement directions during free exploration of standard and comparison gratings. The standard gratings were clearly oriented. The comparison gratings did not have a clear orientation defined by grooves. Participants adjusted movement directions to the texture orthogonal only for clearly oriented textures (standards). The adjustment to texture orthogonal was present in the final movement but not in the first movement. This suggests that movement adjustment is based on sensory signals for texture orientation that were gathered over the course of exploration. In Experiment 3 we assessed whether the perception of texture orientation and movement adjustments are based on shared sensory signals. We determined perceptual thresholds for orientation discrimination and computed ‘movometric’ thresholds from the stroke-by-stroke adjustment of movement direction. Perception and movements were influenced by a common factor, the spatial period, suggesting that the same sensory signals for texture orientation contribute to both. We conclude that people optimize texture perception by adjusting their movements in directions that maximize temporal cue frequency. Adjustments are performed on the basis of sensory signals that are also used for perception."
https://openalex.org/W2904776203,"The use of nonthermal atmospheric plasma (NTP) in the biomedical field has recently expanded into cell death induction in cancer, infection prevention, inflammation treatment, and wound-healing enhancement. NTP has been demonstrated to enhance skin and muscle regeneration, but its effects on tissue regeneration, following deep tissue or muscle damage, remains underinvestigated. In this study, we determined the effects of NTP on muscle differentiation and the mechanisms of NTP's contribution to differentiation and regeneration. NTP treatment enhanced cell differentiation in primary normal human skeletal muscle myoblast cells and increased the relative expression of mRNA levels of MyoD which is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment, and myogenin, which are important transcription factors required for myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, NTP treatment induced increases in the levels of myosin heavy chain, a differentiated muscle-specific protein, and in myotube formation of myoblasts. We observed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation induced by NTP treatment affects the myogenic differentiation. In addition, STAT3 phosphorylation was also enhanced by NTP treatment in injured animal muscle. These findings indicate that NTP could enhance musculoskeletal differentiation by acting as an external stimulus for myoblast differentiation, suggesting its treatment potential in promoting regeneration of damaged muscle.—Park, J.

https://openalex.org/W2903607219,"Introduction Bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma) is a common malignancy characterized by high recurrence rates and intense clinical follow-up, indicating the necessity for more effective therapies. Current treatment regimens include intra-vesical administration of mitomycin C (MMC) for non-muscle invasive disease and systemic cisplatin for muscle-invasive or metastatic disease. Hyperthermia, heating a tumor to 40–44°C, enhances the efficacy of these chemotherapeutics by various modes of action, one of which is inhibition of DNA repair via homologous recombination. Here, we explore whether ex vivo assays on freshly obtained bladder tumors can be applied to predict the response towards hyperthermia. Material and methods The cytochrome C release assay (apoptosis) and the RAD51 focus formation assay (DNA repair) were first established in the bladder cancer cell lines RT112 and T24 as measurements for hyperthermia efficiency, and subsequently tested in freshly obtained bladder tumors (n = 59). Results Hyperthermia significantly increased the fraction of apoptotic cells after cisplatin or MMC treatment in both RT112 and T24 cells and in most of the bladder tumors (8/10). The RAD51 focus formation assay detected both morphological and numerical changes of RAD51 foci upon hyperthermia in the RT112 and T24 cell lines. In 64% of 37 analyzed primary bladder tumor samples, hyperthermia induced similar morphological changes in RAD51 foci. Conclusion The cytochrome C assay and the RAD51 focus formation assay are both feasible on freshly obtained bladder tumors, and could serve to predict the efficacy of hyperthermia together with cytotoxic agents, such as MMC or cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W2952813185,"Introduction Early diagnosis and prompt and effective treatment is one of the pillars of malaria control. Malaria case management guidelines recommend diagnostic testing before treatment using malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (mRDT) or microscopy and this was adopted in Nigeria in 2010. However, despite the deployment of mRDT, the use of mRDTs by health workers varies by settings. This study set out to assess factors influencing utilisation of mRDT among healthcare workers in Zamfara State, Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among 306 healthcare workers selected using multistage sampling from six Local Government Areas between January and February 2017. Mixed method was used for data collection. A pre-tested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on knowledge, use of mRDT and factors influencing utilization. An observational checklist was used to assess the availability of mRDT in the six months prior to this study. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as means and proportions. Association between mRDT use and independent variables was tested using Chi square while multiple regression was used to determine predictors of use at 5% level of significance. Results Mean age of respondents was 36.0 ± 9.4years. Overall, 198 (64.7%) of health workers had good knowledge of mRDT; mRDT was available in 33 (61.1%) facilities. Routine use of mRDT was reported by 253 (82.7%) healthcare workers. This comprised 89 (35.2%) laboratory scientists/technicians, 89 (35.2%) community health extension workers/community health officers; 59 (23.3%) nurses and 16 (6.3%) doctors. Health workers’ good knowledge of mRDT, trust in mRDT results, having received prior training on mRDT, and non-payment for mRDT were predictors of mRDT utilisation. Conclusion This study demonstrated that healthcare worker utilisation of mRDT was associated with health worker and health system-related factors that are potentially modifiable. There is need to sustain training of healthcare workers on benefits of using mRDT and provision of free mRDT in health facilities."

Of these 25 were untreated and completed their puberty.In the whole cohort the inhibin B concentration displayed significant positive correlations with the age at the onset of puberty and at initial evaluation; bone age; breast Tanner stage; serum basal estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and AMH concentrations, LH peak and LH/FSH peak ratio. The AMH concentration displayed a significant positive correlation with serum estradiol and a negative correlation with basal FSH concentration. The leptin concentration displayed significant positive correlations with the age at initial evaluation, bone age, and body mass index and a negative correlation with the FSH peak.In 25 untreated girls, the inhibin B concentration was negatively correlated with the age at first menstruation (r = -0.61, p = 0.001) and the time between the onset of puberty and first menstruation (r = -0.59, p = 0.002). Inhibin B concentrations <30 pg/mL were associated with a time between the onset of puberty and first menstruation ≥3 years in 14/15 patients with a sensitivity of 0.67 and a specificity of 0.75. The age at first menstruation was estimated using a formula: min (11.15-0.510 LH/FSH peak ratio, 11.57-0.025 inhibin B)available at: http://www.kamick.org/lemaire/med/girls-cpp18.html.We established formulas based on the serum inhibin B concentrations and LH/FSH peak ratio at the initial evaluation, alone or in combination, to predict the age at first menstruation in girls with CPP.

Given differences between conservatives and liberals in threat sensitivity and dangerous-world beliefs, correlations between political orientation and negatively-biased credulity may thus reflect endogenous mindsets. Alternatively, such results may owe to the political hierarchy at the time of previous research, as the tendency to see dark forces at work is thought to be greater among those who are out of political power. Adjudicating between these accounts can inform how societies respond to the challenge of alarmist disinformation campaigns. We exploit the consequences of the 2016 U.S. elections to test these competing explanations of differences in negatively-biased credulity and conspiracism as a function of political orientation. Two studies of Americans reveal continued positive associations between conservatism, negatively-biased credulity, and conspiracism despite changes to the power structure in conservatives’ favor."

We report the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging findings obtained for the C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers. Of the 135 cases screened, 3/82 (3.7%) of all FTD cases and 1/37 (2.7%) of all clinical AD cases had a C9orf72 repeat expansion. In this cohort, the C9orf72 pathological expansion was found in clinical diagnoses bridging the FTD, parkinsonism, ALS and AD spectrum. Interestingly, we showed early writing errors without aphasia in two subjects with C9orf72 expansions.This study represents the first genetic screening for C9orf72 repeat expansions in a Bulgarian dementia cohort. The C9orf72 repeat expansion does not appear to be a common cause of FTD and related disorders. This report confirms the notion that C9orf72 repeat expansions underlie a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative phenotypes. Relatively isolated agraphia in two cases with C9orf72 repeat expansions is a strong motivation to provide detailed and sophisticated oral and written language assessments that can be used to more precisely characterize early cognitive deficits in these heterogeneous conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2905266882,"Understanding the drivers of large-scale vegetation change is critical to managing landscapes and key to predicting how projected climate and land use changes will affect regional vegetation patterns. This study aimed to improve our understanding of the role, magnitude, and spatial distribution of the key environmental and socioeconomic factors driving vegetation change in a southern African savanna. This research was conducted across the Kwando, Okavango and Zambezi catchments of southern Africa (Angola, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia) and explored vegetation cover change across the region from 2001-2010. A novel coupled analysis was applied to model the dynamic biophysical factors then to determine the discrete / social drivers of spatial heterogeneity on vegetation. Previous research applied Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA), a multivariate times series dimension reduction technique, to ten years of monthly remotely sensed vegetation data (MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), and a suite of time-series (monthly) environmental covariates: precipitation, mean, minimum and maximum air temperature, soil moisture, relative humidity, fire and potential evapotranspiration. This initial research was performed at a regional scale to develop meso-scale models explaining mean regional NDVI patterns. The regional DFA predictions were compared to the fine-scale MODIS time series using Kendall's Tau and Sen's Slope to identify pixels where the DFA model we had developed, under or over predicted NDVI. Once identified, a Random Forest (RF) analysis using a series of static social and physical variables was applied to explain these remaining areas of under- and over- prediction to fully explore the drivers of heterogeneity in this savanna system. The RF analysis revealed the importance of protected areas, elevation, soil type, locations of higher population, roads, and settlements, in explaining fine scale differences in vegetation biomass. While the previously applied DFA generated a model of environmental variables driving NDVI, the RF work developed here highlighted human influences dominating that signal. The combined DFRFA model approach explains almost 90% of the variance in NDVI across this landscape from 2001-2010. Our methodology presents a unique coupling of dynamic and static factor analyses, yielding novel insights into savanna heterogeneity, and providing a tool of great potential for researchers and managers alike."

Observational healthcare databases such as patient diary databases provide a rich resource for patient-level predictive modeling. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical vector autoregressive (VAR) model to predict medical and psychological conditions using multivariate time series data. Compared to the existing patient-specific predictive VAR models, our model demonstrated higher accuracy in predicting future observations in terms of both point and interval estimates due to the pooling effect of the hierarchical model specification. In addition, by adopting an elastic-net prior, our model offers greater interpretability about the associations between variables of interest on both the population level and the patient level, as well as between-patient heterogeneity.

https://openalex.org/W2950158909,"Metabolic networks comprise thousands of enzymatic reactions functioning in a controlled manner and have been shaped by natural selection. Thanks to the genome data, the footprints of adaptive (positive) selection are detectable, and the strength of purifying selection can be measured. This has made possible to know where, in the metabolic network, adaptive selection has acted and where purifying selection is more or less strong and efficient. We have carried out a comprehensive molecular evolutionary study of all the genes involved in the human metabolism. We investigated the type and strength of the selective pressures that acted on the enzyme-coding genes belonging to metabolic pathways during the divergence of primates and rodents. Then, we related those selective pressures to the functional and topological characteristics of the pathways. We have used DNA sequences of all enzymes (956) of the metabolic pathways comprised in the HumanCyc database, using genome data for humans and five other mammalian species. We have found that the evolution of metabolic genes is primarily constrained by the layer of the metabolism in which the genes participate: while genes encoding enzymes of the inner core of metabolism are much conserved, those encoding enzymes participating in the outer layer, mediating the interaction with the environment, are evolutionarily less constrained and more plastic, having experienced faster functional evolution. Genes that have been targeted by adaptive selection are endowed by higher out-degree centralities than non-adaptive genes, while genes with high in-degree centralities are under stronger purifying selection. When the position along the pathway is considered, a funnel-like distribution of the strength of the purifying selection is found. Genes at bottom positions are highly preserved by purifying selection, whereas genes at top positions, catalyzing the first steps, are open to evolutionary changes. These results show how functional and topological characteristics of metabolic pathways contribute to shape the patterns of evolutionary pressures driven by natural selection and how pathway network structure matters in the evolutionary process that shapes the evolution of the system."
https://openalex.org/W2905561301,"The timing was perfect. A few weeks after the experimental protocol that had served me for years inexplicably stopped working, my grad school adviser approached me about writing a review paper detailing the history of our field. I was feeling hopeless about my lab work. I had seemingly tried everything to fix the broken tissue culture system, but nothing worked, crippling not only my productivity, but also my confidence. Shifting my focus to literature review and writing offered a welcome respite. And although I didn't expect it, this historical venture ended up teaching me how science proceeds across generations—and it provided the key to getting my research back on track.

> “Each generation is assisted by the knowledge of the scientists who came before.” 

While diving into the literature, I stumbled upon a string of reports from the 1910s describing experiments that were shockingly similar to the protocol I had been struggling with. The more I read, the more I questioned whether anything I was doing was actually novel. They led me to another set of intriguing papers, including one from 1934 describing a tissue culture method so complex that it seemed impossible.

Maybe there was unrealized value in this long-forgotten system, I thought. I set off to replicate the work.

After a couple of tries, I succeeded, which provided a much-needed confidence boost. I was amazed that such an advanced system had been invented more than 80 years ago. I couldn't wait to tell my adviser that I had replicated it.

To my surprise, he wasn't as enthusiastic as I was. He asked a simple question: What's the utility? I didn't have an answer. This method was much more difficult than my current, albeit broken, protocol. So why should we care about it? Why not instead pour my time and energy into fixing my modern protocol?

I was determined to come up with some hidden utility for the rediscovered system. It was too interesting, too radical compared with what I had been doing to not be useful. But I couldn't think of anything. My surge of inspiration gave way to gloom. I was stuck with my broken method.

Returning to my adviser's office the next day, I was ready to admit that he was right and that replicating the historical method had been a waste of time. But he asked another simple question: Had it taught me anything? The answer was yes. On a technical level, it reminded me of the importance of paying attention to details, even minute and seemingly insignificant ones, which were critical for reproducing such an intricate method. Just as important, my excitement in trying a challenging, complex method got me out of my research slump. Perhaps that was the true utility.

With renewed vigor and focus on the details, I finally got my protocol working again, after nearly 5 months of troubleshooting. The problem turned out to be infuriatingly simple: a bad component in the tissue culture media. As fate would have it, I got my protocol working just as our review paper was accepted for publication.

My adviser often uses the phrase “spirals of science” to describe how science progresses. The idea—which he inherited from his postdoc adviser—is that researchers sometimes retrace paths conceptually similar to those explored by previous generations. But each generation is assisted by the knowledge of the scientists who came before, which allows the spiral to progress upward.

This notion hadn't fully resonated with me when he mentioned it after we found the tissue culture papers from the 1910s. But after troubleshooting my protocol while diving into the history of my field, I saw exactly what he meant. And I took confidence from the thought that, no matter how slowly, I was progressing up the spiral.
