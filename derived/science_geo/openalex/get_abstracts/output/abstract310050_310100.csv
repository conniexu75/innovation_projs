There have been more deadly epidemics, but they have been more circumscribed; there have been epidemics almost as widespread, but they have been less deadly. Floods, famines, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have all written their stories in terms of human destruction almost too terrible for comprehension, yet never before has there been a catastrophe at once so sudden, so devastating and so universal. The astonishing thing about the pandemic was the complete mystery which surrounded it. The pandemic calls attention not only to the fact that there is an interchange of mouth germs wherever people meet, but it illustrates how frequently respiratory infections may occur to which little or no attention is given. The steps which should be taken to suppress the disease if it breaks out afresh are such as seem best for the maintenance of general health and protection from respiratory infections as a class."

The collision evidently took place during the flight of an inhomogeneous swarm of moldavites, still plastic but already displaying almost definite aerodynamic shapes. It is the first time such moldavites have been encountered, and the authors propose to designate them as double moldavites."

(1971) that the low albedos and reddish spectra observed in some lunar fines are caused by a low density amorphous substance which coats the fines is disputed. It is shown that these coatings have only a marginal effect on lunar reflectivity.
