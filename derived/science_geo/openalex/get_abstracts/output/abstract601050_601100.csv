https://openalex.org/W2772063315,"The differentiation of human memory CD8 T cells is not well understood. Here we address this issue using the live yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine, which induces long-term immunity in humans. We used in vivo deuterium labelling to mark CD8 T cells that proliferated in response to the virus and then assessed cellular turnover and longevity by quantifying deuterium dilution kinetics in YFV-specific CD8 T cells using mass spectrometry. This longitudinal analysis showed that the memory pool originates from CD8 T cells that divided extensively during the first two weeks after infection and is maintained by quiescent cells that divide less than once every year (doubling time of over 450 days). Although these long-lived YFV-specific memory CD8 T cells did not express effector molecules, their epigenetic landscape resembled that of effector CD8 T cells. This open chromatin profile at effector genes was maintained in memory CD8 T cells isolated even a decade after vaccination, indicating that these cells retain an epigenetic fingerprint of their effector history and remain poised to respond rapidly upon re-exposure to the pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2774214122,"Memory CD8 T cells that circulate in the blood and are present in lymphoid organs are an essential component of long-lived T cell immunity. These memory CD8 T cells remain poised to rapidly elaborate effector functions upon re-exposure to pathogens, but also have many properties in common with naive cells, including pluripotency and the ability to migrate to the lymph nodes and spleen. Thus, memory cells embody features of both naive and effector cells, fuelling a long-standing debate centred on whether memory T cells develop from effector cells or directly from naive cells. Here we show that long-lived memory CD8 T cells are derived from a subset of effector T cells through a process of dedifferentiation. To assess the developmental origin of memory CD8 T cells, we investigated changes in DNA methylation programming at naive and effector cell-associated genes in virus-specific CD8 T cells during acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in mice. Methylation profiling of terminal effector versus memory-precursor CD8 T cell subsets showed that, rather than retaining a naive epigenetic state, the subset of cells that gives rise to memory cells acquired de novo DNA methylation programs at naive-associated genes and became demethylated at the loci of classically defined effector molecules. Conditional deletion of the de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3a at an early stage of effector differentiation resulted in reduced methylation and faster re-expression of naive-associated genes, thereby accelerating the development of memory cells. Longitudinal phenotypic and epigenetic characterization of the memory-precursor effector subset of virus-specific CD8 T cells transferred into antigen-free mice revealed that differentiation to memory cells was coupled to erasure of de novo methylation programs and re-expression of naive-associated genes. Thus, epigenetic repression of naive-associated genes in effector CD8 T cells can be reversed in cells that develop into long-lived memory CD8 T cells while key effector genes remain demethylated, demonstrating that memory T cells arise from a subset of fate-permissive effector T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2773300145,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, energy levels, and growth factors. It contains the atypical kinase mTOR and the RAPTOR subunit that binds to the Tor signalling sequence (TOS) motif of substrates and regulators. mTORC1 is activated by the small GTPase RHEB (Ras homologue enriched in brain) and inhibited by PRAS40. Here we present the 3.0 ångström cryo-electron microscopy structure of mTORC1 and the 3.4 ångström structure of activated RHEB-mTORC1. RHEB binds to mTOR distally from the kinase active site, yet causes a global conformational change that allosterically realigns active-site residues, accelerating catalysis. Cancer-associated hyperactivating mutations map to structural elements that maintain the inactive state, and we provide biochemical evidence that they mimic RHEB relieving auto-inhibition. We also present crystal structures of RAPTOR-TOS motif complexes that define the determinants of TOS recognition, of an mTOR FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain-substrate complex that establishes a second substrate-recruitment mechanism, and of a truncated mTOR-PRAS40 complex that reveals PRAS40 inhibits both substrate-recruitment sites. These findings help explain how mTORC1 selects its substrates, how its kinase activity is controlled, and how it is activated by cancer-associated mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2774013165,"Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) encoded by TMEM16A control neuronal signalling, smooth muscle contraction, airway and exocrine gland secretion, and rhythmic movements of the gastrointestinal system. To understand how CaCCs mediate and control anion permeation to fulfil these physiological functions, knowledge of the mammalian TMEM16A structure and identification of its pore-lining residues are essential. TMEM16A forms a dimer with two pores. Previous CaCC structural analyses have relied on homology modelling of a homologue (nhTMEM16) from the fungus Nectria haematococca that functions primarily as a lipid scramblase, as well as subnanometre-resolution electron cryo-microscopy. Here we present de novo atomic structures of the transmembrane domains of mouse TMEM16A in nanodiscs and in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol as determined by single-particle electron cryo-microscopy. These structures reveal the ion permeation pore and represent different functional states. The structure in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol has one Ca2+ ion resolved within each monomer with a constricted pore; this is likely to correspond to a closed state, because a CaCC with a single Ca2+ occupancy requires membrane depolarization in order to open (C.J.P. et al., manuscript submitted). The structure in nanodiscs has two Ca2+ ions per monomer and its pore is in a closed conformation; this probably reflects channel rundown, which is the gradual loss of channel activity that follows prolonged CaCC activation in 1 mM Ca2+. Our mutagenesis and electrophysiological studies, prompted by analyses of the structures, identified ten residues distributed along the pore that interact with permeant anions and affect anion selectivity, as well as seven pore-lining residues that cluster near pore constrictions and regulate channel gating. Together, these results clarify the basis of CaCC anion conduction."
https://openalex.org/W2772677192,"Cryo-electron microscopy mapping of the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A combined with functional experiments reveals that calcium ions interact directly with the pore to activate the channel. The diverse TMEM16 membrane protein family contains Ca(II)-activated chloride channels, lipid scramblases and cation channels. TMEM16A mediates chloride-ion permeation, which controls neuronal signalling, muscle contraction and numerous other physiological functions. In this issue of Nature, two groups have solved the structure of TMEM16A by using cryo-electron microscopy, providing insights into the function of this channel. Unlike other ligand-gated ion channels, the Ca(II) ion interacts with the pore directly, where a glycine residue acts as a flexible hinge to adjust calcium sensitivity. Raimund Dutzler and colleagues report the structure of the protein in both Ca(II)-free and Ca(II)-bound states, which shows how calcium binding facilitates the structural rearrangements involved in channel activation. In the second Letter, Lily Jan and colleagues present two functional states of TMEM16A in the glycolipid LMNG and in nanodiscs, with one and two Ca(II) ions bound, respectively. The closed conformation observed in nanodiscs is proposed to show channel rundown after prolonged Ca(II) activation. The calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A is a ligand-gated anion channel that opens in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration1,2,3. The protein is broadly expressed4 and contributes to diverse physiological processes, including transepithelial chloride transport and the control of electrical signalling in smooth muscles and certain neurons5,6,7. As a member of the TMEM16 (or anoctamin) family of membrane proteins, TMEM16A is closely related to paralogues that function as scramblases, which facilitate the bidirectional movement of lipids across membranes8,9,10,11. The unusual functional diversity of the TMEM16 family and the relationship between two seemingly incompatible transport mechanisms has been the focus of recent investigations. Previous breakthroughs were obtained from the X-ray structure of the lipid scramblase of the fungus Nectria haematococca (nhTMEM16)12,13, and from the cryo-electron microscopy structure of mouse TMEM16A at 6.6 Å (ref. 14). Although the latter structure disclosed the architectural differences that distinguish ion channels from lipid scramblases, its low resolution did not permit a detailed molecular description of the protein or provide any insight into its activation by Ca2+. Here we describe the structures of mouse TMEM16A at high resolution in the presence and absence of Ca2+. These structures reveal the differences between ligand-bound and ligand-free states of a calcium-activated chloride channel, and when combined with functional experiments suggest a mechanism for gating. During activation, the binding of Ca2+ to a site located within the transmembrane domain, in the vicinity of the pore, alters the electrostatic properties of the ion conduction path and triggers a conformational rearrangement of an α-helix that comes into physical contact with the bound ligand, and thereby directly couples ligand binding and pore opening. Our study describes a process that is unique among channel proteins, but one that is presumably general for both functional branches of the TMEM16 family."
https://openalex.org/W2772342852,"The challenges of evolution in a complex biochemical environment, coupling genotype to phenotype and protecting the genetic material, are solved elegantly in biological systems by the encapsulation of nucleic acids. In the simplest examples, viruses use capsids to surround their genomes. Although these naturally occurring systems have been modified to change their tropism and to display proteins or peptides, billions of years of evolution have favoured efficiency at the expense of modularity, making viral capsids difficult to engineer. Synthetic systems composed of non-viral proteins could provide a 'blank slate' to evolve desired properties for drug delivery and other biomedical applications, while avoiding the safety risks and engineering challenges associated with viruses. Here we create synthetic nucleocapsids, which are computationally designed icosahedral protein assemblies with positively charged inner surfaces that can package their own full-length mRNA genomes. We explore the ability of these nucleocapsids to evolve virus-like properties by generating diversified populations using Escherichia coli as an expression host. Several generations of evolution resulted in markedly improved genome packaging (more than 133-fold), stability in blood (from less than 3.7% to 71% of packaged RNA protected after 6 hours of treatment), and in vivo circulation time (from less than 5 minutes to approximately 4.5 hours). The resulting synthetic nucleocapsids package one full-length RNA genome for every 11 icosahedral assemblies, similar to the best recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors. Our results show that there are simple evolutionary paths through which protein assemblies can acquire virus-like genome packaging and protection. Considerable effort has been directed at 'top-down' modification of viruses to be safe and effective for drug delivery and vaccine applications; the ability to design synthetic nanomaterials computationally and to optimize them through evolution now enables a complementary 'bottom-up' approach with considerable advantages in programmability and control."
https://openalex.org/W2774307240,"It has been hypothesized that a condensed nervous system with a medial ventral nerve cord is an ancestral character of Bilateria. The presence of similar dorsoventral molecular patterns along the nerve cords of vertebrates, flies, and an annelid has been interpreted as support for this scenario. Whether these similarities are generally found across the diversity of bilaterian neuroanatomies is unclear, and thus the evolutionary history of the nervous system is still contentious. Here we study representatives of Xenacoelomorpha, Rotifera, Nemertea, Brachiopoda, and Annelida to assess the conservation of the dorsoventral nerve cord patterning. None of the studied species show a conserved dorsoventral molecular regionalization of their nerve cords, not even the annelid Owenia fusiformis, whose trunk neuroanatomy parallels that of vertebrates and flies. Our findings restrict the use of molecular patterns to explain nervous system evolution, and suggest that the similarities in dorsoventral patterning and trunk neuroanatomies evolved independently in Bilateria."
https://openalex.org/W2771149562,"The composition of the diet (what we eat) has been widely related to the microbiota profile. However, whether the timing of food consumption (when we eat) influences microbiota in humans is unknown. A randomized, crossover study was performed in 10 healthy normal-weight young women to test the effect of the timing of food intake on the human microbiota in the saliva and fecal samples. More specifically, to determine whether eating late alters daily rhythms of human salivary microbiota, we interrogated salivary microbiota in samples obtained at 4 specific time points over 24 h, to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between food timing and metabolic alterations in humans. Results revealed significant diurnal rhythms in salivary diversity and bacterial relative abundance (i.e., TM7 and Fusobacteria) across both early and late eating conditions. More importantly, meal timing affected diurnal rhythms in diversity of salivary microbiota toward an inverted rhythm between the eating conditions, and eating late increased the number of putative proinflammatory taxa, showing a diurnal rhythm in the saliva. In a randomized, crossover study, we showed for the first time the impact of the timing of food intake on human salivary microbiota. Eating the main meal late inverts the daily rhythm of salivary microbiota diversity which may have a deleterious effect on the metabolism of the host.— Collado, M. C., Engen, P.

https://openalex.org/W2771953154,"Vesicular carriers transport proteins and lipids from one organelle to another, recognizing specific identifiers for the donor and acceptor membranes. Two important identifiers are phosphoinositides and GTP-bound GTPases, which provide well-defined but mutable labels. Phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives are present on the cytosolic faces of most cellular membranes. Reversible phosphorylation of its headgroup produces seven distinct phosphoinositides. In endocytic traffic, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate marks the plasma membrane, and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate mark distinct endosomal compartments. It is unknown what sequence of changes in lipid content confers on the vesicles their distinct identity at each intermediate step. Here we describe 'coincidence-detecting' sensors that selectively report the phosphoinositide composition of clathrin-associated structures, and the use of these sensors to follow the dynamics of phosphoinositide conversion during endocytosis. The membrane of an assembling coated pit, in equilibrium with the surrounding plasma membrane, contains phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate and a smaller amount of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Closure of the vesicle interrupts free exchange with the plasma membrane. A substantial burst of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate immediately after budding coincides with a burst of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, distinct from any later encounter with the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate pool in early endosomes; phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate and the GTPase Rab5 then appear and remain as the uncoating vesicles mature into Rab5-positive endocytic intermediates. Our observations show that a cascade of molecular conversions, made possible by the separation of a vesicle from its parent membrane, can label membrane-traffic intermediates and determine their destinations."
https://openalex.org/W2773669784,"Good nutrition is a prerequisite for a healthy and active life, especially for agriculture-dependent households. However, diets in most households in Tanzania lack diversity because the intake of meat, poultry, fish, and vegetables and fruits is low. This study estimates factors influencing dietary diversity of the household, children under five years, and women using primary survey data. It qualitatively assesses male dietary patterns and men's potential role in improving the nutritional status of the entire household. The findings show that the most consumed foods within the household are cereals, vegetables, oils and fats, spices, condiments and beverages. Children (d = 0.4; p<0.05) and women (d = 0.5; p<0.01) in female-headed households have low dietary diversity compared to those in male-headed households. Women and children access less diverse diets since 46% and 26%, achieved minimum dietary diversity respectively. Production of vegetables (coef. 0.34; p<0.05) play an important role in improving the dietary diversity of women. Gender (coef. 0.05; p<0.10) and education of the household head (coef. 0.02; p<0.01), food preparation and nutrition training (coef. 0.10; p<0.05) are important factors influencing dietary diversity of the members of a household. Results suggest that there is a need to support community-based programs to provide information on food and the importance of vegetables, their preparation, consumption and utilization to address food and nutrition challenges. Men can contribute towards improving household nutrition security by reducing consumption of food away from the home, especially during periods of food shortages. We recommend the use of complementary quantitative research to determine the patterns and dynamics of men's dietary diversity and compare it with that of other household members."
https://openalex.org/W2775137578,"Lupeol and stigmasterol, major phytosterols in various herbal plants, possess anti-inflammatory activities and have been proposed as candidates for anti-cancer agents, but their molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of lupeol and stigmasterol on tumor and endothelial cells in vitro and their anti-cancer activities in vivo. Our results demonstrated that lupeol and stigmasterol suppressed cell viability, migration, and morphogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) but not cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells. Expression analyses showed that the treatment of both compounds significantly reduced the transcript level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and Western blot analyses further revealed a decrease in downstream effector levels of VEGFR-2 signaling, including phosphorylated forms of Src, Akt, PCL, and FAK, which were rescued by TNF-α treatment. In vivo, lupeol and stigmasterol disrupted tumor angiogenesis and reduced the growth of CCA tumor xenografts. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed a decrease in CD31-positive vessel content and macrophage recruitment upon treatment. These findings indicate that lupeol and stigmasterol effectively target tumor endothelial cells and suppress CCA tumor growth by their anti-inflammatory activities and are attractive candidates for anti-cancer treatment of CCA tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2772394307,"Activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) death receptor by TNF induces either cell survival or cell death. However, the mechanisms mediating these distinct outcomes remain poorly understood. In this study, we report that the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase, an enzyme up-regulated in numerous cancers, sialylates TNFR1 and thereby protects tumor cells from TNF-induced apoptosis. Using pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells with ST6Gal-I knockdown or overexpression, we determined that α2-6 sialylation of TNFR1 had no effect on early TNF-induced signaling events, including the rapid activation of NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and Akt (occurring within 15 min). However, upon extended TNF treatment (6–24 h), cells with high ST6Gal-I levels exhibited resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis, as indicated by morphological evidence of cell death and decreased activation of caspases 8 and 3. Correspondingly, at these later time points, high ST6Gal-I expressers displayed sustained activation of the survival molecules Akt and NF-κB. Additionally, extended TNF treatment resulted in the selective enrichment of clonal variants with high ST6Gal-I expression, further substantiating a role for ST6Gal-I in cell survival. Given that TNFR1 internalization is known to be essential for apoptosis induction, whereas survival signaling is initiated by TNFR1 at the plasma membrane, we examined TNFR1 localization. The α2-6 sialylation of TNFR1 was found to inhibit TNF-induced TNFR1 internalization. Thus, by restraining TNFR1 at the cell surface via sialylation, ST6Gal-I acts as a functional switch to divert signaling toward survival. These collective findings point to a novel glycosylation-dependent mechanism that regulates the cellular response to TNF and may promote cancer cell survival within TNF-rich tumor microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W2774948007,"Extracellular phosphate (Pi) can act as a signaling molecule that directly alters gene expression and cellular physiology. The ability of cells or organisms to detect changes in extracellular Pi levels implies the existence of a Pi-sensing mechanism that signals to the body or individual cell. However, unlike in prokaryotes, yeasts, and plants, the molecular players involved in Pi sensing in mammals remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the high-affinity, sodium-dependent Pi transporters PiT1 and PiT2 in mediating Pi signaling in skeletal cells. We found that deletion of PiT1 or PiT2 blunted the Pi-dependent ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent gene up-regulation of the mineralization inhibitors matrix Gla protein and osteopontin. This result suggested that both PiTs are necessary for Pi signaling. Moreover, the ERK1/2 phosphorylation could be rescued by overexpressing Pi transport–deficient PiT mutants. Using cross-linking and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer approaches, we found that PiT1 and PiT2 form high-abundance homodimers and Pi-regulated low-abundance heterodimers. Interestingly, in the absence of sodium-dependent Pi transport activity, the PiT1-PiT2 heterodimerization was still regulated by extracellular Pi levels. Of note, when two putative Pi-binding residues, Ser-128 (in PiT1) and Ser-113 (in PiT2), were substituted with alanine, the PiT1-PiT2 heterodimerization was no longer regulated by extracellular Pi. These observations suggested that Pi binding rather than Pi uptake may be the key factor in mediating Pi signaling through the PiT proteins. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Pi-regulated PiT1-PiT2 heterodimerization mediates Pi sensing independently of Pi uptake."

However, little is known about the effect of Rev-erb agonist on the progression of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure. To investigate it, wild-type male mice underwent sham-operation or permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery to create MI model. Rev-erb agonist SR9009 (100 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate cardiac function 1 week after surgery. The gene and protein expression levels in the left ventricles (LVs) were determined with real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Moreover, immune cell infiltration into the LVs was analyzed by flow cytometry. Survival rate and reduced LV function were significantly improved by the treatment with SR9009 after MI. The expression level and plasma concentration of brain natriuretic peptide were significantly lower in MI mice treated with SR9009 (MI+SR) than in MI mice treated with vehicle (MI+V). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory-related molecules such as Il6, Mcp1, Ly6g, Cd11b, matrix metallopeptidase (Mmp)9, and the protein expression levels of phosphorylated NF-κB p65, phosphorylated ERK, and phosphorylated p38 were also significantly lower in MI+SR than in MI+V. Immunofluorescence intensity for MMP-9 was enhanced in the LVs, but was less so in MI+SR than in MI+V. Furthermore, infiltrations of neutrophils and proinflammatory macrophages in the LVs were dramatically increased in MI+V and were significantly suppressed in MI+SR. Rev-erb agonist SR9009 treatment inhibited post-MI mortality and improved cardiac function through modulating inflammation and remodeling process."

The aim of this study was to evaluate two interferon gamma release assays during early post-transplant period as a predictor of the development of CMV infection in CMV-seropositive patients. A total of 124 CMV-seropositive recipients who received kidney transplantation from CMV-seropositive donor were prospectively examined. At pre-transplant and post-transplant 1 and 3 months, CMV-CMIs were tested using QuantiFERON-CMV assay (QF-CMV) and CMV specific T cell ELISPOT against CMV pp65 and IE-1 antigens (pp65-ELISPOT, IE-1-ELISPOT). CMV DNAemia occurred in 16 (12.9%) patients within 3 months after transplant. Post-transplant pp65 or IE-1 ELISPOT response, but not QF-CMV, was significantly associated with CMV DNAemia. The pp65 ELISPOT (cut-off; 30 spots/200,000 cells) and IE-1 ELISPOT (10 spots/200,000 cells) at post-transplant 1 month predicted the risk of post-transplant CMV DNAemia (P = 0.019). Negative predictive values (NPV) for protection from CMV DNAemia in case of positive ELISPOT results were 94.5% (95% CI: 86.9-97.8%) and 97.6% (95% CI: 86.3-99.6%) in pp65-ELISPOT and IE-1-ELISPOT assays, respectively. These results suggest that the variability may exist between CMV ELISPOT assays and QF-CMV, and CMV ELISPOT at post-transplant 1 month can identify the risk of CMV DNAemia in seropositive kidney transplant recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2771303342,"Slit-Robo GTPase-activating protein 1 (SRGAP1) functions as a GAP for Rho-family GTPases and downstream of Slit-Robo signaling. We aim to investigate the biological function of SRGAP1 and reveal its regulation by deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in gastric cancer (GC). mRNA and protein expression of SRGAP1 were examined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. The biological role of SRGAP1 was demonstrated through siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. The regulation of SRGAP1 by miR-340 and miR-124 was confirmed by western blot, dual luciferase activity assays and rescue experiments. SRGAP1 is overexpressed in 9 out of 12 (75.0%) GC cell lines. In primary GC samples from TCGA cohort, SRGAP1 shows gene amplification in 5/258 (1.9%) of cases and its mRNA expression demonstrates a positive correlation with copy number gain. Knockdown of SRGAP1 in GC cells suppressed cell proliferation, reduced colony formation, and significantly inhibited cell invasion and migration. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that SRGAP1 knockdown significantly inhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In addition, SRGAP1 was found to be a direct target of two tumor-suppressive miRNAs, miR-340 and miR-124. Concordantly, these two miRNAs were downregulated in primary gastric tumors and these decreasing levels w5ere associated with poor outcomes. Expression of miR-340 and SRGAP1 displayed a reverse relationship in primary samples and re-expressed SRGAP1, rescued the anti-cancer effects of miR-340. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that, apart from gene amplification and mutation, the activation of SRGAP1 in GC is partly due to the downregulation of tumor-suppressive miRNAs, miR-340 and miR-124. Thus SRGAP1 is overexpressed in gastric carcinogenesis and plays an oncogenic role through activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2774211259,"Understanding interactions between herbivores and parasitoids is essential for successful biodiversity protection and monitoring and for biological pest control. Morphological identifications employ insect rearing and are complicated by insects' high diversity and crypsis. DNA barcoding has been successfully used in studies of host-parasitoid interactions as it can substantially increase the recovered real host-parasitoid diversity distorted by overlooked species complexes, or by species with slight morphological differences. However, this approach does not allow the simultaneous detection and identification of host(s) and parasitoid(s). Recently, high-throughput sequencing has shown high potential for surveying ecological communities and trophic interactions. Using mock samples comprising insect larvae and their parasitoids, we tested the potential of DNA metabarcoding for identifying individuals involved in host-parasitoid interactions to different taxonomic levels, and compared it to standard DNA barcoding and morphological approaches. For DNA metabarcoding, we targeted the standard barcoding marker cytochrome oxidase subunit I using highly degenerate primers, 2*300 bp sequencing on a MiSeq platform, and RTAX classification using paired-end reads. Additionally, using a large host-parasitoid dataset from a Central European floodplain forest, we assess the completeness and usability of a local reference library by confronting the number of Barcoding Index Numbers obtained by standard barcoding with the number of morphotypes. Overall, metabarcoding recovery was high, identifying 92.8% of the taxa present in mock samples, and identification success within individual taxonomic levels did not significantly differ among metabarcoding, standard barcoding, and morphology. Based on the current local reference library, 39.4% parasitoid and 90.7% host taxa were identified to the species level. DNA barcoding estimated higher parasitoid diversity than morphotyping, especially in groups with high level of crypsis. This study suggests the potential of metabarcoding for effectively recovering host-parasitoid diversity, together with more accurate identifications obtained from building reliable and comprehensive reference libraries, especially for parasitoids."
https://openalex.org/W2775612778,"Prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been dramatically improved. However, prognosis of the cases refractory to primary therapy is still poor. Recent phase 2 study on the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with bortezomib (BTZ), a proteasome inhibitor, for refractory childhood ALL demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes. However, septic death was observed in over 10% of patients, indicating the necessity of biomarkers that could predict BTZ sensitivity. We investigated in vitro BTZ sensitivity in a large panel of ALL cell lines that acted as a model system for refractory ALL, and found that Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL, IKZF1 deletion, and biallelic loss of CDKN2A were associated with favorable response. Even in Ph-negative ALL cell lines, IKZF1 deletion and bilallelic loss of CDKN2A were independently associated with higher BTZ sensitivity. BTZ showed only marginal cross-resistance to four representative chemotherapeutic agents (vincristine, dexamethasone, l-asparaginase, and daunorubicin) in B-cell precursor-ALL cell lines. To improve the efficacy and safety of proteasome inhibitor combination chemotherapy, we also analyzed the anti-leukemic activity of carfilzomib (CFZ), a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, as a substitute for BTZ. CFZ showed significantly higher activity than BTZ in the majority of ALL cell lines except for the P-glycoprotein-positive t(17;19) ALL cell lines, and IKZF1 deletion was also associated with a favorable response to CFZ treatment. P-glycoprotein inhibitors effectively restored the sensitivity to CFZ, but not BTZ, in P-glycoprotein-positive t(17;19) ALL cell lines. P-glycoprotein overexpressing ALL cell line showed a CFZ-specific resistance, while knockout of P-glycoprotein by genome editing with a CRISPR/Cas9 system sensitized P-glycoprotein-positive t(17;19) ALL cell line to CFZ. These observations suggested that IKZF1 deletion could be a useful biomarker to predict good sensitivity to CFZ and BTZ, and that CFZ combination chemotherapy may be a new therapeutic option with higher anti-leukemic activity for refractory ALL that contain P-glycoprotein-negative leukemia cells."

Since implementation of the focused antenatal care model, quality of care assessments have mostly focused on utilization and coverage of routine interventions for antenatal care. This study aims to assess the quality of antenatal care provision from a holistic perspective in a rural district in Tanzania. Structure, process and outcome components of quality are explored. This paper reports on data collected over several periods from 2012 to 2015 through facility audits of supplies and services, ANC observations and exit interviews with pregnant women. Additional qualitative methods were used such as interviews, focus group observations and participant observations. Findings indicate variable performance of routine ANC services, partly explained by insufficient resources. Poor performance was also observed for appropriate history taking, attention for client's wellbeing, basic physical examination and adequate counseling and education. Achieving quality improvement for ANC requires increased attention for the process of care provision beyond coverage, including attention for response-based services, which should be assessed based on locally determined criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2774438235,"In Escherichia coli, FtsLB plays a central role in the initiation of cell division, possibly transducing a signal that will eventually lead to the activation of peptidoglycan remodeling at the forming septum. The molecular mechanisms by which FtsLB operates in the divisome, however, are not understood. Here, we present a structural analysis of the FtsLB complex, performed with biophysical, computational, and in vivo methods, that establishes the organization of the transmembrane region and proximal coiled coil of the complex. FRET analysis in vitro is consistent with formation of a tetramer composed of two FtsL and two FtsB subunits. We predicted subunit contacts through co-evolutionary analysis and used them to compute a structural model of the complex. The transmembrane region of FtsLB is stabilized by hydrophobic packing and by a complex network of hydrogen bonds. The coiled coil domain probably terminates near the critical constriction control domain, which might correspond to a structural transition. The presence of strongly polar amino acids within the core of the tetrameric coiled coil suggests that the coil may split into two independent FtsQ-binding domains. The helix of FtsB is interrupted between the transmembrane and coiled coil regions by a flexible Gly-rich linker. Conversely, the data suggest that FtsL forms an uninterrupted helix across the two regions and that the integrity of this helix is indispensable for the function of the complex. The FtsL helix is thus a candidate for acting as a potential mechanical connection to communicate conformational changes between periplasmic, membrane, and cytoplasmic regions."
https://openalex.org/W2773476049,"Sepsis is a dysregulated systemic response to infection involving many inflammatory pathways and the induction of counter-regulatory anti-inflammatory processes that results in a state of immune incompetence and can lead to multi-organ failure. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that, following ligation by CXCL12, directs cells to bone marrow niches and also plays an important role in T cell cosignaling and formation of the immunological synapse. Here, we investigated the expression and function of CXCR4 in a murine model of polymicrobial sepsis. Results indicate that CXCR4 is selectively upregulated on naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and CD4+ central memory T cells following the induction of sepsis, and that CXCR4 antagonism resulted in a significant decrease in sepsis-induced mortality. We probed the mechanistic basis for these findings and found that CXCR4 antagonism significantly increased the number of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following sepsis. Moreover, mice treated with the CXCR4 antagonist contained fewer PD-1+ LAG-3+ 2B4+ cells, suggesting that blockade of CXCR4 mitigates CD4+ T cell exhaustion during sepsis. Taken together, these results characterize CXCR4 as an important pathway that modulates immune dysfunction and mortality following sepsis, which may hold promise as a target for future therapeutic intervention in septic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2773594069,"Over the 20th century, urbanization has substantially shaped the surface of Earth. With population rapidly shifting from rural locations towards the cities, urban areas have dramatically expanded on a global scale and represent crystallization points of social, cultural and economic assets and activities. This trend is estimated to persist for the next decades, and particularly the developing countries are expected to face rapid urban growth. The management of this growth will require good governance strategies and planning. By threatening the livelihoods, assets and health as foundations of human activities, another major global change contributor, climate change, became an equally important concern of stakeholders. Based on the climate trends observed over the 20th century, and a spatially explicit model of urbanization, this paper investigates the impacts of climate change in relation to different stages of development of urban areas, thus evolving a more integrated perspective on both processes. As a result, an integrative measure of climate change trends and impacts is proposed and estimated for urban areas worldwide. We show that those areas facing major urban growth are to a large extent also hotspots of climate change. Since most of these hotspots are located in the Global South, we emphasize the need for stakeholders to co-manage both drivers of global change. The presented integrative perspective is seen as a starting point to foster such co-management, and furthermore as a means to facilitate communication and knowledge exchange on climate change impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2774588923,"Obesity and cigarette smoke are major cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and, when coexisting in the same individuals, have additive/synergistic effects upon CVD. We studied the mechanisms involved in nicotine enhancement of CVD in Sprague Dawley rats with diet–induced obesity. The rats were fed either a high fat (HFD) or normal rat chow diet with or without nicotine (100 mg/L in drinking water) for 20 weeks. HFD rats developed central obesity, increased systolic blood pressure (SBP), aortic superoxide (O2-) production, and impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (EDR). Nicotine further increased SBP, O2- and impaired eNOS and EDR in obese rats. In the peritoneal macrophages from obese rats, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin 1β and CD36 were increased, and were further increased in nicotine-treated obese rats. Using PCR array we found that 3 of 84 target proinflammatory genes were increased by 2–4 fold in the aorta of obese rats, 11 of the target genes were further increased in nicotine-treated obese rats. HUVECs, incubated with conditioned medium from the peritoneal macrophages of nicotine treated-obese rats, exhibited reduced eNOS and increased NADPH oxidase subunits gp91phox and p22phox expression. Those effects were partially prevented by adding anti-TNFα antibody to the conditioned medium. Our results suggest that nicotine aggravates the CV effects of diet–induced obesity including the oxidative stress, vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The underlying mechanisms may involve in targeting endothelium by enhancement of macrophage-derived TNFα."
https://openalex.org/W2773017465,"Remodeling of the primitive vasculature is necessary for the formation of a complex branched vascular architecture. However, the factors that modulate these processes are incompletely defined. Previously, we defined the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in endothelial specification. In the present study, we further examined the Etv2-Cre mediated ablation of DicerL/L and characterized the perturbed vascular patterning in the embryo proper and yolk-sac. We mechanistically defined an important role for miR-130a, an Etv2 downstream target, in the mediation of vascular patterning and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Inducible overexpression of miR-130a resulted in robust induction of vascular sprouts and angiogenesis with increased uptake of acetylated-LDL. Mechanistically, miR-130a directly regulated Jarid2 expression by binding to its 3'-UTR region. Over-expression of Jarid2 in HUVEC cells led to defective tube formation indicating its inhibitory role in angiogenesis. The knockout of miR-130a showed increased levels of Jarid2 in the ES/EB system. In addition, the levels of Jarid2 transcripts were increased in the Etv2-null embryos at E8.5. In the in vivo settings, injection of miR-130a specific morpholinos in zebrafish embryos resulted in perturbed vascular patterning with reduced levels of endothelial transcripts in the miR-130a morphants. Further, co-injection of miR-130a mimics in the miR-130a morphants rescued the vascular defects during embryogenesis. qPCR and in situ hybridization techniques demonstrated increased expression of jarid2a in the miR-130a morphants in vivo. These findings demonstrate a critical role for Etv2-miR-130a-Jarid2 in vascular patterning both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2774886460,"The world faces a food security challenge with approximately 868 million people undernourished and about two billion people suffering from the negative health consequences of micronutrient deficiencies. Yet, it is believed that at least 33% of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted along the food chain. As food waste has a negative effect on food security, the present study sought to quantify household food waste along the rural-urban continuum in three South African mid-sized towns situated along an agro-ecological gradient. We quantified the types of foods and drinks that households threw away in the previous 48 hours and identified the causes of household food waste in the three sites. More households wasted prepared food (27%) than unprepared food (15%) and drinks (8%). However, households threw away greater quantities of unprepared food in the 48-hour recall period (268.6±610.1 g, 90% confidence interval: 175.5 to 361.7 g) compared to prepared food (121.0±132.4 g, 90% confidence interval: 100.8 to 141.3 g) and drinks (77.0±192.5 ml, 90% confidence interval: 47.7 to 106.4 ml). The estimated per capita food waste (5–10 kg of unprepared food waste, 3–4 kg of prepared food waste and 1–3 litres of drinks waste per person per year) overlaps with that estimated for other developing countries, but lower than most developed countries. However, the estimated average amount of food waste per person per year for this study (12.35 kg) was higher relative to that estimated for developing countries (8.5 kg per person per year). Household food waste was mainly a result of consumer behavior concerning food preparation and storage. Integrated approaches are required to address this developmental issue affecting South African societies, which include promoting sound food management to decrease household food waste. Also, increased awareness and educational campaigns for household food waste reduction interventions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2771689220,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavioral effects of chronic (six weeks) nandrolone decanoate (ND, 20 mg/kg, s.c., weekly in single dose) administration (in order to mimic heavy human abuse), and exercise (swimming protocol of 60 minutes a day, five days in a row/two days break), applied alone and simultaneously with ND, in male rats (n = 40). Also, we evaluated the effects of those protocols on hippocampal parvalbumin (PV) content and the possible connection between the alterations in certain parts of hippocampal GABAergic system and behavioral patterns. Both ND and exercise protocols induced increase in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and estradiol blood levels. Our results confirmed anxiogenic effects of ND observed in open field (OF) test (decrease in the locomotor activity, as well as in frequency and cumulative duration in the centre zone) and in elevated plus maze (EPM) test (decrease in frequency and cumulative duration in open arms, and total exploratory activity), that were accompanied with a mild decrease in the number of PV interneurons in hippocampus. Chronic exercise protocol induced significant increase in hippocampal PV neurons (dentate gyrus and CA1 region), followed by anxiolytic-like behavioral changes, observed in both OF and EPM (increase in all estimated parameters), and in evoked beam-walking test (increase in time to cross the beam), compared to ND treated animals. The applied dose of ND was sufficient to attenuate beneficial effects of exercise in rats by means of decreased exercise-induced anxiolytic effect, as well as to reverse exercise-induced augmentation in number of PV immunoreactive neurons in hippocampus. Our results implicate the possibility that alterations in hippocampal PV interneurons (i.e. GABAergic system) may be involved in modulation of anxiety level induced by ND abuse and/or extended exercise protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2772169524,"Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of food-simulating liquids on the flexural strength of a methacrylate-based and a silorane-based resin composite. Materials and methods In this in vitro study, sixty specimens of Filtek P90 and Filtek Z350 composite were prepared in a customized mold (2 × 2 × 25 mm). The specimens of each composite were divided into five subgroups as follows: one as a control group and the other four groups included distilled water, heptane, 2% citric acid, and 50% aqueous ethanol. The specimens were stored in the solutions for one week at 37°C, and the control group was stored at room temperature for the same period of time. Then, flexural strength values were measured. The statistical analysis was performed by One-Way ANOVA, Paired T test and post hoc LSD at a significance level of 0.05. Results In the control group, the mean flexural strength of Filtek P90 and Filtek Z350 were 155.1 MPa and 147.3 MPa, respectively, and there was no significant difference (P-value>0.05). The mean flexural strength of Filtek P90 and Filtek Z350 significantly decreased in ethanol (P-value <0.05). Immersion in 0.02 N citric acid and heptane had no significant effect on the flexural strength of Filtek P90 and Filtek Z350. The maximum flexural strength of Filtek P90 was in the heptane group (192.6 MPa) and minimum flexural strength was in ethanol group (92.7 MPa) the maximum flexural strength of Filtek Z350 was in the heptane group (163.2 MPa) and minimum flexural strength was in the ethanol group (104.7 MPa). Conclusion The flexural strength of tested resin composites significantly affected by ethanol solution. The flexural strength of resin composites was not affected by other food simulating liquids."
https://openalex.org/W2773744668,"Tick-Borne Relapsing Fever (TBRF) is caused by spirochetes in the genus Borrelia. Very limited information exists on the incidence of this disease in humans and domestic dogs in the United States. The main objective of this study is to evaluate exposure of dogs to Borrelia turicatae, a causative agent of TBRF, in Texas. To this end, 878 canine serum samples were submitted to Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory from October 2011 to September 2012 for suspected tick-borne illnesses. The recombinant Borrelial antigen glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ) was expressed, purified, and used as a diagnostic antigen in both ELISA assays and Immunoblot analysis. Unfortunately, due to significant background reaction, the use of GlpQ as a diagnostic marker in the ELISA assay was not effective in discriminating dogs exposed to B. turicatae. Nevertheless, immunoblot assays showed that 17 out of 853 samples tested were considered to be seropositive, which constitutes 1.99% of all Texas samples tested in this study. The majority of positive samples were from central and southern Texas. Exposure to TBRF spirochetes may be seasonal, with 70.59% (12 out of 17) of the cases detected between June and December. In addition, 2 out of the 17 sero-reactive cases (11.76%) showed reactivity to both B. burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease) and B. turicatae (a causative agent of TBRF). This is the first report of TBRF sero-prevalence in companion animals in an endemic area. Our findings further indicate that B. turicatae is maintained in domestic canids in Texas in regions where human disease also occurs, suggesting that domestic dogs could serve as sentinels for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2771912956,"The common cutworm (CCW; Spodoptera litura Fabricius) is a serious herbivorous insect pest of soybean (Glycine max) in Asia and Oceania. Previously, we identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for CCW-antibiosis-resistance, CCW-1 and CCW-2, and antixenosis-resistance, qRslx1 and qRslx2, in the cultivar 'Himeshirazu'. The effects of these QTLs are useful in the breeding of CCW-resistant cultivars. In this study, we conducted an antixenosis bioassay on CCW using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between a wild soybean (Glycine soja) and the leading cultivar 'Fukuyutaka' to identify CCW-resistance genes in G. soja. The QTL analysis revealed six and four novel antixenosis-resistance QTLs in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Among them, the QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 7, designated qRslx4 and qRslx3, respectively, were stably detected in both years. qRslx3 exhibited the largest effect in both years, suggesting that qRslx3 can be exploited in the breeding of CCW-resistant soybean. Furthermore, qRslx3 and qRslx4 can be used, along with previously reported QTLs from 'Himeshirazu', to enhance the CCW-resistance of soybean cultivars because their chromosomal positions are unique. These new CCW-resistance QTLs from G. soja should play important roles in the breeding of CCW-resistant soybean cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2772382647,"In smart parking environments, how to choose suitable parking facilities with various attributes to satisfy certain criteria is an important decision issue. Based on the multiple attributes decision making (MADM) theory, this study proposed a smart parking guidance algorithm by considering three representative decision factors (i.e., walk duration, parking fee, and the number of vacant parking spaces) and various preferences of drivers. In this paper, the expected number of vacant parking spaces is regarded as an important attribute to reflect the difficulty degree of finding available parking spaces, and a queueing theory-based theoretical method was proposed to estimate this expected number for candidate parking facilities with different capacities, arrival rates, and service rates. The effectiveness of the MADM-based parking guidance algorithm was investigated and compared with a blind search-based approach in comprehensive scenarios with various distributions of parking facilities, traffic intensities, and user preferences. Experimental results show that the proposed MADM-based algorithm is effective to choose suitable parking resources to satisfy users’ preferences. Furthermore, it has also been observed that this newly proposed Markov Chain-based availability attribute is more effective to represent the availability of parking spaces than the arrival rate-based availability attribute proposed in existing research."
https://openalex.org/W2772127660,"Protein-carbohydrate interactions are very often mediated by the stacking CH-π interactions involving the side chains of aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr) or phenylalanine (Phe). Especially suitable for stacking is the Trp residue. Analysis of the PDB database shows Trp stacking for 265 carbohydrate or carbohydrate like ligands in 5 208 Trp containing motives. An appropriate model system to study such an interaction is the AAL lectin family where the stacking interactions play a crucial role and are thought to be a driving force for carbohydrate binding. In this study we present data showing a novel finding in the stacking interaction of the AAL Trp side chain with the carbohydrate. High resolution X-ray structure of the AAL lectin from Aleuria aurantia with α-methyl-l-fucoside ligand shows two possible Trp side chain conformations with the same occupation in electron density. The in silico data shows that the conformation of the Trp side chain does not influence the interaction energy despite the fact that each conformation creates interactions with different carbohydrate CH groups. Moreover, the PDB data search shows that the conformations are almost equally distributed across all Trp-carbohydrate complexes, which would suggest no substantial preference for one conformation over another."

However, the high-frequency, immunodominant CD8+ T-cell responses that control CMV infection have not been well studied in African populations. We therefore sought to define the immunodominant CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses within sub-Saharan African study subjects. Among 257 subjects, we determined the CD8+ T-cell responses to overlapping peptides spanning three of the most immunogenic CMV proteins, pp65, IE-1 and IE-2, using IFN-γ ELISpot assays. A bioinformatics tool was used to predict optimal epitopes within overlapping peptides whose recognition was statistically associated with expression of particular HLA class I molecules. Using this approach, we identified 16 predicted novel CMV-specific epitopes within CMV-pp65, IE-1 and IE-2. The immunodominant pp65-specific, IE-1, IE-2 responses were all either previously well characterised or were confirmed using peptide-MHC tetramers. The novel epitopes identified included an IE-2-specific epitope restricted by HLA*B*44:03 that induced high-frequency CD8+ T-cell responses (mean 3.4% of CD8+ T-cells) in 95% of HLA-B*44:03-positive subjects tested, in one individual accounting for 18.8% of all CD8+ T-cells. These predicted novel CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes identified in an African cohort will facilitate future analyses of immune responses in African populations where CMV infection is almost universal during infancy."

Here, we report a novel mechanism by which PHLDA1, Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 1, negatively regulates ErbB receptor signaling by inhibition of receptor oligomerization. We have found that the ErbB3 ligand, heregulin, induces PHILDA1 expression in MCF-7 cells.

Although PHLDA1 has been reported to be a negative regulator of ErbB-signaling pathways and significantly enhances the sensitivity of ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells to lapatinib (21Li G. Wang X. Hibshoosh H. Jin C. Halmos B. Modulation of ErbB2 blockade in ErbB2-positive cancers: the role of ErbB2 mutations and PHLDA1.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 (25238247): e10634910.1371/journal.pone.0106349Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it has not been demonstrated how PHLDA1 regulates ErbB signaling at a network level. In this study, we have found using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) that PHLDA1 targets ErbB3 and thereby inhibits phosphorylation of ErbB receptors in HRG-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Although these experimental results suggest a role for PHLDA1 in negative regulation of the receptors, single-cell data have shown that the expression of PHLDA1 and phospho-ErbB2 are positively correlated, even at the time when phosphorylation of ErbB2 is attenuated and PHLDA1 expression is increased. These results suggested a complex inhibitory mode of PHLDA1 in ErbB receptor activation. Mathematical models, including ErbB receptor activation processes such as dimerization, phosphorylation, and tetramer formation with different inhibitory modes of PHLDA1, demonstrated that only a model containing inhibition of both dimer and tetramer formation could explain the experimental data. Live cell single-molecule imaging analysis demonstrated that ligand–receptor interactions closely mimicked the computational predictions. Our study suggests that PHLDA1 inhibits higher-order oligomerization of the ErbB receptor via a transcriptionally-induced feedback mechanism. We first used qRT-PCR to examine time-course mRNA expression of the PHLDA family genes, PHLDA1, PHLDA2, and PHLDA3, in HRG-stimulated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A). Expression of PHLDA1 mRNA increased about 30-fold after HRG ligand stimulation, with a peak maximum at 120 min. PHLDA2 mRNA showed a sustained increase, but the amount of PHLDA3 mRNA was not increased by HRG. Expression levels of PHLDA1 and PHLDA2 were more increased by HRG compared with EGF. We tested several kinase inhibitors, U0126 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor), wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor), and trastuzumab (an ErbB2 inhibitor), to identify the induction pathways using a microarray platform (Fig. S1). As a result, expression of PHLDA1 was suppressed by all three inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 1B, U0126 and the Akt inhibitor VIII, a specific inhibitor targeting Akt1 and -2, decreased the induction of PHLDA1 mRNA at 2 h after HRG stimulation. These results suggest that PHLDA1 mRNA induction is dependent on both Ras-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways. These pathways also affected PHLDA1 protein levels at 3 h after HRG stimulation (Fig. 1C, quantification values are shown in Fig. S2). PHLDA1 mRNA expression induced by HRG is suppressed by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 1D) and siRNA targeting c-FOS (Fig. 1E) as well, suggesting that de novo synthesis of the c-FOS transcription factor is necessary prior to PHLDA1 mRNA expression. We confirmed that c-FOS knockdown decreased the induction of PHLDA1 proteins (Figs. 1F and Fig. S3). In contrast, PHLDA1 siRNA moderately increased phosphorylation of ErbB receptors, Akt (Thr-308 and Ser-473) and ERK (Fig. 1G). Among the molecules we analyzed for phosphorylation, ErbB2 was most affected (1.8 times higher than the control), and the phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 was significantly up-regulated by PHLDA1 knockdown (p < 0.05, Welch’s statistical test, Fig. S4). Consistent with the above findings, PHLDA1 overexpression inhibited phosphorylation of ErbB2, Akt, and ERK in the plasma membrane fraction with statistical significance (Fig. 1H and Fig. S5), implying that PHLDA1 is responsible for negative regulation of the ErbB signaling pathway. HRG titration experiments under conditions where PHLDA1 was overexpressed showed that its inhibitory effect on ErbB2 phosphorylation was only significant at higher HRG concentrations (Fig. S6A). Overexpression of PHLDA1 suppressed ErbB2 phosphorylation at higher ligand doses but did not affect the EC50 (4.1 nm in control and 6.0 nm in PHLDA1 overexpression conditions) (Fig. S6A). This non-competitive inhibitory profile indicates that PHLDA1 may indirectly inhibit ErbB2 phosphorylation by modulating unknown regulatory molecules or by inducing conformational changes but not by competing with ErbB2 kinase activity. A similar phenomenon was also observed with cells that were first treated with 1 nm HRG for 180 min followed by a second treatment with different amounts of HRG (Fig. S6B). These results suggest that the ErbB signaling network is negatively regulated by mechanisms that at least in part include PHLDA1. From the current experimental results (Fig. 1, G and H, and S6A) and our previous study (18Nagashima T. Shimodaira H. Ide K. Nakakuki T. Tani Y. Takahashi K. Yumoto N. Hatakeyama M. Quantitative transcriptional control of ErbB receptor signaling undergoes graded to biphasic response for cell differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 (17142811): 4045-405610.1074/jbc.M608653200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we concluded that 10 nm HRG is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of ErbB2 and expression of PHLDA1 for the following experiments. Next, to further clarify the inhibitory mechanism of PHLDA1 on ErbB activation, we investigated PHLDA1-binding partners using LC/MS. Immunoprecipitates of HRG-stimulated MCF-7 samples using an anti-PHLDA1 antibody contained proteins such as ErbB3, TP53, PLCG1, and PIK3R1, -2, or -3 (PIK3R1/2/3) with ErbB3 having the highest score (Fig. 2A). The ErbB3–PHLDA1 interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2B). In this experiment, less ErbB3 is immunoprecipitated under HRG-stimulated conditions, which may be due to modification of the antibody recognition site on ErbB3. Association between PHLDA1 and ErbB3 was also observed in an earlier study (22Li J. Bennett K. Stukalov A. Fang B. Zhang G. Yoshida T. Okamoto I. Kim J.-Y. Song L. Bai Y. Qian X. Rawal B. Schell M. Grebien F. Winter G. et al.Perturbation of the mutated EGFR interactome identifies vulnerabilities and resistance mechanisms.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2013; 9 (24189400): 70510.1038/msb.2013.61Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that PHLDA1 might interrupt phosphorylation of ErbB receptors by binding to ErbB3. HRG is a growth factor that preferentially binds to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors and induces strong phosphorylation of the ErbB2 receptor through receptor heterodimerization (23Holbro T. Beerli R.R. Maurer F. Koziczak M. Barbas 3rd., C.F. Hynes N.E. The ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer functions as an oncogenic unit: ErbB2 requires ErbB3 to drive breast tumor cell proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In MCF-7 cells, it is thought that the main partner of ErbB3 in the heterodimer is ErbB2, because ErbB4 is only weakly expressed (24Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y.

We therefore examined whether the amount of PHLDA1 expression affects the interaction between ErbB3 and phosphorylated ErbB2 at 5 and 180 min after HRG stimulation, when phosphorylation of the ErbB receptor reaches its peak maximum and when the cells show a sufficient amount of PHLDA1 expression, respectively. As a result, knockdown of PHLDA1 increased the interaction between ErbB3 and phospho-ErbB2 as well as the interaction ErbB3 and ErbB2 after HRG stimulation at both 5 and 180 min (Fig. 2, C and D), whereas overexpression of PHLDA1 decreased this interaction (Fig. 2, E and F). These results suggest that PHLDA1 affects not only the amount of phosphorylated ErbB receptor but also the amount of ErbB receptor oligomers containing both ErbB2–ErbB3 association. We also confirmed the effect of PHLDA1 knockdown on receptor dimerization by using proximity ligation assay (PLA). PLA is a technology that enables detection of protein–protein interaction, similar to a colocalization analysis in immunostaining, and it can be applied for detection of ErbB receptor complex formation (26Söderberg O.

In this assay, bright fluorescent puncta can be detected only when two antibodies recognizing ErbB3 and phospho-ErbB2 are in proximal regions (i.e. these proteins form a complex). We found that knockdown of PHLDA1 increases complex formation between phosphorylated ErbB2 and total ErbB3 proteins after HRG stimulation (Fig. 2, G and H). Overall, these data support the hypothesis that PHLDA1 negatively regulates the transactivation of ErbB2 receptor through interaction with ErbB3. ErbB receptor signal response in MCF-7 cells is heterogeneous across cell populations (28Nagashima T. Inoue N. Yumoto N. Saeki Y. Magi S. Volinsky N. Sorkin A. Kholodenko B.N. Okada-Hatakeyama M. Feedforward regulation of mRNA stability by prolonged extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity.FEBS J. 2015; 282 (25491268): 613-62910.1111/febs.13172Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 29Mina M.

Rep. 2015; 5 (26179713): 1199910.1038/srep11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the amount of PHLDA1 expression is moderate. Therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively assess the activation status of the ErbB-signaling pathway and PHLDA1 expression at a single-cell level to confirm the inhibitory function of PHLDA1. We obtained the averaged single-cell time course of PHLDA1 expression and phosphorylation of ErbB2, ERK, and Akt using immunofluorescence-based imaging cytometry (Fig. 3, A and B). These data are consistent with mRNA expression and Western blotting data obtained from bulk cell experiments (Fig. S8). Cell population average behaviors of the same molecules in the PHLDA1 knockdown condition are also consistent with the Western blotting data (Figs. 1G and 3C and Fig. S4). Regardless of the large standard deviation (S.D.) of signal intensities in each cell population (because these values are dependent on sample size; in our experiments >1,500 cells in each condition), statistical analysis supported the hypothesis that the amount of phospho-ErbB2, phospho-ERK, and phospho-Akt in control and PHLDA1 knockdown conditions are statistically different (p value <1.0 × 10−20, Welch’s statistical test). The coefficient of variation (CV) is one of the indexes for evaluating cell-to-cell variability in a population. The CV of PHLDA1 decreased over time while its expression is increased (Fig. 3D). Knockdown of PHLDA1 increased the CV of phospho-ErbB2, although it did not significantly affect those of phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK at 180 min after HRG stimulation (Fig. 3E). Thus, elimination of PHLDA1 from the ErbB network resulted in increased cell-to-cell variation in phospho-ErbB2. Mean expression levels of PHLDA1 and phospho-ErbB2 per cell at each time point (see “Mean expression level per cell” under “Experimental procedures” for details) (Fig. 3F) indicated that the mean expression level of PHLDA1 increased along with decreased phospho-ErbB2 levels (rank correlation = −0.82) indicating that PHLDA1 negatively affects the phosphorylation of ErbB2 after HRG stimulation. However, despite these data, in individual cells the PHLDA1 expression level positively correlated with the phospho-ErbB2 expression level at each time point (Fig. 3, G and H). We confirmed that this positive correlation was not due to an artificial effect of the phosphorylated ErbB2-specific antibody (Fig. S9). To explain this discrepancy, we therefore hypothesized that PHLDA1 might not directly inhibit receptor phosphorylation but instead might inhibit other steps in the ErbB receptor activation processes, for example, formation of receptor dimers and oligomers. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the existence of higher-order ErbB receptor oligomers (30Huang G.C. Ouyang X. Epstein R.J.

Moreover, an earlier study suggested that tetramer formation between ErbB2 and ErbB3 is functionally important for potent signal transduction (34Zhang X. Meng J. Wang Z.-Y. A switch role of Src in the biphasic EGF signaling of ER-negative breast cancer cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 (22927910): e4161310.1371/journal.pone.0041613Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further examined the effect of PHLDA1 on activation of ErbB receptors, including higher-order oligomer formation. To identify the inhibitory mode of PHLDA1 in HRG-induced ErbB receptor activation processes, we constructed six simple mathematical models to explore network topology that can explain our experimental data. For simplification purposes, the models are described in a way such that phosphorylated ErbB heterodimers and tetramers directly induce PHLDA1 expression. In the model, we considered that the main population of HRG-binding ErbB receptors in MCF-7 cells, termed HRGR, is ErbB3, because its amount is about 70 times higher than ErbB4 (25Aguilar Z. Akita R.W. Finn R.S. Ramos B.L. Pegram M.D. Kabbinavar F.F. Pietras R.J. Pisacane P. Sliwkowski M.X. Slamon D.J.

Based on an earlier study (34Zhang X. Meng J. Wang Z.-Y. A switch role of Src in the biphasic EGF signaling of ER-negative breast cancer cells.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 (22927910): e4161310.1371/journal.pone.0041613Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the models include the formation of tetramers composed of the orphan receptor ErbB2 and HRGR complexes (Fig. 4A). The ErbB receptor activation scheme is described as follows: 1) formation of inactive heterodimers between ErbB2 and HRGR prior to HRG stimulus; 2) binding of HRG to HRGR, both monomers and heterodimers; 3) formation of heterodimers between ErbB2 and HRG-bound HRGR (ErbB2/HRGR); 4) phosphorylation of ErbB2/HRGR; and 5) formation of tetramers consisting of two phosphorylated ErbB2/HRGR. For the PHLDA1-mediated regulation, six types of inhibitory modes are considered as follows: model M0, no inhibition from PHLDA1 to HRGR activation; model M1, inhibition of the 1st and 3rd reaction steps; model M2, inhibition of the 4th reaction step; model M3, inhibition of the 5th reaction step; model M4, inhibition of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th reaction steps; and model M5, inhibition of the 1st, 3rd, and 4th reaction steps (Fig. 4A, see Tables S1 to S5, and supporting Methods for details of the models). We performed stochastic simulation of each model using experimentally obtained CVs of ErbB2, ErbB3, and PHLDA1 expression (Fig. 3D). The averaged dynamics of phospho-ErbB2 and PHLDA1 (Figs. 3B and 4B), in addition to time courses of CVs of ErbB2, ErbB3, and PHLDA1 proteins (Figs. 3D and 4C) in all models and the experimental data, were consistent with each other. However, model M3 was excluded from the network candidates because the peak intensities of phosphorylated ErbB2 were down-regulated in models M1, M2, M4, and M5 relative to PHLDA1, which is consistent with the data, but not in model M3 (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2771500314,"Introduction Wildlife is an important source of protein for many people in developing countries. Yet wildlife depletion due to overexploitation is common throughout the humid tropics and its effect on protein security, especially for vulnerable households, is poorly understood. This is problematic for both sustainable rural development and conservation management. Methods This study investigates a key dimension of protein security in a cash-crop farming community living in a wildlife-depleted farm-forest landscape in SW Ghana, a region where protein–energy malnutrition persists. Specifically, we monitored protein sufficiency, defined as whether consumption met daily requirements, as benchmarked by recommended daily allowance (RDA). We focus on whether more vulnerable households were less likely to be able to meet their protein needs, where vulnerability was defined by wealth, agricultural season and gender of the household head. Our central hypothesis was: (a) vulnerable households are less likely to consume sufficient protein. In the context that most plant proteins were home-produced, so likely relatively accessible to all households, while most animal proteins were purchased, so likely less accessible to vulnerable households, we tested two further hypotheses: (b) vulnerable households depend more on plant protein to cover their protein needs; and (c) vulnerable households are less likely to earn sufficient cash income to meet their protein needs through purchased animal sources. Results Between 14% and 60% of households (depending on plant protein content assumptions) consumed less than the RDA for protein, but neither protein consumption nor protein sufficiency co-varied with household vulnerability. Fish, livestock and food crops comprised 85% of total protein intake and strongly affected protein sufficiency. However, bushmeat remained an important protein source (15% of total consumption), especially during the post-harvest season when it averaged 26% of total protein consumption. Across the year, 89% of households experienced at least one occasion when they had insufficient income to cover their protein needs through animal protein purchases. The extent of this income shortage was highest during the lean season and among poorer households. Conclusions These findings indicate that despite wildlife depletion, bushmeat continues to make a substantial contribution to protein consumption, especially during the agricultural lean season. Income shortages among farmers limit their ability to purchase bushmeat or its substitutes, suggesting that wildlife depletion may cause malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2774956645,"The ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 family of proteins is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Their involvement in humoral and cellular immune responses is emerging through studies in drosophila and humans. In humans, a select group of 14-3-3 isoforms are antigenic; however the determinants of their antigenicity are not known. Here, we show that although mammalian 14-3-3 proteins are mostly conserved, subtle differences between their isoforms may give rise to their antigenicity. We observed syntenic relations among all the isoforms of 14-3-3 for mammals, but not with that of birds or amphibians. However, the parasitic 14-3-3 isoforms, which have known antigenic properties, show unique sequence, structure and evolution compared to the human 14-3-3. Moreover we report, for the first time the existence of a bacterial 14-3-3 protein. Contrary to the parasitic isoforms, both bacterial and yeast 14-3-3 exhibited significant homology with mammalian 14-3-3 in protein sequence as well as structure. Furthermore, a human 14-3-3 inhibitor caused significant killing of Candida albicans, which could be due to the inhibition of the structurally similar yeast homologue of 14-3-3, BMH, which is essential for its life cycle. Overall, our bioinformatic analysis combined with the demonstration of a novel antifungal role of a peptide inhibitor of human 14-3-3 indicates that the sequences and structural similarities between the mammalian, bacterial and fungal proteins are likely determinants of the antigenic nature of these proteins. Further, we propose that molecular mimicry triggered by microbial infections with either yeast or bacteria may contribute to the antigenic role of human 14-3-3."

Although deletion of NEP exacerbates intestinal inflammation in animal models, its role in ulcerative colitis (UC) is not well explored. Herein, we aimed to demonstrate changes in NEP and associated neuropeptides at the same time in colonic tissue. 72 patients with UC and 27 control patients were included. Patients’ demographic data and laboratory findings, five biopsy samples from active colitis sites and five samples from uninvolved mucosa were collected. Substance P (SP), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were extracted from freshly frozen tissues and measured using ELISA. Levels of NEP expression were determined using immunohistochemistry and immunoreactivity scores were calculated. GEBOES grading system was also used. We demonstrated a profound loss (69.4%) of NEP expression in UC, whereas all healthy controls had NEP expression. Patients with UC had lower neuronal SP; however non-neuronal SP remained similar. UC patients had also lower neuronal and non-neuronal VIP levels. CGRP were low in general and no significant changes were observed. Additionally, CRP positive patients with UC had higher rates of NEP loss (80% vs 51.9%) and lower SP levels when compared with CRP negative patients with UC. Concurrent decreases in SP and VIP with profound loss of NEP expression observed in UC is likely to be one of the factors in pathogenesis. Further studies are required to define the role of neuropeptides and NEP in UC."
https://openalex.org/W2772054142,"Purpose As result of the current demographic changes, osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures are becoming an increasing social and economic burden. In this experimental study, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), was evaluated as a treatment option for the improvement of osteoporotic fracture healing. Methods A well-established fracture model in the metaphyseal tibia in the osteoporotic rat was used. 132 animals were divided into 11 groups, with 12 animals each, consisting of one sham-operated group and 10 ovariectomized (osteoporotic) groups, of which 9 received ESWT treatment. Different energy flux intensities (0.15 mJ/mm2, 0.35 mJ/mm2, or 0.55 mJ/mm2) as well as different numbers of ESWT applications (once, three times, or five times throughout the 35-day healing period) were applied to the osteoporotic fractures. Fracture healing was investigated quantitatively and qualitatively using micro-CT imaging, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, histomorphometric analysis and biomechanical analysis. Results The results of this study show a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the osteoporotic fracture healing under low-energy (energy flux intensity: 0,15 mJ/mm2) ESWT and with fewer treatment applications per healing period. Conclusion In conclusion, low-energy ESWT seems to exhibit a beneficial effect on the healing of osteoporotic fractures, leading to improved biomechanical properties, enhanced callus-quantity and -quality, and an increase in the expression of bone specific transcription factors. The results suggest that low-energy ESWT, as main treatment or as adjunctive treatment in addition to a surgical intervention, may prove to be an effective, simple to use, and cost-efficient option for the qualitative and quantitative improvement of osteoporotic fracture healing."
https://openalex.org/W2774746584,"Candida albicans is a virulent human opportunistic pathogen. It evades innate immune surveillance by masking an immunogenic cell wall polysaccharide, β-glucan, from recognition by the immunoreceptor Dectin-1. Glucan unmasking by the antifungal drug caspofungin leads to changes in the nanostructure of glucan exposure accessible to Dectin-1. The physical mechanism that regulates glucan exposure is poorly understood, but it controls the nanobiology of fungal pathogen recognition. We created computational models to simulate hypothetical physical processes of unmasking glucan in a biologically realistic distribution of cell wall glucan fibrils. We tested the predicted glucan exposure nanostructural features arising from these models against experimentally measured values. A completely spatially random unmasking process, reflective of random environmental damage to the cell wall, cannot account for experimental observations of glucan unmasking. However, the introduction of partially edge biased unmasking processes, consistent with an unmasking contribution from active, local remodeling at glucan exposure sites, produces markedly more accurate predictions of experimentally observed glucan nanoexposures in untreated and caspofungin-treated yeast. These findings suggest a model of glucan unmasking wherein cell wall remodeling processes in the local nanoscale neighborhood of glucan exposure sites are an important contributor to the physical process of drug-induced glucan unmasking in C. albicans."

In the ACOS cohort, the aHRs for depression were 1.70 (95% CI = 1.51-1.93) and 1.84 (95% CI = 1.55-2.19) in patients without inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and oral steroids (OSs) use, respectively. Moreover, the aHRs for the risk of depression were 1.16 (95% CI = 0.95-1.41) and 1.12 (95% CI = 0.96-1.29) in patients with ICSs and OSs use, respectively.The risk of depression is higher in ACOS patients, even in those without comorbidities or in young adults. The events of the depression were not significant difference in patients receiving the ICSs/OSs between the ACOS and the non-ACOS cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2773821102,"Burn injury detrimentally affects the myocardium, primarily due to over-activation of β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR). Autopsy reports from our institution reveal that patients often suffer from right ventricle (RV) failure. Since burn injury affects β-AR signaling in the left ventricle (LV), we proposed that β-AR signaling may also be altered in the RV. A rodent model with a scald burn of 60% of the total body surface area was used to test this hypothesis. Ventricles were isolated 7 days post-burn. We examined the expression of β-ARs via Western blotting and the mRNA expression of downstream signaling proteins via qRT-PCR. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and protein kinase A (PKA) activity were measured in membrane and cytosolic fractions, respectively, using enzyme immunoassay kits. β1-AR protein expression was significantly increased in the RV following burn injury compared to non-burned RV but not in the LV (p = 0.0022). In contrast, β2-AR expression was unaltered among the groups while Gαi expression was significantly higher in the LV post-burn (p = 0.023). B-arrestin-1 and G-protein coupled receptor kinase-2 mRNA expression were significantly increased in the left ventricle post-burn (p = 0.001, p<0.0001, respectively). cAMP production and PKA activity were significantly lower in the LV post-burn (p = 0.0063, 0.0042, respectively). These data indicate that burn injury affects the β-AR signaling pathway in the RV independently of the LV. Additionally, non-canonical β-AR signaling may be activated in the RV as cAMP production and PKA activity were unchanged despite changes in β1-AR protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2771085304,"Unlike the fibroblast-like cells formed upon monolayer culture of human mesenchymal stem cells, the natural stem cell niche of the bone marrow and other types of tissues favours the formation of 3-dimensional (3D) cell clusters. The structuring and biological activity of these clusters are regulated by the contacts established by cells with both the basement membrane and neighbour cells and results in their asymmetric division and the consequent maintenance of both a stem population and a committed progeny. The present work demonstrates the potential of a synthetic substrate to mimic the stem cell niche in vitro. The side amino groups of a linear Poly-L-lysine were modified with hyperbranched poly-(ϵ-lysine) peptides, named as dendrons, tethered with the laminin-mimicking sequence, YIGSR. These dendrons presented the YIGSR sequence at the uppermost molecular branching ensuring a controlled spacing of the bioligand. When used to coat the surface of tissue culture plates in a serum-free in vitro cell culture system, the substrate was able to mimic the most relevant features of the basement membrane of the stem cell niche, i.e. the mesh structure of Collagen Type IV and the availability of laminin bioligands relevant to integrin biorecognition. The substrate biomimetic properties were tested for their ability to support the formation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) 3D spheroids similar to those observed in the natural stem cell niches and their ability to maintain stem cell pluripotency markers. These features were related to the substrate-specific expression and localisation of (i) cell adhesion receptors (i.e. β-integrin and N-cadherin), (ii) transcription factors of pluripotency markers and cytoskeleton protein and (iii) regulators of cell migration throughout cell culture passages 2 to 4. The results clearly demonstrate the formation of 3D spheroids starting from the asymmetric division of substrate-adhering spread cells, the clustering of relevant integrins and the expression of specific intracellular pathways controlling cytoskeleton formation suggesting their potential use as a substrate for the handling of stem cells prior to transplantation procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2774776988,"Background The presence of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) is related to poor long-term outcomes in stroke patients. However, the long-term outcome is unknown in patients with both large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) and WMH. Methods We investigated the impact of WMH on long-term outcome in patients with LAA. Consecutive patients in a prospective stroke registry were included. Patients were followed for a median of 7.7 years (interquartile range, 5.6–9.7). The degree of WMH was assessed by Fazekas grade on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Total WMH burden was calculated by summation of Fazekas scores in periventricular and deep white matter. Severe WMH was defined as total burden score ≥ 3. Results Among 2529 patients, 639 patients (25.3%) were classified with the LAA subtype. After applying exclusion criteria, the data from 538 patients were analyzed. The mean patient age was 65.7 ± 10.3 years. Severe WMHs were found in 243 patients (45.2%). During follow-up, 200 patients (37.2%) died. Cox regression analysis showed that LAA patients with severe WMH had a 1.50-fold (95% CI, 1.12–2.00, p = 0.007) higher death rate compared to those without. In the older age group (≥65 years), Cox regression revealed that patients with severe WMH had a 1.75-fold (95% CI, 1.15–2.65, p = 0.008) higher 5-year death rate, whereas the younger age group did not have this association. Conclusion The degree of WMH might be a surrogate marker for long-term outcome in patients with LAA. Atherosclerotic burdens in both small and large arteries might impact long-term prognosis in ischemic stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W2775655618,"Allostery is a regulatory mechanism in proteins where an effector molecule binds distal from an active site to modulate its activity. Allosteric signaling may occur via a continuous path of residues linking the active and allosteric sites, which has been suggested by large conformational changes evident in crystal structures. An alternate possibility is that the signal occurs in the realm of ensemble dynamics via an energy landscape change. While the latter was first proposed on theoretical grounds, increasing evidence suggests that such a control mechanism is plausible. A major difficulty for testing the two methods is the ability to definitively determine that a residue is directly involved in allosteric signal transduction. Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) is a method that has been successful at predicting pathways, and experimental tests involving mutagenesis or domain substitution provide the best available evidence of signaling pathways. However, ascertaining energetic pathways which need not be contiguous is far more difficult. To date, simple estimates of the statistical significance of a pathway in a protein remain to be established. The focus of this work is to estimate such benchmarks for the statistical significance of contiguous pathways for the null model of selecting residues at random. We found that when 20% of residues in proteins are randomly selected, contiguous pathways at the 6 Å cutoff level were found with success rates of 51% in PDZ, 30% in p53, and 3% in MutS. The results suggest that the significance of pathways may have system specific factors involved. Furthermore, the possible existence of false positives for contiguous pathways implies that signaling could be occurring via alternate routes including those consistent with the energetic landscape model."
https://openalex.org/W2772180661,"In recent decades, various kinds of remote sensing-based drought indexes have been proposed and widely used in the field of drought monitoring. However, the drought-related software and platform development lag behind the theoretical research. The current drought monitoring systems focus mainly on information management and publishing, and cannot implement professional drought monitoring or parameter inversion modelling, especially the models based on multi-dimensional feature space. In view of the above problems, this paper aims at fixing this gap with a component-based system named RSDMS to facilitate the application of drought monitoring by remote sensing. The system is designed and developed based on Component Object Model (COM) to ensure the flexibility and extendibility of modules. RSDMS realizes general image-related functions such as data management, image display, spatial reference management, image processing and analysis, and further provides drought monitoring and evaluation functions based on internal and external models. Finally, China's Ningxia region is selected as the study area to validate the performance of RSDMS. The experimental results show that RSDMS provide an efficient and scalable support to agricultural drought monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2774925933,"Background and purpose Hydrocephalus is a frequent complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Few studies investigated the association between laboratory parameters and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. This study aimed to investigate the variations of laboratory parameters after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We also attempted to identify predictive laboratory parameters for shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. Methods Multiple imputation was performed to fill the missing laboratory data using Bayesian methods in SPSS. We used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to calculate hazard ratios for shunt-dependent hydrocephalus based on clinical and laboratory factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the laboratory risk values predicting shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. Results We included 181 participants with a mean age of 54.4 years. Higher sodium (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.07; p = 0.005), lower potassium, and higher glucose levels were associated with higher shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the areas under the curve of sodium, potassium, and glucose were 0.649 (cutoff value, 142.75 mEq/L), 0.609 (cutoff value, 3.04 mmol/L), and 0.664 (cutoff value, 140.51 mg/dL), respectively. Conclusions Despite the exploratory nature of this study, we found that higher sodium, lower potassium, and higher glucose levels were predictive values for shunt-dependent hydrocephalus from postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD 12–16 after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Strict correction of electrolyte imbalance seems necessary to reduce shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. Further large studies are warranted to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2774968719,"Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) is a key regulator of actin-related morphogenetic processes including axon guidance, where it functions downstream of several guidance receptors. While the long C-terminal domain (CTD) of Abl is required for function, its role is poorly understood. Here, a battery of mutants of Drosophila Abl was created that systematically deleted large segments of the CTD from Abl or added them back to the N-terminus alone. The functionality of these Abl transgenes was assessed through rescue of axon guidance defects and adult lethality in Abl loss-of-function, as well as through gain-of-function effects in sensitized slit or frazzled backgrounds that perturb midline guidance in the Drosophila embryonic nerve cord. Two regions of the CTD play important and distinct roles, but additive effects for other regions were also detected. The first quarter of the CTD, including a conserved PxxP motif and its surrounding sequence, regulates Abl function while the third quarter localizes Abl to axons. These regions feature long stretches of intrinsically disordered sequence typically found in hub proteins and are associated with diverse protein-protein interactions. Thus, the CTD of Abl appears to use these disordered regions to establish a variety of different signaling complexes required during formation of axon tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2774051937,"When dissimilar images are presented one to each eye, we do not see both images; rather, we see one at a time, alternating unpredictably. This is called binocular rivalry, and it has recently been used to study brain processes that correlate with visual consciousness, because perception changes without any change in the sensory input. Such studies have used various types of images, but the most popular have been gratings: sets of bright and dark lines of orthogonal orientations presented one to each eye. We studied whether using cardinal rival gratings (vertical, 0°, and horizontal, 90°) versus oblique rival gratings (left-oblique, –45°, and right-oblique, 45°) influences early neural correlates of visual consciousness, because of the oblique effect: the tendency for visual performance to be greater for cardinal gratings than for oblique gratings. Participants viewed rival gratings and pressed keys indicating which of the two gratings they perceived, was dominant. Next, we changed one of the gratings to match the grating shown to the other eye, yielding binocular fusion. Participants perceived the rivalry-to-fusion change to the dominant grating and not to the other, suppressed grating. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we found neural correlates of visual consciousness at the P1 for both sets of gratings, as well as at the P1-N1 for oblique gratings, and we found a neural correlate of the oblique effect at the N1, but only for perceived changes. These results show that the P1 is the earliest neural activity associated with visual consciousness and that visual consciousness might be necessary to elicit the oblique effect."
https://openalex.org/W2775125805,"Class II chaperonins are essential multisubunit complexes that aid the folding of nonnative proteins in the cytosol of archaea and eukarya. They use energy derived from ATP to drive a series of structural rearrangements that enable polypeptides to fold within their central cavity. These events are regulated by an elaborate allosteric mechanism in need of elucidation. We employed mutagenesis and experimental analysis in concert with in silico molecular dynamics simulations and interface-binding energy calculations to investigate the class II chaperonin from Thermoplasma acidophilum. Here we describe the effects on the asymmetric allosteric mechanism and on hetero-oligomeric complex formation in a panel of mutants in the ATP-binding pocket of the α and β subunits. Our observations reveal a potential model for a nonconcerted folding mechanism optimized for protecting and refolding a range of nonnative substrates under different environmental conditions, starting to unravel the role of subunit heterogeneity in this folding machine and establishing important links with the behavior of the most complex eukaryotic chaperonins.-Shoemark, D.
