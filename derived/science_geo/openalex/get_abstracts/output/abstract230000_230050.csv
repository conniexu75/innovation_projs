https://openalex.org/W1972867200,"We report on a microfluidic particle-separation device that makes use of the asymmetric bifurcation of laminar flow around obstacles. A particle chooses its path deterministically on the basis of its size. All particles of a given size follow equivalent migration paths, leading to high resolution. The microspheres of 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 micrometers that were used to characterize the device were sorted in 40seconds with a resolution of ∼10nanometers, which was better than the time and resolution of conventional flow techniques. Bacterial artificial chromosomes could be separated in 10 minutes with a resolution of ∼12%."
https://openalex.org/W2028594041,"Activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype glutamate receptors (NMDARs) is required for long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory synaptic transmission at hippocampal CA1 synapses, the proposed cellular substrates of learning and memory. However, little is known about how activation of NMDARs leads to these two opposing forms of synaptic plasticity. Using hippocampal slice preparations, we showed that selectively blocking NMDARs that contain the NR2B subunit abolishes the induction of LTD but not LTP. In contrast, preferential inhibition of NR2A-containing NMDARs prevents the induction of LTP without affecting LTD production. These results demonstrate that distinct NMDAR subunits are critical factors that determine the polarity of synaptic plasticity."

Both microbial and apoptotic cells are delivered on a common route from phagosomes to lysosomes for degradation. Here, we found that activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway by bacteria, but not apoptotic cells, regulated phagocytosis at multiple steps including internalization and phagosome maturation. Phagocytosis of bacteria was impaired in the absence of TLR signaling. Two modes of phagosome maturation were observed, constitutive and inducible; their differential engagement depended on the ability of the cargo to trigger TLR signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1996147852,"Seasonal field observations show that the North Sea, a Northern European shelf sea, is highly efficient in pumping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the North Atlantic Ocean. The bottom topography–controlled stratification separates production and respiration processes in the North Sea, causing a carbon dioxide increase in the subsurface layer that is ultimately exported to the North Atlantic Ocean. Globally extrapolated, the net uptake of carbon dioxide by coastal and marginal seas is about 20% of the world ocean's uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, thus enhancing substantially the open ocean carbon dioxide storage."
https://openalex.org/W1993076246,"Although the ability of engrafted stem cells to regenerate tissue has received much attention, the molecular mechanisms controlling regeneration are poorly understood. In the Drosophila male germline, local activation of the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) pathway maintains stem cells; germline stem cells lacking Jak-STAT signaling differentiate into spermatogonia without self-renewal. By conditionally manipulating Jak-STAT signaling, we find that spermatogonia that have initiated differentiation and are undergoing limited mitotic (transit-amplifying) divisions can repopulate the niche and revert to stem cell identity. Thus, in the appropriate microenvironment, transit-amplifying cells dedifferentiate, becoming functional stem cells during tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2013740123,"Stable zeolites that have larger pore apertures and a three-dimensional pore topology are of interest because they could be used to adsorb larger molecules, particularly for application in oil refining. Several large-pore zeolitic materials with channels formed by openings of more than 12 rings are known, but all of them have a one-dimensional channel system that limits their use in catalysis. We report the synthesis and some characterizations of IM-12, a thermally stable germanium-containing zeolite that contains the first two-dimensional channel system with extra-large pores formed by 14- and 12-ring channels."
https://openalex.org/W2089849935,Urban and industrial air pollution can cause elevated heritable mutation rates in birds and rodents. The relative importance of airborne particulate matter versus gas-phase substances in causing these genetic effects under ambient conditions has been unclear. Here we show that high-efficiency particulate-air (HEPA) filtration of ambient air significantly reduced heritable mutation rates at repetitive DNA loci in laboratory mice housed outdoors near a major highway and two integrated steel mills. These findings implicate exposure to airborne particulate matter as a principal factor contributing to elevated mutation rates in sentinel mice and add to accumulating evidence that air pollution may pose genetic risks to humans and wildlife.

https://openalex.org/W2009543130,State-resolved gas-surface reactivity measurements revealed that vibrational excitation of ν 3 (the antisymmetric C-H stretch) activates methane dissociation more efficiently than does translational energy. Methane molecules in the vibrational ground state require 45 kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) of translational energy to attain the same reactivity enhancement provided by 36 kJ/mol of ν 3 excitation. This result contradicts a key assumption underlying statistical theories of gas-surface reactivity and provides direct experimental evidence of the central role that vibrational energy can play in activating gas-surface reactions.
https://openalex.org/W2076691464,"Two types of consolidated memory have been described in Drosophila , anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), a shorter-lived form, and stabilized long-term memory (LTM). Until now, it has been thought that ARM and LTM coexist. On the contrary, we show that LTM formation leads to the extinction of ARM. Flies devoid of mushroom body vertical lobes cannot form LTM, but spaced conditioning can still erase their ARM, resulting in a remarkable situation: The more these flies are trained, the less they remember. We propose that ARM acts as a gating mechanism that ensures that LTM is formed only after repetitive and spaced training."
https://openalex.org/W2172253900,"The Red Queen hypothesis posits that sex has evolved in response to the shifting adaptive landscape generated by the evolution of interacting species. Previous studies supporting the Red Queen hypothesis have considered a narrow region of parameter space and only a subset of ecological and genetic interactions. Here, we develop a population genetics model that circumscribes a broad array of ecological and genetic interactions among species and derive the first general analytical conditions for the impact of species interactions on the evolution of sex. Our results show that species interactions typically select against sex. We conclude that, although the Red Queen favors sex under certain circumstances, it alone does not account for the ubiquity of sex."
https://openalex.org/W1976951513,"The prion protein (PrP) is a Cu2+ binding cell surface glycoprotein that can misfold into a β-sheet-rich conformation to cause prion diseases. The majority of copper binding studies have concentrated on the octarepeat region of PrP. However, using a range of spectroscopic techniques, we show that copper binds preferentially to an unstructured region of PrP between residues 90 and 115, outside of the octarepeat domain. Comparison of recombinant PrP with PrP-(91–115) indicates that this prion fragment is a good model for Cu2+ binding to the full-length protein. In contrast to previous reports we show that Cu2+ binds to this region of PrP with a nanomolar dissociation constant. NMR and EPR spectroscopy indicate a square-planar or square-pyramidal Cu2+ coordination utilizing histidine residues. Studies with PrP analogues show that the high affinity site requires both His96 and His111 as Cu2+ ligands, rather than a complex centered on His96 as has been previously suggested. Our circular dichroism studies indicate a loss of irregular structure on copper coordination with an increase in β-sheet conformation. It has been shown that this unstructured region, between residues 90 and 120, is vital for prion propagation and different strains of prion disease have been linked with copper binding. The role of Cu2+ in prion misfolding and disease must now be re-evaluated in the light of these findings.

The role of Cu2+ in prion misfolding and disease must now be re-evaluated in the light of these findings. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that include Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease in humans, mad cow disease in cattle, and scrapie in sheep. The infectious agent in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is a proteinous infectious particle or “prion,” which is devoid of nucleic acid. It is believed that these spongiform encephalopathies are caused by the accumulation of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular isoform of prion protein; PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of prion protein; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser exchange spectroscopy. 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular isoform of prion protein; PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of prion protein; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser exchange spectroscopy. This misfolded protein is rich in β-sheet and is designated the scrapie isoform, PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Google Scholar, 2Horwich A.L. Weissman J.S.

Whereas normal physiological function of the prion protein is yet to be determined, the ability of PrPC to bind Cu2+in vivo and in vitro suggests a role in copper homeostasis (4Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Google Scholar, 5Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Google Scholar). Indeed, elevated copper levels promote endocytosis of PrPC suggesting that PrP could transport copper into the cell (6Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Google Scholar, 7Perera W.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Google Scholar). Recent data has shown that PrPC expression increased the binding of copper to the outer plasma cell membrane and increases antioxidant enzyme activities (8Rachidi W. Vilette D. Guiraud P. Arlotto M. Riondel J. Laude H. Lehmann S. Favier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9064-9072Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is suggested that PrPC plays a protective role by binding Cu2+ in a redox inactive state (9Wong B.S. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Petersen R.B. Jones I.M. Gambetti P. Brown D.R. Sy M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 249-252Google Scholar, 10Shiraishi N. Ohta Y. Nishikimi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267Google Scholar). An enzymatic role for copper-PrP is also proposed as it exhibits superoxide dismutase activity (11Brown D.R. Wong B.S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Google Scholar, 12Wong B.S. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 136-139Google Scholar, 13Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem.

The cellular prion protein is a cell surface glycoprotein tethered via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor at the C terminus. There are now a number of NMR solution structures of mammalian PrPs in the copper-free form (15Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Google Scholar, 16James T.L. Liu H. Ulyanov N.B. Farr-Jones S. Zhang H. Donne D.G. Kaneko K. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 145-150Google Scholar). A crystal structure of PrPC has also been published. The structure is dimeric involving domain swapping between monomeric forms (19Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Google Scholar). Structurally, PrPC contains two distinct regions. In the absence of Cu2+, the N-terminal domain, residues 23–120, is unstructured (17Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Google Scholar) and has a high degree of main chain flexibility in the absence of copper (20Viles J.H. Donne D. Kroon G. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2743-2753Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal domain, residues 121–231, is largely α-helical (15Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Google Scholar). Residues 60–91 consist of an octapeptide sequence, PHGGGWGQ, which is repeated four times. It is this unstructured region that binds four Cu2+ ions cooperatively (5Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Google Scholar). Although binding of a fifth Cu2+ ion to PrP has been noted (4Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Google Scholar, 21Kramer M.L. Kratzin H.D. Schmidt B. Romer A. Windl O. Liemann S. Hornemann S. Kretzschmar H. J.

A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Google Scholar), as well as Cu2+ coordination to a C-terminal fragment of PrP (23Brown D.R. Guantieri V. Grasso G. Impellizzeri G. Pappalardo G. Rizzarelli E. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 133-143Google Scholar). The majority of studies have concentrated on characterizing the four copper ions binding to the octarepeat region of PrP. Recent publications on copper binding to the octarepeats include circular dichroism (CD) studies (24Garnett A.P. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6795-6802Google Scholar), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) studies (25Aronoff-Spencer E. Burns C.S. Avdievich N.I. Gerfen G.J. Peisach J. Antholine W.E. Ball H.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13760-13771Google Scholar), and a crystallographic study (26Burns C.S. Aronoff-Spencer E. Dunham C.M. Lario P. Avdievich N.I. Antholine W.E. Olmstead M.M. Vrielink A. Gerfen G.J. Peisach J. Scott W.G. Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3991-4001Google Scholar). Dissociation constants for Cu2+ binding to the octarepeat region have been reported to be between 1 nm and 10 μm (21Kramer M.L. Kratzin H.D. Schmidt B. Romer A. Windl O. Liemann S. Hornemann S. Kretzschmar H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16711-16719Google Scholar, 24Garnett A.P. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6795-6802Google Scholar) although others have suggested a much higher affinity with a Kd in the femtomolar range (22Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Google Scholar). Studies with transgenic mice have shown that mice expressing a truncated version of PrP with the octarepeat region removed are still susceptible to prion infection (27Flechsig E. Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Raeber A.J. Fischer M. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Neuron. 2000; 27: 399-408Google Scholar). This has meant that a direct link between copper and prion disease was thought to be unlikely. However, recent studies suggest copper can bind to the unstructured domain of PrP outside of the octarepeat region with a femtomolar dissociation constant (22Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Google Scholar). Residues His111 and/or His96 have been implicated in this binding (22Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Google Scholar, 28Hasnain S.S. Murphy L.M. Strange R.W. Grossmann J.G. Clarke A.R. Jackson G.S. Collinge J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 467-473Google Scholar, 29Burns C.S. Aronoff-Spencer E. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Antholine W.E. Gerfen G.J. Peisach J. Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 44: 6794-6803Google Scholar). Interestingly, the unstructured region between the N-terminal domain and the structured C-terminal domain is considered to be essential for amyloid formation and infectivity in prion disease (30Muramoto T. Scott M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15457-15462Google Scholar, 31Fischer M. Rulicke T. Raeber A. Sailer A. Moser M. Oesch B. Brandner S. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C.

Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Google Scholar). Residues in this unstructured region are thought to play a pivotal role in the misfolding of PrPC into the β-sheet-rich conformation (34Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Verga L. Giaccone G. Sarma R. Gorevic P. Ghetti B. Passerini F. Ghibaudi E. Forloni G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Fragione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9678-9682Google Scholar). The presence of a high affinity Cu2+ site within the region 90–126 should have profound implications for the copper loaded structure in this region of PrPC.Cu2+ can convert the cellular prion protein into a protease-resistant species (35Quaglio E. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11432-11438Google Scholar). Copper induced structuring in this region might also explain the different protease resistance profiles of PrP observed with and without the presence of Cu2+ (36Qin K. Yang D.S. Yang Y. Chishti M.A. Meng L.J. Kretzschmar H.A. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Westaway D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19121-19131Google Scholar), these protease profiles correspond to similar profiles seen in different strains of prion disease (37Wadsworth J.D. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Google Scholar). In addition, a fragment from this unstructured region, PrP-(106–126), contains a hydrophobic cluster of residues and has been shown to be neurotoxic in both the soluble and fibrillar states (33Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Google Scholar, 38Florio T. Paludi D. Villa V. Principe D.R. Corsaro A. Millo E. Damonte G. A'rrigo C. Russo C. Schettini G. Aceto A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 62-72Google Scholar). Copper binding to this peptide has been linked with its toxicity (39Jobling M.F. Huang X. Stewart L.R. Barnham K.J. Curtain C. Volitakis I. Perugini M. White A.R. Cherny R.A. Masters C.L. Barrow C.J. Collins S.J. Bush A.I. Cappai R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8073-8084Google Scholar). Metal imbalances are a feature of prion disease (40Thackray A.M. Knight R. Haswell S.J. Bujdoso R. Brown D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 253-258Google Scholar) and metal binding to the prion protein is altered in human prion disease (41Wong B.S. Chen S.G. Colucci M. Xie Z. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1400-1408Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that a loss of PrP function in copper transport and homeostasis may well be a feature of prion disease. Recent studies have shown that scrapie infection modulates copper content at a cellular level (42Rachidi W. Mange A. Senator A. Guiraud P. Riondel J. Benboubetra M. Favier A. Lehmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14595-14598Google Scholar) and that copper-catalyzed redox damage of PrP is implicated in prion disease (43Requena J.R. Groth D. Legname G. Stadtman E.R. Prusiner S.B. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7170-7175Google Scholar, 44Ruiz F.H. Silva E. Inestrosa N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 491-495Google Scholar). Elimination of the copper binding octarepeat region has been shown to slow disease progression (27Flechsig E. Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Raeber A.J. Fischer M. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Neuron. 2000; 27: 399-408Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent study shows that disease progression in infected mice is slowed with the use of copper specific chelation therapy (45Sigurdsson E.M. Brown D.R. Alim M.A. Scholtzova H. Carp R. Meeker H.C. Prelli F. Frangione B. Wisniewski T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46199-46202Google Scholar). A mutant form of PrP associated with familial prion disease contains nine additional octarepeats and fails to undergo copper-mediated endocytosis (7Perera W.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Google Scholar). The role of copper in the normal function of PrP, as well as in prion diseases, has been the subject of a number of reviews (46Brown D.R. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 55: 165-173Google Scholar, 47Brown D.R. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 85-90Google Scholar, 48Lehmann S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 187-192Google Scholar, 49Vassallo N. Herms J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 538-544Google Scholar, 50Millhauser G.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 79-85Google Scholar). The aim of this study is to characterize the binding of Cu2+ to the unstructured region of PrP outside of the octarepeats. This region is of particular interest because it is essential for amyloidogenesis, and metal occupancy confers strain type in disease. There are some inconsistencies in the literature that we hope to resolve. For example, the coordinating ligands of this so-called fifth Cu2+ binding site are disputed with an EPR study, suggesting only His96 as the locus for Cu2+ coordination (29Burns C.S. Aronoff-Spencer E. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Antholine W.E. Gerfen G.J. Peisach J. Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 44: 6794-6803Google Scholar), whereas an EXAFS study suggested His111, Met112, and His96 as coordinating ligands (28Hasnain S.S. Murphy L.M. Strange R.W. Grossmann J.G. Clarke A.R. Jackson G.S. Collinge J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 467-473Google Scholar). In addition, the reported affinities for Cu2+ also vary greatly in the literature between the micromolar (4Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Google Scholar, 21Kramer M.L. Kratzin H.D. Schmidt B. Romer A. Windl O. Liemann S.

PrP-(23–231) with the octarepeat domain deleted, fragments PrP-(91–115) and PrP-(90–126) and PrP-(91–115) analogues (H96A and H111A) have been used to identify key residues in Cu2+ coordination. We use direct spectroscopic methods including CD, NMR, and EPR to study the folding, affinity, coordination geometry, stoichiometry, and pH dependence of copper binding to the prion protein. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Mouse Prion PrP(23–231Δ51–90) Protein—The coding region of the full-length mouse PrP-(23–231) with a deleted octapeptide region, named PrP(23–231Δ51–90), was cloned into a pET-23 vector to produce a tag-free protein as previously described (11Brown D.R. Wong B.S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in 2-liter flasks of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7 and the protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm. Bacterial pellets were harvested after 3 h and sonicated in a buffer containing 8 m urea, 200 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6. The resulting solution was cleared of bacterial debris by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The protein was absorbed to a copper-charged metal affinity column made from chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted from the column using imidazole (300 mm). The purity of the protein was checked by polyacrylamide electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. The protein was refolded by successive rounds of dilution in distilled water, concentrated using vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience), and dialyzed with a 12,000–14,000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis tube at 4 °C against water overnight to remove residual urea. The concentration of PrP(23–231Δ51–90) was measured by its absorbance at 280 nm ( A280 nm1 mg/ml, 1 cm, = 1.758). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides representing various fragments of PrP were synthesized employing solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (A.B.C, Imperial College, London). After removing from the resin and de-protection, the samples were purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and characterized using mass spectrometry. To mimic the peptides within the full-length prion protein, all peptides were blocked at the N terminus with N-acetyl and ethyl ester at the C terminus. One and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed the amino acid sequence. Design of Peptides—Peptides synthesized included: human (PrP) sequence, PrP-(91–115), acetyl-QGGGTHSQWNKPSKPKTNMKHMAGA; PrP-(90–126), acetyl-GQGGGTHSQWNKPSKPKTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG; PrP(H96A), acetyl-QGGGTASQWNKPSKPKTNMKHMAGA; PrP(H111A), acetyl-QGGGTHSQWN KPSKPKTNMKAMAGA; PrP-(58–91), PrP(4octa), acetyl-GQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQ. Titrations—The pH was measured before and after each spectrum was recorded. Unless otherwise noted, all titrations were carried out in the absence of buffers or salts. For all titrations the pH was adjusted using small aliquots of 100 mm NaOH or HCl. The peptide concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm. An extinction coefficient of 5690 m–1 cm–1 (multiplied by the number of tryptophan residues) was used for each peptide (51Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). The freeze-dried peptides contained 20–30% moisture by weight. The addition of metal ions (CuCl2·2H2O) or competing ligands was performed using small aliquots from freshly prepared stock aqueous solutions. Stability Constants—The absolute affinity (pH independent) of l-His for Cu2+ is 1.5 · 1010m–1, the apparent affinity, at pH 7.4 is therefore 2.6 · 108m–1 or a dissociation constant of 3.7 nm (as log α = pKa, pH = 9.17–7.4 = 1.77, and log K1(app) = log K1 – log α = 10.2–1.77 = 8.43 or 2.6 · 108m–1). The glycine dissociation constant at pH 7.5 is ∼500 nm (52Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Claredon, Oxford1986Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV 202 instrument at 25 °C. Typically a cell with a 0.1-cm path length was used for spectra recorded between 185 and 260 nm with sampling points every 0.5 nm. A 1-cm path length cell was used for data between 300 and 800 nm with a 2-nm sampling interval. A minimum of three scans was recorded and the baseline or apospectra were subtracted from each spectrum. Data were smoothed when necessary. Data were processed using Microsoft Excel and the KaleidaGraph spread sheet/graph package. The direct CD measurements (θ, in mdeg) were converted to molar ellipticity, Δϵ (m–1 cm–1) using the relationship Δϵ = θ/33,000 · c · l = [θ]/3,300, where [θ] = θ/cl, c is the concentration, and l the path length. The molar ellipticity [θ] is in units of degree cm2 dmol–1, therefore, [θ] = {mdeg}/{(10Shiraishi N. Ohta Y. Nishikimi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267Google Scholar) · (mol liter–1) · (cm)}. Absorption Spectroscopy (UV-Visible)—UV-visible electronic absorption spectra were obtained with a Hitachi U-3010 double beam spectrophotometer, using a 1-cm path length. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)—All NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Advance 600 MHz spectrometer using a 5-mm inverse detection (1H), triple-resonance, z-gradient probe. Peptide samples were prepared in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 100% D2O, pH 6.5, or for the Cu2+ titrations, pH 7.5, and spectra were acquired at 303 K. In the 90% H2O, 10% D2O samples water suppression was achieved using the W5 Watergate method (53Liu M. Mao X. Ye C. Huang H. Nicholson J.K. Lindon J.C. J. Magn. Res. 1998; 132: 125-129Google Scholar), whereas samples in 100% D2O had residual water suppressed with a low power presaturation pulse. For two-dimensional spectra, quadrature detection in the indirect dimension was achieved using the States-TPPI method. Two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra were typically acquired with 2048[F2] × 512[F1] complex points, with water suppression achieved using the W5 Watergate sequence. The TOCSY experiment employed a DIPSI2 sequence for isotropic mixing, with a mixing time of 75 ms (54Shaka A.J. Lee C.J. Pines A. J. Magn. Res. 1988; 77: 274-293Google Scholar). Nuclear Overhauser exchange spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra (55Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Google Scholar) were acquired with 2048[F2] × 512[F1] data points, with mixing times of 200, 300, and 500 ms. Prior to Fourier transformation, sine-squared window functions, phase shifted by 90° were applied to both dimensions, the F1 dimension was forward linear predicted to 512 real points and both dimensions zero filled to 2048 real points. Data were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker) software running on a SGI O2 work station and analyzed using the program XEASY (56Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Guntert M. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Google Scholar). Proton resonance assignments and sequential connectivities for PrP-(91–115) were obtained using the TOCSY and NOESY data and standard homonuclear techniques (57Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids, Wiley, New York1986Google Scholar). Analysis of spectra of the H96A and H111A mutants allowed unambiguous assignment of histidine resonance. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)—X-band EPR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer operating at a microwave frequency of 9.38 GHz. The spectra were acquired over a sweep width of 2500 gauss, a microwave power of 0.63 milliwatt, a modulation frequency of 10 gauss, and a temperature of either 20 or 100 K. At least two scans were acquired per sample. The pH of the peptide samples was adjusted prior to freezing, however, the pH values noted are not altered to take into account freezing effects. CD spectra of PrP-(91–115) in the UV region are shown in Fig. 1. In the absence of copper, PrP-(91–115) gives an predominately random coil CD spectrum in agreement with the structure of full-length PrP in this region (17Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that addition of Cu2+ increases the negative chirality centered at ∼217 nm with a decrease in the negative CD band at 200 nm. An isodichroic point is observed at 207 nm with Cu2+ addition indicating a single mode of binding up to 1 eq of copper. The changes in the CD spectra with Cu2+ additions are more apparent by obtaining the difference spectra shown as an insert. The changes in the CD spectra upon copper coordination indicate an increase in β-sheet or extended conformation, accompanied by a loss of irregular structure. A similar titration with Cu2+ and PrP-(90–126), at pH 7.5, produces identical UV-CD spectra (data not shown). Copper binding to His111 and His96 (14 residues apart) are possible candidates as coordinating ligands and would cause the polypeptide chain to fold back on itself, perhaps inducing anti-parallel β-sheet in this region, the CD spectra shown in Fig. 1 support this possibility. We show later that Cu2+ does indeed coordinate to both His111 and His96. The Cu-PrP-(91–115) CD data indicates that the copper-loaded peptide still possesses a considerable irregular structure, hence a stable well defined anti-parallel β-sheet between His111 and His96 is unlikely. Using visible absorption bands and associated CD bands we have monitored the pH dependence of Cu2+ binding to the prion protein fragment, PrP-(91–115). PrP-(91–115) was loaded with 1 mol eq of Cu2+ and the visible absorption spectrum were acquired at a number of pH values between pH 5.5 and 9.4. Fig. 2, panel A, shows the resulting overlaid spectra. At pH 5.5, a single absorption band is apparent at 610 nm corresponding to Cu2+ d-d electronic transitions. As the pH increases the absorption increases in intensity until ∼pH 9. Above pH 6.5 there is a shift in the absorption maximum from 610 to 540 nm, suggesting a change in the coordination environment of the Cu2+ ion. The absorption maximum and extinction coefficient (between 40 and 100 m–1 cm–1) for the Cu-PrP-(91–115) complex are typical for a type II Cu2+ complex. The absorption maximum can be sensitive to ligand type. For example, using model peptide complexes of type II copper complexes the wavelength maximum decreases from 765 nm for Cu2+ with a single nitrogen ligand (and three water oxygens) to 540 nm for Cu2+ with four nitrogen ligands (58Bryce G.F. Gurd F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1439-1448Google Scholar). The visible absorption spectra observed here are characteristic of three or four nitrogen coordinations in a type II square-planar arrangement. Circular dichroism spectra of Cu1PrP-(91–115) (1 mol eq of Cu2+ loaded) have been obtained at pH 6.2, 7.2, and 9.2, shown in Fig. 2B. These data show that the arrangement of ligands coordinating the Cu2+ ions changes significantly with pH. The CD spectrum at pH 6.2 gives a maximum CD band at 520 nm and no ellipticity at 580 nm. In direct contrast, at pH 9.2 a maximal negative CD band at 580 nm is observed with negative ellipticity at 520 nm. The spectrum at pH 7.2 is a mixture of the CD spectra from the mildly acidic and basic conditions. A weighted average of the pH 6.2 and 9.2 spectra shows good agreement with the pH 7.5 spectra using a 70:30% ratio of pH 6.2 and 9.2, respectively. Addition of 2 eq of Cu2+ shows further changes in the spectra at all three pH values as shown in Fig. 2C. Copper coordination to PrP-(91–115) is very sensitive to pH. The titratable imidazole side chain of histidine provides a rationale for the pH dependence of binding. The Δϵ of the d-d transition CD bands indicate a strong vicinal effect from the chiral Cα, this implies main chain coordination via the carbonyl or amide (59Tsangaris J.M. Martin R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 4255-4260Google Scholar). The change in coordination geometry and ligands as the pH is raised above the pKa of histidine is likely to be because of the additional coordination of main cha"
https://openalex.org/W1993813725,"The fatty acid (FA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22: 6n-3) is highly enriched in membrane phospholipids of the central nervous system and retina. Loss of DHA because of n-3 FA deficiency leads to suboptimal function in learning, memory, olfactory-based discrimination, spatial learning, and visual acuity. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signal transduction is a common signaling motif in these neuronal pathways. Here we investigated the effect of n-3 FA deficiency on GPCR signaling in retinal rod outer segment (ROS) membranes isolated from rats raised on n-3-adequate or -deficient diets. ROS membranes of second generation n-3 FA-deficient rats had ∼80% less DHA than n-3-adequate rats. DHA was replaced by docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-6), an n-6 FA. This replacement correlated with desensitization of visual signaling in n-3 FA-deficient ROS, as evidenced by reduced rhodopsin activation, rhodopsin-transducin (Gt) coupling, cGMP phosphodiesterase activity, and slower formation of metarhodopsin II (MII) and the MII-Gt complex relative to n-3 FA-adequate ROS. ROS membranes from n-3 FA-deficient rats exhibited a higher degree of phospholipid acyl chain order relative to n-3 FA-adequate rats. These findings reported here provide an explanation for the reduced amplitude and delayed response of the electroretinogram a-wave observed in n-3 FA deficiency in rodents and nonhuman primates.

Litman B. Kim H.Y. Gawrisch K. Lipids. 2001; 36: 945-959Google Scholar). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), a long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (FA) of the n-3 series, is highly enriched in the membrane phospholipids of the brain, neuronal tissue, and retina (2Salem N. Spiller G.A. Scala J. Current Topics in Nutrition and Disease: New Protective Roles for Selected Nutrients. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York1989: 109-228Google Scholar). In n-3 FA deficiency, membrane phospholipid DHA is replaced in both the retina and brain by docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22: 5n-6), an n-6 series FA, in a near stoichiometric manner (3Galli C. Trzeciak H.I. Paoletti R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 248: 449-454Google Scholar). n-3 deficiency is associated with visual and cognitive deficits, as observed in animal and human infant studies (2Salem N. Spiller G.A. Scala J. Current Topics in Nutrition and Disease: New Protective Roles for Selected Nutrients. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York1989: 109-228Google Scholar). Studies in reconstituted systems demonstrate that visual signaling, the best characterized GPCR system, is sensitive to membrane phospholipid acyl chain composition and appears to be optimal in DHA membranes (4Litman B.J. Niu S.L. Polozova A. Mitchell D.C. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 16: 237-242Google Scholar). An important question in determining the underlying mechanism responsible for the deficits observed in n-3 FA deficiency is whether the loss of DHA in vivo results in suboptimal GPCR signaling. In visual signaling, absorption of a photon by rhodopsin triggers the formation of the active form of the receptor, metarhodopsin II (MII) (5Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Google Scholar). MII binds and activates several hundred molecules of transducin (Gt), the visual G protein (6Kibelbek J. Mitchell D.C. Beach J.M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6761-6768Google Scholar), which subsequently activates the effector enzyme, a cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). PDE catalyzes cGMP hydrolysis, triggering closure of cGMP-gated Na+/Ca2+ channels in the rod outer segment (ROS) plasma membrane. This hyperpolarizes the rod cell and initiates the visual response, as observed in the a-wave of the electroretinogram (ERG). Thus, the ERG a-wave time course and amplitude are determined by the kinetics and coupling parameters of the individual steps in the visual signaling pathway. Early studies of the FA dependence of the ERG showed that decreased levels of n-3 FAs in the diet led to decreased a-wave and b-wave amplitudes in the rat ERG (7Wheeler T.G. Benolken R.M. Anderson R.E. Science. 1975; 188: 1312-1314Google Scholar). Similar changes were observed in the ERGs of rodents (8Weisinger H.S. Vingrys A.J. Sinclair A.J. Ann. Nutr. Metab. 1996; 40: 91-98Google Scholar, 9Weisinger H.S. Armitage J.A. Jeffrey B.G. Mitchell D.C. Moriguchi T. Sinclair A.J. Weisinger R.S. Salem Jr., N.

Nutr. 1997; 65: 465-472Google Scholar). n-3 FA deficiency was also associated with increased implicit times in the ERG and decreased visual acuity in nonhuman primates (11Connor W.E. Neuringer M. Karnosky M.L. Lent A. Bolls L.C. Biological Membranes: Abbreviations in Membrane and Function Structure. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York1988: 275-276Google Scholar, 12Neuringer M. Connor W.E. Lin D.S.

Lipids. 2002; 37: 839-848Google Scholar). The most dramatic change observed in the composition of the retinal tissue is the replacement of DHA by DPA, suggesting that depletion of retinal DHA is responsible for the observed suboptimal responses, likely through changes in membrane physical properties that lead to down-regulation of GPCR signaling pathways. In this study, we provide explicit experimental evidence linking the changes in phospholipid acyl chain composition associated with n-3 FA deficiency to the down-regulation of individual steps in a GPCR signaling pathway using the visual signaling pathway as a model system. The replacement of DHA by DPA in n-3 FA-deficient rat ROS resulted in slower kinetics and reduced levels of receptor activation, receptor-G protein coupling, and an attenuation of the integrated signaling pathway, as evidenced by a 3-fold reduction in PDE activity at physiologically relevant bleach levels. In addition, ROS membranes from n-3-deficient rats had a higher degree of phospholipid acyl chain order than those obtained from n-3-adequate rats. These studies provide a mechanistic basis for the reduced amplitude and delayed response (increased latency) of the retinal ERG a-wave observed in n-3 FA-deficient animals. Animal Procedures—The protocol and all animal procedures used in this experiment were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Female Long-Evans rats were obtained from Charles River (Portage, MI) at weaning (3 weeks of age). Weaning females were semirandomly divided into two dietary groups with the constraint that both groups had the same mean body weight. One group of females was fed with the n-3 FA-adequate diet, and the second group was fed with the n-3 FA-deficient diet (14Moriguchi T. Greiner R.S. Salem Jr., N. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2563-2573Google Scholar). The females in both dietary groups were mated with 12-week-old males when they were 11 weeks of age. Offspring were culled to a maximum of 12/dam, and the dams were maintained on their respective diets during lactation. At the age of 21 days, the pups were dark-adapted overnight and sacrificed by decapitation under dim red light. Diet Composition—Diets were patterned after those of the American Institute of Nutrition (AIN93) with the fat source modified to provide either a low or an adequate level of n-3 FAs. Both diets had the same basal macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, and basal fats (hydrogenated coconut and safflower oils) (14Moriguchi T. Greiner R.S. Salem Jr., N. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2563-2573Google Scholar). However, the n-3 FA-adequate diet also contained flaxseed oil and DHASCO® (Martek Biosciences, Columbia, MD), fats that supply α-linolenic acid and DHA, respectively, as their principal component. FA composition of the diets was balanced for saturated FAs, monounsaturated FAs, and linoleic acid; the key difference between diets was a substitution of a small amount of flaxseed and DHASCO® oils for a portion of the hydrogenated coconut oil in the n-3 FA-adequate diet. ROS Membrane Sample Preparation—Retinas were dissected immediately after sacrifice under dim red light and placed in 10 ml of TBS (10 mm Tris, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm DTPA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 15 μg of aprotinin, pH 8.0) at 4 °C. ROS were prepared using a sucrose gradient method as described previously (15Organisciak D.T. Wang H. Kou A.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 401-412Google Scholar). The endogenous peripheral membrane proteins, Gt and PDE, in ROS were removed by two washes in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris and 50 μm DTPA, pH 8.0). The purified ROS membranes were assayed for rhodopsin contents and the concentration of total phospholipids. Aliquots of Gt and PDE isolated from bovine retinas were added back to the hypotonically stripped ROS membranes at the physiological ratio of 100:10:1 of rhodopsin:Gt:PDE to restore the signaling cascade (16Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Dratz E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 898: 81-89Google Scholar). Phospholipid Analysis—Phospholipid molecular species were analyzed using reversed phase HPLC-electrospray mass spectrometry (17Kim H.Y. Wang T.C. Ma Y.C. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3977-3982Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from ROS membranes using the Bligh and Dyer procedure in the presence of deuterium-labeled phospholipid internal standards. Samples were injected into a C18 column and separated using a mobile phase containing 0.5% NH4OH in water, methanol, and hexane and a gradient from 12:88:0 to 0:88:12 in 17 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min after holding at the initial composition for 3 min. The separated phospholipid molecular species were detected using an Agilent HPLC-MS 1100 Series mass selective detector instrument. For electrospray ionization the capillary voltage and the exit voltage were set at 4000 and 200 V, respectively. The drying gas temperature was set at 350 °C, the flow rate of the drying gas was 13 liters/min, and the gas pressure of the nebulizer was 32 p.s.i. Quantification was based on the area ratios calculated against the internal standard of the same phospholipid class. Assays—Light-activated PDE activity was assayed using a real time pH method (18Yee R. Liebman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8902-8909Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A high sensitivity pH meter with built-in temperature compensation (Model 370 from Thermo Orion, Beverly, MA) coupled to a microelectrode (MI-710 from Microelectrodes, Inc., Bedford, NH) was used to monitor pH. The signal output from the pH meter was acquired by a computer through a 12-bit A/D board (Lab-PC-1200/AI, National Instruments, Austin, TX) operated at a 1-kHz rate. Samples that contained 5 μm rhodopsin from either n-3 FA-adequate or -deficient ROS membranes with replenished bovine Gt and PDE, 50 μm GTP, and 1 mm cGMP in TBS buffer (pH 8.0) were preincubated at 37 °C in a thermo-regulated microcuvette in the dark for 10 min. A set of 20 data points was collected as the base-line activity prior to sample activation by a flash lamp (FX1131 from EG&G; pulse width = 1 μs) synchronized by the computer. The light intensity was attenuated using neutral density filters to vary the level of rhodopsin activation in samples, which was determined by rhodopsin concentrations before and after light exposure. The PDE activity is obtained from the shift in pH and is expressed as cGMP hydrolyzed (mm)/s. Rhodopsin activation was characterized by the MI-MII equilibrium constant, Keq, using a spectroscopic method (19Straume M. Mitchell D.C. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9135-9142Google Scholar, 20Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42807-42811Google Scholar). Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence lifetime and differential polarization measurements were performed with a K2 multifrequency cross-correlation phase fluorometer (ISS, Urbana, IL) as described previously (21Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 879-891Google Scholar). For lifetime measurements 12 modulation frequencies were used, logarithmically spaced from 5 to 200 MHz, and differential polarization measurements were made at 15 modulation frequencies logarithmically spaced from 5 to 200 MHz. Both total intensity decay and differential polarization measurements were repeated a minimum of three times. Measured polarization-dependent differential phases and modulation ratios for each sample were combined with the measured total intensity decay to yield the anisotropy decay, r(t). Anisotropy decay data of diphenylhexatriene (DPH) were analyzed using the Brownian rotational diffusion model (21Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 879-891Google Scholar). This model characterizes the anisotropy decay of DPH in terms of the orientational distribution function, f(θ), and the diffusion coefficient for rotation about the long axis of DPH. Flash Photolysis Measurements—Samples for flash photolysis measurements were prepared by diluting concentrated ROS suspensions with pH 7.5 TBS buffer, dividing the solution in half, and adding concentrated Gt to one half and an identical amount of Gt buffer to the other half. Samples were then incubated for 4 h on ice to ensure binding of Gt to the bilayer. Final concentrations were 5.0 μm rhodopsin and 1.0 μm Gt. Kinetics of MII and MII-Gt formation were assessed by measuring the transient absorption at 380 nm using a flash photolysis system as described previously (22Mitchell D.C. Niu S.L. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42801-42806Google Scholar). Excitation was provided by a high pressure flash lamp (EG&G; pulse width = 1 μs) filtered with a broad (±25 nm) bandpass filter centered at 500 nm. The current from a thermoelectrically cooled photomultiplier tube (R928, Hamamatsu) was passed to a low noise current amplifier (Stanford Research). The amplifier output voltage was acquired at 2–10 μs/point by a 1.25-MHz, 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (National Instruments) installed in a personal computer. The detailed kinetics of MII formation were extracted from the changes in absorbance observed at 380 nm in the absence of Gt via analysis in terms of the microscopic rate constants of a branched photoreaction model (19Straume M. Mitchell D.C. Miller J.L. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9135-9142Google Scholar). The kinetics of MII-Gt formation were determined by analyzing absorbance changes at 380 nm obtained in the presence of Gt in terms of the branched model plus a reaction between MII and Gt to form the MII-Gt complex. In both cases the observed absorbance increase at 380 nm was directly analyzed in terms of the appropriate microscopic rate constants using NONLIN with subroutines specifying each model written by the authors of this paper. Flash photolysis measurements in the presence of Gt produced an equilibrium mixture of MI, free MII, and MII-Gt complex. MI and free MII were assumed to be present in the ratio corresponding to their equilibrium mixture measured in the absence of Gt, and the concentrations of free MII and MII-Gt complex were determined from the kinetic analysis. The association constant, Ka, between MII and Gt was determined using the measured concentrations of free MII and MII-Gt complex and assuming that [free Gt] = [total Gt] – [MII-Gt complex]. Lipid and Protein Analysis—To characterize the effect of the dietary regimes on ROS membrane lipid composition, phospholipid molecular species and total acyl chain composition for each phospholipid class were determined for both n-3 FA-adequate and -deficient dietary groups. The n-3 FA-adequate group contained the highest levels of DHA in phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at 44.7 (±0.9)% and 49.8 (±0.4)% of total acyl chains, respectively. DHA levels in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and plasmalogen PE (PLE) were lower at 29.4 (±0.9)% and 24.5 (±0.4)%, respectively (Table I). Only minor levels of DPA were detected in all classes analyzed. Relative to the n-3 FA-adequate diet, the n-3 FA-deficient diet resulted in a major loss of DHA in PC, PS, PE, and PLE of 79, 79, 73, and 82%, respectively. The reduction in DHA was accompanied by a compensatory replacement by the n-6 FA, DPA, a close structural analog of DHA with one less double bond at the n-3 position. This is consistent with the essentially reciprocal replacement of DHA by DPA associated with n-3 FA deficiency that was observed by others (3Galli C. Trzeciak H.I. Paoletti R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 248: 449-454Google Scholar). Differences for key phospholipid molecular species are illustrated in Fig. 1. DHA is the major phospholipid component in the n-3 FA-adequate ROS. A significant amount of PC, PS, and PE contains DHA in both the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chain positions. In contrast, ROS from n-3 FA-deficient rats show a major loss of DHA, which is accompanied by the appearance of DPA-containing species as the primary constituents. One of the interesting findings is that the di-22:6n-3 species of PE and PC are not well replaced by di-22:5n-6 species; instead, there is an increased level of 18:0,22:5n-6 PC in the ROS from n-3 FA-deficient rats. There is also a failure in the replacement of 16:0,22:6n-3 PLE species by the corresponding DPA species. The ratio of membrane phospholipid to rhodopsin was determined to be the same for both dietary groups, suggesting that rhodopsin expression was not altered by n-3 FA deficiency.Table IPhospholipid compositions of ROS membranesLipid classn-3 adequaten-3 deficient22:6n-3aPercentages of 22:6n-3 or 22:5n-6 are expressed as the mole percentage of total fatty acid in each phospholipid class.

Open table in a new tab Light-stimulated PDE Activity—The PDE activity, which is a measure of the integrated activity of the visual signaling pathway encompassing rhodopsin activation, MII-Gt coupling, Gtα-PDE coupling, and PDE-catalyzed cGMP hydrolysis, was assayed for ROS membranes isolated from n-3 FA-adequate and -deficient rat retinas. ROS membranes were hypotonically stripped of endogenous Gt and PDE and subsequently reconstituted with equivalent aliquots of the same preparation of purified bovine Gt and PDE so as to restore the native ratio of proteins in the visual pathway. This was done to ensure that n-3 FA-adequate and -deficient ROS membranes contained identical amounts of Gt and PDE so that the only difference in the two samples was the change in ROS membrane phospholipid composition induced by the diet. Thus any changes observed in light-stimulated PDE activity can unequivocally be associated with the observed changes in ROS membrane composition. The ROS membranes from both dietary groups exhibited similar dark PDE activity, as shown from the base line in the absence of light stimulus (Fig. 2a). Upon light stimulation, which activates a fraction of 1.7 × 10–3 rhodopsin molecules, there were considerable differences in the amplitude and the rate of cGMP hydrolysis observed for ROS membranes derived from n-3 FA-adequate and -deficient rat retinas. These differences were dependent on the level of light stimulus, which is shown in the dose-response curve (Fig. 2b), where the PDE activity is expressed as a percentage of the maximal rate of cGMP hydrolysis and the light stimulus level is expressed as the fraction of rhodopsin molecules light-activated. The dose-response curve is shifted toward the right for the n-3 FA-deficient group, indicating a loss of sensitivity of the light-activated signaling pathway (Fig. 2b). High levels of light stimulus saturated the light-activated PDE activity and diminished the difference in PDE activity between the two dietary groups. However, the large difference in PDE activity in the ROS samples at low light stimulus levels is explicitly shown in the plot of the ratio of PDE activity in n-3 FA-adequate ROS to that in n-3 FA-deficient ROS (Fig. 2c). Under physiological conditions, where about 1 in 105 rhodopsin molecules is activated, there was a ∼3-fold difference between light-stimulated PDE activity in n-3 FA-adequate ROS and n-3 FA-deficient ROS. Receptor Activation—To identify the steps involved in the change in visual pathway sensitivity induced by n-3 FA deficiency, we measured the level and rate of rhodopsin activation in ROS membranes from both dietary groups. The MI-MII equilibrium constant, Keq = [MII]/[MI], which is a measure of the level of rhodopsin activation, was reduced by 16% at 37 °C in ROS membranes from the n-3 FA-deficient group relative to the n-3-adequate group (Fig. 3a). This observation in the ROS membrane is consistent with the lower Keq values observed previously for rhodopsin reconstituted in membranes containing phospholipids with lower DHA or acyl chain unsaturation levels (20Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42807-42811Google Scholar). The time constant for MII formation at 37 °C, τMII, in the n-3 FA-adequate group was 0.56 ms, compared with 0.67 ms in the deficient group (Fig. 3b). This translates into ∼20% delay in the rate of MII formation induced by n-3 FA deficiency. Previous studies established that DHA-containing membranes have relatively low membrane acyl chain order parameters (23Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17299-17308Google Scholar), high compressibility (24Koenig B.W. Strey H.H. Gawrisch K. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1954-1966Google Scholar), and high membrane acyl chain packing free volume (21Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 879-891Google Scholar). Given that a molecular volume expansion is associated with the MI to MII transition, the properties of DHA membranes would likely impose a minimal energy barrier for the formation of MII, whereas a reduction in DHA levels in n-3 FA-deficient ROS membranes would likely raise the energy barrier. This is consistent with the reduced acyl chain packing free volume observed for the ROS membranes from the n-3 FA-deficient group relative to the n-3-adequate group (see “Membrane Structure” below). This variation in membrane properties would affect both the extent and the rate of formation of MII. Receptor-G Protein Coupling—The initial step in signal amplification and information flow from receptor to effector enzyme in GPCR signaling is the formation of an activated receptor-G protein complex, which is the MII-Gt complex in the visual system. The association constant, Ka, for the complex is 16.4 μm–1 for the n-3-adequate ROS and 9.9 μm–1 for the n-3-deficient ROS. This demonstrates that lower levels of the MII-Gt complex form in the n-3 FA-deficient ROS. In the n-3 FA-adequate group, the time constant for MII-Gt formation, τMII-Gt, is 0.81 ms, paralleling closely the kinetics of MII formation, which has a time constant of 0.56 ms. The tight coupling of MII appearance and MII-G protein complex formation makes visual transduction one of the most efficiently coupled systems in the GPCR family. However, in the n-3 FA-deficient ROS, the kinetics of MII-Gt formation were slower than those of the adequate group by 38% (Fig. 3c). The ratio of the time constants τMII-Gt:τMII is a measure of the lag time in the coupling of MII to Gt. This ratio is 1.45 for the n-3 FA-adequate ROS and is increased by 16% to 1.67 in the n-3 FA-deficient ROS, indicating a reduced efficiency of MII coupling to Gt. The overall lag time in the initiation of the ERG a-wave is determined by the fact that the time constant for the appearance of the MII-Gt complex is 38% larger in the n-3-deficient ROS than in the n-3-adequate ROS. A previous study, using reconstituted membranes, demonstrated that the rate of MII-Gt formation, which is controlled by lateral diffusion of MII and Gt in the plane of the membrane, is mediated by phospholipid acyl chain composition and optimized in DHA-containing bilayers (22Mitchell D.C. Niu S.L. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42801-42806Google Scholar). A similar dependence would explain the observed delay in the formation of MII-Gt in the n-3 FA-deficient ROS membranes. Membrane Structure—Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of the hydrophobic fluorescent probe DPH was shown to be a reliable probe of acyl chain packing properties in both reconstituted rhodopsin-lipid vesicles and ROS disk membranes (22Mitchell D.C. Niu S.L. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42801-42806Google Scholar, 25Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20139-20145Google Scholar). Analyzing the data using a Brownian rotational diffusion model yields a parameter fv, which allows a comparison of relative acyl chain packing free volume in membranes of different lipid composition. This parameter decreases with increasing acyl chain order. Values of fv for ROS membranes from n-3 FA-adequate and -deficient rats are 0.11 and 0.086, respectively. The smaller fv value for the n-3 FA-deficient ROS membranes indicates a more ordered phospholipid acyl chain packing than that of the n-3 FA-adequate ROS membranes. ERGs of n-3 FA-deficient rodents and nonhuman primates are characterized by a reduced amplitude and increased latency in the a-wave, which is determined by the visual transduction pathway in the ROS. The rate and degree of hyperpolarization of the ROS plasma membrane, which results from the closure of cGMP-gated Na+/Ca2+ channels, are determined by the rate and extent of hydrolysis of cGMP by the PDE. Characteristics of the light-stimulated PDE activity in turn depend on the rate and extent of rhodopsin activation to MII, MII activation of Gt, and the resulting activation of the PDE by Gtα. A recently published model relates the generation of the ERG a-wave to the kinetic and equilibrium parameters associated with the various steps in the visual transduction pathway (26Leskov I.B. Klenchin V.A. Handy J.W. Whitlock G.G. Govardovskii V.I. Bownds M.D. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 525-537Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The model explicitly relates the amplitude of the ERG a-wave to the number of activated rhodopsin molecules and the subsequent number of G proteins and PDE catalytic subunits activated, whereas the rate of generation of the a-wave is associated with the kinetics of coupling of these proteins in the signaling pathway. In the current study, we provide i"
https://openalex.org/W1979588994,"The Bedout High, located on the northwestern continental margin of Australia, has emerged as a prime candidate for an end-Permian impact structure. Seismic imaging, gravity data, and the identification of melt rocks and impact breccias from drill cores located on top of Bedout are consistent with the presence of a buried impact crater. The impact breccias contain nearly pure silica glass (SiO2), fractured and shock-melted plagioclases, and spherulitic glass. The distribution of glass and shocked minerals over hundreds of meters of core material implies that a melt sheet is present. Available gravity and seismic data suggest that the Bedout High represents the central uplift of a crater similar in size to Chicxulub. A plagioclase separate from the Lagrange-1 exploration well has an Ar/Ar age of 250.1 +/- 4.5 million years. The location, size, and age of the Bedout crater can account for reported occurrences of impact debris in Permian-Triassic boundary sediments worldwide."

https://openalex.org/W1501261568,"Repeated transmission of the avian H5N1 influenza virus to humans during the ongoing avian epidemic has raised concerns that such events might initiate a global pandemic of a highly pathogenic human virus. [We][1] review the current global mechanisms of influenza surveillance, and highlight the need for improved surveillance of animal viruses. We show how risk assessment and surveillance can be enhanced by quantitative analysis, and emphasize that low-level human-to-human transmission is not necessarily indicative of an emerging pandemic. We propose that the appearance of uncharacteristically large clusters of cases is indicative of increased viral transmissibility and hence of when to issue global alerts and implement stringent control measures.

https://openalex.org/W2121327910,"Collectins are a family of innate immune proteins that contain fibrillar collagen-like regions and globular carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs). The CRDs of these proteins recognize various microbial surface-specific carbohydrate patterns, particularly hexoses. We hypothesized that collectins, such as pulmonary surfactant proteins (SPs) SP-A and SP-D and serum protein mannose-binding lectin, could recognize nucleic acids, pentose-based anionic phosphate polymers. Here we show that collectins bind DNA from a variety of origins, including bacteria, mice, and synthetic oligonucleotides. Pentoses, such as arabinose, ribose, and deoxyribose, inhibit the interaction between SP-D and mannan, one of the well-studied hexose ligands for SP-D, and biologically relevant d-forms of the pentoses are better competitors than the l-forms. In addition, DNA and RNA polymer-related compounds, such as nucleotide diphosphates and triphosphates, also inhibit the carbohydrate binding ability of SP-D, or ∼60 kDa trimeric recombinant fragments of SP-D that are composed of the α-helical coiled-coil neck region and three CRDs (SP-D(n/CRD)) or SP-D(n/CRD) with eight GXY repeats (SPD(GXY)8(n/CRD)). Direct binding and competition studies suggest that collectins bind nucleic acid via their CRDs as well as by their collagen-like regions, and that SP-D binds DNA more effectively than do SP-A and mannose-binding lectin at physiological salt conditions. Furthermore, the SP-D(GXY)8(n/CRD) fragments co-localize with DNA, and the protein competes the interaction between propidium iodide, a DNA-binding dye, and apoptotic cells. In conclusion, we show that collectins are a new class of proteins that bind free DNA and the DNA present on apoptotic cells by both their globular CRDs and collagen-like regions. Collectins may therefore play an important role in decreasing the inflammation caused by DNA in lungs and other tissues.

Collectins may therefore play an important role in decreasing the inflammation caused by DNA in lungs and other tissues. Nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA of higher organisms and microbes are long, pentose sugar-based anionic phosphate polymers. Apoptotic cell death results in the fragmentation of DNA and its subsequent display on the surfaces of the cells as blebs (1Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Google Scholar). Inefficient removal of apoptotic cells leads to disintegration of their contents and the formation of necrotic cells. These leaky cells eventually release their intracellular contents, and many of these components elicit tissue inflammation. Furthermore, certain pulmonary pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, actively secrete DNA into the extracellular matrix to establish an active biofilm and chronic infections (2Whitchurch C.B. Tolker-Nielsen T. Ragas P.C. Mattick J.S. Science. 2002; 295: 1487Google Scholar). Removal of dying cells and their components, including DNA, is therefore essential to maintain inflammation-free tissues and to prevent autoimmune diseases (1Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Google Scholar). Although the multiple pathways and proteins involved in the apoptotic process have been studied in great detail, clearance of these cells and their debris is poorly understood. Collectins are a class of innate immune proteins that are often secreted into body fluids and extracellular cavities (3Palaniyar N. Nadesalingam J. Reid K.B. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 575-594Google Scholar). Well-studied members of the collectin family include surfactant proteins (SPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SP, surfactant protein; MBL, mannose-binding lectin; CRD, carbohydrate-recognition domain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; SAP, serum amyloid component P; GlcNAc, N-acetyl glucosamine. A and D and mannose-binding lectin (MBL). These proteins, particularly SP-D, bind many of the inflammation-causing ligands derived from microbes (3Palaniyar N. Nadesalingam J. Reid K.B. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 575-594Google Scholar), such as fungal cell wall glucans (4Allen M.J. Voelker D.R. Mason R.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2037-2044Google Scholar), lipopolysaccharides (5Kuan S.F. Rust K. Crouch E. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 97-106Google Scholar), peptidoglycans and lipoteichoic acids (6van de Wetering J.K. van Eijk M. van Golde L.M. Hartung T. van Strijp J.A. Batenburg J.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 184: 1143-1151Google Scholar), and lipids (7Ogasawara Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21244-21249Google Scholar). We have shown recently that SP-D also binds to proteoglycans with long glycosaminoglycan chains, such as decorin, via both protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions, and that SP-D-decorin interactions may be related to reducing tissue-specific inflammation (8Nadesalingam J. Bernal A.L. Dodds A.W. Willis A.C. Mahoney D.J. Day A.J. Reid K.B. Palaniyar N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25678-25687Google Scholar). Collectins not only bind to these purified ligands but also recognize them on cell surfaces (3Palaniyar N. Nadesalingam J. Reid K.B. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 575-594Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells, for example, contain carbohydrate polymers such as DNA on their surfaces, and accumulation of these dying cells, as well as excess free DNA, is known to cause inflammation and septic shock (9McLachlan G. Stevenson B.J. Davidson D.J. Porteous D.J. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 384-392Google Scholar, 10Schwartz D.A. Quinn T.J. Thorne P.S. Sayeed S. Yi A.K. Krieg A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 68-73Google Scholar). Fragments of bacterial DNA with specific CpG motifs, however, act as immunostimulatory molecules (11Krieg A.M. Yi A.K. Matson S. Waldschmidt T.J. Bishop G.A. Teasdale R. Koretzky G.A. Klinman D.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 546-549Google Scholar). Regulatory mechanisms and all the proteins that are involved in these pathways are not clearly identified. A typical collectin is composed of polypeptide chains containing a short, interchain, disulfide bond-forming N-terminal domain, a collagen-like region with Gly-X-Y repeats (where X is any amino acid and Y is often hydroxyproline or hydroxylysine), an α-helical hydrophobic neck region and a C-terminal globular carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (12Persson A. Chang D. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5755-5760Google Scholar, 13Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Google Scholar). Three of these polypeptides form a trimeric subunit (14Palaniyar N. McCormack F.X. Possmayer F. Harauz G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6310-6316Google Scholar, 15Head J.F. Mealy T.R. McCormack F.X.

Holterman C.E. Inchley K. Possmayer F. Harauz G. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 297-310Google Scholar). SP-A further assembles as unidimensional (19Palaniyar N. Ridsdale R.A. Hearn S.A. Heng Y.M. Ottensmeyer F.P. Possmayer F. Harauz G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L631-L641Google Scholar) and multidimensional (20Palaniyar N. Ridsdale R.A. Possmayer F. Harauz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 131-136Google Scholar) fibers. Although the trimeric subunits of the collectins have limited affinity (μm) for several carbohydrate targets, their oligomeric assembly provides high avidity so that these proteins bind to ligands selectively and with high affinity (nm to pm). Collectins bind microbes primarily via hexose sugars and enhance their phagocytosis (16Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Google Scholar), and whether these proteins can bind pentose sugars was unknown. We hypothesized that collectins could bind free RNA and DNA, as well as nucleic acid present on the apoptotic and necrotic cells, and promote their clearance. In this study, we used pentoses, ribonucleoside phosphates, deoxyribonucleoside phosphates, synthetic short oligonucleotide fragments, DNA isolated from bacteria and mouse cells, and the apoptotic forms of Jurkat cells and mouse alveolar macrophages. Evidence obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), electron microscopy, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS), and confocal microscopy experiments show that collectins, particularly SP-D, bind DNA obtained from many sources. Furthermore, SP-D binds DNA both via their CRDs and collagen-like regions. We used two recombinant fragments of SP-D in this study to further determine the roles of different domains of the protein: the SP-D(n/CRD) fragment, which lacks the N-terminal segment and the entire collagen-like region; and the SPD(GXY)8(n/CRD) fragment, which is similar to SP-D(n/CRD) except that it also contains eight of the Gly-X-Y repeats. Both of these proteins also recognize DNA. SP-D(GXY)8(n/CRD) binds nucleic acids present on apoptotic cells. Therefore, our findings establish a novel ligand for collectins and suggest that these proteins could enhance the clearance of nucleic acids and play an important role in limiting inflammation.

Thiel S. Lee S.H. Lu J. Biochem. J. 1996; 319 (Pt 2): 329-332Google Scholar) and C1q (24Reid K.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82 (Pt A): 319-324Google Scholar) were purified from pooled human plasma (HD Supplies, Aylesbury, England). Recombinant preparations of the trimeric ∼60-kDa fragment composed of the neck and CRDs of SP-D, with and without eight Gly-X-Y repeats derived from the collagen-like region, were expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, respectively. As described previously, SP-D(GXY)8(n/CRD) and SP-D(n/CRD) were purified from inclusion bodies and cell culture media supernatant, respectively (16Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Google Scholar, 25Shrive A.K. Tharia H.A. Strong P. Kishore U. Burns I. Rizkallah P.J. Reid K.B. Greenhough T.J. J. Mol.

EMSA Assay—DNA-protein complexes were prepared for gel shift analyses by incubating 0.1-0.4 μg of linear plasmid DNA with protein in a 20-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, or 5 mm MgCl2, or 5 mm MnCl2, or 5 mm EDTA buffer as described previously (27Tseng M. Palaniyar N. Zhang W. Evans D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21637-21644Google Scholar). After 20-60 min at 37 °C, the DNA-protein complexes were fractionated by agarose gel (0.8 or 1%, w/v) electrophoresis in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8) buffer in the absence or presence of 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized by UV transilluminator as described previously (27Tseng M. Palaniyar N. Zhang W. Evans D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21637-21644Google Scholar, 28Palaniyar N. Gerasimopoulos E. Evans D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 9-20Google Scholar). Protease Assay—SP-D (1.5 μg) and DNA (400 ng) were allowed to form complexes as described in EMSA and were treated either with 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 20 mm octyl glucoside, or 500 μg/ml proteinase K (Promega) in a 20-μl reaction for 1 h at 37 °C. In the collagenase experiment, SP-D (500 ng) was first treated with enzyme (40 μg, type 1 collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum, >90% pure; Calbiochem) in a 20-μl reaction for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated with DNA (400 ng) for 1 h at 37 °C. In another reaction, SP-D (500 ng) was first incubated with DNA (400 ng) in a 20-μl volume for 1 h at 37 °C and then treated with enzyme for 1 h at 37 °C. Dot Blot—SP-D (370 ng) and linear pUC18 DNA (150 ng and 2-fold dilutions) were carefully dotted (1 μl) onto Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane discs (Amersham Biosciences) and allowed to dry in a Petri dish. Membranes were incubated with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.02% (v/v) Tween (PBST) buffer for 18 h at 4 °C. Remaining procedures were carried out at 23 °C. Membranes were washed three times with 20 ml of PBST for 5-10 min on a shaker. Membranes were either incubated with 10 ml of PBST or PBST with SP-D (0.5 μg/ml) for 1 h. The membranes were washed as above and incubated further with 10 ml of biotinylated rabbit polyclonal anti-human SP-D(GXY)8(n/CRD) antibody (1 μg/ml) for 1 h. Antibody was washed away as described above, and the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:10,000) for 20 min. SP-D complexes were detected by ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot—Proteins were separated in a gradient polyacrylamide gel (4-20% (w/v); Bio-Rad), soaked in transfer buffer (49 mm Tris-HCl, 39 mm glycine, 0.0375% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.3) for 0.5 h, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Dorset, England) by a semidry transfer apparatus (Biometra, Goettingen, Germany) at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 3 h. The membranes were blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBST, and the SP-D present on the membranes was detected as described for dot blots. Electron Microscopy—Mouse lung DNA and proteins were incubated in the DNA binding buffer, spread in a thin layer on carbon-coated specimen grids, negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate, and examined using a Jeol JEM 1010 or 100 CX electron microscope (Leica UK Ltd., Cambridge, England) (18Palaniyar N. Ridsdale R.A. Holterman C.E. Inchley K. Possmayer F. Harauz G. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 297-310Google Scholar, 27Tseng M. Palaniyar N. Zhang W. Evans D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21637-21644Google Scholar). Biotinylation of Carbohydrate Ligands—Yeast mannan was biotinylated as described previously (8Nadesalingam J. Bernal A.L. Dodds A.W. Willis A.C. Mahoney D.J. Day A.J. Reid K.B. Palaniyar N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25678-25687Google Scholar). Briefly, mannan (1 mg/ml) was reacted with 1.5 mm NaIO4 in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) for 30 min on ice, and the reaction was stopped with 15 mm glycerol. The mixture was dialyzed into 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) for 18 h at 4 °C and reacted with 5 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce, Perbio Science, Cheshire, England) for 2 h at 23 °C in the same buffer. The mixture was dialyzed for 18 h at 4 °C to remove non-reacted biotin and stored at the same temperature. Oligonucleotides, 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ (22-mer; Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) and 5′-TCCATGAGCTTCCTGAGTCT-3′ (20-mer; Applied Biosciences) that contained 5′ biotin anchor were purchased. SPR Analyses—Biotinylated oligonucleotides (2.5 μg/ml) or mannan (200 μg/ml) were immobilized on a streptavidin SA chip (BIAcore 2000, Herts, England). The biotinylated ligands were diluted in 10 mm NaOAc (pH 5.5) buffer and immobilized on individual streptavidin-coated chips by injecting them at 5 μl/min for 5-10 min. Leaving flow cell 1 as blank, the next three flow cells were used for immobilization of ligands. Free streptavidin in all flow cells was blocked with biotin, and the flow cell surface was normalized with 50% (v/v) glycerol solution. Binding of proteins (0-50 μg/ml) to the oligonucleotides was analyzed in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm CaCl2, and 0 or 150 mm NaCl buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. In competition assays, SP-D (1 or 5 μg/ml) or SP-D(GXY)8(n/CRD) (200 μg/ml) was allowed to bind (10 μl/min) to immobilized mannan in the presence of different concentrations of competitors (0-80 mm). The SPR response obtained in the absence of any competitor was considered as 100%, and the relative binding was calculated for each competitor concentration. Binding of SP-D(G-XY)8(n/CRD) to Apoptotic Cells—Nicked DNA of apoptotic Jurkat cells (Apo-direct, BD PharMingen) was labeled with Cy3-dUTP by deoxynucleotidyl transferase as described by the manufacturers (Apo-direct, BD PharMingen). These cells were incubated with FITC-labeled SP-D(GXY)8(n/CRD) fragment in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 for 20-30 min at 23 °C, fixed with 0.5% (v/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed, and resuspended in PBS. Distribution of the labels was determined by FACS (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, England) and confocal microscopy (Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, England). In FACS experiments involving apoptotic mouse alveolar macrophages (29Clark H. Palaniyar N. Strong P. Edmondson J. Hawgood S. Reid K.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2892-2899Google Scholar), different concentrations (0, 4, and 20 μg/ml) of SP-D(GXY)8(n/CRD) were incubated with the cells, followed by staining with propidium iodide. Detection of Collectin Binding to Bacterial DNA by EMSA—To determine whether collectins bind DNA, we incubated linear plasmid DNA with collectins and related proteins and analyzed the complexes in agarose gels. This EMSA showed that native forms of SP-D, MBL, and C1q, but not SP-A, shifted the migration pattern of the DNA in the gel (Fig. 1A). SP-D(n/CRD), a yeast-expressed, recombinant ∼60 kDa trimeric subunit fragment of SP-D that contains only the coiled-coil neck and the CRDs, as well as a known DNA-binding pentraxin, serum amyloid component P (SAP), did not shift the DNA bands in EMSA. Because both SAP (30Hind C.R. Collins P.M. Renn D. Cook R.B. Caspi D. Baltz M.L. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 1058-1069Google Scholar) and CRDs of surfactant proteins have lectin domains and bind agarose to varying degrees, the DNA binding ability of these proteins might partly be competed by the matrix. These experiments showed that in addition to the non-collectin, subcomponent C1q of the classical complement pathway (31Jiang H. Cooper B. Robey F.A. Gewurz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25597-25601Google Scholar), innate immune collectins could bind DNA. These EMSA results were consistent with the interpretation that, similar to the collagen-like regions of C1q (31Jiang H. Cooper B. Robey F.A. Gewurz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25597-25601Google Scholar), SP-D and MBL bound DNA via their collagen-like regions, or that oligomerization of the proteins was required for the formation of large complexes. Interestingly, SP-D bound DNA even at 1 m NaCl concentration, indicating that this collectin strongly interacted with DNA (Fig. 1B). Because calcium and other divalent cations affect the structure and function of collectins (16Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Google Scholar), we examined the effect of these ions on collectin-DNA interactions. SP-D bound more effectively to DNA in the presence of 5 mm calcium, magnesium, and manganese than EDTA (Fig. 1C). The ion-dependent increase in the binding of SP-D to DNA was detectable only with supercoiled but not linearized DNA. Hence, these results suggest that the structure of DNA is important for SP-D-DNA interactions, and that both lectin and non-lectin types of binding may be involved in the formation of these complexes. Determination of the Nature of SP-D-DNA Complexes—To determine the types of complexes formed by SP-D, we incubated SP-D (1.5 μg) with linear pUC18 DNA (400 ng) in the standard DNA-binding buffer for 1 h at 37 °C and added either SDS (0.05%, w/v), octyl glucoside (20 mm), or proteinase K (500 μg/ml) and incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. DNA-protein complexes were size-fractionated in an agarose gel, and the DNA present in each complex was visualized with ethidium bromide staining and UV light. Linear DNA (Fig. 2A, lane 2) migrated into the gel, and no noticeable amount of DNA was present in SP-D preparations (Fig. 2A, lane 3). SP-D retarded the mobility of the DNA, and the DNA complexes were detected in the wells (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Although SDS did not alter the migration of DNA in the gel (Fig. 2A, lane 5), this strong anionic detergent disassociated the DNA from the complexes (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Hence, SP-D-DNA complexes were formed by noncovalent interactions. A non-ionic mild detergent, octyl glucoside, neither affected the DNA (Fig. 2A, lane 7) nor SP-DDNA complexes (Fig. 2A, lane 8). Therefore, SP-D-DNA complexes were strong and likely involved charge interactions. Digestion of these complexes with proteinase K resulted in the release of DNA, indicating that they were formed by protein-DNA interactions (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10). To further show that these complexes were formed by SP-D, we treated the complexes with collagenase enzyme and analyzed the samples by agarose gels, SDS-PAGE under reducing and denaturing conditions, and Western blots to specifically visualize the DNA, proteins, and SP-D, respectively (Fig. 2, B-D). Linear pUC18 DNA contained no aggregated complexes (Fig. 2, B-D, lanes 2). The 110-kDa collagenase enzyme neither showed any aggregates (Fig. 2, B-D, lanes 3) nor affected the mobility of DNA (data not shown). SP-D itself did not contain any significant amount of DNA or DNA-protein complexes when 500 ng of protein was used (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Under reducing and denaturing conditions, SP-D migrated at about 43 kDa (Fig. 2C, lane 4) and was detected by anti-SP-D antibody (Fig. 2D, lane 4). The agarose gel showed that SP-D formed complexes and shifted the DNA to the wells (Fig. 2B, lane 5). Under reducing and denaturing conditions, SP-D separated away from DNA without any noticeable change to its structure (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 5). When the SP-D was digested with collagenase for 1 h and then incubated with DNA, no shift in the mobility of DNA was noticed (Fig. 2B, lane 6). SDS-PAGE and Western blots showed that the collagen-like region of SP-D was digested by the collagenase (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 6). The calculated molecular mass of the collagenase-resistant fragment of SP-D was ∼16 kDa, and this was consistent with the protein detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot after the enzyme digestion. Interestingly, when the collagenase was added after the formation of SP-D-DNA complexes, the enzyme did not completely eliminate these complexes (Fig. 2B, lane 7) suggesting that bound DNA may protect the collagen-like region from collagenase digestion. SDS-PAGE and Western blots showed that the collagen-like region of approximately half of the SP-D molecules was intact (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 7). In the absence of DNA, collagenase completely digested the collagen-like regions of SP-D (Fig. 2, B-D, lanes 8). These results established that SP-D bound DNA, and that the collagen-like region of the protein was important for the formation of large SP-D-DNA complexes and subsequent gel shift. Binding of SP-D to Immobilized DNA—To directly show that SP-D could bind DNA, we first immobilized linearized plasmid DNA on nitrocellulose membranes and incubated the membranes with buffer or SP-D (0.5 μg/ml). After washing the membranes, SP-D was detected by anti-SP-D antibody and ECL reagents. SP-D antibody detected the 370 ng of SP-D spotted on both membranes equally well (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 1). The polyclonal antibody did not show any significant binding to DNA in the absence of SP-D (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The dot blot showed that SP-D bound to the DNA present on the membrane in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, lane 2). These results showed that SP-D directly interacted with DNA. Visualization of SP-D-Genomic DNA Complexes by Electron Microscopy—To obtain further confirmatory evidence of SP-D interacting with DNA, we examined the binding of SP-D to mouse lung genomic DNA by electron microscopy (Fig. 4). DNA was detected as long strands on the carbon support film (Fig. 4, A and E). SAP appeared as pentamers (Fig. 4B), which avidly bound DNA (Fig. 4F). When SP-D(n/CRD) was incubated with DNA, it coated the entire DNA (Fig. 4, C and G). Similar complexes were obtained when SP-D(GXY)8(n/CRD) was incubated with the DNA (Fig. 4, D and H). Interestingly, these complexes were very different compared with the native SP-D-DNA assemblies. Native SP-D, which contained long collagen-like fibrillar regions, efficiently spooled the DNA into aggregates (Fig. 5, A and B). The hub and nearby collagen-like regions preferentially bound DNA (Fig. 5C), suggesting that this collectin also interacted with the ligand probably via polyionic interactions. These images (Figs. 4 and 5) suggested that both globular and collagen-like regions of the collectin interacted effectively with DNA. SPR Analysis of Interaction between Collectins and Oligonucleotides—To characterize collectin-DNA interaction using a more sensitive system, we allowed the proteins to bind to short oligonucleotides (22-mer) that were immobilized on a BIAcore chip. The SPR response showed that although SP-A bound oligonucleotides in a low ionic strength buffer, it progressively lost DNA-binding ability as the ionic strength increased (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, SP-D bound to DNA in 150 mm NaCl buffer (Fig. 6C). Hence, SP-D, but not SP-A, interacted with the oligonucleotides under physiological salt concentrations (Fig. 6). MBL showed a moderate level of binding under physiological salt conditions (data not shown). We conducted similar SPR experiments with another biotinylated oligonucleotide (20-mer). Similar levels of SP-D binding were observed for both of those oligonucleotides (data not shown). Although the SPR response of SP-D-oligonucleotide (Fig. 6) was relatively small compared with SP-D-mannan ligand (8Nadesalingam J. Bernal A.L. Dodds A.W. Willis A.C. Mahoney D.J. Day A.J. Reid K.B. Palaniyar N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25678-25687Google Scholar), these results suggested that all three collectins bound single-stranded short oligonucleotides. SPR Analyses of Competition of Collectin-Carbohydrate Interactions—To directly investigate whether collectins could bind pentoses, the carbohydrate moieties present in nucleic acids, we allowed SP-D to bind immobilized mannan present on a BIAcore chip in the presence of different concentrations of hexoses or pentoses (Figs. 7 and 8). BIAcore assays behaved similarly to the conventional ELISA system (32Holmskov U.L. APMIS Suppl. 2000; 100: 1-59Google Scholar), and maltose, mannose, myo-inositol, and glucose inhibited the interaction between SP-D and mannan with relatively low IC50 values compared with those of d-fucose, d-galactose, and GlcNAc (Fig. 7). We conducted competition experiments under identical conditions for pentoses (Fig. 8). d-Arabinose and glucose inhibited binding with a similar IC50 value (Figs. 7A and 8A). Furthermore, d-ribose was a better competitor than d-2-deoxyribose, and they competed with IC50 values comparable with those of d-galactose, d-fucose, and GlcNAc (Figs. 7A and 8A). Interestingly, the d-forms of all three of these pentoses inhibited better than their l-forms of the respective sugars (Fig. 8, A and B). Because nucleic acids contain"

In adults and older children, the perception of an object and the organization of actions on it are seamlessly integrated.

They try, for example, to sit in a dollhouse chair or to get into a small toy car.

https://openalex.org/W1991365348,"Ganglioside GM1 has been considered to have a neurotrophic factor-like activity. To analyze the effects of endogenously generated GM1, the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was transfected with the GM1/GD1b/GA1 synthase gene and showed increased expression levels of GM1. To our surprise, GM1+-transfectant cells (GM1+ cells) showed no neurite formation after stimulation with nerve growth factor (NGF). Autophosphorylation of NGF receptor TrkA and activation of ERK1/2 after NGF treatment were scarcely detected in GM1+ cells. Binding of 125I-NGF to PC12 cells was almost equivalent between GM1+ cells and controls. However, dimer formation of TrkA upon NGF treatment was markedly suppressed in GM1+ cells in both cross-linking analysis with Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate 3 and 125I-NGF binding assay. The sucrose density gradient fractionation of the cell lysate revealed that TrkA primarily located in the lipid raft fraction moved to the non-raft fraction in GM1+ cells. p75NTR and Ras also moved from the raft to non-raft fraction in GM1+ cells, whereas flotillin and GM1 persistently resided in the lipid raft. TrkA kinase activity was differentially regulated when GM1 was added to the kinase assay system in vitro, suggesting suppressive/enhancing effects of GM1 on NGF signals based on the concentration. Measurement of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed that the membrane fluidity was reduced in GM1+ cells. These results suggested that overexpressed GM1 suppresses the differentiation signals mediated by NGF/TrkA by modulating the properties of the lipid raft and the intracellular localization of NGF receptors and relevant signaling molecules.

Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, are thought to play important roles in the development and function of the nervous system, because they accumulate in brain tissues of vertebrates, and their profiles of carbohydrate moiety alter with development (1Wiegandt H. Glycolipids. Elsevier Science, New York1985: 199-260Google Scholar, 2Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1965; 12: 969-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of glycosyltransferase genes have been isolated, and studies of these genes have shown that the various expression patterns of gangliosides are determined basically by the combination of activated glycosyltransferase genes (3Lloyd K.O. Furukawa K. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Among complex gangliosides, GM112 has been most rigorously studied, because it is one of the major gangliosides in vertebrate brain (2Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1965; 12: 969-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and shows specific binding with the cholera toxin B subunit resulting in important biological events such as cAMP response (4Fishman P.H. Brady R.O. Science. 1976; 194: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Since GM1 synthase cDNA was isolated by us (5Miyazaki H. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Hasegawa T. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24794-24799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the mRNA expression of the gene has been directly examined, and a high expression level in the rat fetal brain has been demonstrated. Recently, membrane microdomains such as glycolipid-enriched microdomains, detergent-insoluble microdomains, or lipid rafts have been thought of as sites for signal transduction as well as for endocytosis and cholesterol turnover on the cell membrane (6Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). They are enriched in cholesterol, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, sphingomyelin, glycosphingolipids, and various signaling molecules such as growth factor receptors, G-proteins, and Src family tyrosine kinases (7Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9138Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although ganglioside GM1 has been used as a mere marker of rafts, we demonstrated that GM1 might regulate the signal magnitude of PDGF/PDGFR by altering the intracellular localization of PDGF receptor (R) in Swiss3T3 cells (8Mitsuda T. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11239-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There have also been a number of reports indicating the effects of glycosphingolipids on the growth/differentiation signals (9Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10231-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). These reports suggested that GM1 might affect the structure/function of lipid rafts in neuronal cells, resulting in the regulation of differentiation/proliferation signals. A rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 has been widely used as a differentiation model of neuronal cells, because they show neurite extension after nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation (10Green L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar). The effects of NGF are mediated at least in part by TrkA (11Klein R. Jing S.Q. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), the high affinity NGF receptor containing a tyrosine kinase activity. Mutoh et al. (12Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) demonstrated that GM1 binds to TrkA tightly on the surface of PC12 cells and enhances the effects of NGF (12Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Exogenous GM1 enhanced the TrkA phosphorylation and neurite formation when added with a low concentration of NGF. Furthermore, it could rescue PC12 cells from apoptotic death induced by serum deprivation (13Ferrari G. Anderson B.L. Stephens R.H. Kaplan D.R. Green L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3074-3080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These results seemed to reflect the neurotrophic nature of GM1. However, it is not clear whether endogenously generated GM1 plays the same roles as exogenous GM1. In the present study, we established stable transfectant lines of PC12 with the GM1/GD1b/GA1 synthase cDNA, which we had isolated previously (5Miyazaki H. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Hasegawa T. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24794-24799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and analyzed the response to NGF. To our surprise, marked alterations in the cell response to the induced differentiation and in the activation of signaling molecules were found in GM1+ cells. We also demonstrated dramatic changes in the intracellular localization of NGF receptors and relevant molecules, i.e. the majority of TrkA, p75NTR, and Ras moved from the raft to the non-raft fraction in GM1+ cells, whereas the raft markers such as GM1 and flotillin persistently stayed in the raft fraction. These results suggested that GM1 plays critical roles in the regulation of the physicochemical nature of lipid raft and of the bio-signals to determine the cell fates.

Recombinant DNA—Human β1,3-galactosyltransferase cDNA clone pM1T-9 (5Miyazaki H. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Hasegawa T. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24794-24799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was digested with XhoI-XbaI and inserted into the XhoIXbaI site of pMIKneo to obtain pMIKneo/M1T-9. pMIKneo is a mammalian expression vector with the SRα promoter and was generously presented by Dr. K. Maruyama (Tokyo Medical and Dental University). Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 as described previously (14Fukumoto S. Mutoh T. Hasegawa T. Miyazaki H. Okada M. Goto G. Furukawa K. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5832-5838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PC12 cells used for cDNA transfection were plated in a 60-mm plastic tissue culture plate (Falcon) at a density of 7 × 105 cells/4 ml/plate. The plasmid pMIKneo/M1T-9 (4 μg) was transfected into cells with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectant cells were selected in the presence of 250 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and maintained continuously in the presence of G418 (200 μg/ml). Neurite Outgrowth Assay—PC12 cells and the transfectants were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well in a type I collagen-coated 48-well culture plate (Falcon) and were either treated with 100 ng/ml 2.5S NGF (Alamone Laboratories) in serum-free medium or left untreated in the serum-containing medium. Neurite-bearing cells were counted for the following 4 days. To analyze the effect of exogenous GM1 on neurite outgrowth, PC12 cells were treated with either serum-free medium or medium containing 100 ng/ml NGF, 5 ng/ml NGF, 50 μm GM1 (Sigma), or 5 ng/ml NGF with 50 μm GM1 (preincubated with 50 μm GM1 for 12 h at 37 °C, then treated with 5 ng/ml NGF). The percentage of cells bearing neurites of various lengths was counted from days 1 to 4. Flow Cytometry—The cell surface expression of gangliosides was analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences), using the anti-ganglioside mAbs as described previously (8Mitsuda T. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11239-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); mAbM2590 (anti-GM3), mAb10-11 (anti-GM2), mAb92-22 (anti-GD1a), mAbR24 (anti-GD3), mAb220-51 (anti-GD2), mAb370 (anti-GD1b), mAb CDR73-6 (anti-fucosyl-GM1), and mAb549 (anti-GT1b). The cells were incubated with mAbs for 45 min on ice and then stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC). To analyze GM1, cells were incubated with the CTB subunit-biotin conjugates (List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA) for 45 min on ice, and then stained with FITC-conjugated avidin (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA). Control samples were prepared using the second antibody alone. The intensity of staining was measured and presented in arbitrary units as the log of fluorescent intensity. MTT Assay—3 × 103 cells were seeded with serum-containing medium in 98-well plates. At 0-5 day of culture, MTT assay was performed as described (8Mitsuda T. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11239-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Growth of cells was quantified by assessing the reduction of MTT to formazan, measured as the absorbance at 590 nm using a plate reader ImmunoMini NJ-2300 (System Instrument, Tokyo, Japan). Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—PC12 cells and transfectants were plated in 60-mm tissue culture plates in serum-containing medium, then cells were treated as described below. For the assay of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and TrkA phosphorylation, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium and incubated for 1 h. Then cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml 2.5S NGF for 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C. After each treatment, the medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with 3 ml of serum-free medium, then solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml aprotinin). Lysed cells were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected to remove nuclei. Lysates were separated with SDS-PAGE using 7-12% gels. The separated proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked with 10% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h. The membrane was first probed for 1 h with primary antibodies at the dilution suggested by the suppliers. After washing three times with PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), the blots were then incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgGs or goat anti-mouse IgGs conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:4000). After the membranes were washed three times with PBST, bound conjugates were visualized with an ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Science). For detection of GM1, the membranes were probed with CTB-biotin (1:500) and detected with an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). To analyze the effects of the reduced GT1b expression, the transfectant cells were cultured with exogenous GT1b (50 μm) and used for immunoblotting as described above after confirmation of GT1b incorporation on the cell surface with flow cytometry. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 60 mm β-octylglucoside, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin). After sonication (3 × 20 s), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C (10,000 × g for 2 min). The lysate was incubated with antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The immune-complex was precipitated after incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, and the precipitates were solubilized in a Laemmli sample buffer by heating for 3 min at 98 °C. TrkA Receptor Cross-linking—Cells were plated at a density of 6 × 106/10-cm dish, and serum-starved for 1 h before NGF treatment. Then, cells were washed with plain medium without serum and treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then cross-linked using 1 mm BS3 in a cross-linking buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.5, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA) at 4 °C for 1 h. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by adding 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 0.1 m. Then, cells were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline and lysed in the lysis buffer as described above. TrkA was immunoprecipitated, and immunoprecipitates were separated on a 7% gel with an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 200:1. Samples were transferred onto membranes and immunoblotted with an anti-Trk antibody (B-3). Isolation of Raft Fraction—Microdomain rafts were prepared using a non-detergent extraction method essentially as described by Song et al. (15Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 107/15-cm dish and cultured up to 90% confluency, and five dishes of cells were used for each preparation. After being washed twice with ice-cold PBS, the cells were scraped in 1 ml of 0.5 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 11.0. The cells were homogenized sequentially using a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts), and a sonicator (three 20-s bursts). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The homogenate (1 ml) was then adjusted to 45% (w/v) sucrose by adding 1 ml of 90% (w/v) sucrose prepared in 2× MNE buffer (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). The final pH of the mixture was 10.2. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed by overlaying 2 ml of 35% (w/v) sucrose onto the mixture, and then 1 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose was overlaid. Both of these layers were prepared with MNE containing 0.25 m sodium carbonate. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g in an SW50.1 rotor for 16 h at 4 °C. From the top of the gradient, 0.5 ml of each fraction was collected to yield 10 fractions. The components in each fraction were concentrated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C in MNE buffer, and precipitates were resolved in the lysis buffer and used for immunoprecipitation or Western immunoblotting. NGF-TrkA Cross-linking—Cells were resuspended in a binding buffer (Hanks' containing 1 mg/ml each of glucose and bovine serum albumin) at 5 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 1 nm125I-NGF (2750 dpm). To correct the nonspecific binding, unlabeled NGF (1 μm) was added during the binding. To cross-link NGF with TrkA, BS3 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After the cross-linking reaction was terminated, cells were washed and lysed in the lysis buffer. The lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with an anti-Trk antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were separated using a 7% gel as described above. 125I-NGF-bound proteins were detected with autoradiography using an imaging plate and BAS2000 Bioimage Analyzer™ (Fujifilm, Tokyo). NGF Binding Assay—Cells were resuspended in a binding buffer at 1 × 105 cells/0.2 ml and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with various concentrations (5 pm to 10 nm) of 125I-NGF. The reaction mixture was overlaid onto 5% bovine serum albumin in 0.32 m sucrose and was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, and the tips of tubes containing the cell pellets were cut off. A 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled NGF was used to assess the nonspecific binding. The radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter, and the results were analyzed on the basis of Scatchard plot. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The PC12 lysate was used for immunoprecipitation with an anti-TrkA antibody as described above. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with the Tris-buffered saline containing a phosphatase inhibitor (100 μm Na3VO4). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a tyrosine kinase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm Na3VO4, 5 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP) and then incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of various concentrations of GM1. The kinase reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli sample buffer followed by boiling. Relative kinase activity was measured by scanning the bands in the autoradiogram as described above. The effects of GM3 or GT1b were also examined for comparison. Immunofluorescence Study—Cells were cultured on a poly-l-lysinecoated coverslip, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Then, cells were treated with CTB-Alexa555 (10 μg/ml) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The fixed cells were analyzed with a confocal laser microscope Fluoview FV500™ (Olympus, Tokyo). Rho Kinase Assay—To determine the alteration in the activation levels of Rho, activated Rho was isolated and analyzed with the method of Ren et al. (16Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) using a Rho Activation Assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were plated at a density of 6 × 106/10 cm dish. After being washed, cells were lysed with lysis buffer, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with Rhotekin-RBD beads under rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, and the precipitates were solubilized in a Laemmli sample buffer, heated for 3 min at 98 °C, and then separated in SDS-PAGE. Bound Rho proteins were detected by Western immunoblotting using an anti-Rho polyclonal antibody in the kit. Measurement of the Membrane Fluidity by Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—Cells were cultured on a glass bottom dish coated with poly-d-lysine, and the medium was replaced with a standard external solution (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose) prewarmed at 37 °C. A fluorescent probe, DiI (DiIC18; D-282, Molecular probes, Eugene OR) was added to the standard external solution at 2.5 μg/ml and incubated for 10 min, to be incorporated into the cell membranes. FRAP analyses were performed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus) equipped with a stage heater at 37 °C. A small area of the labeled membrane was photobleached by full laser power (100%), resulting in the immediate reduction of the intensity of fluorescence. A selected area (3-μm square) on the labeled cell membrane was photobleached for 8-15 s by a 488-nm laser beam. Then, the fluorescence recovery in the photobleached area was immediately recorded using a time-lapse option of the system until the fluorescence was recovered at a plateau level. Relative recovery in fluorescence intensity was calculated for 60 s after photobleaching and analyzed by Microsoft Excel. FRAP was calculated by a ratio of post-bleach intensity/pre-bleach intensity, and the membrane fluidity was evaluated by comparing the percentage of FRAP to a plateau as follows. Fluorescence intensities at a pre-photobleach state and the post-photobleach intensities at a plateau were expressed as average values of 10 scans. In each experiment, the value obtained at pre-photobleach was taken as 100% and that at just after photobleach was taken as 0% to compensate for the differences among experiments. The half-maximal recovery of fluorescence (t½) was also calculated on the basis of the duration (t) of fluorescence recovery reaching a plateau. Expression of Gangliosides in GM1 Synthase Gene Transfectant Cells (GM1+Cells)—After the transfection of PC12 cells with a GM1 synthase gene expression vector (pMIKneo/M1T-9), or pMIKneo, two transfectant lines (M1 and M3) and two vector controls (V1 and V2) were established, respectively. Expression profiles of gangliosides were examined by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A). The mean fluorescence values of individual gangliosides obtained by subtracting those of corresponding controls are shown in Fig. 1B. Among the gangliosides examined, expression levels of GM1 and fucosyl-GM1 markedly increased in the transfectants (M3 and M6). Expression levels of other gangliosides showed no apparent change compared with those in the vector control lines (V1 and V2) except that GT1b expression level reduced after the transfection. To compare the distribution pattern of GM1 on the cell membrane, we stained the cultured cells with CTB-Alexa555. Whereas GM1 in vector control cells showed a weak and patched distribution, those in the GM1+ cells showed very strong staining and a uniform and thick distribution throughout the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). No Neurite Extension with NGF in PC12 Cells Transfected with GM1 Synthase cDNA—To examine the effects of GM1 expressed endogenously on NGF-induced differentiation, the GM1+ cells and vector controls were cultured with or without 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 days. Fig. 2 shows the morphological change in controls and GM1+ cells after 5 days of NGF treatment. As reported previously, cell proliferation was reduced and neurite formation was observed in vector control cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the GM1+ cells showed no neurite extension, although cell proliferation was not affected (Fig. 2, A and B). Quantitative analysis of the neurite formation revealed that only 10-20% of GM1+ cells showed neurites longer than twice the cell diameter even on day 4 of culture (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, 80% of control cells showed neurites longer than twice the diameter. Although the vector controls showed little neurite outgrowth when treated with low density of NGF (5 ng/ml), the pretreatment with GM1 (50 μm) enhanced the outgrowth as previously reported (12Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 13Ferrari G. Anderson B.L. Stephens R.H. Kaplan D.R. Green L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3074-3080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In contrast, GM1+ cells showed no neurite outgrowth even when stimulated with a high concentration of NGF (100 ng/ml) (data not shown). Reduced Phosphorylation of TrkA and ERKs with NGF Treatment—It has been known that exogenously added GM1 enhanced NGF-induced neurite extension. To determine the effects of the overexpressed GM1 on NGF-derived signals in the GM1+ cells, the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of Trk after NGF treatment was investigated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was detected at 5 min after NGF treatment and gradually reduced in the control cells (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was scarcely detected in the GM1+ cells. As for the downstream ERK1/2 phosphorylation, only weak phosphorylation was found at 5 min after the NGF stimulation in the GM1+ cells correspondingly with the reduced phosphorylation of TrkA (Fig. 3B). In the control cells, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was clearly detected at 5 min after NGF treatment with subsequent slow reduction. Immunoblots with anti-ERK1/2 antibody demonstrated that applied lysates contained equivalent amounts of ERK proteins (Fig. 3B, bottom panels). To examine the effects of the reduced GT1b expression level in the GM1+ cells, the transfectant cells were cultured in the presence of exogenous GT1b and were analyzed for the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. GT1b was well incorporated on the membrane (Fig. 3C). The phosphorylation patterns of ERK1/2 after NGF stimulation showed no change after GT1b incorporation, suggesting that the reduced NGF signals in the GM1+ cells were not due to the loss of GT1b expression. NGF Binding Was Equivalent between the Controls and GM1+Cells—Using gradually diluted 125I-labeled NGF, NGF binding to the controls and to the GM1+ cells was investigated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nonspecific binding of 125I-labeled NGF was determined by adding excess amounts (×1000) of cold NGF, and the values were used to subtract from the individual counts. The 125I-labeled NGF specifically bound to PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The Scatchard plots indicated that PC12 cells express two kinds of NGF receptors, i.e. a high affinity receptor and a low affinity receptor, as previously reported. Bmax values calculated from the high affinity binding curves were 2.52 × 102 pmol/105 cells and 2.62 × 102 pmol/105 cells for V1 and V2, respectively. Those for M3 and M6 were 2.08 × 102 pmol/105 cells and 2.44 × 102 pmol/105 cells, respectively (Fig. 4). In addition, the dissociation constants (Kd values) of NGF were 0.55 and 0.53 nm for V1 and V2, respectively, and Kd values for M3 and M6 were 0.46 and 0.55 nm, respectively (Fig. 4). There were no significant differences in the binding levels and kinetics between the control cells and the GM1+ cells, suggesting that overexpressed GM1 did not disturb the NGF binding itself. Reduced Dimerization of TrkA with NGF Treatment in the GM1+Cells—The GM1+ cells showed neither neurite extension nor signal activation after NGF treatment. Then, TrkA dimerization after NGF treatment was investigated. The cell surface proteins were cross-linked with BS3 under the NGF treatment as describe"
https://openalex.org/W2118919140,"Pifithrin-α (PFTα) was originally thought to be a specific inhibitor of signaling by the tumor suppressor protein p53. However, the laboratory that discovered pifithrin recently reported that the compound also inhibits heat shock and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling, and they suggested that PFTα targets a factor common to all three signal transduction pathways, such as the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery (Komarova, E. A., Neznanov, N., Komarov, P. G., Chernov, M. V., Wang, K., and Gudkov, A. V. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 15465–15468). Because it is important for the mechanistic study of this machinery to identify unique inhibitors of chaperone action, we have examined the effect of PFTα on transcriptional activation, the hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, and hsp90-dependent nuclear translocation for both p53 and the GR. At concentrations where PFTα blocks p53-mediated induction of p21/Waf-1 in human embryonic kidney cells, we observed no inhibition of GR-mediated induction of a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter in LMCAT cells. PFTα did, however, cause a left shift in the dexamethasone dose response curve by increasing intracellular dexamethasone concentration, apparently by competing for dexamethasone efflux from the cell. The assembly of p53 or GR heterocomplexes with hsp90 and immunophilins was not affected by PFTα either in vivo or in vitro and did not affect the nuclear translocation of either transcription factor. Thus, we conclude that PFTα does not inhibit GR-mediated induction or the function of the chaperone machinery, and, as originally thought, it may specifically inhibit p53 signaling by acting at a stage after p53 translocation to the nucleus.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor that induces growth arrest or apoptosis in response to a variety of stress signals (1Ljungman M.

Activation of p53-mediated apoptosis in response to a stress, such as DNA damage, results in the elimination of potential tumor cell precursors. Thus, p53 is referred to as a tumor suppressor, and p53 knock-out mice have a high incidence of spontaneous tumors (7Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery C.A. Butel J.S.

Subsequently, PFTα has been shown to protect against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in mouse heart (10Liu X. Chua C.C. Gao J. Chen Z. Landy C.L.C. Hamdy R. Chua B.H.L. Am. J.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The p53 protein itself or perhaps factors required for p53-mediated transcriptional activation have been thought to be the molecular target of PFTα. However, Komarova et al. (15Komarova E.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15465-15468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) recently published a report revealing that PFTα suppresses signaling through the heat shock transcription factor HSF1 and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) but not signaling by NF-κB. This finding indicated that PFTα may not specifically target p53 but targets some unknown cellular component that is common for three major signal transduction pathways. Inasmuch as p53, HSF1, and the GR are all bound to and regulated by hsp90 (see Ref. 16Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar for review), it was suggested that heat shock proteins of the hsp90/hsp70-based machinery are obvious candidate targets for PFTα (15Komarova E.A.

We have recently demonstrated that p53·hsp90 and GR·hsp90 complexes exist in identical large heterocomplexes containing dynein and one of three immunophilins, namely FKBP52, cyclophilin 40 (CyP-40), or PP5 (17Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M.

The association of either transcription factor with hsp90 is critical both for maintenance of its inactive state and for rapid translocation to the nucleus after its activation by stress or steroid (16Pratt W.B.

Because it would be very useful to have additional inhibitors of the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery, we have tested the proposal of Komarova et al. (15Komarova E.A. Neznanov N. Komarov P.G. Chernov M.V. Wang K. Gudkov A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15465-15468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) by examining PFTα effects on p53-mediated and GR-mediated transcriptional activation, the formation of heterocomplexes with hsp90 and immunophilins, and the nuclear movement of the two transcription factors. We find that, at concentrations where PFTα abrogates p53-dependent induction of p21/Waf-1, there is no inhibition of dexamethasone-dependent activation from a GR-dependent reporter construct. However, PFTα did cause a left shift in the dose response curve of dexamethasone, apparently by competing for dexamethasone efflux from the cell. PFTα did not affect assembly of either p53·hsp90·immunophilin or GR·hsp90·immunophilin complexes in vivo or in vitro, and it did not affect nuclear translocation of either transcription factor. Our observations indicate that PFTα may very well be a specific inhibitor of p53 signaling that does not affect the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery and that inhibits p53 function at a stage after its translocation to the nucleus. Materials—PFTα (1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2-imino-3(2H)benzothiazolyl)ethanone hydrobromide) was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The mouse mammary tumor virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (MMTV-CAT) reporter plasmid and the mouse fibroblast L929 cell line stably transfected with MMTV-CAT (LMCAT cells) were provided by Dr. Edwin Sanchez (Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, OH). DLD-1 human colon adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HT29-tsp53 (formerly referred to as ts29-G cells) human colorectal cancer cells overexpressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of mouse p53 were described previously (20Merchant A.K. Loney T.L.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Cytosol Preparation—Cultures of mouse fibroblast L929 cells, L929 cells stably transfected with an MMTV-CAT reporter plasmid (LMCAT cells), HeLa cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, all expressing wild-type p53, were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. DLD-1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 1 mm pyruvate. Cells were harvested by scraping into Hanks' buffered saline solution and centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed in Hanks' buffered saline solution, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of HEM buffer (10 mm NaOH-Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm sodium molybdate, pH 7.4) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per 3 ml of buffer and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant, referred to as “cytosol,” was collected, aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at –70 °C. Mouse GR was expressed in Sf9 cells, and cytosol was prepared as described previously (22Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Li D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence of GR and p53—NIH 3T3 cells were grown on 11 × 22 mm coverslips placed in 35-mm culture wells in 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with bovine calf serum. When the cells were ∼50% confluent, the culture medium was replaced with phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped calf serum, and the cells were grown for an additional 24 h. Cells were incubated with 0.05% Me2SO or 100 μm PFTα for 2 h prior to the addition of 0.1% ethanol or 1 μm dexamethasone for 10 min to permit nuclear translocation of the GR. HT29-tsp53 cells were grown at 39 °C (non-permissive temperature) on coverslips placed in 35-mm culture wells in 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Nuclear translocation of p53 was triggered by reducing the incubation temperature of HT29-tsp53 cells from 39 to 32 °C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized by immersion in cold (–20 °C) methanol and immunostained by inverting the coverslip on a 50-μl solution of phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin containing 1 μl of the Ab-4 mouse monoclonal IgG against p53 or 1 μl of FiGR mouse monoclonal IgG overnight at 4 °C in a humid chamber. The coverslips were incubated with a washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 630 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at room temperature, and reincubated with 1:100 dilution of rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG counter-antibody for 2 h. Coverslips were rinsed in washing buffer for 30 min and mounted on microscope slides using a drop of mounting medium (1 mg/ml phenylenediamine in 10% phosphate-buffered saline and 90% glycerol, pH 9). Cells were observed with a Leitz Aristoplan epi-illumination microscope and scored for GR or p53 translocation as described previously (23Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Hously P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) using a score of 4 for nuclear fluorescence much greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 3 for nuclear fluorescence greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 2 for nuclear fluorescence equal to cytoplasmic fluorescence, 1 for nuclear fluorescence less than cytoplasmic fluorescence, and 0 for nuclear fluorescence much less than cytoplasmic fluorescence. The translocation scores represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments in which ≥ 50 cells per condition per experiment were counted. Transient Transfection of MMTV-CAT Reporter—L929 or HeLa cells were grown as monolayer cultures in 35-mm culture wells to ∼50% confluency, washed, and incubated for 1 h with 1 ml of serum-free medium containing 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of TransFast transfection reagent (Promega). The transfection medium was replaced with regular medium, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. During the incubation, cells were treated for 2 or 20 h with dexamethasone or PFTα or both as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2. GR-mediated Transcriptional Activation—Dexamethasone-induced CAT gene expression was assayed by measuring CAT enzymatic activity in HeLa, L cell, and LMCAT cell cytosol, using a modified version of the CAT assay described in Kwok et al. (24Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). LMCAT cells were grown in 35-mm culture wells to ∼50% confluence and incubated with varying concentrations of dexamethasone and PFTα for up to 24 h. Cells were washed, harvested, resuspended in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8), and ruptured by exposing the cell suspensions to three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatants was measured by a Bradford assay. Aliquots of the supernatants containing 10 μg of total protein were incubated for 15 min at 70 °C in 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The aliquots were added to a CAT reaction mixture (50 nm purified [3H]chloramphenicol, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.25 mm butyryl CoA) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. An organic phase mixture consisting of 2 parts pristane and 1 part mixed xylenes was added and samples were thoroughly subjected to a vortex. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and 150 μl of the organic phase was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Immunoadsorption of GR and p53—Receptors were immunoadsorbed from aliquots of 50 (for measuring steroid binding) or 100 μl (for Western blotting) of Sf9 cell cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 18 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 9 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 200 μl of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). p53 was immunoadsorbed from 250-μl aliquots of DLD-1 cytosol with 10 μl of Ab421 antibody. Prior to incubation with reticulocyte lysate, immunoadsorbed p53 and GR were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet for an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 350 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in TEG buffer. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). GR·hsp90 and p53·hsp90 Heterocomplex Reconstitution—Immunopellets containing GR or p53 stripped of chaperones were incubated with reticulocyte lysate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and for GR- or p53-associated proteins. Assay of Steroid Binding Capacity—For measuring hormone retention in intact cells, exponentially growing LMCAT cells (∼2 × 106 cells/25 cm2 flask) were incubated with 100 nm [3H]dexamethasone at 37 °C for 2 h in the absence or presence of 1,000-fold excess unlabeled dexamethasone and the presence of Me2SO or PFTα. Cells were washed, harvested, and suspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Specific binding activity was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity in the cells incubated in the presence of excess unlabeled dexamethasone. Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl of HEM buffer plus 100 nm [3H]dexamethasone. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM buffer and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]dexamethasone bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 50 μl of cytosol. For cytosols to be assayed for steroid binding, a 50 μl aliquot of cytosol was incubated overnight at 4 °Cin50 μl of HEM buffer with 100 nm [3H]dexamethasone plus or minus a 1,000-fold excess of non-radioactive dexamethasone. Samples were mixed with dextran-coated charcoal, centrifuged, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of bound [3H]dexamethasone/100 μl of cell cytosol. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Immune pellets were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.1% Ab-7 for p53, 0.25 μg/ml BuGR2 for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, 1 μg/ml anti-p21/Waf-1, 0.1% UPJ56 for FKBP52, 0.1% anti-cyclophilin 40, or 0.1% anti-PP5. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counterantibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. p53 was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Because PP5, FKBP52, and p53 migrate in the same region upon gel electrophoresis, we electrophoresed replicate samples of both non-immune and immune pellets and probed replicate immunoblots with an antibody specific for each protein. Thus, the Western blots of Figs. 5 and 6 are necessarily composites prepared from two or more replicate immunoblots.Fig. 6PFTα does not affect cell-free assembly of p53 or GR heterocomplexes with hsp90 and immunophilins. Replicate immunopellets of p53 (A) or GR (B) were stripped of associated chaperones, and the stripped immune pellets (Str) were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with reticulocyte lysate (RL), an ATP-regenerating system, 20 mm molybdate, and various concentrations of PFTα. Proteins in the washed immune pellets were resolved by electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Replicate GR immune pellets were incubated with [3H]dexamethasone to determine steroid binding activity. Lane 1 (counting from the left), stripped immune pellet; lanes 2–5, stripped pellet incubated with reticulocyte lysate and Me2SO vehicle (lane 2) or 10 (lane 3), 30 (lane 4), or 100 μm PFTα (lane 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PFTα Effect on p53- and GR-mediated Transcription—To confirm the activity of the PFTα preparation as an inhibitor of p53 signaling, HEK cells were treated with doxorubicin to cause DNA damage and activate p53. As shown in Fig. 1A, doxorubicin treatment causes an increase in the amount of p21/Waf-1 that is prevented by 10 μm PFTα. The PFTα inhibition of p21/Waf-1 induction is sustained over 24 h of doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1B). To determine the effect of PFTα on GR-mediated transcription, HeLa cells (Fig. 2A) or L929 mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 2B) were transiently transfected with an MMTV-CAT reporter plasmid and treated for 2 or 20 h with 1 μm dexamethasone or 30 μm PFTα or both prior to the assay of CAT activity. In both cell lines, there was a robust induction of CAT by dexamethasone that was not affected by PFTα. To further test any possible effect of PFTα on dexamethasone-dependent induction, we used a subline of L929 mouse fibroblasts stably transfected with an MMTV-CAT reporter plasmid (LMCAT cells) that was developed by Ning and Sanchez (25Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6073-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the LMCAT cells are treated with dexamethasone, there was an induction of CAT driven by the endogenous L cell GR. As shown in Fig. 3A, PFTα did not inhibit GR-mediated CAT induction when cells were treated with a high concentration (1 μm) of dexamethasone. At lower concentrations of dexamethasone and a short induction time, PFTα stimulated dexamethasone-dependent CAT induction (Fig. 3B). PFTα Increases the Concentration of Dexamethasone in Cells—Potentiation of a dexamethasone response like that shown in Fig. 3B has been reported with immunosuppressant drugs (reviewed in Ref. 26Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). It is known that both dexamethasone and the immunosuppressant drugs, such as FK506, are transported out of the cell by the multidrug transporter Mdr1, and Kralli and Yamamoto (27Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17152-17156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) showed that FK506 potentiates dexamethasone responsiveness in L cells by increasing dexamethasone accumulation without altering the hormone binding properties of the GR. Here, we show that PFTα did not affect the binding activity of the GR when it was added to cytosol (Fig. 4A), but treatment of LMCAT cells with PFTα increased the amount of [3H]dexamethasone bound to GRs in vivo (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, treatment with PFTα increased the amount of [3H]dexamethasone retained in the cell. This increase in intracellular dexamethasone is likely due to PFTα competition for efflux in the same manner as that seen with the immunosuppressant drugs, and it forms the basis for a potential drug interaction. PFTα Does Not Inhibit Assembly of Heterocomplexes with hsp90 and Immunophilins—To examine the effects of PFTα on the assembly of p53·hsp90·immunophilin complexes in vivo, we selected the DLD-1 human colorectal cancer cell line, which possesses a point mutation that converts serine 241 of p53 to phenylalanine (28Rodrigues N.R. Rowan A. Smith M.E.F. Kerr I.B. Bodmer W.F. Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7555-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). This mutant p53 is localized in the cytoplasm where it exists in cytosolic heterocomplexes with hsp90 (29Peng Y. Chen L. Li C. Lu W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the p53·hsp90 heterocomplexes contain the immunophilins that are present in GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes (17Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 is an immunoblot of hsp90 and the tetratricopeptide repeat domain immunophilins co-immunoadsorbed with p53 or the GR from cytosol prepared from untreated DLD-1 cells (Fig. 5, lanes 2) or DLD-1 cells treated with PFTα (lanes 3). In neither case did PFTα affect heterocomplex formation in vivo. Heterocomplexes with hsp90 and the tetratricopeptide repeat domain immunophilins that bind hsp90 can be assembled in vitro by incubating immunoadsorbed p53 or GR that has been stripped of endogenous bound chaperones with rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Fig. 6 presents immunoblots of hsp90 and immunophilins that associate with p53 (Fig. 6A) and the GR (Fig. 6B) during such cell-free heterocomplex assembly. It is clear that PFTα did not affect assembly in either case. When the GR is assembled into GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes, it is converted from a non-steroid binding state to a steroid binding state, and, as shown in the bar graph in Fig. 6B, the generation of steroid binding activity was not affected by pifithrin. PFTα Does Not Inhibit Nuclear Translocation of p53 or GR— Both p53 and the GR utilize an hsp90-dependent movement system for translocation to the nucleus along microtubular tracts driven by the cytoplasmic dynein motor protein (17Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M.

In the movement system, the immunophilins bind via their tetratricopeptide repeat domain to hsp90 and via their peptidylprolyl isomerase domain to the dynamitin component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex. Thus, rapid nuclear translocation of either the GR or p53 requires dynamic assembly of heterocomplexes with hsp90, and movement is impeded by geldanamycin and radicicol, which inhibit hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (17Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M.

Here, we do not find PFTα inhibition of hsp90 heterocomplex assembly with p53 or the GR, inhibition of functional opening of the steroid binding cleft in the GR, or inhibition of the nuclear transfer of either transcription factor. The absence of PFTα inhibition shows that PFTα must be inhibiting some step in the induction mechanism after p53 transfer to the nucleus. Because, in our hands, induction by the GR is not affected, we would suggest that PFTα is not inhibiting a coactivator common to both p53-dependent and GR-dependent responses.

We and others have previously identified molecular interactions between the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal end of PMCA and PDZ domain-containing proteins. These interactions suggested a new role for PMCA as a modulator of signal transduction pathways. The existence of other intracellular regions in the PMCA molecule prompted us to investigate the possible participation of other domains in interactions with different partner proteins. A two-hybrid screen of a human fetal heart cDNA library, using the region 652–840 of human PMCA4b (located in the catalytic, second intracellular loop) as bait, revealed a novel interaction between PMCA4b and the tumor suppressor RASSF1, a Ras effector protein involved in H-Ras-mediated apoptosis. Immunofluorescence co-localization, immunoprecipitation, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments performed in mammalian cells provided further confirmation of the physical interaction between the two proteins. The interaction domain has been narrowed down to region 74–123 of RASSF1C (144–193 in RASSF1A) and 652–748 of human PMCA4b. The functionality of this interaction was demonstrated by the inhibition of the epidermal growth factor-dependent activation of the Erk pathway when PMCA4b and RASSF1 were co-expressed. This inhibition was abolished by blocking PMCA/RASSSF1 association with an excess of a green fluorescent protein fusion protein containing the region 50–123 of RASSF1C. This work describes a novel protein-protein interaction involving a domain of PMCA other than the COOH terminus.

At present, four different PMCA isoforms, PMCA1–4, have been identified in mammals as the products of four independent genes (4Shull G.E. Greeb J. J. Biol.

The primary protein structure of PMCAs comprises 10 membrane-spanning segments, two major cytosolic loops, and NH2 and COOH cytoplasmic tails. The COOH-terminal tail contains an autoinhibitory domain (situated ∼40 amino acids downstream of the last transmembrane domain) that binds Ca2+-calmodulin and plays a major role in the regulation of the activity of the enzyme (11James P. Maeda M. Fischer R. Verma A.K. Krebs J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2905-2910Google Scholar, 12Enyedi A. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J. Filoteo A.G. Carafoli E.

In the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin, this domain interacts with two different regions of PMCA located in the first and second intracellular loops (13Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Brunner J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2930-2936Google Scholar, 14Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1612-1621Google Scholar). This intramolecular interaction keeps the pump in an inactive state. Elevation in the Ca2+-calmodulin levels prompts high affinity binding to the autoinhibitory domain, releasing inhibition, and stimulating pump activity. Our group and others have identified other molecular interactions involving the COOH-terminal region and PDZ domain-containing proteins. These proteins include members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family (15Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1591-1595Google Scholar, 16DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Google Scholar), cytoskeletal proteins (17Zabe M. Dean W.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Google Scholar), nitric-oxide synthase I (nNOS) (19Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Telkamp M. Röthlein N. Neyses L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 201-205Google Scholar), calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) (20Schuh K Uldrijan S Gambaryan S. Röthlein N. Neyses L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9778-9783Google Scholar), and a novel protein named PISP (PMCA-interacting single-PDZ protein) (21Goellner G.M. DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 461-471Google Scholar). These interactions suggest a new function of PMCA as a modulator of intracellular signaling pathways. In fact, by placing interaction partners in a cellular microenvironment, where the concentrations of Ca2+ and calmodulin are kept low, PMCA was shown to negatively modulate the activity of nNOS (19Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Telkamp M. Röthlein N. Neyses L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 201-205Google Scholar) and CASK (20Schuh K Uldrijan S Gambaryan S. Röthlein N. Neyses L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9778-9783Google Scholar). These interactions are dependent on the presence of the E(T/S)X(V/L)* sequence in the COOH-cytoplasmic end of PMCA, and PDZ domains in the partner proteins. However, the existence of other intracellular domains in the PMCA polypeptide chain, and the previous reports of a functional interaction between PMCA and calmodulin (a protein without PDZ domains), prompted us to investigate whether other regions are implicated in interactions with different partner proteins. To test this hypothesis, we performed a two-hybrid screen of a human fetal heart cDNA library. We used the sequence from amino acids 652 to 840 (located in the catalytic, second intracellular loop, between transmembrane domains 4 and 5) of the human PMCA4b isoform (accession no. NM_001684) as bait. A positive clone encoding a partial sequence of the tumor suppressor RASSF1, a Ras effector protein that mediates the apoptotic effects of H-Ras (22Dammann R. Li C. Yoon J.-H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Google Scholar, 23Vos M.D. Chad A.E. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Google Scholar), was isolated. We have further characterized RASSF1 as a novel interaction partner of PMCA. Interaction of PMCA with RASSF1 significantly inhibited the EGF-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk, indicating a role for PMCA as a modulator of EGF-mediated Ras signaling pathways via interaction with RASSF1. This work shows a novel protein-protein interaction involving a domain of PMCA other than the COOH terminus. It suggests a role for PMCA as an organizer of macromolecular protein complexes, and a regulator of intracellular signaling pathways in the microenvironment of these multiprotein complexes. Cell Culture, Isolation, and Culture of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes—HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Isolation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was performed on hearts removed from 1–3-day-old rats. Hearts were cut in small pieces and ventricular tissue digested by several rounds of 10-min incubation in a filter-sterilized solution of collagenase A (0.3 mg/ml), pancreatin (0.6 mg/ml), ADS buffer, pH 7.35 (0.68% NaCl (w/v), 0.476% Hepes (w/v), 0.012% NaH2PO4 (w/v), 0.1% glucose (w/v), 0.04% KCl (w/v), 0.01% MgSO4 (w/v)) at 37 °C with shaking. Each round of digestion was finished by addition of 2 ml of FCS. Digestions were pooled and cells collected by centrifugation at 700 rpm for 4 min. Cell pellet was resuspended in plating media (68% DMEM, 17% Medium 199, 10% horse serum, 5% FCS) (1 ml/pup), plated on 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon), and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to remove cardiac fibroblasts. Supernatants containing cardiomyocytes were plated on 22 × 22-mm collagen-coated coverslips and further incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to allow cellular attachment. The following day, cells were washed with PBS and plating media were replaced with maintenance media (79.5% DMEM, 19.5% Medium 199, 1% FCS) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Plasmids—The region encoding amino acids 652–840 of human PMCA4b was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR (the conditions were denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 50 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s) using the oligonucleotides hPMCA4b652Sense (5′-TCTTCgCggATCCTgggACAATgAgAATgAgATC-3′) and hPMCA4b840Anti (5′-TCTTCCgCTCgAggATgCTgTCATAgACATTTCg-3′). The amplified product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of plasmid pBT (Stratagene) to generate plasmid pBT-hPMCA4b (652–840). pFlag-RASSF1A wild type and pFlag-RASSF1C (S61F) contain the cDNAs encoding human RASSF1A and RASSF1C, respectively, fused to the Flag epitope in a modified pcDNA3 vector in the manner previously reported (23Vos M.D. Chad A.E. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Google Scholar). RASSF1C (S61F) cDNA was isolated from neurons derived from a cloned human teratocarcinoma cell line. The sequence of RASSF1C (S61F) is identical to that of the RASSF1C wild type protein (accession no. AF132676) except for a mutation in nucleotide 193 (C 3 T) that changes serine 61 to phenylalanine. Site-directed mutagenesis (S131A) of RASSF1A was performed with a QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the protocol from the manufacturer. The oligomers used were: (5′-TgggAgACACCAgATCTTgCTCAAgCTgAgATTg-3′) and (5′-CAATCTCAgCTTgAgCAAgATCTggTgTCTCCCT-3′). Mutants were identified by the introduction of a silent BglII site and confirmed by sequencing. pCMV-hPMCA4b contains the human PMCA4b cDNA and was a gift from Prof. E. Strehler (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905).

Amplified fragments were cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pGEX-KG to generate plasmids pGEX-KG-RASSF1C (50–123), pGEX-KG-RASSF1C (124–197), and pGEX-KG-RASSF1C (198–270), which encode GST fusion proteins containing RASSF1C (S61F) amino acids 50–123, 124–197, or 198–270, respectively. To generate plasmids encoding Flag-tagged COOH-terminal deletion mutants of RASSF1C, fragments encompassing nucleotides 12–158, 12–269, 12–380, or 12–602 (numbering according to GenBank™ accession no. AF132676) were generated by 35 cycles of PCR (the conditions were denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min) using oligonucleotides EcoRASSF1Sense1 (5′-TCTTCCggAATTCCATgggCgAggCggAggCgCC-3′) and BamRASSF1Anti49 (5′-TCTTCgCggATCCTCACTggTCCCggCgCggCCTgC-3′), BamRASSF1Anti86 (5′-TCTTCgCggATCCTCACTTgTTCAAgCTCATgAAgAg-3′), BamRASSF1Anti123 (5′-TCTTCgCggATCCTCATCCTgggCCCCgCCgggCATC-3′), or BamRASSF1Anti197 (5′-TCTTCgCggATCCTCACCgCAggggCTgCTCATCATC-3′), respectively. pFlag-RAS-SF1C (S61F) was used as a template. Amplified products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of plasmid p3xFlag-CMV7.1 (Sigma-Aldrich). The resulting plasmids pFlag-RASSF1C (1–49), pFlag-RASSF1C (1–86), pFlag-RASSF1C (1–123), and pFlag-RASSF1C (1–197) encode Flag-tagged RASSF1C truncated proteins containing amino acids 1–49, 1–86, 1–123, and 1–197, respectively. Likewise, to generate Flag-tagged RASSF1C NH2-terminal deletion mutants, fragments encompassing nucleotides 195–821, 231–821, or 270–821 (according to accession no. AF132676) were generated by 35 cycles of PCR by using the following oligonucleotides: EcoRASSF1Sense62 (5′-TCTTCCggAATTCCCAAgCTgAgATTgAgCAgAAg-3′) and BamRASSF1Anti270 (5′-TCTTCgCggATCCTCACCCAAgggggCAggCgTg-3′) for amplification of nucleotides 195–821 (PCR conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 44 °C for 45 s, extension at 72 °C for 45 s); EcoRASSF1Sense74 (5′-TCTTCCggAATTCCgCCCAgATCAACAgCAACCTC-3′) and BamRASSF1Anti270 for amplification of nucleotides 231–821 (PCR conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 48 °C for 45 s, extension at 72 °C for 45 s); and EcoRASSF1Sense87 (5′-TCTTCCggAATTCCgACggTTCTTACACAggCTTC-3′) and BamRASSF1Anti270 for amplification of nucleotides 270–821 (PCR conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min). pFlag-RASSF1C (S61F) was used as template in the PCR reactions. Amplified products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of plasmid p3xFlag-CMV7.1 (Sigma-Aldrich). The resulting plasmids, pFlag-RASSF1C (62–270), pFlag-RASSF1C (74–270), and pFlag-RASSF1C (87–270), encode Flag-tagged RASSF1C truncated proteins containing amino acids 62–270, 74–270, and 87–270, respectively. To generate the plasmid pCMV-MycRASSF1A, the coding sequence for RASSF1A was subcloned from pFlag-RASSF1A into the BamHI and XhoI cloning sites of the expression vector pCMV-Tag 3B (Stratagene). To generate plasmid pFlag-hPMCA4b (652–840), a cDNA fragment coding for the region of human PMCA4b encompassing amino acids 652–840, was generated by 35 cycles of PCR using the following oligonucleotides and PCR conditions: BamPMCA4bSense652 (5′-TCTTCgCggATCCgTgggACAATgAgAATgAgATCC-3′) and XhoPMCA4bAnti840 (5′-TCTTCCgCTCgAgTCAgATgCTgTCATAgACATTTCgT-3′) (PCR conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s). The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the BglII-XhoI restriction sites of plasmid p3xFlag-CMV7.1 (Sigma-Aldrich). To generate construct pFlag-hPMCA4b (749–840), the PCR fragment was digested with HindIII and XhoI and cloned into the HindIII-XhoI sites of plasmid p3xFlag-CMV7.1 (Sigma-Aldrich). To clone pEGFP-R (50–123), the fragment encompassing nucleotides 159–380 of RASSF1C was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR using the oligonucleotides EcoRASSF1Sense50 (5′-TCTTCCggAATTCCgACgAgCCTgTggAgTgggAg-3′) and BamRASSF1Anti123 (5′-TCTTCgCggATCCTCATCCTgggCCCCgCCgggCATC-3′). PCR conditions were denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 66 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. pFlag-RASSF1C (S61F) was used as a template in the PCR reactions. Amplified products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of plasmid pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The fidelity of all amplified products was confirmed by sequencing. pFA2-Elk1 (Stratagene) encodes a fusion protein between the DNA binding domain of the yeast Gal4 protein and the transactivation domain of the transcription factor Elk1. pFR-Luc (Stratagene) is a reporter vector containing a synthetic promoter with five tandem repeats of the yeast Gal4-binding sites that control the expression of the luciferase gene. Two-hybrid Assay—A two-hybrid screen of a BacterioMatch™ human fetal heart cDNA library (Stratagene) was performed according to the instructions of a BacterioMatch™ two-hybrid system vector kit (Stratagene). Approximately 2 × 106 independent cDNA clones (which is equivalent to the whole library) were screened and assayed for resistance to carbenicillin or for β-galactosidase expression. To test for resistance to carbenicillin, transformed bacteria were plated onto LB-CTCK (250 μg/ml carbenicillin, 15 μg/ml tetracycline, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml kanamycin) agar plates and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. To test for β-galactosidase expression, carbenicillin-resistant bacteria were plated onto LB-X-gal indicator plates (15 μg/ml tetracycline, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 80 μg/ml X-gal, 200 μm phenylethyl-β-d-thiogalactoside) and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. Positive clones were sequenced following standard procedures. Immunofluorescence Experiments—Primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were washed with PBS, warmed at 37 °C, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, cardiomyocytes were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Unspecific staining was reduced by blocking with 10% horse serum for 30 min. Cells were incubated overnight with a 1% (v/v) solution of 5F10 anti-PMCA monoclonal antibody (Neomarkers) in 1% horse serum, and a 2% (v/v) solution of a goat polyclonal anti-RASSF1 antiserum (C-12, Santa Cruz) in 1% horse serum, and then washed three times with PBS. Antibody binding was detected by incubation, for 2 h in the dark, with a 1% (v/v) solution of a FITC-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 1% horse serum for detection of PMCA, and a 1% (v/v) solution of Texas Red-conjugated AffiniPure rabbit anti-goat IgG (Jackson Immuno-Research) in 1% horse serum for detection of RASSF1. Unbound antibody was removed by washing three times with PBS. HEK 293 cells were plated onto 22 × 22-mm coverslips at a density of 5 × 105 cells/coverslip. Transfected cells were washed with PBS, warmed at 37 °C, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Unspecific staining was reduced by blocking with 10% horse serum for 30 min. Cells were incubated overnight with a 0.1% (v/v) solution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-PMCA4 antibody (Swant) in 1% horse serum and a 0.1% solution of a FITC-conjugated anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in 1% horse serum. Following incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS. Antibody binding to PMCA4 was detected by incubation for 2 h in the dark with a 1% (v/v) solution of a Texas Red dye-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 1% horse serum. Unbound antibody was removed by washing three times with PBS. Coverslips were mounted in Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) on glass slides. Fluorescence was visualized using a Leica DM LB fluorescence microscope. GST Fusion Protein Expression and Pull-down Assays—GST-RASSF1 fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria by incubation in LB medium supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and ampicillin (100 μg/ml), at 37 °C, for 5 h. Bacterial pellet was resuspended and sonicated in NET-N buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 μm PMSF, 500 ng/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 500 ng/ml pepstatin). GST fusion proteins were purified by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C, for 45 min. After washing three times with NET-N buffer, beads containing purified GST fusion proteins were resuspended in RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 1% Igepal, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 μm PMSF, 500 ng/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 500 ng/ml pepstatin). Protein concentration and integrity were detected by PAGE electrophoresis and subsequent Coomassie Blue staining. For pull-down assays, cardiac protein extracts were prepared by homogenization of mouse hearts in RIPA buffer (1 ml/heart). Cardiac protein extracts were precleared by incubation (4 °C, 60 min) with glutathione-agarose beads (100 μl of agarose beads/1 ml of cardiac extracts) to avoid unspecific binding. After preclearing, 250 μg of cardiac proteins were incubated with 3 μg of GST fusion protein-agarose beads at 4 °C, overnight. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm, washed twice with RIPA buffer, and resuspended in 60 μlof 2× Laemmli loading buffer. Pulled down proteins were detected by Western blot. Transient Transfection—For immunofluorescence assays, HEK 293 cells were plated in 22 × 22-mm coverslips at a density of 5 × 105 cells/coverslip the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 6 μg of pCMV-hPMCA4b and 6 μg of pFlag-RASSF1A by using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. For immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK 293 cells were plated in 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes (4.5 × 106 cells/plate) the day before transfection. Cells were transfected in 4 ml of DMEM plus 10% FCS using 10 μg of the indicated expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate method. HEK 293 cells were incubated with precipitated DNA for 4.5 h, washed with PBS and incubated for 36 h more at 37 °C in 5 ml of DMEM plus 10% FCS prior to immunoprecipitation. For luciferase assays, HEK 293 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates (7 × 105 cells/well) the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 3.0 μg of an expression vector encoding human PMCA4b (pCMV-hPMCA4b) or the corresponding empty vector (pcDNA3), 3.0 μg of an expression vector encoding RASSF1 (pFlag-RASSF1A wild type, pFlag-RASSF1A (S131A), or pFlag-RASSF1C (S61F)) or the corresponding empty vector (pcDNA3-Flag), 0.25 μg of pFA2-Elk1 (Stratagene), and 0.25 μg of the luciferase reporter pFR-Luc (Stratagene) by using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions form the manufacturer. When indicated pEGFP-R (50–123) or the corresponding empty vector (pEGFP-C1) was included in the transfection reaction. Transfected cells were incubated with DNA-LipofectAMINE complexes for 24 h, washed once with PBS, and then incubated overnight in 5 ml of fresh DMEM, 10% FCS. The next morning, transfected cells were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (Sigma) (10 ng/ml) and incubated 6 h more. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined with a luciferase assay system (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection of plasmid pEF-LacZ carrying the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the EF1α promoter, and determination of β-galactosidase activity (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Transfected HEK 293 cells were lysed with 0.4 ml of RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 1% Igepal, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 μm PMSF, 500 ng/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 500 ng/ml pepstatin). To minimize unspecific binding, 1.2 ml of protein extracts were precleared by incubation with 200 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche) and 5 μl of anti-luciferase polyclonal antibody (1 mg/ml) (Promega) at 4 °C, for 1 h. Beads were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm, and 550 μl of precleared extracts were incubated overnight with the corresponding immunoprecipitating antibodies and 40 μl of protein G-agarose beads, at 4 °C with shaking. Beads were recovered by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm and washed three times with 500 μl of RIPA buffer. Washed beads were resuspended in 75 μl of 2× Laemmli loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Western Blot—Samples were boiled and resolved, under reducing conditions, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6 or 12% polyacrylamide for human PMCA4b or Flag-tagged RASSF1 detection, respectively). The gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk solution in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at 4 °C overnight. After being washed in TBS-T (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a 0.1% (v/v) solution of JA3 monoclonal antibody (Neomarkers) in TBS-T for PMCA4b detection, or a 0.1% (v/v) solution of anti-Flag M2 peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS-T, for Flag-epitope detection. The membranes were washed three times for 5 min with TBS-T; for PMCA4b detection, membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a 0.013% (v/v) solution of peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako) in TBS-T and washed twice with TBS-T. Bound antibodies were detected with the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).

Little is known about the mechanism underlying these SHOX-related inherited disorders of bone formation. Here we demonstrate that SHOX expression in osteogenic stable cell lines, primary oral fibroblasts, and primary chondrocytes leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These events are associated with alterations in the expression of several cellular genes, including pRB, p53, and the cyclin kinase inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. A SHOX mutant, such as seen in Léri-Weill syndrome patients, does not display these activities of the wild type protein. We have also shown that endogenous SHOX is mainly expressed in hypertrophic/apoptotic chondrocytes of the growth plate, strongly suggesting that the protein plays a direct role in regulating the differentiation of these cells. This study provides the first insight into the biological function of SHOX as regulator of cellular proliferation and viability and relates these cellular events to the phenotypic consequences of SHOX deficiency.

Homeobox genes encode a large family of transcription factors, characterized by the presence of a 60-amino acid DNA-binding domain, the homeodomain. These proteins play fundamental roles during embryogenesis and development by regulating pattern formation and organogenesis (1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev.

They can function as transcriptional activators or as repressors that control the temporally and spatially regulated expression of target genes. Mutations of homeobox genes are associated with human disorders, including Waardenburg syndrome (PAX3) (3Baldwin C.T. Hoth C.F. Amos J.A. da-Silva E.O. Milunsky A.

Genet. 1997; 16: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization analyses of human embryos have demonstrated that SHOX is expressed in the first and second pharyngeal arches and at high levels in the developing limbs (17Clement-Jones M. Schiller S. Rao E. Blaschke R.J. Zuniga A. Zeller R. Robson S.C. Binder G. Glass I. Strachan T. Lindsay S. Rappold G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). High levels of SHOX expression have also been found in trabecular bone cells of adults (18Ellison J.W. Wardak Z. Young M.F. Gehron Robey P. Laig-Webster M. Chiong W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that SHOX acts as a transcription activator in osteogenic cells (19Rao E. Blaschke R.J. Marchini A. Niesler B. Burnett M. Rappold G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3083-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Together these studies suggest a role for SHOX in bone development. Direct evidence for this, however, comes from the discovery that mutations in the coding region of the SHOX gene cause idiopathic growth retardation, mesomelic short stature, and Madelung deformity in Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, Langer syndrome (16Rao E.

To understand the role of SHOX in regulating growth and to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying SHOX-related disorders, we have investigated the influence of SHOX expression on cell proliferation and viability. Furthermore, because COOH-terminal-truncated forms of SHOX lead to Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis and idiopathic short stature, we have compared the activity of the wild type form of SHOX with a COOH-terminal-truncated form. Our results in two different human cellular systems (osteogenic U2OS cells and primary oral fibroblasts) demonstrate that only wild type SHOX induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The COOH-terminal-truncated form does not maintain these properties, suggesting that these functions are important for normal bone development. We have also shown that SHOX is expressed in human growth plate chondrocytes with the highest expression in terminally differentiated hypertrophic cells, suggesting its involvement in the processes controlling chondrocyte differentiation and apoptosis in the growth plate. Further supporting this hypothesis and in agreement with the results obtained with the other cell culture systems, expression of SHOX in primary chondrocytes is associated with a decrease of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cell Culture and Retroviral Infections—The generation of U2OS-ST and STM stable cell lines and their growth conditions were as previously described (19Rao E. Blaschke R.J. Marchini A. Niesler B. Burnett M. Rappold G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3083-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Induction of SHOX expression was obtained by adding 0.5 μg ml-1 of doxycycline (DOX) to the culture medium unless otherwise described. Human chondrocytes were obtained after informed consent from patients undergoing knee joint replacement as approved by the local ethics committee. Cells were harvested from knee cartilage regions with no macroscopically evident degeneration as described previously (23Winter A. Breit S. Parsch D. Benz K. Steck E. Hauner H. Weber R.M. Ewerbeck V. Richter W. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 418-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Primary human oral fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary chondrocytes (passage 8) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Retroviral infections were performed as described in Caldeira et al. (24Caldeira S. Zehbe I. Accardi R. Malanchi I. Dong W. Giarre M. de Villiers E.M. Filotico R. Boukamp P. Tommasino M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2195-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After infection, positive cells were selected in medium containing puromycin at the concentration of 1 μg ml-1. Colony Formation Assay—Colony formation assay was performed as previously described (25Giarre M. Caldeira S. Malanchi I. Ciccolini F. Leao M.J. Tommasino M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4705-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cells were selected for 10 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with puromycin (500 ng ml-1). Growth Curves—Equal numbers of U2OS, ST, and STM cells (300,000-500,000) were plated on two different sets of 145-mm dishes. After 8 h, one set of dishes was induced with DOX. Cell numbers were calculated every day for a total of 7 days by counting the cells using a hemocytometer. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the average of values is given for each point. BrdUrd Incorporation—Cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days before addition of BrdUrd to the culture medium for a further 20 h. Detection of labeled cells was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling and detection kit I (Roche Diagnostics). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were trypsinized and washed twice in PBS. The cellular pellet was then resuspended in cold 70% ethanol and fixed for at least 30 min at -20 °C. After ethanol fixation, the cells were washed again in PBS and finally resuspended in PBS with 100 μg ml-1 RNase and 25 μgml-1 propidium iodide. The suspension was then analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS) flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the software program Cell Quest. Analysis of the cell cycle profiles was performed using the ModFit cell cycle analysis software package (Verity Software House, Inc.). For time course experiments, samples collected at different times were stored in 70% ethanol at -20 °C. TUNEL Assay—For detection and quantification of apoptosis by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, an apoptosis detection system, Fluorescein (Promega), was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the only exception (for U2OS cells) that the fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dye for 2 min at room temperature. Cell Extract Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—The culture plates were transferred to a sheet of crushed ice, and cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS. Plates were scraped using a rubber policeman, and cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mix of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 min), the supernatant was collected and used for SDS-PAGE analysis. Twenty micrograms of total extract were loaded for each sample except for primary oral fibroblast (POF) cells, where 100 μg were used. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry blotting. Filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk. The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis: anti-SHOX-β rabbit antibody (described in Ref. 19Rao E. Blaschke R.J. Marchini A. Niesler B. Burnett M. Rappold G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3083-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), anti-cdc2 (sc-56), anticyclin B1 (D-11), anti-p27kip1 (C-19) monoclonal antibodies, anti-p107, anti-p130, anti-p21waf1 (C-19) polyclonal antibodies (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pRB (G3-245) monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen), anti-p53 (DO-7) monoclonal antibody (Dako), anti-β-tubulin (clone 2.1) monoclonal antibody (Sigma Aldrich), and anti-PARP p85 fragment polyclonal antibody (Promega). After membrane washing, the peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit or goat antimouse antibody was added. Proteins were visualized with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Antibody Generation—Polyclonal rabbit anti-human SHOX-γ antibodies used for immunohistochemistry experiments were generated against keyhole limpet hemocyanin or bovine serum albumin-conjugated peptides (NH2-FKDHVDNDKEKLKEF-COOH) corresponding to amino acids 71-85 of the SHOX protein sequence. Sera were collected at 10 weeks after the second boost. SHOX-γ antibodies were affinity purified using the original peptide bound to Sepharose 4B columns (Pineda Antibody Service, Berlin, Germany). Specificity of antibody was demonstrated by Western blot analysis using cellular extract derived from ST cells, grown in the presence or absence of DOX, where the antibody recognizes a single band of the equivalent molecular size of SHOX exclusively in SHOX-expressing cells (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry—The human growth plate sections used in this study were obtained from a normal fetus of 22 weeks gestation (humeral growth plate), from 12- and 15-year-old boys (tibial growth plates) subjected to surgery intervention because of abnormal leg over-growth, and a 13-year-old girl (hip growth plate) subjected to surgery intervention because of hip reconstruction. Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of growth plates was performed as previously described (26van der Eerden B.C. Karperien M. Gevers E.F. Lowik C.W. Wit J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1045-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with the only exception that the digestion step was carried out using 5 μgml-1 of proteinase K (Invitrogen) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. The SHOX antibodies used for the immunohistochemistry were SHOX-β (19Rao E. Blaschke R.J. Marchini A. Niesler B. Burnett M. Rappold G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3083-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and SHOX-γ (this study) used at 1:50 and 1:25 dilution, respectively. SHOX Expression Induces Cell Cycle Arrest in U2OS Cells—To investigate the cellular function of SHOX, we established stable osteosarcoma cell lines expressing SHOX in a tetracycline-inducible manner (19Rao E. Blaschke R.J. Marchini A. Niesler B. Burnett M. Rappold G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3083-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ST cells express wild type SHOX, whereas STM cells express a COOH-terminal deletion mutant that resembles SHOX mutations observed in patients with idiopathic short stature and Léri-Weill syndrome (4Glaser T. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Only after induction with DOX were both the wild type and mutant SHOX proteins detected by Western blot analysis on total cellular extracts. The expression of the protein was proportional to the amount of DOX added to the cultured medium (Fig. 1B). Expression of wild type SHOX was associated with dramatic morphological changes in ST cells and a marked decrease in growth that became evident 2 days after induction. By day 4, virtually all cells were growth-arrested (Fig. 1C). SHOX-induced ST cells showed an enlarged and apparently more differentiated phenotype. A significant portion of cells (∼30%) displayed nuclear segmentation resulting in two nuclei of equal size (Fig. 1C). Doxycycline titration experiments (from 5 to 0.005 μg ml-1) showed that very low levels of SHOX are sufficient to cause the phenotype (data not shown). In contrast to ST cells, the induced STM cells expressing the SHOX mutant protein did not display any evident morphological changes and grew like the non-induced cells (Fig. 1C, lower panel). We examined the proliferation capacity of these cell populations by counting cell numbers for 7 days (Fig. 2A). This showed that, in the absence of DOX, ST and STM cells have growth rates comparable with the parental U2OS cell line. The addition of DOX (0.5 μg/ml) to the culture medium did not affect the growth of U2OS cells and had only a marginal effect on the growth of STM cells. In contrast, ST cells expressing SHOX rapidly stopped growing. Moreover, after 3 days we observed a decrease in cell number, indicating that expression of SHOX also influences cell viability (Fig. 2A). To confirm the SHOX-induced cell cycle arrest, we assessed the percentage of cells undergoing de novo DNA synthesis by BrdUrd incorporation experiments in U2OS, ST, and STM cells. Cells were grown for 2 days, either in the presence or absence of DOX, before BrdUrd was added to the medium for 20 h. As shown in Fig. 2B, expression of SHOX was associated with a strong decrease in the number of ST cells incorporating BrdUrd (from ∼80 to 10%), confirming a reduced cell cycle activity in the induced ST cell line. To define in which phase of the cell cycle SHOX blocks proliferation, we measured the DNA content of both uninduced and induced ST and STM cells by FACS of propidium iodide-labeled cells in time course experiments. In agreement with the BrdUrd experiments, analysis of the cell cycle profiles showed that the expression of SHOX causes a decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase with an increase of the two peaks in G1 and G2/M phase (Fig. 2C, 2 days). At the time when cellular growth is no longer apparent (Fig. 2A, days 3 and 4), and consistent with the observation that a significant fraction of cells becomes binucleated, the reduction of S phase is accompanied by an accumulation of cells predominantly in G2/M phase (Fig. 2C, 3 and 4 days). However, the fact that the relative number of G1 cells remains similar and that the FACS profiles do not reveal a total accumulation of cells in G2/M phase suggests that G1 cells also do not proceed through S phase. Therefore, expression of SHOX seems to induce a double block in both G1 and G2/M phase of the cell cycle in U2OS cells (Fig. 2C). No cell cycle arrest is detected following induction of the COOH-terminal-truncated SHOX in STM cells, strongly suggesting that the COOH-terminal portion of SHOX is essential for these functions (Fig. 2D). These data were confirmed by using different clones of each cell type, demonstrating that the cellular changes caused by SHOX are not clone-specific but truly dependent on protein expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SHOX induces cell cycle arrest in U2OS cells. SHOX Alters the Expression of Several Cell Cycle Regulatory Proteins—Cell cycle progression is dependent on the successive activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases. Their activity is tightly regulated by several mechanisms, which include transient associations with cyclin regulatory subunits and binding of small proteins, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. To investigate the mechanism underlying the SHOX-induced events, we examined the expression of several cell cycle regulatory proteins by Western blot analysis. Experiments were performed on parallel cultures of ST cells maintained under inducing and non-inducing conditions. Total protein extracts were prepared at 48 and 72 h. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the levels of two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, were strongly increased upon induction of SHOX (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the levels of p53, which plays a central role in controlling cell cycle and apoptosis, were also elevated in SHOX-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). The pocket proteins, pRB, p107, and p130, are targets of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and their phosphorylation is essential for cell cycle progression. Hypophosphorylated forms of the pocket proteins are often associated with cell cycle arrest. Consistent with the elevated levels of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 in SHOX-expressing cells, pRB was present at lower levels and was completely converted to the faster migrating hypophosphorylated forms as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Similarly, p107 levels were also greatly reduced. In contrast, p130 was up-regulated with an accumulation of its hypophosphorylated forms (Fig. 3B). These changes in the pocket proteins are associated with a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and are consistent with the G1 block detected by FACS analysis (see Fig. 2C). In addition, protein levels of both cdc2 and cyclin B1, which regulate G2/M transition, were either slightly (cdc2) or strongly (cyclin B1) reduced by SHOX expression, providing additional proof of the SHOX-mediated cell cycle arrest (Fig. 3C). Together, these data confirm the multiple effects of SHOX on cell proliferation at the biochemical level. SHOX Expression Leads to Apoptosis in U2OS Cells—The reduction in cell numbers following prolonged SHOX expression indicates that SHOX influences cell viability (Fig. 2A). To test whether this event in ST cells expressing SHOX can be attributed to apoptosis, we used four independent methods. First, nuclei of uninduced and induced ST cells were stained with the cell-permeable dye DAPI and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. A fraction of cells expressing SHOX showed markedly condensed chromatin and nuclear fragmentation characteristic of apoptotic cells. These features were not observed in uninduced cells (data not shown). We then assessed the occurrence of DNA fragmentation in these cells by flow cytometric analysis, calculating the percentage of cells with a DNA content lower than 2n (sub G1 population). Uninduced and induced ST cells were collected at different time points, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide. The presence of an apoptotic cell population was already detectable at days 2 and 3 postinduction, and the percentage increased constantly with the time of SHOX expression. After 7 days of induction, ∼30% of cells were undergoing apoptosis. Conversely, uninduced ST cells had a normal DNA content (Fig. 4A). In a third approach, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-fluorescein nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. In agreement with the results shown above, and compared with uninduced cells, SHOX-expressing cells displayed a larger number of TUNEL-positive nuclei (Fig. 4B). Quantification of TUNEL by FACS analysis confirmed that ∼30% of cells underwent apoptosis after 7 days of SHOX expression (Fig. 4C). Finally, we performed immunoblot analysis for the caspase-cleaved fragment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) that is associated with apoptosis (27Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared from ST cells cultured either in the absence or in presence of DOX for 3 days. Levels of cleaved PARP were considerably higher in SHOX-induced cells than in uninduced cells (Fig. 4D). No apoptosis was detected in STM cells (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that expression of wild type SHOX but not of the COOH-terminal-truncated mutant leads to apoptosis in osteogenic cells. This finding provides an explanation for the reduction in cell numbers observed in the growth curve after SHOX expression (see Fig. 2A).Fig. 5Apoptosis is not detected upon expression of SHOX COOH-terminal-truncated mutant in STM cells. FACS analysis was performed as described in the legend of Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SHOX Expression Induces G1Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Human Primary Oral Fibroblasts—To verify the results derived from U2OS cells in a physiologically more relevant setting, we also expressed SHOX in human POF (non-transformed cells, where cell cycle checkpoints are intact and no culture stress has accumulated). SHOX was cloned in the pBABE-puro vector, which contains the promoter/enhancer sequence of the Moloney murine leukemia virus and expresses exogenous genes at low levels (28Morgenstern J.P. Land H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). POF cells were infected with recombinant retrovirus containing pBABE-SHOX. After puromycin selection, cells expressing SHOX displayed morphological changes and grew more slowly than the mock-infected cells (Fig. 6A). Colony formation assays and BrdUrd incorporation experiments confirmed that the expression of SHOX strongly reduces cellular growth (Fig. 6, B and C). FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells demonstrated that POF cells expressing SHOX were arrested in G1 phase (Fig. 6D). The G2/M block detected in U2OS cells was not observed in the primary cells, suggesting cell type specificity, most likely dependent on U2OS alterations in G1-specific cell cycle regulatory pathways (29Grossel M.J. Bake G.L. Hinds P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29960-29967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, in human primary cells where the cell cycle checkpoints are intact, the G1 arrest becomes predominant. Next, we analyzed the protein levels of various cell cycle regulators by Western blot analysis of total cellular lysates. As previously demonstrated for ST cells, in POF cells the expression of SHOX is also associated with a significant increase of p53, p21Cip1, and p27kip1 protein levels. Consistent with the up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and the G1 arrest observed by flow cytometric analysis, pRB is converted in the hypophosphorylated form (Fig. 6E). To determine whether SHOX expression also leads to apoptosis in primary human fibroblasts, we monitored DNA fragmentation in SHOX-expressing cells as sub-G1 population by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 7A, a higher percentage of apoptotic cells was observed in SHOX-expressing cells compared with control. Similarly, high levels of the PARP-cleaved form were detected in SHOX-expressing cells, confirming the induction of apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 7B). In summary, these results demonstrate that SHOX also retains the ability to promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in primary cells.

https://openalex.org/W2095143806,"F-box proteins, components of SCF ubiquitin-ligase complexes, are believed to be responsible for substrate recognition and recruitment in SCF-mediated proteolysis. F-box proteins that have been identified to function in the SCF complexes to date mostly have substrate-binding motifs, such as WD repeats or leucine-rich repeats in their C termini. However, many F-box proteins lack recognizable substrate-binding modules; whether they can function in the SCF complexes remains unclear. We show here that Fbx7, an F-box protein without WD repeats and leucine-rich repeats, is required for the proteasome-mediated proteolysis of the hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP). Depletion of Fbx7 by small interfering RNA leads to depression of HURP ubiquitination and accumulation of HURP abundance. In the SCFFbx7 complex, Fbx7 recruits HURP through its C-terminal proline-rich region in a Cdk1-cyclin B-phosphorylation dependent manner. Mutation of the multiple Cdk1-cyclin B phosphorylation sites on HURP or the proline-rich region of Fbx7 abolishes the association between Fbx7 and HURP. Thus, Fbx7 is a functional adaptor of the SCF complex with a proline-rich region as the substrate-binding module. In addition to Fbx7, data base analyses reveal two putative mammalian proline-rich region-containing F-box proteins, KIAA1783 and RIKEN cDNA 2410015K21.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a central role in regulation of many biological processes, including cell cycle progression, transcription, and signal transduction. The formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates requires three components: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HURP, hepatoma up-regulated protein; PRR, proline-rich region; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PIPES, 1,4-pipera-zinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HURP, hepatoma up-regulated protein; PRR, proline-rich region; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PIPES, 1,4-pipera-zinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). Ubiquitinated proteins are rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome. In the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, E3s play a major role in providing specificity of substrate recognition and timing for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (1Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). The SCF (Skp1, Cdc53/Cullin1, F-box protein) complex, one of the E3s, is a highly diverse multicomponent complex consisting of common components, such as Skp1, Cullin1, and Rbx1, as well as variable components known as F-box proteins (3Tyers M. Jorgensen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 54-64Google Scholar, 4Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Google Scholar, 5Craig K.L. Tyers M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 299-328Google Scholar). By biochemical and topological studies, the SCF complex is known to utilize F-box protein to recruit phosphorylated substrate to its core (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar, 4Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Google Scholar, 6Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Google Scholar, 7Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 3002.1-3002.7Google Scholar). Thus, the substrate specificity of the SCF complex is thought to depend on the F-box protein component. Each F-box protein contains an N-terminal motif of ∼40 amino acids, known as the F-box, which links the F-box protein to other components of the SCF complex by binding Skp1 (5Craig K.L. Tyers M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 299-328Google Scholar, 8Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Google Scholar). In general, F-box proteins have additional C-terminal protein-protein interaction motifs responsible for substrate binding. The two most common motifs are WD repeats (9Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Google Scholar) and leucine-rich repeats (10Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Google Scholar), both of which have been found to bind phosphorylated substrates and recruit them to the SCF complexes (11Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Google Scholar). Substrate recognition by the SCF complex is thought to require the same core components (i.e. Cullin1, Skp1, and Rbx1) but to utilize various F-box proteins. The ability of the same core to bind multiple F-box proteins increases the substrate repertoire. Modern advances in genome sequencing and molecular cloning have led to the identification of numerous F-box proteins, which are classified into three subfamilies according to the C-terminal substrate-binding motifs that they contain (7Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 3002.1-3002.7Google Scholar, 12Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Google Scholar, 13Winston J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Google Scholar). The Fbw and Fbl families represent the F-box proteins containing WD repeats and leucine-rich repeats, respectively, and have been shown to function in the SCF complexes and recruit substrates for ubiquitination. The Fbx family represents the F-box proteins without known substrate-binding motifs and includes the majority of F-box proteins. However, only limited numbers of Fbx family members, such as Fbx2, Fbx4, and Fbx6b (14Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Google Scholar, 15den Engelsman J. Keijsers V. de Jong W.W. Boelens W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4699-4704Google Scholar, 16Yoshida Y. Tokunaga F. Chiba T. Iwai K. Tanaka K. Tai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43877-43884Google Scholar), have been recently demonstrated to function in the SCF complexes. The structural and functional characterization of the rest of the Fbx family members still needs to be defined. Whether these novel Fbx family members function in the SCF complexes, as do those of the Fbw and Fbl families, is one of the central issues in current studies of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, especially because F-box proteins have also been found to be associated with various biological pathways other than SCF-mediated proteolysis (7Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 3002.1-3002.7Google Scholar, 17Kim J. Kim J.H. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Kang H.Y. Bae S.H. Pan Z.Q. Seo Y.S. J. Biol.

The gap causing slow progress in this field is due mainly to the lack of substrates. Research to identify the downstream targets of these novel Fbx family members is needed to fill this gap. Hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP) was initially identified through bioinformatics analysis that was performed to search for potentially important regulatory genes involved in growth control of human hepatocellular carcinoma (19Tsou A.P. Yang C.W. Huang C.Y. Yu R.C. Lee Y.C. Chang C.W. Chen B.R. Chung Y.F. Fann M.J. Chi C.W. Chiu J.H. Chou C.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 298-307Google Scholar). Empirical characterization in HeLa cells indicates that HURP is a cell cycle-regulated gene with an elevated expression in the G2/M phase, followed by a sharp decline in early to middle G1 phase. Immunofluorescence studies reveal that HURP localizes to the spindle poles during mitosis. Overexpression of HURP in 293T cells results in an enhanced cell growth at low serum levels and at polyhema-based, anchorage-independent growth conditions (19Tsou A.P. Yang C.W. Huang C.Y. Yu R.C.

Furthermore, elevated gene expression of HURP and its related truncated form KIAA0008 is highly associated with human hepatocellular carcinoma, colon cancer, breast cancer and transitional cell carcinoma (19Tsou A.P. Yang C.W. Huang C.Y. Yu R.C. Lee Y.C. Chang C.W. Chen B.R. Chung Y.F. Fann M.J. Chi C.W. Chiu J.H. Chou C.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 298-307Google Scholar, 20Bassal S. Nomura N. Venter D. Brand K.

Chiu A.W. Huan S.K. Wang Y.C. Ju J.P. Lu C.L. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 2729-2733Google Scholar), suggesting that HURP may have a role in carcinogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that HURP undergoes proteasome-mediated proteolysis and the SCFFbx7 complex is the corresponding upstream E3 ligase. Fbx7, a member of the Fbx family (12Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Google Scholar, 13Winston J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Google Scholar), functions as an adaptor recruiting Cdk1-cyclin B-phosphorylated HURP to the core SCF complex. Fbx7 interacts with HURP through its C-terminal proline-rich region (PRR), suggesting that PRR is a new substrate-binding module of F-box proteins other than WD repeats and leucine-rich repeats. By data base search, we further identify two putative PRR-containing F-box proteins, KIAA1783 and RIKEN cDNA 2410015K21. Thus, these PRR-containing molecules might constitute a new subfamily of mammalian F-box proteins.

Continuous time point samples were collected for various assays. Transient transfection of cells was performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of the subcellular localization of various proteins by indirect immunofluoresence was carried out as previously described (19Tsou A.P. Yang C.W. Huang C.Y. Yu R.C. Lee Y.C. Chang C.W. Chen B.R. Chung Y.F. Fann M.J. Chi C.W. Chiu J.H. Chou C.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 298-307Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Vectors and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human full-length HURP cDNA (designated as HURP-WT) and Cdk1 cDNA were subcloned into FLAG-CMV2 (Kodak) or a modified version of pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen), with an HA epitope tag for mammalian expression, or T7 promoter-driven vectors for the in vitro coupled transcription-translation reaction. The HURP phosphorylation site mutant (HURP-PM) and various Fbx7-truncated mutants (Fbx7-ΔN, Fbx7-ΔF, Fbx7-ΔC, and Fbx7-ΔP) were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis (QuikChange™ Site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). FLAG-tagged F-box protein constructs used in this study were kindly provided by Dr. Michele Pagano (New York University School of Medicine). Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting Analysis—To prepare cell-free lysates, cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in extraction buffer, which was composed of 50% lysate buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin) and 50% IP washing buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 40 mm β-glycerolphosphate). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay reagents (Pierce). In general, 1 mg of total cell lysate was incubated with antibodies against target epitopes and Protein A/G-agarose beads (Oncogene Research Product) to immunoprecipitate the target proteins. The immunoprecipitation products were resolved by 8-15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and detected with various antibodies. The complexed IgGs were detected by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase, and developed using the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate or the Western Lighting system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Preparation of Recombinant Protein, in Vitro Kinase Reaction, and Phosphorylation Site Determination—Human HURP recombinant proteins were prepared using a bacterial expression system. HURP cDNA was subcloned into expression vector pET32a (Novagen) and expressed as His-tagged fusion protein. The proteins were expressed and trapped in inclusion bodies and solubilized with 2 m urea. The solubilized proteins were partially purified by nickel-agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions. The purified proteins were then dialyzed to remove the denaturant as described in the manufacturer's manual. The purified recombinant HURP proteins were incubated with bauclovirus-expressed human Cdk1-cyclin B complex (New England Biolabs) in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Brij 35, pH 7.5) containing [γ-33P]ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated bands were visualized by autoradiography. For phosphorylation site determination, Escherichia coli expressed recombinant HURP proteins were incubated with Cdk1-cyclin B in kinase buffer containing ATP. After reaction for 30 min, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. HURP proteins were sliced from the gel and phosphorylation sites were determined by LC MS/MS analysis as previously described (23Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were prepared by coupled transcription-translation reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Ubiquitination Assay—293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged HURP or Myc-tagged ubiquitin separately or together. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed. Equal amounts of total lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitation products were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA or anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Cycloheximide Inhibition Assay—The turnover rates of proteins were determined using cycloheximide inhibition of protein synthesis (24Zhao J. Tenev T. Martins L.M. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4363-4371Google Scholar, 25Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24057-24064Google Scholar). Cycloheximide blocks protein synthesis through interaction with the translocase enzyme in eukaryotic cells. Cells were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) and harvested at different stages. Equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Data Bases Used in This Study—The data bases used in this study includes BLAST and PROSITE. Small Interference RNA (SiRNA)—The following target sequence was used for Fbx7 siRNA: CCCACACCAUUCCAUUCUA. To generate functional siRNA, we designed the gene-specific insert such that it specifies a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 1,136-1,154 (CCCACACCATTCCATTCTA) of Fbx7, separated by a 9-nucleotide non-complementary spacer (TTCAAGAGA) from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. This insert was then subcloned in a vector system, named pSUPER as described (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar) to direct the synthesis of siRNA in mammalian cells. HURP Is a Phosphoprotein Regulated by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway—Previous studies have shown that in HeLa cells the HURP transcript is low in G1 and S phases, but is predominantly expressed in the G2/M phase (19Tsou A.P. Yang C.W. Huang C.Y. Yu R.C. Lee Y.C. Chang C.W. Chen B.R. Chung Y.F. Fann M.J. Chi C.W. Chiu J.H. Chou C.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 298-307Google Scholar). We showed here that HURP protein expression levels also underwent periodic changes along with cell cycle progression. 293T cells were synchronized in the G2/M phase by nocodazole block and subsequently released into cell cycle progression by removing nocodazole. Endogenous HURP protein levels in G2/M-arrested cells were analyzed in comparison to those in exponentially growing cells. Western blot showed that HURP protein expression levels were low in exponentially growing cells but accumulated in G2/M-arrested cells, which was coincident with the expression pattern of cyclin B (Fig. 1, A, lanes 1 and 2; B, lanes 1 and 3). Notably, HURP exhibited various degrees of electrophoretic mobility shifts on SDS-PAGE as cells were synchronized in the G2/M phase (Fig. 1, A, lane 2; B, lane 3). These mobility up-shifts were abolished when λ phosphatase was added to lysates, indicating they were because of protein phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lane 4). To further support this finding, [35S]methionine-labeled HURP was incubated with nocodazole-arrested 293T lysates, which resulted in a reminiscent mobility up-shift pattern (Fig. 1C). The mobility up-shifts of [35S]methionine-labeled HURP were also sensitive to λ phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1C), characteristic of protein phosphorylation. Moreover, simultaneous decreases in the protein quantity and in the degree of phosphorylation of HURP were observed as G2/M-arrested cells were released into the cell cycle progression by removing nocodazole (Fig. 1A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HURP is a mitotic phosphoprotein that exhibits periodic variations both in the phosphorylation state and in protein quantity as cells progress through the cell cycle. To determine the molecular mechanism involved in the degradation of HURP, 293T cells were treated with three kinds of conventional proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin, proteasome inhibitor I, and MG132) to block HURP from degradation taking place as G2/M-arrested 293T cells were released into cell cycle progression. Because MG132 exhibits additional inhibitory activities against calpain, two calpain inhibitors (ALLM and ALLN) were used as controls. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors, but not calpain inhibitors, could block HURP degradation, implying the involvement of proteasomes in HURP degradation (Fig. 1D). Because ubiquitination is the signal for effective recognition and degradation of proteins by the proteasome, we then investigated whether HURP is a substrate of ubiquitination. 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged HURP or Myc-tagged ubiquitin separately or together. Equal amounts of lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-HA and anti-ubiquitin antibodies. High molecular weight products accumulated in cells cotransfected with HURP and ubiquitin but not in cells transfected with ubiquitin alone (Fig. 1E), indicating that HURP is a substrate of ubiquitination. Taken together, these results reveal that HURP is a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Fbx7 Serves as an Adaptor Linking the SCF Complex with HURP—To identify the upstream E3 ligase responsible for HURP ubiquitination, we collected a set of F-box protein expression constructs and assayed for their association with HURP by immunoprecipitation. 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged HURP or FLAG-tagged F-box proteins (Fbw1a, Fbw2, Fbl3a, Fbx4, and Fbx7) separately or together followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis. The results showed that Fbx7, but not any of the other F-box proteins tested, physically associated with HURP (Fig. 2A). To determine whether Fbx7 serves as an adaptor and recruits HURP to a SCF complex, we expressed HA-tagged HURP (HA-HURP) and FLAG-tagged Fbx7 (FLAG-Fbx7) separately or together in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated the cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody. Then, we examined the existence of other SCF components in the immunoprecipitates by Western blotting analysis. Endogenous Skp1 and Cullin1 were detected in the FLAG-Fbx7 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2B, lane 2). This data, in agreement with previous reports, represented the reconstitution of the SCFFbx7 complex (12Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Google Scholar). Moreover, co-expression of HA-HURP and FLAG-Fbx7 followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody resulted in the complex formation of HURP, Fbx7, Skp1, and Cullin1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3). To further illustrate the role of Fbx7 in this complex and test the significance of Fbx7 in the stability of its putative substrate, HURP, we used the siRNA to reduce the expression of Fbx7 and then assessed its effect on HURP ubiquitination. Results showed that HURP ubiquitination was depressed in cells contransfected with plasmid-based double-stranded RNA against Fbx7 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we assessed its effect on HURP abundance. HURP accumulated in siRNA-inhibited 293T cells when compared with cells transfected with a control empty vector (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data indicate that Fbx7 is involved in the regulation of HURP stability. Fbx7 Associates with Cdk1-Cyclin B-phosphorylated HURP—There is compelling evidence that protein phosphorylation is a regulatory factor in the interactions between the substrate of the SCF complex and the F-box protein (11Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Google Scholar, 27Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Google Scholar, 28Spencer E. Jiang J. Chen Z.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 284-294Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, HURP is a mitotic phosphoprotein, suggesting that protein phosphorylation may provide a mode of regulating the interaction between Fbx7 and HURP. In fact, MPM2 antibody, an antibody specifically recognizing a subset of mitosis-specific phosphoproteins (29Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Google Scholar, 30Engle D.B. Doonan J.H. Morris N.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 10: 434-437Google Scholar), could recognize the immunoprecipitated HURP from nocodazole-arrested cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that HURP might be the downstream substrate of Cdk1-cyclin B, which has been shown to be able to generate MPM2 reactivity (31Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 986-994Google Scholar, 32Westendorf J.M. Rao P.N. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 714-718Google Scholar). Therefore, we next addressed whether HURP is a downstream substrate of Cdk1-cyclin B. First, active Cdk1-cyclin B could phosphorylate HURP in vitro. When recombinant HURP protein was added to the kinase reaction in the presence of recombinant Cdk1-cyclin B and [γ-33P]ATP, an [γ-33P]ATP-incorporated band was observed at the 10-min point in the Cdk1-cyclin B-mediated kinase reaction, but not in the control lanes (Fig. 3B). Second, Cdk1-specific inhibitors, roscovitine (33Deng M.Q. Shen S.S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 873-878Google Scholar) and olomoucine (34Malecz N. Foisner R. Stadler C. Wiche G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8203-8208Google Scholar), partially abolished the mobility up-shifts of HURP as [35S]methionine-labeled HURP was incubated with nocodazole-arrested 293T lysates (Fig. 3C), suggesting that HURP is a potential substrate of Cdk1-cyclin B in the G2/M phase. Third, overexpression of FLAG-tagged HURP and HA-tagged Cdk1 in 293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG showed that HURP was coimmunoprecipitated with Cdk1, indicating that HURP can associate with Cdk1 in culture cells (Fig. 3D). Fourth, immunofluoresence analysis also demonstrated that endogenous Cdk1 and HURP colocalized to the mitotic spindles in the metaphase (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results indicate that HURP is a potential substrate of Cdk1-cyclin B. Cdk1-cyclin B is known to phosphorylate numerous proteins and regulate their stability (35Thom G. Minshall N. Git A. Argasinska J. Standart N. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 91-100Google Scholar, 36Ke P.Y. Yang C.C. Tsai I.C. Chang Z.F. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 265-273Google Scholar, 37Castro A. Peter M. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Vigneron S. Galas S. Lorca T. Labbe J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2660-2671Google Scholar). To examine whether Cdk1-cyclin B-mediated HURP phosphorylation is the key step in the interaction between HURP and Fbx7, we determined the in vitro Cdk1-cyclin B phosphorylation sites on HURP by LC MS/MS analysis. Nine sites (Ser67, Thr329, Thr401, Thr402, Ser618, Thr639, Ser642, Thr759, and Ser839) were identified with 82% amino acid sequence coverage, indicating that Cdk1-cyclin B can phosphorylate HURP at multiple sites in vitro (Fig. 4A). Initially, we replaced each phosphorylation site individually with alanine and some combination of two phosphorylation site mutations on HURP. These mutants were assayed for their association with Fbx7; however, none of these mutants tested had a significant difference in terms of association with Fbx7 (data not shown), raising the possibility that multisite phosphorylation of HURP may be required for the association with Fbx7. Next, we constructed a HURP mutant in which all nine phosphorylation sites were replaced with alanines (designated as HURP-PM). HURP-PM exhibited a more depressed phosphorylation state than HURP-WT, both as incubating with nocodazole-arrested cell lysates (Fig. 4B) and as expressing in mitotic cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting that Cdk1-cyclin B-mediated HURP phosphorylation could recapitulate in the in vivo situation. Subsequently, we examined whether a complex of Fbx7 and HURP-PM could be detected in 293T cells. The results showed that mutation of all nine Cdk1-cyclin B phosphorylation sites on HURP abolished the association between Fbx7 and HURP (Fig. 4D). In addition, comparisons of"

The encoded product, here named Cox23p, is shown to be required for the expression of cytochrome oxidase. Cox23p is homologous to Cox17p, a water-soluble copper protein previously implicated in the maturation of the CuA center of cytochrome oxidase. The respiratory defect of a cox23 null mutant is rescued by high concentrations of copper in the medium but only when the mutant harbors COX17 on a high copy plasmid. Overexpression of Cox17p by itself is not a sufficient condition to rescue the mutant phenotype. Cox23p, like Cox17p, is detected in the intermembrane space of mitochondria and in the postmitochondrial supernatant fraction, the latter consisting predominantly of cytosolic proteins. Because Cox23p and Cox17p are not part of a complex, the requirement of both for cytochrome oxidase assembly suggests that they function in a common pathway with Cox17p acting downstream of Cox23p.

Because Cox23p and Cox17p are not part of a complex, the requirement of both for cytochrome oxidase assembly suggests that they function in a common pathway with Cox17p acting downstream of Cox23p. Copper is an essential electron carrier of cytochrome oxidase, the terminal complex of the respiratory chain. The copper in cytochrome oxidase is associated with two separate catalytic sites (1Beinert H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 521-532Google Scholar, 2Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Tsukihara T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 1-7Google Scholar). Two of the coppers form the CuA center in subunit 2 (Cox2p). The third copper, referred to as CuB, is in electronic equilibrium with the heme a of cytochrome a3 in subunit 1 (Cox1p). The CuA center is located in a carboxyl-terminal domain of Cox2p that protrudes into the intermembrane space of mitochondria where it acts as the initial acceptor of electrons from cytochrome c (1Beinert H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 521-532Google Scholar, 2Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Tsukihara T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 1-7Google Scholar). Acquisition of copper for the CuA center of Cox2p has been shown to depend on at least two proteins (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 4Punter F.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30875-30880Google Scholar, 5Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Google Scholar). Cox17p is a small soluble copper protein that is detected in the cytosol and in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (6Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 372: 33191-33196Google Scholar, 7Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Google Scholar). This subcellular localization suggested that Cox17p functions in delivery of cytosolic copper to mitochondria (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar). The second protein, Sco1p, is a constituent of the inner membrane (8Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rödel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Google Scholar) and like Cox2p has a carboxyl-terminal domain with the copper binding site located in the intermembrane space (8Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rödel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Google Scholar, 9Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22185-22190Google Scholar). The function of Sco1p is either to transfer copper from Cox17p to the CuA center of Cox2p or to chemically modify the oxidation state of the cysteine ligands for copper (5Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Google Scholar, 10Chinenov Y.V. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 239-242Google Scholar). The CuB center on Cox1p is probably formed in the lipid phase of the inner membrane or in the matrix compartment. Cox11p, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein previously shown to be essential for the expression of yeast cytochrome oxidase (11Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Google Scholar), has been implicated in the maturation of the CuB site of Cox1p (12Hiser L. Di Valentine M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Google Scholar). Mutations in the COX11 homologue of Rhodobacter sphaeroides elicit a cytochrome oxidase deficiency and an absence of CuB but not CuA (12Hiser L. Di Valentine M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Google Scholar). Additional support for the involvement of Cox11p in this process comes from the finding that yeast Cox11p is a copper protein (13Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Google Scholar). It is not known whether other proteins may also participate in the maturation of this important catalytic center. As part of an effort to understand cytochrome oxidase assembly, we have continued to screen for genes that affect the expression of this respiratory complex in yeast. We show that reading frame YHR116W of chromosome VIII (named COX23) codes for a soluble protein located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. We also present evidence that this protein, like its homologue Cox17p, functions in mitochondrial copper homeostasis and is essential for the expression of functional cytochrome oxidase.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 201-211Google Scholar). Deletion of COX23—COX23 with ∼400 nucleotides of flanking sequences was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-ATGGCGGATCCTCTTTGTAG and 5′-GGCGGATCCTCACTTTGACGTCGGTTGTC. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned in pUC19 (17Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid (pCOX23/ST2) was used to replace the COX23 coding sequence with the yeast HIS3 gene. Amplification of pCOX23/ST2 with the bidirectional primers 5-GGCAGATCTCTTTAAGCGCTCTCGTGAGAG and 5′-GGCAGATCTAGGCAGCCTTTTTCTTCTTGTTTGTTCAGCTG resulted in a clean deletion of COX23. The linear product containing the COX23 flanking regions in pUC19 was digested with BglII and ligated to HIS3 on a 1-kb BamHI fragment of DNA. The cox23::HIS3 null allele was recovered from this plasmid as a 1.8-kb BamHI fragment and was substituted by homologous recombination for the wild type gene in the yeast strain W303-1B. Isolation and Assays of Mitochondria—Respiratory enzymes were assayed with mitochondria prepared by the method of Faye et al. (18Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Google Scholar) except that zymolyase 20T (ICN Biochemicals Inc., Aurora, OH) instead of Glusulase was used for the conversion of cells to spheroplasts. For localization studies mitochondria with intact outer membranes were obtained by the method of Glick and Pon (19Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Google Scholar). In Vivo Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products—Mitochondrial translation products were labeled in whole cells with [35S]methionine (7 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of cycloheximide (20Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Google Scholar) and separated on a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel as described (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The radiolabeled proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and exposed to x-ray film. Miscellaneous Procedures—Standard procedures were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for the transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from E. coli (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Proteins were routinely separated by SDS gel electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and Western blots were treated with antibodies against the appropriate proteins followed by a second reaction with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) was used for the final detection. Protein concentrations were estimated by the Folin procedure (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Phenotype of the cox23 Deletion Mutant—Reading frame YHR116W on chromosome VIII of the yeast nuclear genome has been deleted in the wild type strain BY4741 as part of the Saccharomyces genome deletion project and shown to cause a growth defect on glycerol/ethanol as carbon sources (24Dimmer K.S. Fritz S. Fuchs F. Messerschmitt M. Weinbach N. Neupert W. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 847-853Google Scholar). Deletion of YHR116W in the wild type strain W303-1B produces a similar but less pronounced phenotype. In either genetic background, however, the respiration-deficient phenotype is leaky because slow growth of the mutants on the non-fermentable substrates is detected after incubation of BYΔCOX23 for 4–5 days and of W303ΔCOX23 for 2–3 days at 30 °C (data not shown). The presence in the mutant of cytochromes b, c1, and c (but not of cytochromes a and a3) suggested that the respiratory defect stems from a deficiency of cytochrome oxidase (Fig. 1A). This was confirmed by enzymatic assays, which showed the mutant to have less than 1% of the cytochrome oxidase activity measured in wild type (Table II). Both NADH-cytochrome c reductase and ATPase activities were not significantly different from wild type.Table IIRespiratory and ATPase activities of mitochondria from wild type and a cox23 mutant Purified rho+ cells were grown in YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose) to early stationary phase, and mitochondria were prepared by the method of Faye et al. (18Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Google Scholar). NADH-cytochrome c reductase (NADH-c reductase) and cytochrome oxidase were measured at 23°C and ATPase at 37°C as described previously (25Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Google Scholar). Where indicated, oligomycin was added to a concentration of 10 μg/ml.

This is true not only of structural gene mutants but also of strains that fail to assemble a functional enzyme as a result of impaired heme a synthesis (26Glerum D.M. Muroff I. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19088-19094Google Scholar) or maturation of the CuA and/or CuB sites (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 11Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Google Scholar). Although the nuclear-encoded subunits are also affected in such mutants, the extent of their reduction is much less (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 11Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Google Scholar, 26Glerum D.M. Muroff I. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19088-19094Google Scholar). Analysis of cytochrome oxidase subunits under steady-state conditions and pulse labeling of cells in the presence of cycloheximide indicate that the phenotype of the cox23 mutant is very similar to that of most other oxidase-deficient strains. The lack of spectrally and enzymatically detectable cytochrome oxidase and the deficit of the mitochondrially translated subunits point to cytochrome oxidase as the target of the product encoded by reading frame YHR116W. In keeping with our nomenclature for genes involved in expression of cytochrome oxidase, this gene was named COX23. Cox23p Homologues Are Present in Animals, Plants, and Fungi—Cox23p homologues are present in widely divergent organisms (Fig. 2). The yeast protein, however, has an extra 75-residue-long serine-rich sequence at the amino end that is absent in the homologous proteins. Cox23p is also homologous to Cox17p, a copper protein required for the maturation of the CuA site in Cox2p (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 4Punter F.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30875-30880Google Scholar). The four cysteines of Cox23p align with cysteine residues in Cox17p, some of which have been implicated in copper binding (27Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Google Scholar). Cox23p is a hydrophilic protein of 151 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 17.3 kDa. Truncation of the amino-terminal domain of yeast Cox23p does not affect its ability to confer wild type growth of the mutant on non-fermentable carbon sources (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Growth phenotype of the cox23 deletion mutant and various transformants. The figure shows serial dilutions of the respiration-competent strain BY4741, the cox23 mutant BYΔCOX23, the transformant BYΔCOX23/ST1 with an integrative plasmid expressing a hemagglutinin-tagged Cox23p, and the transformants BYΔCOX23/ST6 and ST7 expressing Cox23p that lacks the amino-terminal 75 residues from an integrative and episomal plasmid, respectively. The different strains were grown in liquid YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) and spotted on solid YPD and YEPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% ethanol, 3% glycerol). The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Rescue of the cox23 Mutant by Copper—The homology to Cox17p suggested that Cox23p, like Cox17p, may be a copper protein. This is supported by the ability of copper to rescue a cox23 mutant transformed with COX17 on a high copy plasmid (Fig. 4). The supplementation of rich glycerol/ethanol medium with 2–10 mm CuSO4 did not promote growth of the cox23 mutant even after a week of incubation at 30 °C. Copper, however, was effective in restoring respiratory growth of the cox23 mutant transformed with COX17 on a high copy plasmid. Growth of the transformant was evident after 30 h of incubation. No rescue of the cox17 mutant overexpressing COX23 was seen under these conditions nor was the cox23 mutant rescued by SCO1, SCO2, COX19, and COX11, all of which have been implicated in mitochondrial copper metabolism. Although cox17 mutants are rescued by copper (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar), they grow on glycerol/ethanol medium at a slower rate and require a longer period of incubation. Localization of Cox23p—BYΔCOX23/ST4 is a respiration-competent strain with a cox23 null allele and a chromosomally integrated COX23-HA fusion gene expressing Cox23p with a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin tag. This strain was used to study the location of Cox23p. An antibody against the HA tag detected a 25-kDa protein in mitochondria and the postmitochondrial supernatant fraction (cytosolic proteins) of BYΔCOX23/ST4 (Fig. 5A). Because this signal is not seen in mitochondria of wild type yeast (data not shown), we conclude that it corresponds to the HA-tagged Cox23p (Cox23p-HA). The apparent mass of Cox23p-HA measured by SDS-PAGE is 7 kDa greater than that predicted by the DNA sequence. This is probably caused by anomalous binding of SDS. The absence of cytochrome b2, a soluble protein of the intermembrane compartment, in the postmitochondrial supernatant makes it unlikely that the Cox23p-HA detected in this fraction is caused by leakage from mitochondria. Based on the relative strength of the signal, we estimate that 35% of Cox23p-HA is in mitochondria and 65% is in the cytosol (Fig. 5B). The mitochondrial compartment in which Cox23p-HA is located was determined by hypotonic lysis of the mitochondria and treatment of the mitochondria and resulting mitoplasts with proteinase K. Like cytochrome b2, Cox23p-HA is a soluble component of the intermembrane space and is released from mitochondria when they are converted to mitoplasts (Fig. 5C). The resistance to proteinase K of the soluble matrix marker α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the mitoplasts confirmed the intactness of the mitoplasts and excluded the absence of Cox23p-HA in this fraction being caused by leakage from the matrix. Mitochondrial Cox23p and Cox17p Are Not Complexed to Each Other—The requirement of both Cox23p and Cox17p for cytochrome oxidase assembly indicated that the two proteins do not have overlapping functions. The dual requirement for cytochrome oxidase assembly also suggested that they are either components of the same complex or that they function sequentially in a common pathway involved in maturation of the CuA center. BWΔCOX17,23/ST4,50, a strain expressing Cox23p-HA with the HA epitope alone, and Cox17p-HA-His with an additional polyhistdine tag were used to test the presence of the two proteins in a complex. Mitochondria were lysed hypotonically, and the cleared lysate consisting of intermembrane proteins was affinity-purified on a Ni-NTA column. Cox17p-HA-His was bound quantitatively to the Ni-NTA beads and was eluted only in the high imidazole wash (Fig. 6A). Cox23p-HA, even though present at a lower concentration than Cox17p-HA-His in this strain, was recovered in the flow-through and the low imidazole wash. When a lysate obtained from BWΔCOX17,23/ST4,52 expressing both Cox17p and Cox23p with the HA tag only was similarly treated, neither protein was adsorbed to the beads (Fig. 6B), confirming that the polyhistidine tag on Cox17p is essential for its binding to the Ni-NTA column. Cox23p is a soluble protein of the mitochondrial intermembrane space but is also present in the cytosol. It is homologous to Cox17p, which was previously shown to have the same subcellular distribution (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar). The sequence similarity to Cox17p is confined to the carboxyl half of Cox23p, which appears to be the functionally important region because a truncated gene expressing the sequence starting from residue 76 does not impair its ability to complement the cox23 mutant. Cox23p is required for mitochondrial copper homeostasis. This is manifest in the rescue by exogenous copper of the cox23 mutant transformed with COX17 on a high copy plasmid. Cox17p was initially proposed to act as a shuttle for the delivery of copper from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar). Recent evidence showing that Cox17p tethered to the inner membrane through a transmembrane domain is able to complement a cox17 mutant has cast doubt on the idea that this protein acts as a shuttle (29Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Google Scholar). Independent of the manner in which it works, based on extensive mutational analysis and its location inside of mitochondria, Cox17p has been linked to maturation of the CuA center (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 4Punter F.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30875-30880Google Scholar). Cox23p, therefore, is likely to be involved in this important aspect of cytochrome oxidase assembly as well. Even though Cox23p and Cox17p do not have overlapping functions, their homology and the conservation in Cox23p of the cysteine residues known to be the copper ligands of Cox17p (27Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Google Scholar) suggest that the two proteins function in an analogous manner. In the absence of evidence for a physical association between Cox23p and Cox17p, the most likely explanation of why both proteins are required for the expression of cytochrome oxidase is that they are components of a common pathway. This is consistent with evidence showing a genetic interaction between the two. The fact that COX17 is a high copy suppressor of the cox23 mutant but not the converse further argues that Cox17p functions downstream of Cox23p. These observations raise the possibility that Cox23p and Cox17p act sequentially in a mitochondrial copper transfer/distribution pathway with cytochrome oxidase as one or perhaps the sole target. We have recently reported another protein, designated Cox19p, with properties similar to Cox23p and Cox17p (including its localization and requirement for cytochrome oxidase assembly) (30Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40206-40211Google Scholar). Cox19p is homologous to Cox17p but has no sequence similarity to Cox23p. It is conceivable that Cox19p is another member of this pathway. We thank Dr. Sandro R. Valentin (Universidade Estadual Paulista, Araraquara, São Paulo, Brazil) for the gift of BYΔCOX23 and Ana R.

https://openalex.org/W2003074473,"The B-RafV599E-mediated constitutive activation of ERK1/2 is involved in establishing the transformed phenotype of some uveal melanoma cells (Calipel, A., Lefevre, G., Pouponnot, C., Mouriaux, F., Eychene, A., and Mascarelli, F. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 42409–42418). We have shown that stem cell factor (SCF) is involved in the proliferation of normal uveal melanocytes and that c-Kit is expressed in 75% of primary uveal melanomas. This suggests that the acquisition of autonomous growth during melanoma progression may involve the SCF/c-Kit axis. We used six human uveal melanoma tumor-derived cell lines and normal uveal melanocytes to characterize the SCF/c-Kit system and to assess its specific role in transformation. We investigated the possible roles of activating mutations in c-KIT, the overexpression of this gene, and ligand-dependent c-Kit overactivation in uveal melanoma cell tumorigenesis. Four cell lines (92.1, SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31) expressed both SCF and c-Kit, and none harbored the c-KIT mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 that have been shown to induce SCF-independent c-Kit activation. Melanoma cell proliferation was strongly inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of c-Kit in these cells, despite the presence of V599EB-Raf in SP6.5 and TP31 cells. We characterized the signaling pathways involved in SCF/c-Kit-mediated cell growth and survival in normal and tumoral melanocytes and found that constitutive ERK1/2 activation played a key role in both the SCF/c-Kit autocrine loop and the gain of function of V599EB-Raf for melanoma cell proliferation and transformation. We also provide the first evidence that Glivec®/STI571, a c-Kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could be used to treat uveal melanomas. The B-RafV599E-mediated constitutive activation of ERK1/2 is involved in establishing the transformed phenotype of some uveal melanoma cells (Calipel, A., Lefevre, G., Pouponnot, C., Mouriaux, F., Eychene, A., and Mascarelli, F.

We also provide the first evidence that Glivec®/STI571, a c-Kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could be used to treat uveal melanomas. Many components of the mitogenic signaling pathways in normal and neoplastic cells have been identified. They include the large family of protein kinases, which play central roles in diverse biological processes, such as the control of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Yarden Y. Ullrich A.

Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Google Scholar). Protein kinases, including receptor tyrosine kinases, are considered to be prime targets for the development of selective inhibitors for tumor treatment because they are frequently deregulated in human cancers. Constitutive receptor tyrosine kinase activation has been shown to be important for malignant transformation and tumor proliferation and may occur by several mechanisms. In most cases, gene amplification, overexpression, mutations, and ligand-dependent or ligand-independent overactivation are responsible for the acquired transforming potential of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (5Zwick E. Bange J. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 161-173Google Scholar, 6Fabbro D. Garcia-Echeverria C. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov.

The ligand for c-Kit has been identified as stem cell factor (SCF), which is also referred to as Kit ligand, Steel factor, or mast cell factor. The c-KIT gene product is essential for the maintenance of normal hematopoiesis, melanogenesis, the development of melanocytes, gametogenesis, and the growth and differentiation of mast cells and interstitial cells of Cajal (7Ashman L.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1037-1051Google Scholar). The deregulation of c-Kit is thought to play a role in certain tumors, including cutaneous melanomas, germ cell tumors, mast cell tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), small cell lung cancers (SCLCs), breast cancers, and neuroblastomas (8Matsuda R.

The SCF/c-Kit axis may mediate solid tumor development by autocrine or paracrine stimulation of the receptor or specific mutation of c-KIT, resulting in ligand-independent activation of the receptor (13DiPaola R.S.

The pharmacological compound Glivec® (formerly known as CGP 57148B, STI571, Imatinib, or Gleevec™), a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative, inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of c-ABL, BCR-ABL, and PDGFRs (19Buchdunger E.

During malignant transformation, cutaneous melanocytes acquire the ability to express and to secrete autocrine growth factors. The oncogenic behavior of cutaneous melanoma results from a combination of autocrine growth factor stimulation and activating mutations in BRAF and RAS. Downstream intracellular signaling pathways, such as the MAPK or ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) module, which controls growth, cell survival, and transformation, are deregulated (26Smalley K.S. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 527-532Google Scholar). Few or no mutations have been found in the genes encoding proteins of the major intracellular signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation in human uveal melanomas, including those affected in cutaneous melanoma, with the exception of V599EB-Raf, for which mutations have been detected in a few uveal melanoma cell lines (27Soparker C.N. O'Brien J.M. Albert D.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 2203-2209Google Scholar, 28Singh A.D. Wang M.X. Donoso L.A. Shields C.L. De Potter P. Shields J.A. Semin.

Kelsell D.P. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 1403-1405Google Scholar). Thus, the deregulation of growth factor signaling may be more important in uveal melanoma than in cutaneous melanoma tumorigenesis. We have demonstrated that c-Kit is activated by exogenous SCF during normal uveal melanocyte (NUM) proliferation and probably also during pathogenic bilateral and diffuse uveal cell proliferation (34Mouriaux F. Chahud F. Maurage C.A. Malecaze F. Labalette P. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 151-157Google Scholar). We have also shown that c-Kit is expressed in 75% of primary choroidal melanomas (35Mouriaux F. Kherrouche Z. Maurage C.A. Demailly F.X. Labalette P. Saule S. Melanoma Res. 2003; 13: 161-166Google Scholar). Mitotic activity and c-Kit immunoreactivity are positively correlated, suggesting that c-Kit is involved in the transformation of normal uveal melanocytes into tumor cells (35Mouriaux F. Kherrouche Z. Maurage C.A. Demailly F.X. Labalette P. Saule S. Melanoma Res. 2003; 13: 161-166Google Scholar). However, the roles of SCF/c-Kit and of the downstream intracellular signaling pathway have been evaluated during the transformation of normal uveal melanocytes. Fiorentini et al. (36Fiorentini G. Rossi S. Lanzanova G. Bernardeschi P. Dentico P. De Giorgi U. Ann. Oncol. 2003; 14: 805Google Scholar) used Glivec® in a few cases of metastatic uveal melanomas and obtained mixed results, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms involved in uveal melanomas were more complex than previously suspected.We therefore investigated the exact role of c-Kit in uveal melanocyte transformation. We investigated c-Kit and SCF expression, the biological effects of exogenous and endogenous SCF, SCF/c-Kit downstream signaling, and the possible involvement of activating mutations of c-KIT in the proliferation, transformation, and survival of normal and tumoral human uveal melanocytes. Finally, we investigated the potential therapeutic role of chemical agents, such as Glivec®, in controlling uveal melanoma cell tumorigenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—NUM were isolated, as previously described (37Hu D.N. McCormick S.A. Ritch R. Pelton-Henrion K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 2210-2219Google Scholar), from human enucleated eyes (generously provided by Prof. P. Gain, Faculté de Médecine, Saint-Etienne, France). NUM were cultured in FIC medium (F-12 Ham's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2.5 μg/ml fungizone/amphotericin B, 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10 ng/ml cholera toxin (Calbiochem), 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml FGF2 (obtained from Dr. H. Prats (INSERM U397, Toulouse, France))). 92.1, Mel270 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Jager, University of Leiden, The Netherlands), OCM-1, MKT-BR, SP6.5 (kindly provided by Dr. F. Malecaze, Ophthalmology Department, CHU Toulouse, France), and TP31 (kindly provided by Dr. Guerin, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire de Quebec, Canada) cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS, 2.5 μg/ml fungizone/amphotericin B, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). NUM and melanoma cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified air/CO2 (19:1) atmosphere.Cell Proliferation Assay—The molecular aspects of cell proliferation were investigated by treating cells with specific pharmacological inhibitors of signaling pathways or immunoblocking antibodies. Stock solutions were made up in Me2SO such that the final concentration of Me2SO in culture medium did not exceed 0.1%, a concentration shown to have no effect on the proliferation of NUM and melanoma cells. Cells were seeded in triplicate in 24-well plates at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells/well for NUM and 1.5 × 104 cells/well for melanoma cells. The plates were incubated for 3 days and were then treated with 1) recombinant human SCF (BIOSOURCE), 2) immunoblocking anti-c-Kit monoclonal antibody (clone K44.2, BIOSOURCE), 3) UO126 and Akt inhibitor (Calbiochem), and 4) Glivec® (kindly provided by W-M. Weber, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland). With the exception of recombinant human SCF, inhibitors were added 2 h before cell proliferation induction and at induction. The number of viable cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric method after 3 days of culture in low serum conditions (0.5% FCS). The percentage of growth inhibition was calculated with respect to control Me2SO-treated cells.Cell Cycle Progression and Cell Apoptosis Analysis—Cell cycle analyses were performed by determining DNA content with propidium iodide (PI) after 24 h in culture. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for at least 2 h at 4 °C. They were rehydrated in cold PBS, treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A (Roche Applied Science), and stained with 50 mg/ml PI for at least 15 min at 4 °C. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Epics ALTRA, Beckman Coulter).Apoptotic cell death was analyzed with the annexin-V-EGFP and PI double staining method (ApoAlert® Annexin V-EGFP kit; Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were treated for 48 h and then incubated briefly with trypsin, rinsed once in serum-containing medium, and rinsed once in 1× binding buffer. They were then incubated with annexin-EGFP and PI for 15 min at room temperature. The percentages of apoptotic (annexin V-positive) and necrotic (IP-positive) cells were determined by flow cytometry.Transformation Assay—Cell transformation was analyzed in a clonogenic assay by determining the ability of cells to form colonies in methyl-cellulose under anchorage-independent conditions. Melanoma cells were suspended in complete medium containing 0.8% methylcellulose (Fluka Methocel MC; Sigma) and either Glivec® or vehicle. They were then plated in 35-mm culture dishes (5500 (OCM-1) or 7000 (Mel270) cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks. Colonies in three randomly chosen 9-cm2 areas were counted every 2 days from day 10 to day 16 of the culture period.Genomic DNA Purification, PCR, and Mutation Screening—Genomic DNA was prepared from normal melanocytes and melanoma cell lines according to standard procedures, checked by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gels, and quantified by spectrophotometry. We analyzed exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of the human c-KIT gene, using specific PCR primers designed to amplify each exon plus its flanking intron sequences (Table I). The primers for amplification of exon 15 of the human BRAF gene have been described elsewhere (31Calipel A. Lefevre G. Pouponnot C. Mouriaux F. Eychene A. Mascarelli F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42409-42418Google Scholar). PCR amplification was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl, containing 250 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 μm each primer, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.25 IU of Platinium High Fidelity TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). DNA was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and was then amplified by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, annealing of the primer pair at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The last cycle was extended by a 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. The amplified products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and purified with the Qiagen MiniElute purification kit (Qiagen) before sequencing (MWG Biotech).Table IPrimer sequences used to amplify exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of the human C-KIT geneExonExon sizePrimersPCR product sizeForward (5′–3′)Reverse (5′–3′)bpbp9194TATGCCACATCCCAAGTGGGTGTGATGCATGTATTACC39011127GAGTGCTCTAATGACTGAGCCACTGGAGTTCCTTAAAG26613111GACATCAGTTTGCCAGTTGGCAAGAGAGAACAACAG29317111GTGAACATCATTCAAGGCGTTACATTATGAAAATCACAGG390 Open table in a new tab RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from uveal melanoma cells by the single-step Trizol method and treated with amplification grade DNase I for 15 min at room temperature. For NUM, mRNA was extracted directly, using the μMACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). We subjected 1 μg of RNA (for uveal melanoma cells) and 100 ng of mRNA (for normal melanocytes) to reverse transcription for 1 h at 42 °C, using oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. We then determined the level of expression of c-KIT and SCF genes by amplifying the cDNAs obtained by semiquantitative PCR for 35 cycles with annealing at 56 °C. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin levels, determined after 22 cycles of amplification, were used to control for loading and constant expression. The following primers were used: c-Kit, forward (5′-TGACTTACGACAGGCTCGTG-3′) and reverse (5′-AAGGAGTGAACAGGGTGTGG-3′) (327 bp); SCF, forward (5-ATGAAGAAGACACAAACTTGGATT-3′) and reverse (5′-GGTACCCACTTCTTGAAACTCTCTCTC-3′) (818 and 734 bp); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward (5′-GGCATCACCACGAAAATCTCCA-3′) and reverse (5′-GGTTGCTTTGGCCGGGATTAGTC-3′) (546 bp); β-actin, forward (5′-AGGAGAAGCTGTGCTACGTC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATAC-3′) (470 bp).Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin-embedded primary tumor specimens of human uveal melanomas were obtained from the Ophthalmology Department (CHRU Lille, France); 4-μm sections were mounted on silane-coated glass slides. Antigen was retrieved by heating in 10 nm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in an oven. Standard avidin-biotin peroxidase immunochemistry was performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Kit and mouse monoclonal anti-SCF antibodies (C19 (1:400) and H-189 (1:20), respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Aminoethylcarbazole was used as the chromogen. The slides were mounted in a water-miscible mounting medium after counterstaining with Mayer's hematoxylin. Negative control sections were incubated with normal mouse or rabbit serum instead of primary antibodies. A pathologist blind to clinical history scored staining and interpreted the immunohistochemical results.Western Blot Analysis—NUM and OCM-1 cells were washed twice in PBS, lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin, 20 kallikrein inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined with the BioRad protein assay kit. Cell lysates were mixed with 3× Laemmli buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. They were then resolved by SDS-PAGE (10 or 15% polyacrylamide gels) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon™; Millipore Corp.) by electrotransfert. To analyze c-Kit and SCF levels, membranes were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against c-Kit and a mouse monoclonal antibody against SCF (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Polyclonal antibodies directed against phospho-c-Kit (Tyr703) (1:100, Zymed Laboratory), phospho-c-Kit (Tyr719), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) were used to analyze the activation of these kinases during the proliferation of NUM and melanoma cells. Membranes were probed with a rat monoclonal antibody directed against α-tubulin (1:1000, Serotec) to control for equal loading. These primary antibodies were tagged with specific secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Antibody complexes were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences), and the membrane was placed against BioMax Light-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Inhibition of c-Kit Expression by Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)— Uveal melanoma cells were plated at 50–60% confluence in complete melanoma cell culture medium in 24-well plates and were incubated for 24 h. They were then transiently transfected in OptiMEM I medium (Invitrogen) with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and either control or anti-c-Kit siRNAs (800 ng/ml), using the Sure Silencing human KIT siRNA kit, as recommended by the manufacturer (Super-Array Bioscience Co.). Five hours later, the Optimen I medium was replaced by complete culture medium. Effects on cell proliferation and death and c-Kit down-regulation were assessed 72 h after transfection, by MTT assay, annexin V-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and Western blotting, as previously described.Statistics—Two-tailed Student's t tests (normal distributions with equal variances) and Mann and Whitney tests (nonparametric tests) were used for statistical analysis.RESULTSExogenous SCF Is a Poor Mitogen for Uveal Melanoma Cells, Despite c-Kit Expression—Mutations in the major intracellular signaling pathway controlling cell proliferation were rare or absent in human uveal melanoma cells, in contrast to what has been observed for cutaneous melanoma cells. This suggests that the deregulation of growth factor signaling may play a central role in uveal melanoma tumorigenesis. Since exogenous SCF stimulates normal human uveal melanocyte proliferation (34Mouriaux F. Chahud F. Maurage C.A. Malecaze F. Labalette P. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 151-157Google Scholar), we thought that SCF might be involved in uveal melanoma growth. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the expression of SCF and its receptor, c-Kit, in six primary uveal melanoma tumors. We demonstrated by RT-PCR that all of the tumors expressed c-Kit and that four also expressed SCF, albeit at very low levels in one patient (patient 11) (Fig. 1A). The expression of these two proteins was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on uveal melanoma cells (Fig. 1B). The large pro-portion of primary uveal melanomas expressing both SCF and c-Kit suggests the possible involvement of SCF/c-Kit in these tumors.We used primary uveal melanoma tumor-derived cell lines to characterize the role of the SCF/c-Kit signaling in transformation. We investigated the effects of exogenous SCF on uveal melanoma cells by analyzing the mitogenic activity of this molecule in six human uveal melanoma cell lines (OCM-1, MKT-BR, 92.1, SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31) and in control normal uveal melanocytes. NUM proliferation was stimulated by 50 ng/ml SCF (Fig. 2A), confirming our previous results (34Mouriaux F. Chahud F. Maurage C.A. Malecaze F. Labalette P. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 151-157Google Scholar). Three of the six uveal melanoma cell lines (OCM-1, MKT-BR, and 92.1) were insensitive to SCF stimulation, whereas the other three (SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31) responded to SCF stimulation but much more weakly than normal melanocytes (Fig. 2A). The surprising inefficiency of high concentrations of exogenous SCF in the stimulation of uveal melanoma cell proliferation may be due to 1) a lack of c-Kit expression on the cell surface in the melanoma cell lines, 2) the presence of activating mutations in c-KIT, conferring ligand independence, 3) the autocrine stimulation of melanoma cells by secreted endogenous SCF, rendering cells insensitive to further stimulation with exogenous SCF, or 4) the presence of the V599EB-Raf activating mutation, rendering stimulation with exogenous SCF unnecessary for maximal rates of cell proliferation.Fig. 2Effects of SCF on cell proliferation and expression of c-Kit and SCF mRNA and protein in normal uveal melanocytes and uveal melanoma cells. A, effects of exogenous SCF on the pro-liferation of NUM and six uveal melanoma cell lines were investigated, using the MTT colorimetric method. Cells were cultured with FIC medium supplemented with 20% FCS (NUM) or in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS (melanoma cells) for 3 days. Cell cultures were then stimulated with FIC medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS (NUM) or with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS (melanoma cells) in the presence or absence of SCF (50 ng/ml) for 3 days. The percentage growth induction was calculated with respect to control PBS-treated cells. The levels of c-Kit and SCF mRNAs were determined by RT-PCR (B) (see the legend to Fig. 1 for an explanation of the two bands for SCF), and those of c-Kit and SCF proteins were determined by Western blotting (C), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 145- and 125-kDa isoforms of c-Kit correspond to the mature and immature forms of the receptor, respectively. The 43- and 31-kDa isoforms of SCF are the translation products of the alternatively spliced mRNAs. The data presented are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)V599EB-Raf and SCF/c-Kit Expression Is Not Mutually Exclusive in Uveal Melanoma Cells—We investigated the expression of c-Kit and SCF in NUM and in the six melanoma cell lines. RT-PCR confirmed that SCF-responsive normal melanocytes expressed c-Kit mRNA (Fig. 2B). C-Kit mRNA was also detected in the 92.1, SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31 cell lines but not in the OCM-1 and MKT-BR cell lines (Fig. 2B). These results were confirmed by Western blotting, which showed that c-Kit protein and transcript profiles were similar, both in NUM and in melanoma cell line cultures (Fig. 2C). In subsequent experiments, the OCM-1 and MKT-BR cell lines were therefore considered to be c-Kit-negative and the 92.1, SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31 cell lines were considered to be c-Kit-positive. The high rate of melanoma cell proliferation in basal culture medium (without SCF) cannot be due to c-Kit overproduction, because NUM produced similar amounts of c-Kit to TP31 melanoma cells and more c-Kit than the other five melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, c-Kit levels generally mirrored the proliferative responses of melanoma cells to exogenous SCF. This is consistent with the lack of a mitogenic effect of exogenous SCF in the OCM-1 and MKT-BR cell lines, due to the absence of c-Kit. However, these data did not account for the weak responses of the 92.1, SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31 cell lines to exogenous SCF. We therefore cannot rule o"
https://openalex.org/W2028601165,"Cell growth control mechanisms were studied based on organization of components in glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomain (GEM) in WI38 cells <i>versus</i> their oncogenic transformant VA13 cells. Levels of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and cSrc were 4 times and 2–3 times higher, respectively, in VA13 than in WI38 GEM, whereas the level of tetraspanin CD9/CD81 was 3–5 times higher in WI38 than in VA13 GEM. Csk, the physiological inhibitor of cSrc, was present in WI38 but not in VA13 GEM. Functional association of GEM components in control of cell growth in WI38 is indicated by several lines of evidence. (i) Confluent, growth-inhibited WI38 showed a lower degree of FGF-induced MAPK activation than actively growing cells in sparse culture. (ii) The level of inactive cSrc (with Tyr-527 phosphate) was higher in confluent cells than in actively growing cells. Both processes i and ii were inhibited by GM3 since they were enhanced by GM3 depletion with d-<i>threo</i>-1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (P4). (iii) The high level of inactive cSrc associated with growth-inhibited cells was caused by coexisting Csk in WI38 GEM. (iv) Interaction of GM3 with FGFR was demonstrated by binding of GM3 to FGFR in the GEM fraction, as probed with GM3-coated beads, and by confocal microscopy. In contrast to WI38, both cSrc and MAPK in VA13 were strongly activated regardless of FGF stimulation or GM3 depletion by P4. Continuous, constitutive activation of both cSrc and MAPK was due to (i) a much higher level of cSrc and FGFR in VA13 than in WI38 GEM, (ii) their close association/interaction in VA13 GEM as indicated by clear coimmunoprecipitation between cSrc and FGFR, and (iii) the absence of Csk in VA13 GEM, making GEM incapable of inhibiting cSrc activation."

Our results identify EphA receptors as positive regulators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that exerts neurogenesis of neural precursor cells from the developing central nervous system. The mammalian central nervous system is derived from a monolayer of germinal neuroepithelial cells, which are composed of self-renewing multipotent precursor cells in the ventricular zone. These most immature precursor cells generate mitotic and lineage-restricted intermediate progenitor cells. Fetal telencephalic neuroepithelial cells contain neural precursors that give rise to the neuronal lineage and the glial lineage. The fate of neural precursors in the developing brain is believed to be determined by intrinsic cellular programs and by external cues (1Gage F.H. Science. 2000; 287: 1433-1438Google Scholar). Newly generated cortical neurons in the ventricular zone migrate along the surface of radial glial fibers and settle in the cortical plate to orderly layers of the cortex (2Song H. Poo M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 81-88Google Scholar). After reaching its destination, each neuron develops a set of dendrites characteristic of its phenotype and a single long axon that extends along specific routes to reach prospective synaptic partners. The migration of either the entire neuron or its nerve growth cones is guided by the interaction between the neuron and its local environment. These navigations use similar guidance molecules.Eph receptor tyrosine kinases/ephrins interactions are implicated in axon guidance, neural crest cell migration, establishment of segmental boundaries, and formation of angiogenic capillary plexi (3Klein R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 196-203Google Scholar). Ephrins play important roles during axon guidance by providing a repulsive guidance signal to Eph receptors in cells. A migrating growth cone expressing a particular Eph receptors would turn away from a cell that presents the cognate ephrin ligand. Eph receptors and ephrins are divided into two subclasses, A and B, based on binding specificities. Ephrin subclasses are further distinguished by their mode of attachment to the plasma membrane; ephrin-A ligands bind EphA receptors and are anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, whereas ephrin-B ligands bind EphB receptors and are anchored via a transmembrane domain. A recent study localized Eph receptors and ephrin ligands to the subventricular zone in the adult rat where neural stem cells reside (4Katz L.C. Shatz C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1133-1138Google Scholar). Activation of EphB by a 3-day infusion of the ectodomain of either EphB2 or ephrin-B2 into the lateral ventricle of the adult rat appeared to increase the number of neural stem cells, suggesting promotion of proliferation (5Conover J.C.

These findings prompted us to hypothesize that Eph/ephrin interactions are involved in the differentiation or maintenance of the neural stem cells in the developing central nervous system. In this manuscript, we show the presence of EphA receptors and its cognate ligand ephrin-A in the neural precursor cells in vitro and in vivo and that activation of EphA receptors alters the fate of neural precursor cells to a neuronal commitment.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESImmunohistochemistry—Mouse embryos at embryonic day 14.5 were killed by anesthetic overdose and dipped in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.2). Next, they were cryoprotected overnight in SPB composed of 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline and 3% sucrose. The bodies were embedded in Tissue Tek O.C.T. compound (Sankura Finetek, Torrance, CA), followed by cryosection at 14 μm. The following antibodies were used as primary antibodies: anti-EphA3 antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz), anti-EphA4 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz), anti-ephrin-A1 antibody (1: 500; Santa Cruz), and anti-nestin antibody (Rat-401, 1:300; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Ephrin-A1-Fc or EphA2-Fc preincubated with the anti-human IgG-Fc antibody (Sigma) at a fixed ratio of 0.1× indicated concentrations of Fc fusion proteins. Sections were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS and then were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies, followed by incubation with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC or Alexa fluor 568 for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were mounted with Immunon™ (Thermo Shandon) and viewed under a SM510-V2.01 laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). The specificity of the antibodies was assessed with a competition study using a ratio of 10× blocking peptide, EphA3P (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or by leaving out the primary antibodies. Western blot analysis of cells expressing the proteins was also performed.Primary Cell Culture—The procedure used to generate neurospheres from the embryonic forebrain was described previously (9Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 1-13Google Scholar). Briefly, the forebrains were dissected from mouse embryos at E14 in PBS and then were transferred to defined media (MHM) composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1; Invitrogen), glucose (0.6%; Wako), NaHCO3, HEPES (0.5 mm; Sigma), l-glutamine (2 mm), bovine transferrin (80 mg), insulin (20 mg), putrescine (56 nm), sodium selenite (28 nm), and progesterone (19 nm). The tissues were mechanically triturated into single cells in MHM with a fire-polished pipette. The cells were cultured in MHM containing 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigma) and bFGF (R & D Systems, Inc.) in noncoated dishes for 4 days in vitro (DIV) at a density of 2 × 105 cell/ml.Differentiation Assay—The generated neurospheres were dissociated mechanically, plated at a density of 1 × 105 cell/ml/well (24-well plate) on poly-l-ornithine coated coverslips, and then allowed to differentiate for 5 DIV in the presence of BrdUrd (10 μg/ml) with or without 2.5 μg/well (24-well plate) ephrin-A1-Fc immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, 170 ng/ml soluble human IgG-Fc, 500 ng/ml soluble ephrin-B2-Fc (Genzyme Techne), 500 ng/ml soluble ephrin-A1-Fc (Genzyme Techne), and 100 μm PD098059 (Sigma). The ligand (human IgG-Fc, ephrin-B2-Fc, and ephrin-A1-Fc) multimers were generated by preincubation with the anti-Fc antibody at a fixed ratio of 0.1× the indicated concentrations of Fc fusion proteins.Immunocytochemistry—Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following primary antibodies were used: anti-EphA3 antibody (1:500), anti-nestin antibody (1:300), anti-TuJ1 antibody (1:2000; RDI), anti-GFAP antibody (1:5; Dako), anti-O4 antibody (1:200; Chemicon), rabbit polyclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody (1:2000; Chemicon), and anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:1000; Sigma). When two mouse-derived antibodies were used simultaneously, a Zenon mouse IgG labeling kit was employed. Briefly, 5 μl of the Zenon mouse IgG labeling regent was added to 1 μg of antibody solution and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 5 μl of the Zenon blocking reagent was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then the cells were immunostained by the procedure used for immunohistochemistry.TUNEL Analysis—Analysis of apoptotic cells was carried out by employing DeadEnd™ Fluotometric TUNEL System (Promega). Briefly, the cells were immobilized to slides in freshly prepared 4% methanol-free formaldehyde solution in PBS (pH 7.4). The cells were Permeabilized by immersing the slides in 0.2% Triton X-100 solution in PBS for 5 min. After rinsing in PBS, excess liquid was removed by tapping the slides. The cells were covered with Equilibration Buffer and stayed for 5-10 min. Then the cells were added to TdT incubation buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by immersing slides in 2× SSC for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed with PBS and observed under a microscope.RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—The neurospheres cultured for 4 days were rinsed with PBS by centrifuging at 400 rpm for 5 min. The medium was replaced with the same volume of MHM with 340 ng/ml human IgG-Fc or 500 ng/ml ephrin-A1-Fc for 5 days with or without EGF plus bFGF. Total cellular RNA was prepared using Isogen (Nippon Gene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cDNA was synthesized employing Ready-To-Go™ (Amersham Biosciences). The PCRs were carried out according to the standard protocols. Optimal MgCl2 concentrations and cycle numbers for liner amplification range were determined. Primer sequences (forward and backward) and product sizes were as follows: tyrosine hydroxylase (5′-TGTCAGAGGAGCCCGAGGTC-3′, 5′-CCAAGAGCAGCCCATCAAAG-3′, 300 bp); l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (5′-CCTACTGGCTGCTCGGACTAA-3′, 5′GCGTACCAGTGACTCAAACTC-3′, 715 bp), vesicular monoamine transporter (5′-ATCCAGACCACCAGACCAGAG-3′, 5′-CCCCATCCAAGAGCACCAAG-3′, 616 bp), Ptx-3 (5′-CGTGCGTGTTGGTTCAAGAA-3′, 5′-GCGGTGAGAATACAGGTTGTGAAG, 616 bp), and β-actin (5′-TCCTCCCTGGAGAAGAGCTA-3′, 5′-TCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACAT, 383 bp). Reverse transcription-PCR products were analyzed in an agarose gel.Slice Culture—The forebrains of mouse embryos at E14.5 were sagittally sliced manually on a glass plate. The slices were mounted in collagen gel as previously described (8Miyata M. Finch E.A. Khiroug L. Hashimoto K. Hayasaka S. Oda S. Inouye M. Takagishi Y. Augustine G.J. Kano M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 233-244Google Scholar) and placed in an incubator. The slices were kept in MHM on ice until mounting. The culture medium was modified neurosphere culture containing BrdUrd (10 μg/ml) and 80 ng/ml EGF plus 80 ng/ml bFGF with or without soluble 100 μg/ml EphA2-Fc or 100 μg/ml EphB2-Fc (Genzyme Techne). After a 5-DIV culture in a well of a 6-well plate, the slices were embedded in Tissue Tek O.C.T. compound, followed by cryosection at 14 μm, and sectioned with a virbratome slicing machine for immunohistochemistry.The numbers of cells double-positive for BrdUrd and TuJ or microtubule-associated protein 2 were counted on sections taken from 80 ng/ml EGF plus 80 ng/ml bFGF with or without soluble 100 μg/ml EphA2-Fc-treated slice culture (six different culture series of ∼10 slice cultures each). Within each sample slice culture, several sections were analyzed. For each section at least three different grid-fields (10000 μm2) in SVZ were randomly selected for analysis.Immunoprecipitation—The neurospheres cultured for 3 days were rinsed with PBS by centrifuging at 400 rpm for 5 min, and the medium was replaced with the same volume of MHM without mitogens. Twenty-four hours later, the neurospheres were exposed to 340 ng/ml human IgG-Fc or 500 ng/ml ephrin-A1-Fc for 0 min, 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, or 1 h. Then the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, l μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). Protein concentrations between the cell lines were equalized. Either lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine as previously described (23Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud M. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 527: 4745-4756Google Scholar), or for cytoplasmic lysates, the extracts were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer.Assay for ERK Activity—The neurospheres cultured for 3 days were rinsed with PBS by centrifuging at 400 rpm for 5 min, and the medium was replaced with the same volume of MHM without mitogens. Twenty-four hours later, the neurospheres were exposed to 340 ng/ml human IgG-Fc, 500 ng/ml ephrin-A1-Fc, or 500 ng/ml ephirn-B2-Fc for 0 min, 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, or 1 h. Then the cells were lysed in the lysis buffer. Western blot was performed with anti-MAPK (Sigma), anti-monophosphorylated ERK (Sigma), or anti-ERK (Sigma) antibodies.Ras Activity Assay—Ras activity was assessed by employing the Ras activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, treated cells were lysed in Mg2+ lysis buffer (MLB buffer) containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm ethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet. The cell lysates were incubated with 20 μl of Raf-1 Ras binding domain-agarose conjugate for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with MLB buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. Anti-Ras antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used for the blotting.Rap1 Activity Assay—Affinity precipitation of the activated Rap1 was performed with glutathione S-transferase-Ral binding domain fusion protein precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The Ral-binding domain of Ral GDS in pGEX vector was kindly provided by Dr. Johannes L. Bos. The activity of Rap1 was determined in immunoprecipitates by Western blot analysis using the anti-Rap1 antibody (BD Bioscience). To quantify the relative amounts of protein, we scanned x-ray film and analyzed the digital images using NIH Image.RESULTSEphA Receptors Are Expressed in Neuroepithelial Cells in the Embryonic Day 14.5 Telencephalon—To investigate whether Ephrin/Eph receptors are associated with neurogenesis during the developmental stage, the expression patterns of EphA receptors and their cognate ligands were examined. The antibody RAT401, which recognizes nestin, an intermediate filament specific to undifferentiated neural precursor cells (7Lendahl U. Zimmerman L.B. McKay R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 585-595Google Scholar), was used to identify the neural precursor cells (8Miyata M. Finch E.A. Khiroug L. Hashimoto K. Hayasaka S. Oda S. Inouye M. Takagishi Y. Augustine G.J. Kano M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 233-244Google Scholar). At E14.5, immunoreactivities for EphA3 and 4 were observed in the ventricular zone and the adjacent mantle/intermediate zone (Fig. 1, A and B). Double immunostaining revealed that EphA3 and 4 were colocalized with nestin, which was expressed on the fibers, in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon. Colocalization of other members, such as EphA2, with nestin was also found (data not shown). One of their cognate ligand, ephrin-A1, was weekly expressed in neuroepithelial cells at E14.5 (Fig. 1C). There is a little population that showed double-positive for ephrin-A1 (Fig. 1D, arrowheads) and EphA3 (Fig. 1D). Using Eph-A2-Fc or ephrin-A1-Fc fusion protein, the expression of ephrins and Eph receptors was verified (Fig. 1E). Binding of Eph-A2-Fc (Fig. 1E-a) was weak, whereas that of ephrin-A1-Fc (Fig. 1E, panel b) was strong and widespread in the ventricular zone, suggesting predominant expression of Eph-A receptors. These results suggest that ephrin-A/EphA receptors signals have a role in neurogenesis in the developmental central nervous system.Neural Precursor Cells from the E14.5 Telencephalon Express EphA Receptors—In vitro, single neural stem cells proliferate to form clonally derived floating sphere colonies, designated neurospheres, which contain cells that, upon dissociation into single cells, give rise to new sphere colonies. These cells that can differentiate into neurons and glia proliferate in the presence of bFGF and EGF (9Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 1-13Google Scholar). Sphere-producing cells derived from E14.5 mouse brain were isolated by primary neurosphere formation, and their self-renewing capacity was demonstrated by assessing the number of secondary neurospheres formed (8Miyata M. Finch E.A. Khiroug L. Hashimoto K. Hayasaka S. Oda S. Inouye M. Takagishi Y. Augustine G.J. Kano M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 233-244Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry was performed using the primary spheres cultured for 7 days after dissociation. As expected, immunoreactivities for EphA3 and 4 were abundantly observed in the spheres and were colocalized with those for nestin (Fig. 2A, panels b and c). Although neurospheres are heterogenous, and only a minority of the cells positive for these EphA immunoreactivities was nestin-positive, EphA2 was also found to be colocalized with nestin in the neurospheres (Fig. 2A, panel a). Using Eph-A2-Fc and ephrin-A1-Fc fusion proteins, the expression of ephrins and Eph receptors was verified (Fig. 2C). Binding of Eph-A2-Fc (Fig. 2C, panel a) or ephrin-A1-Fc (Fig. 2C, panel b) fusion protein to some of the nestin-positive cells was observed. One of the cognate ligands for EphA, ephrin-A1, was expressed weakly in a few cells in each sphere and was not colocalized with EphA2 (Fig. 2B, arrowheads). These results suggest the possibility that neural precursor cells expressing EphA receptor may be responsive to ephrin-A ligands.Fig. 2Colocalization of EphA3 and 4 with nestin in neurospheres derived from the E14.5 telencephalon.A, immunofluorescence staining for EphA2 (panel a), EphA3 (panel b), EphA4 (panel c), and nestin in neuroepithelial cells from the developing mouse neocortex at E14.5. Neurospheres immunostained for EphA2, EphA3, EphA4, and nestin, and overlay images (Merge) are shown. B, immunofluorescence staining for EphA2 and ephrin-A1. These immunoreactivities are not colocalized. The arrowheads indicate immunolabeling of only ephrin-A1.

Doetsch F. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Alvarez-Buylla A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 11: 1091-1097Google Scholar). The authors suggested that EphB/ephrin-B signaling is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. In contrast, another paper showed nonmitogenic activity of ephrin-B (10Posern G. Weber C.K. Rapp U.R. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Google Scholar). To determine whether EphA receptors maintained neural stem cells in an undifferentiated state, we stimulated EphA receptors by adding a fusion protein containing ephrin-A1 joined to human Fc to the cultures in vitro. Because the ephrin-Eph signaling system is able to elicit bi-directional signals, ephrin-A can have dual effects: the inhibition of endogenous ephrin-Eph interactions and the unidirectional activation of their respective binding partners. Dissociation of the neurospheres was done to eliminate the effects elicited by cell-cell interaction. Therefore, the addition of ephrin-A is expected to activate the EphA receptor while not inhibiting the ephrin-A reverse signal. These dissociated cells were transferred onto poly-l-ornithine-coated glass slides and cultured in the absence of EGF and bFGF to facilitate the differentiation. DAPI nuclear staining suggested that ephrin-A1-Fc did not increase the cell number and that cell death was apparently not induced by ephrin-A1-Fc (data not shown). Staining with the anti-nestin antibody revealed that the number of nestin-positive cells was gradually decreased between the 1-day and 5-day assay periods, demonstrating the differentiation of neural precursor cells under the condition we adopted (Fig. 3A). Cessation of cell proliferation was clear, from the total number of the cells stained by DAPI. The number of nestin-positive cells treated with ephrin-A1 for 1 or 5 days was not significantly changed compared with that without ephrin-A1 treatment (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that ephrin-A1 did not inhibit the differentiation of neural precursor cells under our experimental conditions. In contrast, ephrin-B treatment resulted in a significant increase in the number of nestin-positive cells, similar to a previous observation in vivo (5Conover J.C. Doetsch F. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Alvarez-Buylla A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 11: 1091-1097Google Scholar). On the other hand, ephrin-A or -B treatment had no effect on apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Thus, activation of EphA receptors may not contribute to proliferation or death of neural precursor cells derived from the E14.5 telencephalon.Fig. 3No proliferation of neural precursor cells by ephrin-A/EphA.A, dissociated neurospheres were cultured with human IgG-Fc, ephrin-A1-Fc, or ephrin-B2-Fc for a day (white bars) or 5 days (black bars) and then subjected to immunofluorescent staining for nestin. The total cell number was calculated by counting DAPI-positive cells. The data are the means ± S.E. of four independent experiments. The asterisks indicate statistical significance. *, p < 0.01 (Student's t test). B, the number of apoptotic cells were not increased during from a day (white bars) to 5 days (black bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ephrin-A-induced Switch in the Fate of Neural Precursor Cells—Because activation of EphA receptors did not promote the differentiation of neural precursor cells in the undifferentiated condition that contained bFGF and EGF, we next determined whether ephrin-A has the potential to switch the fate of neural precursor cells. A thymidine analog, BrdUrd, was included in the culture medium, and the cells positive for BrdUrd, TuJ1, or GFAP were counted in 1- and 5-day cultures of the precursor cells in the differentiated condition, which did not contain bFGF or EGF. This method allowed the direct examination of the possibility that ephrin-A ligands affect the cell fate by specific killing of the differentiated glia in the neurospheres. BrdUrd-unlabeled neurons or glia may be present from the beginning of the culture, and the number of these neurons or glia was not significantly altered by the addition of ephrin-A1 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), the ratio of the cells double-positive for TuJ1, a marker for immature neuron, and BrdUrd to cells positive for BrdUrd was significantly higher in ephrin-A1-treated cultures compared with untreated cultures. In addition, eprhin-A1 treatment increased the expression of neurofilament, a marker for mature neuron, positive cells. Next, we used immobilized ephrin-A1-Fc on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips to mimic the cell-cell contact condition. Immobilized ephrin-A1-Fc induced neurogenesis to the same extent as soluble ephrin-A1-Fc (Fig. 4, A and B). As TuJ1-positive cells express the EphA3 receptor (Fig. 4C), these data suggest that ephrin-A promotes neurogenesis via an EphA-dependent mechanism. In contrast, ephrin-A1 did not increase the number of GFAP-positive cells (Fig. 4, D and E). The ratio of the cells positive for both neuronal and BrdUrd markers to GFAP and BrdUrd markers was significantly increased with ephrin-A-Fc treatment for 5 days (Fig. 4E). The majority of the cells negative for TuJ1 as well as GFAP may be immature precursor cells, as much of these cells were also negative for oligodendrocyte markers. Our data show that ephrin-A1 appears to direct the neuronal fate of proliferating precursors.Fig. 4Promotion of neurogenesis by ephrin-A/EphA.A, dissociated neurospheres were cultured with human IgG-Fc, ephrin-A1-Fc, ephrin-B2-Fc, or immobilized ephrin-A1-Fc. Cells were immunostained with anti-β-tubulin III antibody. Note that the cells that contain BrdUrd are positive for the neuronal marker when treated with soluble or immobilized ephrin-A1. B, increase in the number of neuronal cells following the treatment with ephrin-A. The cells were immunostained with anti-β-tubulin III (left panel) or anti-neurofilament antibody. The percentage of the β-tubulin III-positive or anti-neurofilament-positive cells that colocalized with BrdUrd was determined. The data are the means ± S.E. of four independent experiments). The asterisks indicate statistical significance. *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.05 (Student's t test). C, colocalization of TuJ1 and EphA3. D, cells were immunostained with anti-GFAP antibody.

E, increase in the ratio of the cells double-positive for TuJ+ and BrdUrd+ (left panel) or neurofilament+ and BrdU+ (right panel) to those double-positive for GFAP+ and BrdUrd+ by the treatment with ephrin-A1. Note that neuronal cells were increased compared with the number of GFAP-positive cells by the ephrin-A1 treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we examined whether ephrin-A induced specific neuronal lineages from the neuroepithelial cells contained in neurospheres. As in differentiation assay, immunocytochemical analysis of the characteristics of ephrin-A-induced neurons revealed that most of the neurons immunoreactive for TuJ1 express tyrosine hydroxylase (Fig. 5, A and B), although a significantly lower percentage of neurons in the control cultures were immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase. We assessed expression of cholin acetyltransferase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, or glutamate decarboxylase and found that the values for these markers were much smaller in the ephrin-A-treated group than that for tyrosine hydroxylase (data not shown).Fig. 5Tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons induced by ephrin-A.A, immunofluorescence staining for β-tubulin III (TuJ) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in 5 DIV neural precursor cells simulated by Fc (Fc) or ephrin-A1-Fc (panel b).

https://openalex.org/W2028517019,"The prevention of injury from reactive oxygen species is critical for cellular resistance to many death stimuli. Resistance to death from the superoxide generator menadione in the hepatocyte cell line RALA255–10G is dependent on down-regulation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP-1 signaling pathway by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Because protein kinase C (PKC) regulates both oxidant stress and JNK signaling, the ability of PKC to modulate hepatocyte death from menadione through effects on AP-1 was examined. PKC inhibition with Ro-31-8425 or bisindolylmaleimide I sensitized this cell line to death from menadione. Menadione treatment led to activation of PKCμ, or protein kinase D (PKD), but not PKCα/β, PKCζ/λ, or PKCδ/θ. Menadione induced phosphorylation of PKD at Ser-744/748, but not Ser-916, and translocation of PKD to the nucleus. PKC inhibition blocked menadione-induced phosphorylation of PKD, and expression of a constitutively active PKD prevented death from Ro-31-8425/menadione. PKC inhibition led to a sustained overactivation of JNK and c-Jun in response to menadione as determined by in vitro kinase assay and immunoblotting for the phosphorylated forms of both proteins. Cell death from PKC inhibition and menadione treatment resulted from c-Jun activation, since death was blocked by adenoviral expression of the c-Jun dominant negative TAM67. PKC and ERK1/2 independently down-regulated JNK/c-Jun, since inhibition of either kinase failed to affect activation of the other kinase, and simultaneous inhibition of both pathways caused additive JNK/c-Jun activation and cell death. Resistance to death from superoxide therefore requires both PKC/PKD and ERK1/2 activation in order to down-regulate proapoptotic JNK/c-Jun signaling. The prevention of injury from reactive oxygen species is critical for cellular resistance to many death stimuli. Resistance to death from the superoxide generator menadione in the hepatocyte cell line RALA255–10G is dependent on down-regulation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP-1 signaling pathway by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2).

Until recently, oxidative stress was thought to trigger cell death through the adverse effects of biochemical reactions between oxidants and cellular macromolecules. However, it is now known that oxidant-induced death pathways are far more complex, with death also resulting from the effects of oxidants on signal transduction pathways (1Czaja M.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 759-767Google Scholar, 2Gabbita S.P. Robinson K.A. Stewart C.A. Floyd R.A. Hensley K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 1-13Google Scholar). Central among these signal transducers of oxidant-induced death are the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). In the hepatocyte cell line RALA255-10G, resistance to toxicity from the ROS superoxide depends on activation of the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Treatment of these cells with the superoxide generator menadione induces ERK1/2 activation (3Czaja M.J. Liu H. Wang Y. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1405-1413Google Scholar). Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling causes sustained activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun/AP-1 pathway, resulting in cell death from normally nontoxic concentrations of menadione (3Czaja M.J. Liu H. Wang Y. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1405-1413Google Scholar). Overactivation of JNK/AP-1 signaling is known to mediate cell death from a number of stimuli in both hepatocytes and nonhepatic cells (4Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Google Scholar, 5Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2003; 284: G875-G879Google Scholar). Restricting the duration of this proapoptotic AP-1 activation following superoxide-generated cellular stress is required for hepatocyte resistance to oxidative stress.The critical nature of cellular resistance to oxidant stress suggests the likelihood that redundant or complementary signaling pathways exist in order to protect hepatocytes against oxidant injury. However, upstream inhibitors of AP-1 activation other than ERK1/2 have not been identified after oxidative stress in hepatocytes. In addition to their effects on MAPK signaling, oxidants have been demonstrated to phosphorylate and thereby activate protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Multiple PKC isoforms are phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (6Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Although originally described as a PKC family member, PKD has distinct features that make it part of a separate kinase family that also includes PKD2 and PKD3 (10Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 193-200Google Scholar). Both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD have been reported to result from hydrogen peroxide treatment (8Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Google Scholar, 9Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17114-17121Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide-induced phosphorylation of Ser-744/748 within the PKD activation loop occurs by a PKC-dependent mechanism (11Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Google Scholar, 12Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation, PKD activation involves translocation from the cytoplasm to other cellular compartments, including the nucleus and mitochondria (13Rey O. Sinnett-Smith J. Zhukova E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49228-49235Google Scholar, 14Storz P. Hausser A. Link G. Dedio J. Ghebrehiwet B. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24601-24607Google Scholar). PKD activation has been reported to up-regulate NF-κB signaling, and the protective effects of PKD activation against death from hydrogen peroxide were associated with PKD-dependent NF-κB activation (8Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKD has also been reported to regulate JNK/c-Jun signaling (15Brandlin I. Eiseler T. Salowsky R. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45451-45457Google Scholar, 16Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Google Scholar, 17Hurd C. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 404-408Google Scholar, 18Hurd C. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2154-2160Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that PKD activation induced by oxidative stress may also regulate the AP-1 pathway.The objective of the present study was to examine whether PKC is an upstream regulator of the AP-1 death pathway in a hepatocyte cell line exposed to the superoxide generator menadione. The studies demonstrate that menadione causes a PKC-dependent activation of PKD. Inhibition of PKC/PKD activation leads to increased toxicity from menadione associated with sustained activation of the JNK/AP-1 pathway. Death resulting from PKC/PKD inhibition is blocked by the c-Jun dominant negative TAM67, suggesting that PKD-dependent resistance to menadione toxicity is the result of down-regulation of AP-1 signaling. These data therefore demonstrate for the first time a critical physiologic role for PKC/PKD in the regulation of AP-1 signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture Conditions—All studies were performed in the adult rat hepatocyte line RALA255–10G (RALA hepatocytes). These cells are conditionally immortalized with a mutant SV40 virus expressing a temperature-sensitive T antigen (19Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum (Gemini, Woodland, CA) and antibiotics (Invitrogen) at the permissive temperature of 33 °C. For experiments, cells were plated and cultured at 33 °C for 24 h and then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 1 μm dexamethasone at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C, as previously described (20Jones B.E. Lo C.R. Liu H. Srinivasan A. Streetz K. Valentino K.L. Czaja M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 705-712Google Scholar). Under these conditions, T antigen expression is suppressed, the cells are nontransformed, and they display a differentiated hepatocyte phenotype (19Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Google Scholar, 21Chou J.Y. Yeoh G.C. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5415-5420Google Scholar). Cells were then placed in serum-free medium containing dexamethasone for 18 h prior to the start of an experiment.Cells were pretreated for 1 h with the PKC inhibitors 10 μm Ro-31-8425, 10 μm bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis I), or 10 μm chelerythrine chloride (Calbiochem) dissolved in Me2SO. Cells were treated with menadione (Sigma) at the concentrations indicated. Some cells were pretreated for 1 h prior to the addition of Ro-31-8425 with 10 μm ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3[2H]-one) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), 1000 units of catalase polyethylene glycol (Sigma), or 50 μm Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Calbiochem). Ebselen and Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone were dissolved in Me2SO. In experiments with inhibitors dissolved in Me2SO, untreated control cells received equivalent amounts of Me2SO.3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—Cell death was determined by the MTT assay (22Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar). At 24 h after treatment, the cell culture medium was aspirated, and an equal volume of a 1 mg/ml MTT solution, pH 7.4, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to the cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the MTT solution was removed, and 1.5 ml of N-propyl alcohol was added to solubilize the formazan product. The absorbance of this compound was measured at 560 nm in a spectrophotometer. The percentage of cell death was calculated by dividing the optical density of a treatment group by the optical density for untreated, control cells, multiplying by 100, and subtracting that number from 100.Fluorescence Microscopy—The numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells were quantified by fluorescence microscopy after costaining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide (23Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Marguiles D.H. Shevack E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 1-16Google Scholar), as previously described (24Liu H. Lo C.R. Jones B.E. Pradhan Z. Srinivasan A. Valentino K.L. Stockert R.J. Czaja M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40155-40162Google Scholar). Cells with a shrunken cytoplasm and a condensed or fragmented nucleus as determined by acridine orange staining were considered apoptotic. Necrotic cells were detected by positive staining with ethidium bromide. A minimum of 400 cells per dish were examined, and the numbers of apoptotic, and necrotic cells are expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted.Protein Isolation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—For the isolation of total cellular protein, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions.To isolate nuclear protein, cells were scraped into hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were pipetted vigorously and centrifuged at 800 × g, at 4 °C for 8 min. Supernatants were transferred into new tubes and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g, at 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatants were saved as cytosolic fractions. The pellets were lysed in hypertonic lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were used as nuclear fractions. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay as above.For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein determination was performed as above, and 350 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated by a 1-h incubation with 2 μg of anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody purified from the 12CA5 hybridoma. Samples were then incubated with protein A/G-agarose (Sigma) for 30 min. The immune complexes were washed five times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm sodium chloride and resolved on Western blots as described subsequently.For Western blotting, 50 μg of protein were denaturated at 100 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were applied to 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and resolved at 100 V over 3 h. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 0.01% SDS, and 15% methanol using a Bio-Rad Trans-blot SD semidry transfer cell to which 150 mA were applied for 90 min. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm sodium chloride, and 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h. Membranes were exposed to antibodies against PKD; PKD phosphorylated at Ser-744/748 or Ser-916; phosphorylated PKCα/β; phosphorylated PKCδ/θ; phosphorylated PKCζ/λ; phosphorylated and total ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); JNK1 and JNK2 and c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); protein-disulfide isomerase (a kind gift from R. J. Stockert) (25Terada K. Manchikalapudi P. Noiva R. Jauregui H.O. Stockert R.J. Schilsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20410-20416Google Scholar); and Nopp140 (kindly provided by U. T. Meier) (26Meier U.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19376-19384Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 to 1:6000 dilutions in 5% nonfat milk or bovine serum albumin in TBS-T for 18 h at 4 °C. Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:10,000 in 5% nonfat milk TBS-T for 1 h. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence (Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to x-ray film.Transient Transfections for PKD Overexpression—RALA hepatocytes were transiently transfected with an expression vector containing the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene, CMV-βGal, or with PKD.SS738/742EE. PKD.SS738/742EE expresses an HA-tagged mutant PKD in which the activation loop residues have been replaced with negatively charged Glu, resulting in a constitutively active PKD (27Storz P. Doppler H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a lower density and cultured at 37 °C for a shorter period of time than in the other experiments to allow for a less confluent culture necessary for optimal transfection efficiency. Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was determined by β-galactosidase staining of CMV-βGal-transfected cells using a commercial kit (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with Ro-31-8425 and/or 20 μm menadione as described previously. The percentage cell survival was determined by an MTT assay 18 h later.JNK Assay—JNK activity was measured in cell lysates using a stress-activated protein kinase/JNK assay kit (Cell Signaling), according to the manufacturer's instructions. An N-terminal c-Jun-(1–89) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was used to immobilize JNK from cell lysates containing 250 μg of total protein. After washing, the kinase reaction was performed in the presence of cold ATP using the c-Jun fusion protein as a substrate. Samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the amount of phosphorylated c-Jun was detected with an antibody specific for c-Jun phosphorylated at serine 63. As a control for the loading of equivalent amounts of protein among samples, total c-Jun levels were analyzed by immunoblotting with a rabbit phosphorylation-independent c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were visualized using a secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate as described above.Luciferase Assay—RALA hepatocytes were cultured as previously described and transiently transfected with reporter genes using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) 18 h prior to Ro-31-8425/menadione treatments. Cells were transfected with the AP-1-regulated firefly luciferase reporter gene Coll73-Luc (28Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Google Scholar) and the constitutive Renilla luciferase vector pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activities were assayed as previously described (24Liu H. Lo C.R. Jones B.E. Pradhan Z. Srinivasan A. Valentino K.L. Stockert R.J. Czaja M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40155-40162Google Scholar), and firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.Adenoviruses—The adenoviruses Ad5LacZ, containing the β-galactosidase gene (29Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Google Scholar), and Ad5TAM, which expresses TAM-67, a dominant negative c-Jun (30Bradham C.A. Hatano E. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1279-G1289Google Scholar), were employed. The adenoviruses were grown in 293 cells, purified by banding twice on CsCl gradients, and titered by plaque assay as previously described (31Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E. Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N. Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Google Scholar). RALA hepatocytes were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 20 as previously described (24Liu H. Lo C.R. Jones B.E. Pradhan Z. Srinivasan A. Valentino K.L. Stockert R.J. Czaja M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40155-40162Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—All numerical results are expressed as mean ± S.E. and represent data from three independent experiments with duplicate dishes in each treatment group. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Calculations were made with Sigma Plot 2000 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL).RESULTSPKC Inhibitors Sensitize RALA Hepatocytes to Death from Menadione—Menadione is a quinone compound that undergoes redox cycling resulting in the formation of superoxide (32Monks T.J. Hanzlik R.P. Cohen G.M. Ross D. Graham D.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1992; 112: 2-16Google Scholar, 33Thor H. Smith M.T. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Jewell S.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12419-12425Google Scholar). Recent investigations have demonstrated that RALA hepatocyte death from menadione-induced oxidative stress is regulated by both ERK1/2 and JNK MAPKs (3Czaja M.J. Liu H. Wang Y. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1405-1413Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how oxidative stress triggers activation of these MAPKs. To delineate upstream signals that regulate MAPK-dependent oxidant-induced death in RALA hepatocytes, the effect of PKC inhibition on menadione toxicity was examined. Cells were pretreated with vehicle or the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8425 (34Merritt J.E. Sullivan J.A. Tse J. Wilkinson S. Nixon J.S. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 53-57Google Scholar) and nontoxic and toxic concentrations of menadione that have been previously established (3Czaja M.J. Liu H. Wang Y. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1405-1413Google Scholar). By 24 h of MTT assay, Ro-31-8425 sensitized RALA hepatocytes to 22 and 41% cell death, respectively, from the usually nontoxic 20 and 25 μm concentrations of menadione (Fig. 1A). This PKC inhibitor also further increased death from a toxic 30 μm menadione concentration by almost 2-fold (Fig. 1A), indicating that PKC-dependent protective mechanisms were still operative even at toxic levels of oxidative stress. No toxicity occurred from Ro-31-8425 treatment alone (data not shown).To ensure that death was secondary to PKC inhibition, the effect of a second PKC inhibitor, Bis I (35Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Google Scholar), on menadione toxicity was investigated. Bis I alone was nontoxic (data not shown), but sensitization of RALA hepatocytes to death from menadione occurred with Bis I pretreatment. Death from Bis I/menadione cotreatment was 28% for 20 μm menadione and 47% for 25 μm menadione at 24 h (Fig. 1B), similar to findings for Ro-31-8425/menadione. In contrast, chelerythrine, another purported chemical PKC inhibitor (36Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Google Scholar), failed to sensitize RALA hepatocytes to death from menadione (data not shown).Death from Ro-31-8425/Menadione Cotreatment Results from Caspase-independent Apoptosis—The induction of cell death from combined Ro-31-8425/menadione treatment was additionally confirmed by fluorescence microscopy of acridine orange/ethidium bromide-costained cells. At 24 h, there was a marked increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells after Ro-31-8425/menadione cotreatment but only a slight increase in the number of necrotic cells (Fig. 2A). Apoptosis was secondary to oxidative stress as demonstrated by significant inhibition of death by the antioxidants ebselen and catalase (Fig. 2B). Death was not prevented by the caspase inhibitor Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Fig. 2B). Thus, similar to findings of caspase-independent apoptosis in RALA hepatocytes and nonhepatic cell types from toxic concentrations of menadione (3Czaja M.J. Liu H. Wang Y. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1405-1413Google Scholar, 37Joza N. Susin S.A. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K. Li C.Y. Sasaki T. Elia A.J. Cheng H.Y. Ravagnan L. Ferri K.F. Zamzami N. Wakeham A. Hakem R. Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Mak T.W. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Kroemer G. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Google Scholar), Ro-31-8425/menadione treatment resulted in an oxidant-induced, caspase-independent apoptosis.Fig. 2PKC inhibition leads to caspase-independent apoptosis from menadione. A, the numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined in acridine orange and ethidium bromide-costained cells by fluorescence microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were untreated (Con) or treated with 25 μm menadione (Men), Ro-31-8425 (Ro), or a combination of the two (Ro/Men). The percentages of cells that were apoptotic or necrotic were determined at 12 h after menadione treatment. B, percentage of cell death at 24 h in RALA hepatocytes treated with Ro-31-8425 and 25 μm menadione alone (ϕ), or together with pretreatment with ebselen (Eb), catalase (Cat), or Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD). The data are from three independent experiments performed in duplicate (*, p < 0.0001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Resistance to Menadione Toxicity Requires Early PKC Signaling—To delineate the temporal involvement of protective PKC signaling in the menadione death pathway, RALA hepatocytes were examined for menadione-induced cell death after different times of Ro-31-8425 treatment. Conversion of the Ro-31-8425 1 h pretreatment to 1 h post-treatment still sensitized the cells to significant toxicity from menadione but reduced death from Ro-31-8425/menadione treatment by 36% (Fig. 3). When Ro-31-8425 treatment was delayed to 2 h after menadione administration, the amount of cell death was not significantly different from that of 25 μm menadione alone (Fig. 3). These data indicate that PKC-dependent signaling mediates an immediate protective response against menadione-induced oxidative stress.Fig. 3Early inhibition of PKC signaling is required to sensitize cells to death from menadione. RALA hepatocytes were treated with 25 μm menadione alone (Men) or with Ro-31-8425 as a 1-h pretreatment (–1h) or as a treatment 1, 2, or 4 h after the menadione. The percentage of cell death was determined at 24 h by an MTT assay. The results represent data from three independent experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Menadione Causes Selective PKD Ser-744/748 Phosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation—To identify the PKC isoform mediating RALA hepatocyte resistance to menadione toxicity, levels of active, phosphorylated PKC were examined after menadione treatment. Menadione induced an increase in phospho-PKCμ or phospho-PKD within 1 h after menadione treatment (Fig. 4A). Menadione-induced phosphorylation was specific for Ser-744/748, since no change was detected in the levels of phosphorylation at the Ser-916 residue. Levels of total PKD were also unaffected by menadione treatment. Menadione had no effect on the levels of phosphorylated PKCα/β, PKCζ/λ, or PKCδ/θ (Fig. 4A). Selective PKD Ser-744/748 phosphorylation was induced by both nontoxic and toxic concentrations of menadione (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Menadione induces selective activation of PKD Ser-744/748. A, protein was isolated from untreated RALA hepatocytes, and cells were treated with 25 μm menadione for the indicated number of hours. Aliquots of protein were immunoblotted with antibodies against PKD phosphorylated at Ser-744/748 (P-PKD(Ser744/8)) or Ser-916 (P-PKD(Ser916)), total PKD, and phosphorylated forms of PKCα/β (P-PKCα/β), PKCζ/λ (P-PKCζ/λ), and PKCδ/θ (P-PKCδ/θ). B, immunoblots performed with the same antibodies on cells untreated or treated with the indicated micromolar concentrations of menadione for 2 h. C, RALA hepatocytes were untreated or treated with 25 μm menadione for the indicted number of minutes. Nuclear and cytosolic protein fractions were obtained as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein aliquots were immunoblotted with the PKD antibodies plus antibodies to Nopp140 and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). The results are representative of three independent experiments. Numerical results under the PKD Western blots represent the relative signal intensity among samples from densitometry scanning of the three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Once"
https://openalex.org/W2086644742,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) is a member of the broad substrate specificity class of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinases and functions as a potent stimulator of Ca2+-dependent gene expression. Activation of CaMKIV is a transient, tightly regulated event requiring both Ca2+/CaM binding and phosphorylation of the kinase on T200 by an upstream CaMK kinase (CaMKK). Previously, CaMKIV was shown to stably associate with protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which was proposed to play a role in negatively regulating the kinase. Here we report that the Ca2+/CaM binding-autoinhibitory domain of CaMKIV is required for association of the kinase with PP2A and that binding of PP2A and Ca2+/CaM appears to be mutually exclusive. We demonstrate that inhibition of the CaMKIV/PP2A association in cells results in enhanced CaMKIV-mediated gene transcription that is independent of Ca2+/CaM. The enhanced transcriptional activity correlates with the elevated level of phospho-T200 that accumulates when CaMKIV is prevented from interacting with PP2A. Collectively, these data suggest a molecular basis for the sequential activation and inactivation of CaMKIV. First, in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+, CaMKIV binds Ca2+/CaM and becomes phosphorylated on T200 by CaMKK. These events result in the generation of autonomous activity required for CaMKIV-mediated transcriptional regulation. The CaMKIV-associated PP2A then dephosphorylates CaMKIV T200, thereby terminating autonomous activity and CaMKIV-mediated gene transcription.

Schulman H. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 103-114Google Scholar, 2Anderson K.A. Kane C.D. Biometals. 1998; 11: 331-343Google Scholar). Whereas CaMKI and CaMKII are ubiquitously expressed, CaMKIV is present in a limited number of cells and tissues (3Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Google Scholar, 4Frangakis M.V. Chatila T. Wood E.R. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17592-17596Google Scholar, 5Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S.

Analysis of the phenotypic consequences caused by the absence of CaMKIV in genetically manipulated mice led to the hypothesis that CaMKIV is involved in the differentiation of cells in which it is expressed (6Anderson K.A.

Ho N. Engle D.L. Williams C.B. Chatila T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6270-6278Google Scholar). At the cellular level, CaMKIV is a potent activator of Ca2+-dependent transcription mediated by a number of factors, including CREB, the CREB-related factor ATF-1, the MADS-box family members SRF and MEF2D, and the orphan receptors RORα, RORγ, and COUP-TF1 (12Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Google Scholar, 13Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Google Scholar, 14Sun P.

CaMKIV-dependent activation of CREB, the most extensively studied cellular activity of the kinase, can occur through the direct phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-133 (16Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Google Scholar). However, CaMKIV can also stimulate CREB-mediated transcription by activating the CREB-binding protein through a mechanism that remains to be elucidated (17Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Google Scholar) but may also involve direct phosphorylation (18Impey S. Fong A.L. Wang Y. Cardinaux J.R. Fass D.M. Obrietan K. Wayman G.A. Storm D.R. Soderling T.R. Goodman R.H. Neuron. 2002; 34: 235-244Google Scholar). The regulation of CaMKIV has been the subject of a number of studies. As is the case for other CaM kinases, the active site of CaMKIV is sterically blocked by an autoinhibitory domain that prevents substrate binding to the enzyme. Binding of Ca2+/CaM to this region relieves autoinhibition by repositioning the autoinhibitory domain and exposes a critical residue in the activation loop, T200, to CaMKK-mediated phosphorylation (19Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Google Scholar, 20Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Huang Q.H. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Google Scholar). T200 phosphorylation increases CaMKIV activity and leads to the generation of Ca2+/CaM-independent, or autonomous, activity. It has been proposed that phosphorylation of T200 is required for CaMKIV-mediated transcription (21Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Google Scholar, 22Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Google Scholar). A unique aspect of CaMKIV activation in the cellular context is its transient nature. In lymphocyte-derived cell lines, both the Ca2+-dependent and autonomous activities of CaMKIV peak by 1 min following application of stimuli that increase intracellular Ca2+ and return to baseline levels by 5 min, indicating that activation/inactivation are brief and tightly regulated events (21Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Google Scholar, 23Hanissian S.H. Frangakis M. Bland M.M. Jawahar S. Chatila T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20055-20063Google Scholar). A protein-protein interaction that may influence the kinetics of inactivation in a cellular context is the stable complex between CaMKIV and the broad substrate specificity protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (24Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the formation of multiprotein complexes is one way to regulate specificity and timing of signaling events (25Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047Google Scholar, 26Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Google Scholar). In the case of protein phosphorylation, macromolecular protein complexes may restrict access of kinases and phosphatases to specific microenvironments and position them to respond rapidly to appropriate signals. In recent years several kinases in addition to CaMKIV, including CK2, p70 S6 kinase, p21-activated kinase, Jak2, Iκβ kinase, and protein kinase C, have also been shown to interact with PP2A (27Lebrin F.

Lin T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5322-5329Google Scholar). However, in most of these cases details describing a precise functional link between the kinase and PP2A are lacking. In the present study, we have further examined the CaMKIV/PP2A interaction. We reveal that the PP2A in complex with CaMKIV dephosphorylates the kinase on T200 thereby extinguishing autonomous activity. In addition, we show that the CaMKIV/PP2A interaction is regulated by the Ca2+/CaM binding-autoregulatory domain of the kinase and that the binding of PP2A and Ca2+/CaM appears to be mutually exclusive. Together our observations suggest a molecular basis for the sequential activation and inactivation of CaMKIV involving Ca2+/CaM, CaMKK, and PP2A. Cells and Cell Culture—A human embryonic kidney cell line, QBI-293A (293A) from Quantum Biotechnologies, was used for all cell culture experiments and was cultured as recommended by the manufacturer. Constructs—FLAG-CaMKIV WT, FLAG-CaMKIV Trunc 1–317, FLAG-CaMKIV Trunc 1–340, and FLAG-CaMKIV K75M, all cloned into the mammalian expression vector, pSG5 (Stratagene), were generated as previously described (21Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Google Scholar). The other CaMKIV mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using single-stranded CaMKIV/pSG5 (without the FLAG tag) DNA as template and the protocol and reagents provided with the Muta-Gene M13 kit (Bio-Rad). The single-stranded DNA was synthesized in CJ236 Escherichia coli that had been transformed with CaMKIV/pSG5 and infected with M13KO7 helper phage (Invitrogen). The sense oligonucleotides used were as follows: CaMKIV Trunc 1–308, 5′-GCCAATTTTGTATAGAGATCTACCGCTCAAAA GAAG-3′; CaMKIV Subst 312–329, 5′-CCAATTTTGTACACATGGATTCCGTTTCAGAGCAGATCAAAAAAAACTTTGCCAAGCGTAAGCTTAAGGCAGCGG-3′; CaMKIV Subst 318–336, 5′-GGATACCGCTCAAAAGAAGCTCAAAAAAAACTTTGCCAAGAGTAAGTGGAAGCAAGCGGTGAAGGCTGTGGTGGCC-3′; CaMKIV Subst 320–321, 5′-GCTCCAAGAAGACGATGCCCGGCGTAAGC-3′. To introduce an inframe FLAG tag sequence at the 5′ end of the newly generated CaMKIV mutants, the mutated region was excised as a XmaI/NheI or PstI/NheI fragment and ligated into FLAG-CaMKIV WT/pSG5 from which the corresponding fragment had been removed. FLAG-CaMKIV Subst 318–336 T200A/pSG5 was created by ligating an EcoR1-excised fragment of FLAG-CaMKIV T200A/pSG5 that contained T200A, with FLAG-CaMKIV subst 318–336/pSG5 from which the corresponding EcoRI fragment had been removed. FLAG-CaMKI/pSG5 was created by PCR using CaMKI/pGEX (34Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Google Scholar) as template and the following primers: sense, 5′-AAGATCTCTGAGATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAACTGGGGGCAGTGGAAGGCCCCAGGTGG-3′; antisense, 5′-GAGATCTCTAGAGCTGGTGGGGCAGTGTGGGGG-3′. The PRC-amplified product was then inserted into the BglII site of pSG5. Nucleotide sequences of cloning sites and the entire cDNA of each mutant was confirmed by automated sequencing (Duke University DNA Sequencing Facility). FLAG-CaM Kinase Expression/Immunoprecipitation from 293A Cells—293A cells grown to ∼90–95% confluency in a p150 dish were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). A mixture of 10 μg of DNA, 14 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000, and 750 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was pipetted into the culture media that was covering the cells. Other details of the transfection procedure followed were those recommended by the manufacturer. The media covering the cells was removed 18–24 h post-transfection, and the cells were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution without CaCl2 (Invitrogen) and then scraped from the dish in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc, and 100 nm okadaic acid (Calbiochem 495604). The lysed cells were pipetted into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, incubated on ice for 30 min, and micro-centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated in a clean 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube 4 h at 4 °C on a rotator with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of Anti-FLAG M2-agarose (freezer safe, Sigma, A2220) that had been washed two times in lysis buffer. The resin was then pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, washed two times with lysis buffer, and one final time with TBS (25 mm Tris base, pH 7.4, 0.14 m NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl). All washes of resin were carried out by suspending the resin in 1 ml of wash buffer followed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The FLAG-CaM kinase was eluted from the resin by incubation in 40 μl of TBS containing 300 ng/μl FLAG peptide (Sigma, F3290), at 4 °C for either 1 h with occasional flicking of the tube, or for overnight. The eluted protein was recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 s. The supernatant was removed and filtered through a disk (Kontes/Kimble #420162–0000) to remove minute amounts of FLAG-resin. The eluted protein was stored at -80 °C in 30% glycerol for later use in the kinase assay or for immunoblotting. The presence of 100 nm okadaic acid during cell lysis/immunoprecipitation was found to enhance the coimmunoprecipitation of PP2A with CaMKIV and was therefore included in all experiments. Co-expression of t-Ag with CaMKIV in 293A Cells—293A cells grown to ∼90–95% confluency in a p150 dish were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen); 750 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing a mixture of 6 μg of t-Ag/pCEP (plasmid kindly provided by Shirish Shenolakar), 4 μg of FLAG-CaMKIV/pSG5, and 14 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 was pipetted into the culture media that was covering the cells. Other details of the transfection procedure followed were those recommended by the manufacturer. The next day, cell lysis and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described above. Western Blotting—To detect PP2Ac protein by immunoblotting, samples were run on a 10% acrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked for 1–2 h, incubated with PP2Ac monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) at a 1/1000 dilution, washed 3× (5 min each), incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 h, washed 4× (10 min each), and developed using the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences. All incubations and washes were at room temperature. The membrane blocking and incubations with antibodies were in TBS (25 mm Tris base, pH 7.4, and 0.14 m NaCl) containing 5% milk, and the washes were with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. To detect CaMKIV P-T200 by immunoblotting, the procedure for detecting PP2Ac was followed except that the incubation with P-T200 antibody (Exalpha Biologicals Inc., Waterson, MA), at 1/1000, was in TBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. To detect CaM by immunoblotting the following protocol was followed. Protein samples were run on a 15% acrylamide gel. After equilibrating the gel for 15 min in Buffer A (25 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0), proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane for 18 h at 4 °C and 20 V in Buffer A. The membrane was then fixed in Buffer A containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde, washed 3× (10 min each) in Buffer A, blocked for 1 h in Buffer B (TBS containing 5% milk), and then incubated 2 h with calmodulin monoclonal antibody (Upstate #05-173) diluted 1/1000 in TBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Next, the membrane was washed 3× (5 min each) in Buffer C (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), incubated for 1 h in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody diluted 1/5000 in Buffer B, washed 4× (10 min each) in Buffer C, and developed using the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences. CREB Assay—Six-well dishes were seeded with 0.2 × 106 293A cells per well. The next day, cells were transfected with 0.02 μg of β-galactosidase, 0.16 μg of Gal4 CREB, 0.4 μg of 5× Gal4 luciferase reporter, and 0.4 μg of FLAG-CaMKIV/pSG5 DNA per well, using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were stimulated with 2 μm ionomycin (calcium salt from Calbiochem, 407952) the following evening for ∼16 h and then lysed. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in cell extracts were determined within 1–2 h as previously described (35Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase activity, and the control transfection was empty pSG5 vector (Stratagene). In Vitro Kinase Assay—The kinase assay was initiated by diluting 100 ng of FLAG-CaMKIV in a final volume of 100 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 80, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 nm okadaic acid, 200 μm GS-10 peptide (proline-leucine-arginine-arginine-threonine-leucine-serine-valine-alanine-alanine) substrate, and 1 μm CaM. In addition, either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA was included in the reaction buffer, depending on whether Ca2+/CaM-dependent or Ca2+/CaM-independent kinase activity, respectively, was to be determined. The assay was run for 10 min at 30 °C at which point 20-μl aliquots of reaction mixture were spotted, in triplicate, onto phosphocellulose paper (p81 disks from Whatman) that was then rinsed in 75 mm phosphoric acid. The 32P-labeled peptide was quantitated by scintillation counting of the dried p81 papers. Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as standard. The Ca2+/CaM Binding-Autoinhibitory Domain of CaMKIV Is Required for Association of the Kinase with PP2A—PP2A has been shown to copurify with CaMKIV from brain, coimmunoprecipitate with CaMKIV from multiple cell types, and associate with GST-CaMKIV (24Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Google Scholar, 37Arnould T. Vankoningsloo S. Renard P. Houbion A. Ninane N. Demazy C. Remacle J. Raes M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 53-63Google Scholar). We find that PP2A also coimmunoprecipitates with a FLAG-tagged version of CaMKIV expressed in 293A cells (Fig. 1A). The absence of detectable PP2A coimmunoprecipitating with FLAG-CaMKI demonstrates the selectivity of the interaction (Fig. 1A). Because FLAG-CaMKIV expressed in 293A cells behaves similarly to its untagged counterpart in vitro and in cell-based transcription assays (data not shown), we have used this system throughout this study. To determine which region of CaMKIV is important for interaction of the kinase with PP2A, a series of FLAG-CaMKIV truncation mutants was tested for ability to coimmunoprecipitate PP2A from 293A cells. The most informative of these mutants are Trunc 1–308, Trunc 1–317, and Trunc 1–340, comprising the N-terminal 308, 317, and 340 residues of CaMKIV, respectively (see schematic in Fig. 1C). Trunc 1–308 fails to coimmunoprecipitate detectable PP2A, Trunc 1–317 coimmunoprecipitates a small amount, and Trunc 1–340 coimmunoprecipitates levels of PP2A similar to that coimmunoprecipitated by WT CaMKIV (Fig. 1B). All three mutants contain the entire kinase homology domain (residues 50–300) but differ from one another by including different portions of the autoregulatory domain of the kinase (residues 301–340, Fig. 1C). The dramatic difference in the amount of PP2A coimmunoprecipitated by these mutants implicates the autoregulatory domain as important for the kinase/phosphatase interaction. To test this idea further, mutants were generated in the context of full-length CaMKIV, by swapping 12 amino acid regions from the autoregulatory domain for corresponding residues from CaMKI. CaMKI was chosen, because it is the kinase that shares greatest homology with CaMKIV but does not associate with PP2A. CaMKIV Subst 312–323 and Subst 318–329, in which residues 312–323 and 318–329 have been replaced, respectively, were found to coimmunoprecipitate PP2A poorly (Fig. 1B). A third full-length CaMKIV autoregulatory domain mutant, Subst 320–321, was generated by replacing residues 320fn321 with DD, a change previously shown to disrupt autoinhibition of the enzyme (38Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Glod J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Google Scholar). CaMKIV Subst 320–321 also failed to associate with PP2A (Fig. 1B). The behavior of the substitution mutants thus complements that of the truncation mutants. As previously reported (24Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Google Scholar), the catalytically inactive CaMKIV mutant, CaMKIV K75M, and the activation loop mutant, CaMKIV T200A, interact with PP2A similarly to CaMKIV WT (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these data indicate a requirement for the autoregulatory domain of CaMKIV for association of the kinase with PP2A. Binding of Ca2+/CaM and PP2A to CaMKIV Is Mutually Exclusive—Whether by directly binding PP2A or through some other mechanism, our results indicate a newly identified role for the autoregulatory domain of CaMKIV. This small region of the kinase already has well defined functions. It is comprised of overlapping autoinhibitory and CaM binding regions that in the absence of Ca2+/CaM sterically inhibit enzymatic activity. Because Ca2+/CaM binding relieves inhibition by repositioning the autoinhibitory domain, we questioned whether Ca2+/CaM might affect association of CaMKIV with PP2A. The standard cell lysis/immunoprecipitation buffer used in our experiments contains the Ca2+ chelator, EGTA, for the purpose of inhibiting Ca2+-dependent proteases. As a first step toward testing the effect of Ca2+/CaM on the CaMKIV/PP2A interaction, EGTA was omitted from the standard protocol. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the amount of PP2A coimmunoprecipitated by CaMKIV (Fig. 2A), and CaM was present only in the “without EGTA” samples (Fig. 2A). Next, the effect of Ca2+/CaM on isolated CaMKIV/PP2A complex was examined. FLAG-CaMKIV was immunoprecipitated in buffer containing EGTA, which favors association between CaMKIV and PP2A. While still attached to FLAG resin, the CaMKIV/PP2A complex was further incubated in EGTA, Ca2+, CaM, Ca2+/CaM, or in Ca2+/CaM that had been preincubated with the CaM antagonist W13. Immunoblot analysis of the washed resin demonstrated that Ca2+/CaM considerably decreased the amount of PP2A present, whereas the other conditions had no effect (Fig. 2B). We conclude that Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKIV inhibits its interaction with PP2A. PP2A Negatively Regulates the Ability of CaMKIV to Regulate CREB-mediated Transcription in 293A Cells—We next examined the physiological role of the CaMKIV/PP2A interaction by comparing the cellular function of CaMKIV WT with that of the mutants that are unable to interact with PP2A. The position of the CaMKIV truncation and amino acid substitutions that render the kinase unable to interact with PP2A suggested that, in addition to compromised PP2A binding, autoinhibition and regulation of kinase activity by Ca2+/CaM might also have been compromised. This prediction was tested before proceeding with the cell-based functional assays by characterizing the CaMKIV PP2A-binding mutant enzyme activities in vitro (Fig. 3A). Indeed, each mutant exhibited Ca2+/CaM-independent activity, indicating that autoinhibition had been disrupted. The variation in levels of total and Ca2+/CaM-independent kinase activity displayed by the different mutants probably reflects the different degrees to which autoinhibition has been disrupted. Least affected was CaMKIV Subst 318–329, because it exhibited a specific activity similar to WT CaMKIV and retained significant Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity. Therefore, we chose the CaMKIV Subst 318–329 mutant to test the role of the CaMKIV/PP2A interaction by comparing it with WT kinase in a cell-based assay. The cell based assay used was the CREB transcription assay in which cells are cotransfected with GAL4-CREB, a GAL4-luciferase reporter, and CaMKIV (35Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Google Scholar). After stimulation of the cells with ionomycin to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, cell extracts were made, from which luciferase activity was measured. Compared with CaMKIV WT, the binding mutant CaMKIV Subst 318–329 was found to stimulate CREB-mediated transcription with dramatically enhanced activity and to do so in a Ca2+/CaM-independent manner (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C illustrates that CaMKIV WT and mutant protein levels in cell extracts were similar. Thus, PP2A appears to negatively regulate CaMKIV in this cell-based system. CaMKIV Becomes Transiently Phosphorylated on T200 in Response to Cell Stimuli That Increase Intracellular Ca2+; T200 Phosphorylation Correlates with Kinase Activation—Because CaMKIV is believed to require phosphorylation of T200 by CaMKK to stimulate CREB-mediated transcription (21Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Google Scholar), we examined whether PP2A might negatively regulate CaMKIV by dephosphorylating T200. The kinetics of T-200 phosphorylation was first investigated using a CaMKIV phospho-T200 (P-T200)-specific antibody. Use of this antibody for Western blotting immunoprecipitates is shown in Fig. 4A (left panels). The immunoprecipitates are of CaMKIV WT or T200A mutant from 293A cells that had been either untreated or stimulated with ionomycin for 5, 15, or 30 min. CaMKIV WT was transiently phosphorylated on T200, with a peak at 5 min following the addition of ionomycin and a return to near baseline level by 15 min. No signal was observed for CaMKIV T200A, which served as a negative control and to illustrate the specificity of the antibody. It was also possible to track the transient phosphorylation of overexpressed CaMKIV WT in cell extracts (Fig. 4A, right panels). The time course was similar to that seen in immunoprecipitates, and again, there was no signal in the samples containing T200A. To determine how phosphorylation of CaMKIV on T200 correlated with enzyme activation, aliquots of the immunoprecipitates shown in Fig. 4A were assayed in vitro for both Ca2+/CaM-dependent and autonomous activity, using GS-10 peptide as substrate. CaMKIV WT developed autonomous activity that peaked at 5 min and had returned to baseline level by 15 min, similar to the time course of P-T200 (Fig. 4B). CaMKIV T200A, which cannot be phosphorylated on residue T200, did not develop autonomous activity. We conclude from these data that autonomous activity correlates well with P-T200. In contrast, Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity does not (Fig. 4C). In fact, Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaMKIV WT and CaMKIV T200A activities were similar to each other and the same before and after stimulation. We have data suggesting that only a small fraction of the overexpressed CaMKIV becomes phosphorylated and activated in 293A cells in response to ionomycin (data not show"

These receptors activate rho via G12/13 family heterotrimeric G proteins, which are known to directly activate three distinct rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (rhoGEFs) that contain a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain (RGS-rhoGEFs). However, it is not known which, if any, of these RGS-rhoGEFs (LARG (leukemia-associated rhoGEF), p115rhoGEF, or PDZrhoGEF) plays a role in G protein-coupled receptor-stimulated rho signaling. Using oligonucleotide small interfering RNAs that suppress specific RGS-rhoGEF expression, we show that thrombin receptor stimulation of rho is primarily mediated by LARG in HEK293T and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. In contrast, the LPA-stimulated rho response in PC-3 cells is dependent on PDZrhoGEF expression. Suppression of p115rhoGEF had no effect. Thus different rhoGEFs (LARG and PDZrhoGEF) mediate downstream rho signaling by the thrombin and LPA receptors.

The rho family of small GTP-binding proteins plays important roles in many normal biological processes and in cancer (1Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). This family includes three main groups (rho, rac, and cdc42). rho itself is activated by numerous external stimuli including growth factor receptors, immune receptors, cell adhesion, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; LARG, leukemia-associated rhoGEF; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, short interfering RNA; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; LARG, leukemia-associated rhoGEF; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, short interfering RNA; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP.

The mechanism of signaling by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors that activate rho has been obscure until recently (3Sah V.P. Seasholtz T.M. Sagi S.A. Brown J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The discovery of a family of unique rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (rhoGEFs), p115rhoGEF (4Hart M.J.

Nakamura S. Mano H. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and Gα13 (8Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) causing rhoGEF activation. Thus, the RGS-rhoGEFs are throught to serve as effectors of activated Gα12/13 and as molecular bridges between the heterotrimeric G protein α subunits and rho. A role for these proteins in cellular rho signaling by GPCRs, such as those for thrombin and LPA, has been suggested by studies with dominant negative constructs (9Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 10Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Buckmaster C. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). There has not, however, been direct proof that these proteins mediate GPCR signals and no information is available about which rhoGEF(s) are downstream of which receptors. rho activation leads to actin rearrangements and stress fiber formation, gene transcriptional activation, neural process retraction, cell rounding, and smooth muscle contraction (reviewed in Ref. 1Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Experimentally, rho activation can be detected directly by measurements of GTP-bound active rho precipitated from cell lysates with effector fusion proteins such as GST-rhotekin (12Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) or indirectly by any of those functional readouts. The 1321N1 astrocytoma cells is a well studied model of thrombin-induced rho activation (13Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Goldstein D. de Lanerolle P. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10099-10106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thrombin induces both cell rounding and enhanced cell proliferation in these astrocytoma cells by mechanisms that are independent of known second messengers but are blocked by rho inhibitors. In this study, we use HEK293T cells and a human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, to test the role of the three RGS-rhoGEFs, LARG, p115rhoGEF, and PDZrhoGEF, in receptor signaling. HEK293 and PC-3 cells express all three of these proteins with RNA for PDZrhoGEF and LARG being more abundant than that for p115. PC-3 cells overexpress the thrombin receptor (PAR1) and have an increased propensity to metastasize to bone compared with lines that have lower PAR1 expression (14Cooper C.R. Chay C.H. Gendernalik J.D. Lee H.L. Bhatia J. Taichman R.S. McCauley L.K. Keller E.T. Pienta K.J. Cancer. 2003; 97: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To demonstrate a role for rhoGEFs in GPCR signaling and to define the specificity of their actions, we prepared 21-nucleotide short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting each of these RGS-rhoGEFs. We show that LARG mediates thrombin responses, while the LPA response is mediated by PDZrhoGEF. Materials—The three myc-tagged human RGS-rhoGEF plasmids in pcDNAmyc and the SRE.L Luciferase rho reporter construct were described previously (7Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Mano H. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The control Renilla luciferase construct, pRL-TK, was purchased from Promega. The C3 exotoxin expression construct in pcDNA3.1 was kindly provided by Dr. John Williams (University of Michigan). siRNA design and synthesis has been described in detail (15Wang Q. Liu M. Kozasa T. Rothstein J.D. Sternweis P.C. Neubig R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389 (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, 21-nucleotide synthetic RNA with the following sequences and their complements (plus 3′ TT overhangs on each) were synthesized by the Qiagen siRNA synthesis service (Xenogene Inc.) and high performance liquid chromatography-purified. The sequence targeted was in the RGS domain for all three RGS-rhoGEFs: p115rhoGEF (CATACCATCTCTACCGACG), PDZrhoGEF (ACTGAAGTCTCGGCCAGCT), and LARG (GAAACTCGTCGCATCTTCC). Duplexes (with 3′ TT overhangs) were prepared by annealing sense and antisense strands to form double-stranded RNA. The oligonucleotide pairs were resuspended at 0.3 mg/ml (total) in buffer containing 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, 2 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.4, and heated to 90 °C for 1 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Aliquots were then placed in small vials to make siRNA stock solutions at 300 ng/μl or about 20 μm and frozen at –20 °C. LARG, p115-rhoGEF, and Gβ antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (N-14, catalog number sc-15439; C-19, catalog number sc-8492, T-20, catalog number sc-378). Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-PDZ-rhoGEF was generated with a synthetic peptide from rat PDZ-rhoGEF (GTRAP48, KTPERTSPSHHRQPSD) as described previously (16Jackson M. Song W. Liu M.Y. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lin C.I. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Sternweis P.C. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were bovine anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (catalog number sc-2352) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (catalog number sc-2054). The PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLRN was from Bachem (catalog number H-8365, King of Prussia, PA). HEK293T and PC-3 cell lines were gifts of Drs. J. Menon and K. Pienta of the University of Michigan. Transfection of siRNAs into Cells—For Westen blot analysis, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected in a 6-well plate with 2 μg/well of either active rhoGEF siRNAs (LARG, PDZ, p115) or mutant inverted siRNAs and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000. After 72 h, protein lysates were prepared as described (17Wang Q. Liu M. Mullah B. Siderovski D.P. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24949-24958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For luciferase assays in 96-well plates, one rhoGEF plasmid DNA (p115 (2 ng), PDZ (5 ng), or LARG (5 ng)) was introduced into HEK293 cells with 30 ng of rhoGEF siRNAs or inverted mutant siRNAs with 0.2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 together with the dual luciferase reporters (SRE.L and pRL-TK at 3 ng and 30 ng/well, respectively). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis is done with RGS-rhoGEF-specific antibodies and ECL detection as described previously (17Wang Q. Liu M. Mullah B. Siderovski D.P. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24949-24958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The same polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was stripped and re-blotted with anti-G protein β subunit antibody as loading control. Blots were quantitated as described previously (17Wang Q. Liu M. Mullah B. Siderovski D.P. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24949-24958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—Twenty-four hours post-transfection with firefly and Renilla vectors, HEK293 cells were serum-starved (0.5% serum), and then at 48 h, luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase counts was calculated. Data are expressed as the percent of the control value (samples without siRNA). GST-rhotekin Pull-down Assay—siRNA (si) or mutant controls (inv) were introduced (10 μg/10-mm dish) into HEK293 cells with 30 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 in duplicate 100-mm dishes. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were switched to medium with 0.5% serum, then 18 h later stimulated with 300 nm thrombin for 5 min. Cells from each dish were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, 2% IGEPAL, and 5% sucrose. The active rho was precipitated with GST-rhotekin beads (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO). Western blots with anti-rhoA antibody were done to assess the amount of active rhoA. Aliquots of total lysate were also analyzed for the amount of rho present. Cell Rounding Assay—The day before transfection, PC-3 cells were grown on laminin-coated coverslips in 12-well plates until ∼80% confluent. Cells were then transfected with 0.2 μg of EGFP cDNA. To disrupt rho signaling GFP was co-transfected with either a C3 exotoxin expression vector (0.5 μg) or with 2.0 μg of the indicated siRNA or inverted control along with 8 μl/well of LipofectAMINE 2000. At 45 h post-transfection, cultures were changed to serum-free medium and 6 h later treated with either buffer, thrombin (100 nm), or LPA (50 μm) for 30 min. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and GFP images obtained using an Olympus fluorescence microscope with a 20× objective. Fluorescent cells were counted (100–300 per coverslip) and the percentage of rounded cells determined. Cell rounding at 30 min was dose-dependent (EC50 80 nm for thrombin and 50 μm for LPA) and reversible upon removal of thrombin for 45 min (data not shown). Data Analysis and Statsistics—Quantitative data are means ± S.E. of three or more independent experiments and each luciferase experiment was conducted in triplicate. Two-way analysis of variance with post-tests (Graph Pad Prism 4.0, San Diego, CA) was used to evaluate statistical significance. All three RGS-rhoGEFs are expressed in HEK293 cells as detected by both Western blot (Fig. 1A) and reverse transcritase-PCR analysis (15Wang Q. Liu M. Kozasa T. Rothstein J.D. Sternweis P.C. Neubig R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389 (in press)Google Scholar). HEK293 cells also exhibit a substantial thrombin-stimulated rho activation ((18Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14626-14632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and Fig. 2). To assess the role of RGS-rhoGEFs in receptor signaling, we designed a series of synthetic oligo-siRNAs targeted against the RGS domain of the three human rhoGEFs. Two oligonucleotides each against LARG and PDZrhoGEF and 5 against p115rhoGEF were analyzed (15Wang Q. Liu M. Kozasa T. Rothstein J.D. Sternweis P.C. Neubig R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389 (in press)Google Scholar), and the most active and specific three siRNAs were used in this study. They suppress the expression of their cognate rhoGEF but do not affect either Gβ used as a loading control (Fig. 1A) or the other rhoGEFs (15Wang Q. Liu M. Kozasa T. Rothstein J.D. Sternweis P.C. Neubig R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389 (in press)Google Scholar). Their specificity is also demonstrated in a functional effect on rho-mediated gene expression. We used a modified SRE.L luciferase reporter construct (7Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Mano H. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which responds to serum response factor-megakaryocytic acute leukemia transcription complexes but not serum response factor-ternary complex factor complexes (19Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) and provides a rho-dependent transcription response. Luciferase expression is strongly enhanced by transfected wild-type Gα13 and the constitutively active Gα13QL mutant (19- and 54-fold over reporter alone, respectively; data not shown), and by transfection of all three of the RGS-rhoGEFs (Fig. 1B). In each case, firefly luciferase expression is reduced to base line by co-transfecting C3 exotoxin (data not shown) consistent with the literature showing that G13- and rhoGEF-stimulated gene expression is rho-dependent (9Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14626-14632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The rhoGEF-stimulated luciferase signal is also completely eliminated by 0.5 μm latrunculin B (not shown). Co-transfection of the siRNAs targeting LARG, p115rhoGEF, or PDZrhoGEF strongly and specifically reduced the luciferase response to the targeted RGS-rhoGEF but had minimal effects on luciferase expression stimulated by the other two RGS-rhoGEFs (Fig. 1B). As an additional control for specificity, an inverted control siRNA (–) for each of the active siRNAs (+) was included and had minimal effects. The incomplete inhibition of the luciferase response by the siRNAs may be due to: 1) a strongly amplified signaling cascade which is integrated over 48 h, 2) some maintained expression of RGS-rhoGEF in the presence of siRNA, or 3) incomplete overlap of transfection of the siRNA and the RGS-rhoGEF plasmid. The latter mechanisms seems unlikely given the nearly 90% transfection efficiency of these cells with a GFP reporter plasmid plus the virtually complete suppression of endogenous protein for LARG and p115rhoGEF. The data, however, indicate a substantial and specific suppression of RGS-rhoGEFs by these transfected siRNAs.Fig. 2LARG siRNA effect on thrombin receptor-stimulated rhoA activation. LARG siRNA or its mutant siRNA (LARGinv) were introduced (10 μg/dish) into HEK293T cells and thrombin-stimulated rho activation measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were treated with (+) or without (–) thrombin (300 nm for 5 min). The active rho was precipitated with GST-rhotekin beads, and Western blots with anti-rhoA antibody were done to assess the amount of active rhoA. The top panel is a representative Western blot showing stimulation of active rhoA by thrombin in the control lanes (LARGinv), which was suppressed by LARG siRNA. The bottom panel shows quantitation of three independent rho pull-down experiments showing mean ± S.E. of scanned band densities. A statistical comparison of results with LARG, PDZ, and p115 RNAi is shown in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess the role of the RGS-rhoGEFs in receptor-mediated signaling, we used the thrombin-stimulated activation of rho as detected by precipitation of GTP-bound active rhoA with the effector domain fusion, GST-rhotekin. 2Attempts to measure a thrombin-stimulated luciferase response in the HEK293 cells were unsuccessful. The prolonged activation needed to initiate a transcription response may not be possible given rapid desensitization of thrombin receptors. Thrombin stimulates rho activation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2) probably via an endogenous PAR1 receptor (20Hollenberg M.D. Saifeddine M. al-Ani B. Kawabata A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Transfection of HEK293 cells with the active LARG siRNA (si) shows an essentially complete block of thrombin-stimulated rho activation (Fig. 2). Table I quantitates the effects of the three rhoGEF siRNAs and their inverted controls. While this assay exhibits significant variability, only the LARG siRNA reduced the thrombin-stimulated rho activation significantly. To assess signaling by other receptors, we attempted similar measurements with LPA. While there was some stimulation of rhoA activation by LPA in HEK293 cells, it was substantially smaller than that induced by thrombin and not sufficient to permit analysis with the siRNAs. Thus we turned to a different cell line and a different rho response.Table ISpecificity of RNAi effects on thrombin-stimulated rho activationControl (inv)Active (si)RNAMeanS.E.nMeanS.E.nLARG3.201.0830.97aSignificantly different from control by two-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05).0.203PDZ1.750.0941.630.195p1151.460.2542.80.606a Significantly different from control by two-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab rho stimulates several types of cytoskeletal rearrangements. Stress fiber formation in NIH or Swiss 3T3 cells is a classic rho response (21Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar). In other cell types such as the 1321N1 astrocytoma line, cell rounding is observed as a thrombin-stimulated G12/13-mediated rho response (10Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Buckmaster C. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26815-26821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We found that a similar cell rounding response occurs in the human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3. After thrombin stimulation, there was some appearance of stress fibers following phalloidin staining (data not shown), but the more prominent effect was cell rounding (Fig. 3A). Since the transfection efficiency of the PC-3 cells (30–50%) was lower than that in HEK293, we used a co-transfected GFP reporter plasmid to permit us to selectively assess the transfected cell population. The cell rounding response to thrombin was reduced by 80–90% by co-transfecting a C3 exotoxin expression plasmid with the GFP reporter (Fig. 3A). The basal cell shape, however, was not affected by C3 toxin. In addition to thrombin responses, LPA also stimulated PC-3 cell rounding in a rho-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The thrombin and LPA responses in PC-3 cells were then tested with the RGS-rhoGEF siRNAs which on Western blots show suppression of the appropriate rhoGEF (data not shown). As expected from the HEK293 data, the LARG siRNA nearly completely abolished the thrombin-stimulated PC-3 cell rounding response (Fig. 3B). This is mediated by the PAR1 type of thrombin receptor, since cell rounding stimulated by the PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLRN was also inhibited by LARG siRNA (Fig. 3C). The negative control inverted LARG siRNA (–) did not affect thrombin-stimulated cell rounding. Also, the p115rhoGEF and PDZrhoGEF siRNAs did not inhibit the thrombin response indicating that LARG represents the primary downstream pathway from PAR1 to rho activation in PC-3 cells. Surprisingly, the LARG siRNA did not inhibit cell rounding induced by LPA but the PDZrhoGEF siRNA did (Fig. 3B). This shows that the LPA receptor uses a different RGS-rhoGEF to induce rho responses. It is known that PC-3 cells express LPA1 and LPA2 but not LPA3 receptors (22Xie Y. Gibbs T.C. Mukhin Y.V. Meier K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32516-32526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but we cannot presently say which LPA receptor is mediating this effect. The LPA data also provide additional controls; the LARG siRNA effect on thrombin responses is specific for thrombin and not other rho-activating stimuli, and the lack of effect of PDZrhoGEF siRNA on thrombin responses is not due to incomplete knockdown of the PDZrhoGEF protein as the siRNA was able to disrupt the LPA response. The mechanism of specificity of PAR1 for LARG and LPA receptor for PDZrhoGEF is unclear. Recently, it has been suggested that thrombin and LPA receptors activate different members of the G12 family, Gα12 and Gα13, respectively (23Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14936-14939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and Gα12 is known to activate LARG (7Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Mano H. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to G protein selectivity, it is possible that there could be direct interactions between the RGS-rhoGEFs and the receptors. Both LARG and PDZrhoGEF have PDZ domains, which bind to plexin B1 and mediate semaphorin signaling (24Aurandt J. Vikis H.G. Gutkind J.S. Ahn N. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The carboxyl termini of LPA1 and LPA2 receptors (EDG2 and EDG4) have classical PDZ interaction motifs (S/T-X-L/V), so direct rhoGEF-receptor interactions may contribute to the specificity. In summary, we provide the first direct demonstration that RGS-rhoGEFs mediate GPCR signaling to rho as well as showing receptor specificity in the use of RGS-rhoGEFs with PAR1 using LARG in both HEK293 and PC-3 cells and the LPA receptor using PDZrhoGEF in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2073875893,"In the ternary substrate complex of DNA polymerase (pol) β, the nascent base pair (templating and incoming nucleotides) is sandwiched between the duplex DNA terminus and polymerase. To probe molecular interactions in the dNTP-binding pocket, we analyzed the kinetic behavior of wild-type pol β on modified DNA substrates that alter the structure of the DNA terminus and represent mutagenic intermediates. The DNA substrates were modified to 1) alter the sequence of the duplex terminus (matched and mismatched), 2) introduce abasic sites near the nascent base pair, and 3) insert extra bases in the primer or template strands to mimic frameshift intermediates. The results indicate that the nucleotide insertion efficiency (kcat/Km, dGTP-dC) is highly dependent on the sequence identity of the matched (i.e. Watson-Crick base pair) DNA terminus (template/primer, G/C ∼ A/T > T/A ∼ C/G). Mismatches at the primer terminus strongly diminish correct nucleotide insertion efficiency but do not affect DNA binding affinity. Transition intermediates are generally extended more easily than transversions. Most mismatched primer termini decrease the rate of insertion and binding affinity of the incoming nucleotide. In contrast, the loss of catalytic efficiency with homopurine mismatches at the duplex DNA terminus is entirely due to the inability to insert the incoming nucleotide, since Kd(dGTP) is not affected. Abasic sites and extra nucleotides in and around the duplex terminus decrease catalytic efficiency and are more detrimental to the nascent base pair binding pocket when situated in the primer strand than the equivalent position in the template strand.

DNA polymerases select (bind and incorporate) a nucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) from a pool of structurally similar molecules to preserve Watson-Crick base pairing rules. DNA polymerase (pol) 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; THF, tetrahydrofuran. 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; THF, tetrahydrofuran. β is a model polymerase to study mechanisms utilized to assure efficient and faithful DNA synthesis. Its small size, lack of essential accessory proteins, and absence of a proofreading exonuclease have facilitated its biochemical, kinetic, and structural characterization. More importantly, it shares many general structural and mechanistic features exhibited by other DNA polymerases (1Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 231-244Google Scholar). DNA polymerase β contributes two important enzymatic activities during single-nucleotide base excision DNA repair. A deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity is associated with the amino-terminal 8-kDa lyase domain. This activity excises a deoxyribose phosphate intermediate during repair of abasic sites and generates a 5′-phosphate in a single-nucleotide gap. The nucleotidyl transferase activity of pol β is associated with the 31-kDa polymerase domain that fills the single-nucleotide gap. In addition, the polymerase activity of pol β is necessary for several alternate repair pathways that require longer gap-filling DNA synthesis (e.g. long patch base excision repair) (2Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Google Scholar, 3Horton J.K. Prasad R. Hou E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2211-2218Google Scholar). A general feature observed in the structures of all DNA polymerases that include a template overhang (i.e. single-stranded DNA) is that the trajectory of the template strand bends dramatically as it enters the polymerase active site (1Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 231-244Google Scholar). This serves at least two functions. First, it provides the polymerase the ability to assess whether geometrical constraints imposed by correct Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding occur, and second, it discourages the next templating base from prematurely entering the polymerase active site, which could result in the downstream template base coding for nucleotide insertion (deletion mutagenesis) (4Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Yin S. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28033-28038Google Scholar). To accurately replicate DNA, polymerases need to stabilize the coding templating base as well as the correct, but not incorrect, incoming nucleotide (5Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R7-R13Google Scholar). This is achieved through a series of protein- and substrate-induced conformational changes that result in a dNTP-binding pocket formed by the templating base, DNA duplex terminus, and enzyme. In the absence of an incoming nucleotide, the carboxyl-terminal N-subdomain 2A functionally based nomenclature is employed for pol β to avoid confusion generated by the architectural nomenclature that compares the polymerase domain to a handlike structure (13Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar). The N-subdomain contributes important interactions with the Nascent base pair and is equivalent to the fingers subdomain of right-handed DNA polymerases. 2A functionally based nomenclature is employed for pol β to avoid confusion generated by the architectural nomenclature that compares the polymerase domain to a handlike structure (13Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar). The N-subdomain contributes important interactions with the Nascent base pair and is equivalent to the fingers subdomain of right-handed DNA polymerases. (residues 262–335) of pol β is in an open conformation so that key polymerase side chains do not interact with the templating nucleotide. Upon binding the correct nucleotide, the N-subdomain closes on the nascent base pair (templating and incoming nucleotides), creating several key interactions with the enzyme (6Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Structure. 2003; 11: 489-496Google Scholar). Accordingly, the constraints imposed by the dNTP-binding pocket are determined by DNA sequence (i.e. structure) as well as the conformational fluctuations that occur in response to enzyme and substrate binding. In the pol β closed ternary substrate complex, the nascent base pair is sandwiched between the duplex DNA terminus and α-helix N (Fig. 1). Lys280 and Asp276 of α-helix N contribute van der Waals interactions with the templating and incoming nucleotide bases, respectively, whereas Asn279 and Arg283 contribute DNA minor groove interactions. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis of these residues has identified interactions that contribute to efficient DNA synthesis (7Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G.

The specific contribution provided by these interactions appears to be dependent on the identity of the base pair that is formed. For example, decreasing the stacking interactions of residue 280 with the templating base by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a more dramatic loss in binding affinity for incoming complementary pyrimidines than purines, indicating that the energetic contributions of specific side chain interactions are strongly dependent on the specific insertion (13Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar). Since the terminal base pair of the growing DNA duplex forms part of the binding pocket of the incoming nucleotide, we now examine the kinetic consequences of modifying the DNA structure at or near the polymerase active site. The structure of the dNTP-binding pocket was altered by varying the DNA sequence or introducing DNA mismatches (i.e. base substitution intermediates), “extra” nucleotides (i.e. frameshift intermediates), or abasic sites in the DNA duplex upstream of the polymerase active site. Materials—Poly(dA), p(dT)20, ultrapure deoxynucleoside triphosphates, [γ-32P]ATP, and MicroSpin G-25 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. [α-32P]TTP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and DE81 filters were from Whatman. Protein Purification—Human DNA polymerase β was purified as described previously (14Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Google Scholar). Enzyme concentration was determined by Coomassie dye binding using purified pol β as a standard (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The concentration of purified pol β was determined by total amino acid analysis. DNA Preparation—The sequence, structure, and nomenclature of the DNA substrates used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 2. An oligonucleotide DNA substrate containing a single-nucleotide gap at position 16 was prepared by annealing three gel-purified oligonucleotides (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR, or Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Each oligonucleotide was suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA, and the concentration was determined from their UV absorbance at 260 nm. The annealing reactions were carried out by incubating a solution of 10 μm primer with 12 μm of downstream and template oligonucleotides at 90–100 °C for 3 min followed by 30 min at 65 °C and then slow cooling to room temperature. Kinetic Assays—Steady-state kinetic parameters for single-nucleotide gap-filling reactions were determined by initial velocity measurements as described previously (13Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, enzyme activities were determined using a standard reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 200 nm single-nucleotide gapped DNA. In some instances requiring high dNTP concentrations (e.g. misinsertion reactions), the MgCl2 concentration was increased to assure that there was at least 5 mm free Mg2+ in the reaction mixture. Enzyme concentrations and reaction time intervals were chosen so that substrate depletion or product inhibition did not influence initial velocity measurements. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and mixed with an equal volume of formamide dye, and the products were separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) to quantify product formation. Equilibrium Binding Constants for Gapped Heteropolymeric DNA Substrates—The equilibrium dissociation constants (i.e. Kd) for the binding of heteropolymeric DNA gapped substrates were determined by inhibition of pol β activity on a homopolymeric DNA as described previously (16Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were typically determined using a standard reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 30 μm [α-32P]dTTP, 30 or 300 nm poly(dA)-poly(dT)20 (Km; expressed as 3′-OH primer termini), and varying concentrations of competitor heteropolymeric DNA. Radioactive dTTP incorporation was not typically observed on the competitor DNA substrate because the templating base is not adenine. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 15 nm pol β, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Quenched reaction mixtures were spotted on Whatman DE-81 filter disks and dried. Unincorporated [α-32P]dTTP was removed, and filters were counted as before (17Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Google Scholar). Data were fitted to Equation 1 for competitive inhibition by nonlinear regression methods. kobs=(kcat×S)(S+Km(1+CKd)) Eq.1 The Michaelis constant, Km, and kcat for the homopolymeric DNA substrate (S) were determined in the absence of heteropolymeric competitor DNA (C). When competitor DNA binds tightly (Kd < polymerase concentration, E), an alternate form of Equation 1 (Equation 2) is necessary to account for the depletion of free inhibitor and enzyme as the EC complex is formed (18Kuzmic P. Hill C. Kirtley M.P. Janc J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 272-279Google Scholar). νobs=ν0[E−C−Ki, app+(E−C−Ki,app)2+4EKi, app2E] Eq.2 For a competitor inhibitor, the apparent inhibitor constant is given by Equation 3. Ki, app=Kd(1+SKm) Eq.3 Influence of the Identity of the DNA Duplex Terminus on Catalytic Efficiency—Steady-state kinetic analysis previously revealed a strong dependence of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km)on the identity of the primer terminus for single-nucleotide gap filling by pol β (19Vaisman A. Warren M.W. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18999-19005Google Scholar). That study examined the efficiency of dCTP insertion into a single-nucleotide gapped substrate with a templating guanine and systematically altered the primer terminus or downstream sequence to characterize the influence of DNA sequence on insertion efficiency. The downstream DNA sequence did not significantly alter the catalytic efficiency of nucleotide insertion. We have reexamined the influence of the identity of the primer terminus on insertion efficiency in a different DNA sequence context and with a different incoming nucleotide (i.e. dGTP rather than dCTP). The results are tabulated in Table I and indicate that the efficiency of dGTP insertion is strongly dependent on the identity of the matched (i.e. Watson-Crick base pair) primer terminus. As observed previously (19Vaisman A. Warren M.W. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18999-19005Google Scholar), primer termini with a pyrimidine are extended more efficiently than those with a purine situated at the 3′ terminus (DNA terminus: template/primer, G/C ∼ A/T > T/A ∼ C/G).Table IKinetics of mispair extension by human DNA polymerase β Values represent the mean (S.E.) of at least two independent determinations. Assays were performed as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence of the single-nucleotide DNA substrate is illustrated in Figure 2A. Except for the G/G terminus, dGTP insertion opposite a templating cytosine was followed. For G/G, the kinetics of dATP insertion was determined (i.e. templating T). The data are tabulated in order of decreasing catalytic efficiencies relative to a matched terminus.

For a base substitution error to become a mutation, the mispair must be extended. This is a kinetically challenging event for all DNA polymerases, most likely due to the aberrant nucleotide-binding pocket generated by the mispair. The kinetic analysis of mispair extension is more complex than that to determine the fidelity of DNA synthesis (20Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Google Scholar, 21Creighton S. Huang M.M. Cai H. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2633-2639Google Scholar, 22Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar). The expression to determine relative mismatch extension efficiency is given by Equation 4 (20Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Google Scholar). fext=kcat,wkcat,r×Kd,rKd,w×(Km,r+Pr[dNTP])(Km,w+Pw[dNTP]) Eq.4 This expression is the relative rate of adding a correct nucleotide (dNTP) onto a wrong (w, mismatched) and right (r, matched) primer termini at equal concentrations under steady-state conditions. The parameters Kd, Km, and P refer to the equilibrium DNA binding affinity, dNTP Michaelis constant, and processivity for correct insertion on a matched or mismatched primer terminus. Processivity is defined as the ratio of rate constants describing nucleotide insertion and DNA dissociation (i.e. kpol/koff). Thus, the relative efficiency for extending a mismatch is dependent on the correct nucleotide concentration with maximum discrimination occurring at infinitely low dNTP concentrations. This intrinsic mismatch extension efficiency is referred to as (fmin0)(Equation 5). fmin0=[(kcat/Km)w(kcat/Km)r]×Kd,rKd,w Eq.5 If the polymerase binds DNA with matched and mismatched primer termini with equal affinities, then (fmin0)is simply the ratio of catalytic efficiencies for insertion on a mismatched relative to that on a matched terminus.Table IIKinetics of misinsertion by human DNA polymerase β Values represent the mean (S.E.) of at least two independent determinations.

Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Google Scholar). The assay follows DNA synthesis on a homopolymeric template/primer system and determines the competitive inhibition constant, Ki, for a heteropolymeric DNA substrate that does not support DNA synthesis (i.e. the templating bases on the two competing DNA substrates are different). Fig. 3 illustrates the results from an assay to determine the binding affinity of single-nucleotide gapped DNA that has a G/C or C/C (template/primer) terminus with a templating G or C, respectively. These DNA substrates have similar binding affinities (Table III). The binding affinity of the matched terminus with a templating G is the same as that determined by following the DNA concentration dependence of the pre-steady-state burst amplitude (Kd ∼20 nm) (11Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Google Scholar). The binding affinities for a series of single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrates with matched or mismatched primer termini were determined and are tabulated in Table III. Although the binding affinities for the one-nucleotide gapped DNA substrates are modestly sensitive to DNA sequence, the mean binding affinities for matched and mismatched primer termini are very similar. Likewise, introduction of an abasic site opposite the primer terminus (i.e. T-1) or an extra base directly behind the primer terminus (+1 frameshift intermediate, P-2) does not significantly affect DNA binding affinity.Table IIIDNA polymerase β equilibrium DNA binding affinity Assays were performed as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The gapped DNA substrates are illustrated in Fig. 2.Primer terminus(X/Y)n- 1:ZnaIdentity of the template (X)/primer (Y) terminus adjacent to the templating base (Z) at position nKd–dNTP+dNTPnmMatched(G/C):G28 ± 5bMean and S.E. of five independent determinations(G/C):C5(G/C):T8(G/C):GcNucleotide insertion was prevented by using a 3′-deoxycytosine at the primer terminus260.14Mismatched(G/A):C19(G/G):G43(G/G):C50(T/G):C41(T/C):C5(A/A):C140.34(C/C):C163.2Abasic site (T-1)dThe nomenclature for the position of the abasic site adduct is outlined in the legend to Fig. 2C(–/A):C25Frameshift intermediate (P-2)eThis substrate is illustrated in Fig. 2B and does not support DNA synthesis activity (Fig. 5)(G/C):C7a Identity of the template (X)/primer (Y) terminus adjacent to the templating base (Z) at position nb Mean and S.E. of five independent determinationsc Nucleotide insertion was prevented by using a 3′-deoxycytosine at the primer terminusd The nomenclature for the position of the abasic site adduct is outlined in the legend to Fig. 2Ce This substrate is illustrated in Fig. 2B and does not support DNA synthesis activity (Fig. 5) Open table in a new tab To determine crystallographic structures of DNA polymerases with bound substrates, an abortive ternary substrate complex is produced (23Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Google Scholar). This is typically achieved with a polymerase-DNA complex, where the first two templating nucleotides are complementary to the included ddNTP. The polymerase inserts the first ddNTP, resulting in a terminated primer and binds another ddNTP, resulting in an abortive ternary complex. Utilizing a 3′-deoxycytosine at the primer terminus, the addition of the complementary dNTP results in a significant increase in the apparent binding affinity for the gapped DNA substrate (Table III), suggesting that important conformational changes have occurred. Pol β-Dependent Mismatch Extension—Since the DNA binding affinities for matched and mismatched primer termini are comparable, the ratio of catalytic efficiencies for correct nucleotide insertion on a mismatched terminus relative to that determined on a matched terminus approximates (fmin0). However, the strong dependence of catalytic efficiency for correct insertion on the identity of the matched primer terminus makes the calculation of (fmin0)potentially ambiguous. For example, the catalytic efficiency for insertion on a G/G mismatch needs to be calculated relative to a matched terminus. In this case, a matched terminus could originate with the template base (i.e. G/C) or, alternatively, the primer base (i.e. C/G). Since the catalytic efficiencies for insertion on these matched termini differ by 25-fold, (fmin0)will differ by 25-fold, depending on the identity of the matched terminus. We have chosen the template base of the mismatch as the reference nucleotide for comparison with the matched terminus, since the template strand serves as the blueprint for DNA synthesis. Consequently, the mismatched primer nucleotide is the incorrect partner. It should be noted, however, that mismatches can arise through correct nucleotide insertion on a misaligned template strand followed by realignment (i.e. dislocation) (24Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Google Scholar). In this scenario, the incorrect nucleotide in the primer strand does not represent a misincorporation event. Steady-state kinetic parameters are tabulated in Table I in order of decreasing catalytic efficiencies for the respective mismatches relative to the corresponding matched terminus. Since insertion of dCTP on a G/G mismatch could not be readily measured (see below), the templating base was changed to thymidine. In general, pol β extends transition intermediates more efficiently than transversions. In most instances, this is due to a decrease in kcat and an increase in Km. However, there are situations where changes in one kinetic parameter dominates over the other. For example, kcat for extension of T/G and T/C is hardly affected relative to T/A, but Km is increased 35- and 74-fold, respectively. The interpretation of these steady-state kinetic parameters is not straightforward due to the observation that product dissociation (i.e. koff for nicked DNA) and nucleotide insertion (i.e. kpol) are partially rate-limiting for correct insertion on a matched terminus (11Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Google Scholar). Thus, kcat can be a reflection of both rate constants. 3The full expressions for kcat and Km are (kpol koff)/(kpol + koff) and Kd(koff/(kpol + koff)), respectively (25Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Karn J. HIV: A Practical Approach. 2. IRL Press, New York1995: 15-36Google Scholar). The observation that it is not significantly altered suggests that the increase in Km represents a diminished dNTP binding affinity rather than a change in processivity (kpol/koff). It is not surprising that a mismatched primer terminus results in diminished dNTP binding and insertion, since the primer terminus forms part of the dNTP-binding pocket. However, the kinetic analysis of extension of an A/A or G/G mismatch indicates that the loss of catalytic efficiency is entirely due to the loss of insertion (kpol) without altering the binding affinity for the incoming nucleotide. Because kcat for correct insertion is diminished 460- and 2800-fold respectively, kcat is a direct measure of kpol. Since the DNA binding affinity is not significantly altered (Table III), kpol is now completely rate-limiting. In such a situation, Km is equivalent to Kd for the incoming nucleotide (25Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Karn J. HIV: A Practical Approach. 2. IRL Press, New York1995: 15-36Google Scholar). The Kd for the correct incoming nucleotide on a matched terminus is ∼10 μm (11Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Google Scholar, 13Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in Km for these mismatche"

Its role in monocyte effector function, however, has not been defined. In the present study a role for OPGL in activating monocytes/macrophages has been characterized. OPGL was found to up-regulate receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) receptor expression on monocytes, regulate their effector function by inducing cytokine and chemokine secretion, activate antigen presentation through up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecule expression, and promote survival. This activation is mediated through the MAPK pathway as evidenced by activation of p38 and p42/44 MAPK and up-regulation of BCL-XL protein levels. A physiological role for OPGL in monocyte activation and effector function was tested in a model of lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock. Administration of receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK)-Fc to block OPGL activity in vivo was able to protect mice from death induced by sepsis, indicating a hitherto undescribed role for OPGL in monocyte function and in mediating inflammatory response. This was further tested in an animal model of inflammation-mediated arthritis. Treatment with RANK-Fc significantly ameliorated disease development and attenuated bone destruction. Thus, our study strongly suggests that administration of receptor fusion proteins to specifically block OPGL activity in vivo may result in blocking development of monocyte/macrophage-mediated diseases.

Most TNF/TNFR superfamily proteins, including CD40L/CD40, TNF/TNFR, or lymphotoxin-β/lymphotoxin-β receptor, are expressed in the immune system and are known to regulate immune response by co-coordinating homeostasis, T cell activation, dendritic cell function, or the formation of germinal centers and lymphoid organs such as Peyer's patches and lymph nodes (3Locksley R.M.

Sequence analysis has shown that the extracellular domain of OPGL shares 18–28% amino acid identity with other members of the TNF superfamily and the greatest identity with CD40L (2Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). High levels of OPGL mRNA are detectable in T cells in the lymph nodes and bone osteoblastic cells. OPGL binds to its specific receptor, RANK, a transmembrane member of the TNFR superfamily (2Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F.

Although RANK mRNA can be detected in skeletal muscle, thymus, liver, colon, small intestine, and adrenal gland, at the protein level RANK expression to date has been detectable only on the surfaces of mature dendritic cells and osteoclasts. OPGL has also been shown to bind an alternate receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG) (6Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R. Colombero A. Elliott G. Scully S. Hsu H.

OPG acts as a soluble decoy receptor for OPGL and has been shown to neutralize the activity of OPGL (8Hofbauer L.C. Khosla S. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Initial functional studies on OPGL revealed its ability to activate dendritic cells and inhibit apoptosis, resulting in an increase in dendritic cell-mediated T cell proliferation in a mixed leukocyte reaction (9Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Sauter B. Li H.L. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). This increase was likely mediated by increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1, and T cell growth factors, such as IL-12 and IL-15, by dendritic cells (10Josien R. Wong B.R. Li H.L. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2562-2568PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies have also revealed that OPGL, in combination with colony-stimulating factor 1, could activate mature osteoclasts and mediate osteoclastogenesis (6Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L.

Although dendritic cells appeared normal, OPGL-deficient mice exhibited defects in early differentiation of T and B cells and lacked all lymph nodes. Null mice also exhibited severe osteopetrosis and a complete lack of osteoclasts. RANK–/– mice expressed similar phenotypes suggesting that OPGL-RANK interactions provided critical signals necessary for lymph node organogenesis and osteoclast differentiation (13Dougall W.C. Glaccum M. Charrier K. Rohrbach K. Brasel K. De Smedt T. Daro E. Smith J. Tometsko M.E. Maliszewski C.R. Armstrong A. Shen V. Bain S. Cosman D. Anderson D. Morrissey P.J. Peschon J.J. Schuh J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2412-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). An important connection between bone and the immune system was reported by Kong et al. (14Kong Y.Y. Feige U. Sarosi I. Bolon B. Tafuri A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Li J. Elliott R. McCabe S. Wong T. Campagnuolo G. Moran E. Bogoch E.R. Van G. Nguyen L.T. Ohashi P.S. Lacey D.L. Fish E. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) when they observed that activated T cells could directly activate osteoclastogenesis through OPGL. This connection was further strengthened following a report that this T cell-mediated regulation could be suppressed by interferon-γ produced by T cells themselves (16Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Tanaka K. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that bone metabolism is regulated by the immune system through complex and dynamic interactions. In addition, activation of T cells in vivo could lead to an OPGL-mediated increase in osteoclastogenesis and bone loss, suggesting that blocking OPGL activity may serve as an efficient therapeutic approach to attenuate bone loss observed in various malignant bone disorders (8Hofbauer L.C. Khosla S. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Thus, while a major role for OPGL in regulation of osteoclastogenesis and chondrocyte differentiation has been established, the exact nature of how OPGL regulates inflammation and the immune system has not been determined. Osteoclasts and monocytes are derived from a common myeloid progenitor and are known to utilize similar signaling pathways involving TNF receptor-associated factors, MAPK, and NF-κB, indicating that they may share a common mechanism of OPGL regulation of their function. This coupled with the fact that OPGL is most closely related in sequence to CD40L, a molecule crucial to activation of antigen-presenting cells, suggests a role for OPGL in immune response. In the present study, we examined a novel role for OPGL in activating monocytes. RANK protein expression was detected on freshly isolated monocytes, and treatment with OPGL was shown to activate monocytes, resulting in MAPK activation, cytokine secretion, and up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecule expression. OPGL was also able to protect monocytes from apoptosis and induced up-regulation of BCL-2 pro-survival family members such as BCL-XL and BCL-2. These in vitro findings were confirmed in an in vivo model of LPS-induced septic shock through the use of a receptor fusion protein approach to specifically block OPGL activity. Administration of RANK-Fc was able to protect mice from death induced by sepsis, indicating a novel role for OPGL in monocyte function in vivo. In addition, treatment with RANK-Fc significantly ameliorated disease development in a model of inflammation-mediated arthritis, suggesting therapeutic potential in inflammatory disease. Thus, the identification of a novel immune cell population regulated by OPGL opens up the possibility that OPGL may play a key role in inflammatory immune response. Cell Culture—Monocytes were isolated from human peripheral blood using the Monocyte Isolation kit (Milteny Biotec) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly lymphocytes were isolated from human peripheral blood using Lymphocyte Separation medium (ICN Pharmaceuticals). A magnetic labeling system (MACS MicroBeads) was used for the isolation of untouched monocytes from peripheral blood by depleting non-monocytes. Cells were maintained in complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Reagents—Monoclonal antibodies against p38 MAPK, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, and phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK were purchased from New England BioLabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Peroxidase-conjugated α-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody to human RANK and recombinant human OPGL and CD40L were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). PE-α-hCD80, FITC-α-hCD86, PE-α-hClass II, FITC-α-mouse IgG1antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. LPS was purchased from Sigma. Murine RANK-Fc and control IgG for in vivo studies were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and Sigma, respectively. FACS Analyses—Monocytes were adjusted to 5 × 105 cells/ml and incubated in the presence or absence of OPGL (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cells were then harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and incubated with one of the following antibodies for 15 min at 4 °C: PE-conjugated α-hCD80, FITC-conjugated α-hCD86, or PE-conjugated α-hClass II or α-hRANK. Cells stained with α-hRANK were washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated α-mouse IgG1 antibody for 15 min at 4 °C. Following another wash step, cells were analyzed by FACS using CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences). Taqman Analyses—Monocytes were adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and cultured for 24 h with (or without) various concentrations of OPGL. Total RNA was then isolated from OPGL-treated and control cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses were performed with 50 ng of total RNA sample and 40 μl of a reaction mixture. The reaction mixture in the Taqman Core kit contained 10× buffer A; 10 units of RNase inhibitor; 200 μm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 4 mm MgCl2, 1.25 units of Taq Gold polymerase; and 25 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each well contained a 10-μl primer/probe mixture of 200 nm gene-specific hybridization probe and 300 nm gene-specific amplification primers. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 30 min at 48 °C, then 2 min at 50 °C, and 10 min at 95 °C. The reactions then cycled 40 times for 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Reactions and sequence detection was conducted with the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. The sequences of the RANK/GAPDH Taqman primer/probe set used are as follows: RANK forward primer, 5′-AGTGGTGCGATTATAGCCCG-3′; RANK reverse primer, 5′-GAAGGTTGAGGTGGGAGGATC-3′; RANK probe, 5′-AGCCTCTAACTCCTGGGCTCAAGCAATC-3′; GAPDH forward primer, 5′-TGGGCTACACTGAGCACCAG-3′; GAPDH reverse primer, 5′-CAGCGTCAAAGGTGGAGGAG-3′; GAPDH probe, 5′-TGGTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCGACAC-3′. Detection of Cytokines—Monocytes were induced with various concentrations of OPGL for 24 h, and supernatants were harvested. Levels of secreted cytokines in the cell culture supernatants were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (BD Pharmingen kits for IL-12 and IL-6, and R&D Systems kits for TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-1β). Western Blotting—Monocytes (adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml) were starved in serum-free medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin) for 4 h and incubated with OPGL for 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 60 min. At each time point, cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates (30 or 50 μg) were separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Novex Electrophoresis) in SDS running buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, and 3.5 mm SDS) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer followed by primary antibodies for p38 and p42/44 MAPK. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Western blotting analyses of BCL-XL and BCL-2 was performed essentially as described above with the lysis buffer being 1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 1 tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Survival Assays—For in vitro assays, monocytes were adjusted to 5 × 105 c/ml and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml LPS, 1 μg/ml CD40 ligand, or 1 μg/ml OPGL. At the indicated time points, cells in the respective cultures were stained with Annexin V-FITC (Clontech) and analyzed by FACS. For in vivo assays, 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were administered RANK-Fc or control IgG (100 μg intraperitoneally) daily starting on day 0, injected intraperitoneally with 30 mg kg–1 of body weight LPS from Escherichia coli serotype O55:B5 (Calbiochem) on day 1, and monitored for survival. Induction of Antibody-mediated Arthritis—Arthritis was induced in two groups of 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory) by intravenous injection (2 mg/mouse, subarthritogenic dose) of a combination of four different monoclonal antibodies generated by the Arthrogen-CIA® mouse B hybridoma cell lines (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Disease development was aided by an intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg/mouse LPS the following day. Groups 1 and 2 were administered RANK-Fc and control IgG starting the same day as the injection of the monoclonal antibodies (day 0). Mice were administered 100 μg of RANK-Fc/control IgG intraperitoneally daily. Mice were sacrificed on day 14. X-ray and Microcomputed Tomography (μCT) Acquisition—Planar x-ray images of the front and hind paws were acquired after sacrifice. The paws were severed with an axial cut of the distal radius/ulna (front paw) and tibia/fibula (hind paw). The samples were then imaged with a digital planar x-ray system (MX-20, Faxitron X-ray, Inc., Wheeling, IL). X-ray images were acquired with an x-ray tube current of 300 μA and a voltage of 26 kV. The extracted mouse samples (front and hind paws) were also imaged with a μCT40 (SCANCO Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland) x-ray μCT system. A sagittal scout image, comparable to a conventional planar x-ray, was obtained to define the start and end point for the axial acquisition of a series of computed tomography images. The location and number of axial images were chosen to provide complete coverage of the joints of interest for each paw. The target joints of the front paw were the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints (PIP and DIP) for digits 2–5. The metatarsophalangeal joints for digits 2–5, PIP joints for digits 2–5, and DIP joints of the hind paw were also evaluated. The μCT images were generated by operating the x-ray tube at an energy level of 50 kV, a current of 160 μA, and an integration time of 300 ms. Axial images were obtained at an isotropic resolution of 16 μm. Radiographic Analysis—X-ray images and μCT were evaluated for bone abnormalities by application of a semiquantitative scoring system that was based on the scoring system for radiographs described by Genant et al. (17Genant H.K. Jiang Y. Peterfy C. Lu Y. Redei J. Countryman P.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional surface rendering was created from the μCT data with Analyze (AnalyzeDirect Inc., Lenexa, KS), an image analysis software package. The x-ray image and corresponding μCT three-dimensional rendering were simultaneously view and evaluated by a single reader (W. P. Lee) who was blinded to treatment. The degree of erosions and periarticular osteoporosis were graded with a six-point score ranging from 0 (normal) to 5 (severe). A cumulative score was determined for each paw by summing the scores of the individual joints: front paw (metacarpophalangeal, PIP, and DIP; digits 2–5) and hind paw (metatarsophalangeal, PIP, and DIP; digits 2–5). Histological Analysis—Joints from all four feet from each animal were scored in three categories (synovial, bone, and cartilage changes) and added to achieve a final total score. Scores were derived as follows: 1 = severity is minimal and distribution is multifocal to diffuse, OR severity is mild but distribution is focal; 2 = severity is mild and distribution is diffuse, OR severity is moderate but distribution is focal; 3 = severity is moderate and distribution is multifocal; 4 = severity is moderate and distribution is diffuse, OR severity is severe but distribution is focal; 5 = severity is severe and distribution is multifocal to diffuse. The criteria for lesion severity scores were as follows. Synovium, bone, and cartilage lesions were scored separately. Synovial lesion scores were based on the amount of synovial proliferation (pannus) and inflammation. Bone lesion scores were based on the amount of bone destruction/loss (occasional evidence of osteoclastic activity in areas of pannus or inflammation as minimal; segmental complete loss of bone and replacement by pannus or new/noncortical bone as severe). Cartilage lesion scores were based on the amount of cartilage destruction/loss (loss of nuclei and preservation of smooth cartilage surface as minimal; complete fragmentation and/or loss as severe). RANK Is Expressed on Monocytes and Is Up-regulated upon Stimulation with OPGL—To investigate potential roles for OPGL in monocyte and macrophage effector function, we first wanted to determine whether RANK is expressed on monocytes. Toward this end, monocytes were freshly isolated from peripheral blood, stained with a monoclonal antibody to RANK, and analyzed by FACS. As shown in Fig. 1A, RANK expression on the cell surface of resting monocytes was clearly detected over control isotype staining. To determine whether OPGL can regulate expression of RANK, monocytes were treated with various concentrations of OPGL (0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.25, and 2.5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses were performed (Fig. 1B). Upon stimulation with OPGL, a dose-dependent increase in RANK mRNA expression was observed. The highest concentration of OPGL used, 2.5 μg/ml, stimulated a 4-fold increase in RANK expression over unstimulated monocytes after 24 h. This up-regulation in RANK expression was specific to OPGL and was not observed when monocytes were stimulated with LPS or CD40L (data not shown). Consistent with an increase in mRNA levels, up-regulation of RANK protein cell surface expression was also observed in FACS analyses upon OPGL treatment after 24 h (Fig. 1C). OPGL Induces Effector Function of Monocytes by Up-regulating Secretion of Cytokines and Chemokines—Activation of monocytes by physiological stimuli such as LPS and TNF family members like CD40L has been shown to induce their effector function resulting in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α. To test whether OPGL could functionally activate monocytes, we stimulated monocytes for 24 h with incremental doses of OPGL and looked for production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, T cell activation cytokines including IL-12 and IL-6, and chemokines such as MIP-1α. As shown in Fig. 2, A–E, OPGL was able to induce secretion of these cytokines from freshly isolated monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest concentration of OPGL used (5 μg/ml), levels of cytokine concentration in the supernatant were 213 pg/ml for IL-12, 7704 pg/ml for IL-6, 13.4 pg/ml for TNF-α, 803 pg/ml for IL-1β, and 8740 pg/ml for MIP-1α. These levels were comparable to those induced by LPS at 5 μg/ml (373 pg/ml for IL-12, 6193 pg/ml for IL-6, 21.3 pg/ml for TNF-α, 658 pg/ml for IL-1β, and 10,395 pg/ml for MIP-1α). OPGL Activates Antigen Presentation Function of Monocytes by Inducing Expression of Co-stimulatory Molecules—In addition to playing a dominant role in innate immunity by phagocytosis of microorganisms, monocytes and macrophages play a very important role in activating the adaptive immune response by activating T lymphocytes. This is accomplished by the secretion of activation cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-6, by presenting antigens, and by providing co-stimulatory signals to T cells. Antigen presentation is accomplished by molecules such as major histocompatibility complex Class II, while members of the B7 family such as B7.1/CD80 and B7.2/CD86 are involved in T cell co-stimulation. To study whether OPGL is involved in activation of the above functions, freshly isolated monocytes were incubated with OPGL (5 μg/ml) and analyzed by FACS. As shown in Fig. 3, OPGL was able to efficiently up-regulate expression of CD80 (Fig. 3A), CD86 (Fig. 3B), and major histocompatibility complex Class II (Fig. 3C) molecules on monocytes after a 24-h stimulation. OPGL was also able to moderately up-regulate CD40 expression on monocytes (data not shown). The above results thus indicate a novel role for OPGL in activating various in vivo functions of monocytes and macrophages such as proinflammatory cytokine secretion and T cell activation. OPGL Activates the MAPK Pathway in Monocytes—To determine whether monocyte activation by OPGL involves the MAPK pathway, we induced monocytes with OPGL (1 μg/ml) for 1, 3, 10, 30, and 60 min and looked for activation of MAPK pathways (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 4A) and p42/44 ERK (Fig. 4B) was observed at 1 min and peaked at 10 min for p38, while it remained at elevated levels for p42/44 MAPK even at 60 min. Interestingly, phosphorylation of p52/54 JNK/SAPK could not be detected in monocytes upon OPGL treatment (data not shown) suggesting a differential utilization of MAPK pathways. OPGL Enhances Survival of Monocytes—Based on previous studies suggesting a role for OPGL as a survival factor for dendritic cells, we induced apoptosis in monocytes by serum withdrawal and looked for protection from apoptosis induced by OPGL. Annexin V staining analyses revealed that OPGL protected monocytes from apoptosis at levels comparable to LPS (0.5 mg/ml) and CD40L (1 μg/ml) (Fig. 5A). Similar results were also obtained for monocytes treated with α-Fas antibody and dexamethasone (data not shown). To determine possible mechanisms of OPGL-induced survival in monocytes, we looked for induction of antiapoptotic proteins belonging to the BCL-2 family. Robust activation of BCL-XL protein expression was observed starting at 4 h post-OPGL stimulation (1 μg/ml) in monocytes, and a moderate but reproducible up-regulation of BCL-2 protein expression was also observed (Fig. 5B). Blocking OPGL Activity Results in Decreased Susceptibility to Endotoxic Shock—The above results suggest an important role for OPGL in the activation of effector function of monocytes during inflammation, and this was tested in an in vivo model of LPS-induced endotoxic shock (18Ashkenazi A. Marsters S.A. Capon D.J. Chamow S.M. Figari I.S. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. Palladino M.A. Smith D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10535-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A soluble receptor form, RANK-Fc, comprising the extracellular domain of murine RANK was used to block OPGL function in vivo. RANK-Fc was chosen based on its ability to bind OPGL exclusively as opposed to the soluble decoy receptor OPG, which can also bind an alternate TNF ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (19Emery J.G. McDonnell P. Burke M.B. Deen K.C. Lyn S. Silverman C. Dul E. Appelbaum E.R. Eichman C. DiPrinzio R. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Rosenberg M. Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2161471893,"Scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells I (SREC-I) is a novel endocytic receptor for acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL). Here we show that SREC-I is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including macrophages and aortas. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) robustly stimulated the expression of SREC-I in macrophages. In an initial attempt to clarify the role of SREC-I in the uptake of modified lipoproteins as well as in the development of atherosclerosis, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the SREC-I gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. To exclude the overwhelming effect of the type A scavenger receptor (SR-A) on the uptake of Ac-LDL, we further generated mice lacking both SR-A and SREC-I (SR-A–/–;SREC-I–/–) by cross-breeding and compared the uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL in the isolated macrophages. The contribution of SR-A and SREC-I to the overall degradation of Ac-LDL was 85 and 5%, respectively, in a non-stimulated condition. LPS increased the uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL by 1.8-fold. In this condition, the contribution of SR-A and SREC-I to the overall degradation of Ac-LDL was 90 and 6%, respectively. LPS increased the absolute contribution of SR-A and SREC-I by 1.9- and 2.3-fold, respectively. On the other hand, LPS decreased the absolute contribution of other pathways by 31%. Consistently, LPS did not increase the expression of other members of the scavenger receptor family such as CD36. In conclusion, SREC-I serves as a major endocytic receptor for Ac-LDL in LPS-stimulated macrophages lacking SR-A, suggesting that it has a key role in the development of atherosclerosis in concert with SR-A.

Scavenger receptors mediate the endocytosis of chemically modified lipoproteins such as acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL), 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; SR-A, class A type I/type II scavenger receptor; SR-BI, class B type I scavenger receptor; SREC, scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells. 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; SR-A, class A type I/type II scavenger receptor; SR-BI, class B type I scavenger receptor; SREC, scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells. thereby contributing to the development of atherosclerosis (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Google Scholar). The scavenger receptor gene family comprises a series of unlinked genes encoding membrane proteins with diverse ligand binding activity (2Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 275-280Google Scholar). The class A type I/type II scavenger receptor (SR-A) is the prototype receptor belonging to this family (3Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Google Scholar) and accounts for ∼80% of the uptake of Ac-LDL in macrophages (4Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S. Noda T. Toyoda Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Horiuchi S.

Steinbrecher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12938-12944Google Scholar). Recently, we identified scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells I (SREC-I), which encodes a protein of 830 amino acids and binds fluorescent DiI-labeled Ac-LDL when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (6Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Google Scholar), and its paralogous gene, SREC-II (7Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Google Scholar). The SREC-I protein is composed of an N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain with seven epidermal growth factor receptor-like cysteine pattern signatures, a membrane-spanning domain, and an unusually long C-terminal cytoplasmic domain that includes a Ser/Pro-rich region followed by a Gly-rich region. SREC-II encodes an 834-amino acid protein with 35% homology to SREC-I. Although SREC-II has little activity to internalize modified LDL, SREC-I-expressing fibroblasts are intensely aggregated with SREC-II-expressing fibroblasts, indicating the association of SREC-I and SREC-II (7Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Google Scholar). However, the precise functions of these two proteins are currently unknown. In atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages are laden with lipids and immunologically activated (8Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Google Scholar). In line with this, the development of atherosclerosis is accelerated by LPS (9Lehr H.A. Sagban T.A. Ihling C. Zahringer U. Hungerer K.D. Blumrich M. Reifenberg K. Bhakdi S. Circulation. 2001; 104: 914-920Google Scholar), a major component of Gram-negative bacteria that stimulates the production of various cytokines in vivo, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of endotoxin shock (10Lynn W.A. Cohen J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 20: 143-158Google Scholar). Conversely, the absence of toll-like receptor 4, a receptor for LPS, inhibits its progression (11Vink A. Schoneveld A.H. van der Meer J.J. van Middelaar B.J. Sluijter J.P. Smeets M.B. Quax P.H. Lim S.K. Borst C. Pasterkamp G. de Kleijn D.P. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1985-1990Google Scholar). These considerations have prompted us to examine the effects of LPS on the expression of SREC-I. In the present study, we show that LPS robustly stimulated the expression of SREC-I in macrophages. In an initial attempt to clarify the role of SREC-I in the uptake of modified lipoproteins as well as in the development of atherosclerosis, we generated mice with targeted disruption of the SREC-I gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. To exclude the overwhelming effect of SR-A on the uptake of Ac-LDL, we further generated mice lacking both SR-A and SREC-I (SR-A–/–;SREC-I–/–). By comparing the uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL in peritoneal macrophages isolated from these mice, we found that SREC-I plays a significant role in the uptake of Ac-LDL in the setting of SR-A deficiency, especially when stimulated with LPS. From these results, we propose that SREC-I contributes to the development of atherosclerosis in concert with SR-A. General Methods—Standard molecular biology techniques were used (12Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The current experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines for animal experiments at the University of Tokyo and the Jichi Medical School. SREC-I Antibody Preparation—Two milligrams of the carboxyl-end peptide of mouse SREC-I (amino acid residues 801–820, KEQEEPLY-ENVVPMSVPPQH) was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the Imject sulfhydryl-reactive antibody production kit (Pierce). The keyhole limpet hemocyanin-peptide was gel-purified and emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Calbiochem). A female Wister rat was immunized with the emulsions. One week after the boost injection, blood was collected, and the antiserum was purified and eluted through an affinity column (Sulfolink coupling gel; Pierce) to which the antigen peptide was coupled. Mice—SR-A knock-out mice were generated previously (4Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S. Noda T. Toyoda Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Horiuchi S. Takahashi K. Kruijt J.K. Van Berkel T.J.C. Steinbrecher U.P. Ishibashi S. Maeda N. Gordon S. Kodama T. Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Google Scholar). ApoE knock-out mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) (13Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Google Scholar). Both mice had been back-crossed to C57BL/6J genetic background and fed a normal chow diet (MF diet from Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo, Japan) that contained 5.6% (w/w) fat with 0.09% (w/w) cholesterol, and the mice were allowed access to water and food ad libitum. Cells—Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (14Yagyu H. Kitamine T. Osuga J. Tozawa R. Chen Z. Kaji Y. Oka T. Perrey S. Tamura Y. Ohashi K. Okazaki H. Yahagi N. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Harada K. Shimano H. Yamashita H. Gotoda T. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21324-21330Google Scholar) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (15Okazaki H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Yahagi N. Tomita S. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kimura S. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3368-3375Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of LPS (Escherichia coli O127:B8; Sigma) for 12 h before the experiments. Northern Blot Analysis—For the SREC-I cDNA probe, two probes were prepared, namely Probe A, a 5′ 2.0-kb fragment spanning the extracellular and intracellular domains, and Probe B, a 0.1-kb fragment consisting of only the transmembrane domain. Poly (A)+ RNA was purified using Oligotex-dT30™, an oligo(dT) latex (Roche Applied Science) from 100–150 μg of total RNA that was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from either cultured cells or tissues. One to three milligrams of poly(A)+ RNA was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formalin, transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to the 32P-labeled probes for SREC-I and other scavenger receptors as described previously (16Tamura Y. Adachi H. Osuga J. Ohashi K. Yahagi N. Sekiya M. Okazaki H. Tomita S. Iizuka Y. Shimano H. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tsujimoto M. Ishibashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12613-12617Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with 0.1% SDS. After centrifugation, 50 μg of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond ECL™, a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation with the anti-SREC-I antibody (1:400 dilution), the membrane was incubated with a goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). The secondary antibody was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of the SREC-I Knock-out Mice—The SREC-I gene was cloned from the 129/Sv mouse genomic library (Clontech) using the mouse cDNA as a probe. A replacement-type targeting vector was constructed so that a 35-bp segment in exon 8, which encodes 3′ two-thirds of the transmembrane domain, was replaced with a polIIneo cassette (Fig. 5A). Long arm consists of a 10-kb NotI/KpnI fragment spanning the 5′ untranslated region and exon 8; short arm consists of a 0.9-kb SacI/XbaI fragment within intron 9. These were inserted together into the vector pPolIIshort-neobpA-HSVTK, as described previously (17Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 883-893Google Scholar). After digestion with SalI, the vector was electroporated into JH-1 embryonic stem cells (a generous gift from Dr. Herz at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, TX). Targeted clones, which had been selected in the presence of G418 and 1-(2-deoxy, 2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5 iodouracil, were identified by PCR using the primers 5′-GATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAGGCATGC-3′ and 5′-CAGAGAGTGTCACCACAACAAGAGGA-3′ (Fig. 5A). Homologous recombination was verified by Southern blot analysis after digestion with EcoRI using a 0.5-kb SpeI/SmaI fragment, which was downstream of the short arm, as a probe (Fig. 5A). Targeted embryonic stem clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, yielding one line of chimeric mice that transmitted the disrupted allele through the germline. Generation of the SR-A/SREC-I Double Knock-out Mice—The SR-A–/– mice were crossed with the SREC-I–/– mice, which were a C57BL/6J × 129/Sv hybrid, to obtain SR-A+/–;SREC-I+/– mice, which were interbred to obtain four types of mice, namely wild-type, SR-A+/+; SREC-I–/–, SR-A–/–;SREC-I+/+, and SR-A–/–;SREC-I–/– mice. Thus, the genetic background of these mice was 75% C57BL/6J and 25% 129/Sv. Littermates were used for the experiments. Biochemical Analyses—Blood was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus after a 12-h fast. Plasma glucose (ANTSENSE II, Bayer Medical, Tokyo, Japan), cholesterol (Determiner TC, Kyowa Medex, Tokyo), and triglycerides (TGLH; Wako Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) were measured. Histology—Mice were sacrificed by decapitation. Tissues were excised, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Preparation of Lipoproteins—LDL (d 1.019–1.063 g/ml) and lipoprotein-deficient serum (d >1.21 g/ml) were prepared by stepwise ultracentrifugation from plasma obtained from healthy volunteers. The lipoproteins and lipoprotein-deficient serum were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01%(w/v) EDTA, and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3. LDL was acetylated with acetic anhydrate and radioiodinated by the iodine monochloride method as described (18Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Cellular Uptake and Degradation of 125I-Ac-LDL—Peritoneal macrophages were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 106/well and treated with or without 100 ng/ml of LPS for 12 h. After stringent washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with a medium containing varying concentrations of 125I-Ac-LDL and 5 mg/ml lipoprotein-deficient serum, with or without a 50-fold excess of unlabeled Ac-LDL, for 5 h at 37 °C. The amounts of 125I-Ac-LDL either degraded by or associated with the cells were measured according to a modified method (19Perrey S. Ishibashi S. Kitamine T. Osuga J. Yagyu H. Chen Z. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Yahagi N. Tamura Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Yamada N. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 154: 51-60Google Scholar) of Goldstein et al. (18Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Google Scholar). Statistics—The differences of the means were compared by Student's t test. Tissue Distribution of mRNA Expression of SREC-I and -II— We performed Northern blot analyses to examine the expression of SREC-I and II in various organs of a mouse (Fig. 1). SREC-I was expressed in a wide variety of organs, most predominantly in liver, lung, kidney, and heart. On the other hand, the expression of SREC-II was restricted to lung and kidney. LPS Stimulates the Expression of SREC-I in Peritoneal Macrophages—LPS robustly increased the mRNA expression of both SREC-I and SR-A in macrophages (Fig. 2). The peak of the stimulation was reached by the 12-h time point of the stimulation (Fig. 2A), and the maximal responses were obtained at the concentration of 10 ng/ml (Fig. 2B). The relative increase in the expression of SREC-I was 4-fold, which was more prominent than that of SR-A (1.8-fold) (Fig. 3). It is of note that the treatment with LPS did not significantly change the expression of MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure) (20Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Google Scholar) and SR-BI (21Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Google Scholar) and that it even decreased the expression of CD36 (22Kunjathoor V.V. Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Moore K.J. Andersson L. Koehn S. Rhee J.S. Silverstein R. Hoff H.F. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49982-49988Google Scholar) and FEEL-1 (fasciclin, EGF-like, laminin-type EGF-like, and link domain-containing scavenger receptor-1) (23Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34264-34270Google Scholar).Fig. 3Northern blot analysis of scavenger receptors for Ac-LDL in macrophages treated with or without LPS. Thioglycolateelicited macrophages from C57BL/6 wild-type mice were treated with (+) or without (–) 100 ng/ml LPS for 12 h. Two micrograms of poly(A)+ RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis. Probes used were SREC-I, SR-A, MARCO, CD36, SR-BI, and FEEL-1. Signal intensity was corrected against the intensity of 36B4, and the relative signal increase ratio was calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of SREC-I in Aortas—We compared the mRNA expression levels of SREC-I in the atherosclerotic aortas, which were taken from 12-month-old apoE knock-out mice, with normal aortas, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, peritoneal macrophages, kidney, or lung from wild-type mice (Fig. 4). Normal and atherosclerotic aortas expressed 1.7- and 2.1-fold higher levels of SREC-I mRNA than the non-stimulated macrophages, respectively. The expression levels were comparable with those in the kidney, but much lower than those of the LPS-treated macrophages. Generation of Mice Lacking the SREC-I and/or SR-A Gene— The intercross of the progeny (SREC-I+/–) resulted in off-spring of both sexes with all three genotypes at the SREC locus with the expected Mendelian ratios (105:191:85 χ2 = 1.06, p > 0.05) (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C shows the results of Northern blot analyses of SREC-I in peritoneal macrophages. When hybridized with Probe A, which contains nearly the whole coding region of the SREC-I cDNA, Northern blot revealed a band with mRNA size of 2.9 kb in wild-type macrophages and a band of 2.4 kb in SREC-I–/– macrophages. When hybridized with Probe B, which contains the transmembrane domain, no band was detectable in SREC-I–/– macrophages. These results indicate that SREC-I–/– mice express a truncated transcript that lacks the transmembrane domain. SREC-I–/– mice were fertile and apparently normal. There were no significant differences in the growth curves of wild-type and SREC-I–/– mice. As shown in Table I, plasma levels of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were not different between wild-type and SREC-I–/– mice. We failed to detect any pathological findings in the brain, lung, heart, liver, kidney, and testis of SREC-I–/– mice.Table IPlasma levels of glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceridesWild-type (+/+)SREC-I-/-mg/dlGlucose61.1 ± 3.2 (n = 31)63.2 ± 3.2 (n = 31)Total cholesterol89.7 ± 5.1 (n = 22)82.0 ± 3.3 (n = 27)Triglycerides89.6 ± 9.4 (n = 22)97.4 ± 10.3 (n = 27) Open table in a new tab Northern blot analysis of four types of mice confirmed the absence of the expression of SR-A in both SR-A–/–;SREC-I+/+ and SR-A–/–;SREC-I–/– mice as well as the expression of the disrupted allele of SREC-I in both SR-A+/+;SREC-I–/– and SR-A–/–;SREC-I–/– mice (Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of SREC-I protein (∼140 and160 kDa) in both SR-A+/+; SREC-I–/– and SR-A–/–;SREC-I–/– mice (Fig. 6B). LPS Stimulates Protein Expression of SREC-I—LPS significantly increased the SREC-I protein by ∼2-fold in wild-type and SR-A–/–;SREC-I+/+ macrophages (Fig. 6B). LPS Increases the Contribution of SREC-I to the Cellular Uptake and Degradation of the 125I-Ac-LDL—In non-stimulated conditions (Fig. 7A) there was no significant difference in the specific uptake and degradation of 125I-Ac-LDL between wild-type and SR-A+/+;SREC-I–/– macrophages. Based on the values for 20 μg/ml degraded 125I-Ac-LDL, SR-A–/–;SREC-I+/+ macrophages degraded significantly smaller amounts of 125I-Ac-LDL (15%) than did wild-type macrophages, supporting the dominant role of SR-A in the uptake and degradation of 125I-Ac-LDL in macrophages. Compared with SR-A–/–;SREC-I+/+ macrophages, SR-A–/–;SREC-I–/– macrophages showed a further reduction in the specific uptake (21%) and degradation of 125I-Ac-LDL (31%). Based on the values for 20 μg/ml degraded 125I-Ac-LDL, the contribution of SR-A and SREC-I to the overall degradation of Ac-LDL was calculated to be 85 and 5%, respectively, in the non-stimulated condition. LPS increased the uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL by 1.8-fold (Fig. 7B). In this condition, there was no significant difference in the specific uptake and degradation of 125I-Ac-LDL between wild-type and SR-A+/+;SREC-I–/– macrophages. Based on the values for 20 μg/ml degraded 125I-Ac-LDL, SR-A–/–;SREC-I+/+ macrophages degraded significantly smaller amounts of 125I-Ac-LDL (10%) than did wild-type macrophages. Compared with SR-A–/–;SREC-I+/+ macrophages, SR-A–/–;SREC-I–/– macrophages showed a further reduction in the specific uptake (49%) and degradation of 125I-Ac-LDL (59%). Based on the values for 20 μg/ml degraded Ac-LDL, the contribution of SR-A and SREC-I to the overall degradation of 125I-Ac-LDL was calculated to be 90 and 6%, respectively. LPS increased the absolute contribution of SR-A and SREC-I by 1.9- and 2.3-fold, respectively. On the other hand, LPS decreased the absolute contribution of other pathways by 31%. In the present study, we have first shown that SREC-I, a novel member of the scavenger receptor family that recognizes modified lipoproteins, is expressed in a wide variety of tissues including macrophages and aortas, implicating its involvement in the development of atherosclerosis. The expression of SREC-I was not significantly different between normal and atherosclerotic aortas, although it was robustly induced by LPS in macrophages, a major cell type that is present in foam cell lesions. To define the precise role of SREC-I, we have generated wild-type, SR-A+/+;SREC-I–/–, SR-A–/–;SREC-I+/+, and SR-A–/–;SREC-I–/– mice and compared the uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL in macrophages between these mice. Results show that the contribution of SREC-I to the overall uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL was 5% in the non-stimulated condition and 6% in the LPS-stimulated condition. Although the involvement of SREC-I was relatively small compared with that of SR-A, LPS increased the SREC-I mediated degradation by 2.3-fold, which accounted for 60% of the amounts of Ac-LDL degraded by the pathway independent of SR-A. Because the responses of scavenger receptors to LPS are variable, we did not expect that LPS induced the expression of SREC-I in macrophages. LPS induces SR-A expression in mouse macrophages, which was confirmed in our experiments (Figs. 2 and 3) but not in THP-1 monocyte/macrophages (24Fitzgerald M.L. Moore K.J. Freeman M.W. Reed G.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2692-2700Google Scholar) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (25van Lenten B.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 112-116Google Scholar). Because SR-A is able to bind LPS (26Hampton R.Y. Golenbock D.T. Penman M. Krieger M. Raetz C.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 342-344Google Scholar), the induction of SR-A by LPS may have a protective role against endotoxemia. This notion is in line with the susceptibility of SR-A knock-out mice to endotoxin shock (4Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S. Noda T. Toyoda Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Horiuchi S. Takahashi K. Kruijt J.K. Van Berkel T.J.C. Steinbrecher U.P. Ishibashi S. Maeda N. Gordon S. Kodama T. Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Google Scholar, 27Haworth R. Platt N. Keshav S. Hughes D. Darley E. Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Kodama T. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1431-1439Google Scholar, 28Ishiguro T. Naito M. Yamamoto T. Hasegawa G. Gejyo F. Mitsuyama M. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 179-188Google Scholar). On the other hand, LPS down-regulates SR-B1 expression (29Baranova I. Vishnyakova T. Bocharov A. Chen Z. Remaley A.T. Stonik J. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 2995-3003Google Scholar), which was confirmed in our experiments (Fig. 2). The mechanism by which LPS induces SREC-I is intriguing. It is well known that LPS modulates gene expression though the activation of NF-κB signaling (30Muller J.M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 233-256Google Scholar), and some of the effects are mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, whose expression is stimulated by LPS. However, there is no NF-κB binding site in the 5′-flanking region of the human SREC-I gene 1 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site (31Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24014-24021Google Scholar). Furthermore, LPS did not induce SREC-I expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and tumor necrosis factor-α did not have increasing effects on SREC-I expression in mouse macrophages (data not shown). Further studies are warranted to decipher how LPS induces SREC-I expression. Although SREC-I is expressed in macrophages, particularly when stimulated with LPS, there was no significant difference in the expression levels between normal and atherosclerotic aortas (Fig. 4). This suggests that other cell types such as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in the aortas express comparable levels of SREC-I. SR-A is the major pathway for the uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL, accounting for 80% of the total activity (4Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S. Noda T. Toyoda Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Horiuchi S. Takahashi K. Kruijt J.K. Van Berkel T.J.C. Steinbrecher U.P. Ishibashi S. Maeda N. Gordon S. Kodama T. Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Google Scholar, 5Lougheed M. Lum C.M. Ling W. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Steinbrecher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12938-12944Google Scholar). Because other scavengers are expressed in macrophages (Fig. 2) and are able to bind Ac-LDL (2Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 275-280Google Scholar), the question is which scavenger receptor is the second most important in the uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL. Our results have revealed that the role of SREC-I is relatively minor in the non-stimulated macrophages, which is largely consistent with the recent report by Kunjathoor et al. (22Kunjathoor V.V. Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Moore K.J. Andersson L. Koehn S. Rhee J.S. Silverstein R. Hoff H.F. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49982-49988Google Scholar). According to them, SR-A and CD36 account for 75–90% of the total amounts of chemically modified LDL degraded by macrophages. In SR-A-deficient macrophages stimulated with LPS, however, the absolute contribution of SREC-I was significantly increased by 2.3-fold, accounting for 60% of the SR-A-independent uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL (Fig. 7B). The degree of increase in the SREC-I mediated uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL is largely comparable with that in SREC-I protein expression (Fig. 6B). It is interesting to note that LPS decreased the absolute contribution of the other endocytic pathway, which is independent of either SR-A or SREC-I, by 31%. This finding is consistent with the Northern blot results that show that LPS did not significantly increase the expression of the other members of scavenger receptor family such as MARCO, SR-BI, CD36, and FEEL-1 (Fig. 3). Thus, SREC-I is the second most important receptor mediating the uptake of Ac-LDL, at least in macrophages stimulated with LPS. Given the activated state of macrophages in rupture-prone unstable plaques (8Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Google Scholar), particularly in plaques infected with microorganisms such as Chlamydia, which is associated with an increased prevalence of coronary events (32Becker A.E. de Boer O.J. van Der Wal A.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 2001; 52: 289-297Google Scholar), SREC-I may take a significant part in the foam cell formation in these pathological conditions. Other aspects of LPS may be involved in the atherogenesis. For example, Baranova et al. (29Baranova I. Vishnyakova T. Bocharov A. Chen Z. Remaley A.T. Stonik J. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 2995-3003Google Scholar) and Khovidhunkit et al. (33Khovidhunkit W. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1636-1644Google Scholar) have recently reported that LPS inhibits high density lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux via down-regulation of the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1. These observations are consistent not only with the ability of LPS to stimulate lipid accumulation in macrophages in vitro (34Funk J.L. Feingold K.R. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 98: 67-82Google Scholar) but also with the proatherogenic effects of LPS (9Lehr H.A. Sagban T.A. Ihling C. Zahringer U. Hungerer K.D. Blumrich M. Reifenberg K. Bhakdi S. Circulation. 2001; 104: 914-920Google Scholar) and its cognate receptor, Toll-like receptor 4, in vivo (11Vink A. Schoneveld A.H. van der Meer J.J. van Middelaar B.J. Sluijter J.P. Smeets M.B. Quax P.H. Lim S.K. Borst C. Pasterkamp G. de Kleijn D.P. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1985-1990Google Scholar). Functions of adhesion molecules have been assigned to both SR-A and SREC-I/II. Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing SR-A have an increased ability to adhere to plastic surfaces (35Fraser I. Hughes D. Gordon S. Nature. 1993; 364: 343-346Google Scholar). Likewise, intense aggregation was observed when SREC-I-expressing fibroblast L-cells were mixed with those expressing SREC-II (7Ishii J. Adachi H. Aoki J. Koizumi H. Tomita S. Suzuki T. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that SREC-I–/– mice have some phenotypes with regard to cell adhesion. However, there were no obvious abnormalities in the pathologies (data not shown). The precise roles of scavenger receptors in atherogenesis have been tested only for SR-A and CD36. With regard to SR-A, we (4Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H.

Kodama T. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2593-2599Google Scholar) have reported that SR-A deficiency protects against the development of atherosclerosis in either apoE, LDL receptor-deficient, or wild-type mice. de Winther et al. (39de Winther M.P. Gijbels M.J. van Dijk K.W. van Gorp P.J. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Frants R.R. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 144: 315-321Google Scholar), however, recently reported apparently opposite results, i.e. SR-A deficiency leads to more complex lesions in the APOE3Leiden mice. The same group reported the reduction in atherosclerosis in LDL receptor knock-out mice in which SR-A was overexpressed in a macrophage-specific manner (40de Winther M.P. Gijbels M.J. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. Int. J. Tissue React. 2000; 22: 85-91Google Scholar). These contradictory results could be attributed to the broad repertoire of functions and the widespread expression of SR-A (41Platt N. Gordon S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 649-654Google Scholar). With regard to CD36, Febbraio et al. have reported that CD36 deficiency protects against atherosclerosis in an apoE-deficient background (42Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Smith J.D. Hajjar D.P. Hazen S.L. Hoff H.F. Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Google Scholar). Availability of the SR-A–/–; SREC-I–/– mice should allow us to determine the role of SREC-I in the development of atherosclerosis by crossing with the genetically hyperlipidemic mice, for example. If the hypothesis is correct, SREC-I should be a new target for preventing atherosclerosis. We thank Kimiko Saito, Megumi Herai, Mihoko Kusubae, and Rie Tamura for excellent technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2071885331,"Transcriptional activation by signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) has been shown to require the direct interaction not only with co-activators such as p300 and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) but also with nuclear co-activator 1, a member of the p160/steroid receptor co-activator family. Among the p160/steroid receptor co-activators, only p/CIP (nuclear co-activator 3) has been shown to be up-regulated by interleukin (IL)-4 in B cells through a STAT-6-dependent mechanism using Gene-Chip analysis. In this study, we have investigated the function of p/CIP in the transcriptional activation by STAT6. We found that p/CIP indirectly interacted with STAT6 via p300, and overexpression of the CBP-interacting domain of p/CIP (p/CIP947–1084) prevented the interaction of p/CIP with STAT6 by blocking the binding of p/CIP to p300. Whereas expression of p/CIP947–1084 resulted in a marked reduction of STAT6-mediated transactivation, overexpression of wild type p/CIP resulted in significant enhancement of it. In addition, p/CIP947–1084 markedly reduced CD23 expression on B cells stimulated with IL-4, whereas overexpression of wild type p/CIP enhanced it. Chromatin immunoprecipitations demonstrate that IL-4 increases the interaction of p/CIP with the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain germ line epsilon promoter in B cells. These results suggest that p/CIP positively regulates STAT6 transcriptional activation through formation of a STAT6, p300/CBP, and p/CIP complex.

IL-4 and IL-13 are considered to be crucial cytokines for the development of type II allergic diseases (4de Vries J.E. Carballido J.M. Sornasse T. Yssel H. Curr. Opin.

STAT6-deficient mice are defective in IL-4- and IL-13-induced Th2 cell differentiation and IL-4-induced class switching B cells to IgE and IgG1 (8Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J.

Wills-Karp M. Grusby M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 939-948Google Scholar) and also from IL-13-induced airway responsiveness (12Kuperman D.A. Huang X. Koth L.L. Chang G.H. Dolganov G.M. Zhu Z. Elias J.A. Sheppard D. Erle D.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 885-889Google Scholar). IL-4 stimulation results in activation of Janus kinase 1 and 3 tyrosine kinases, which in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-4 receptor α. Then STAT6 is recruited to the intracellular domain of the receptor and interacts with the phosphotyrosine residues via its SH2 domain. Subsequently, STAT6 is phosphorylated by Janus kinase kinases, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus where it modulates transcription through binding to STAT6-response elements (13Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Google Scholar, 14Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar). STAT6-binding elements were identified in the Iϵ promoter (15Messner B. Stutz A.M. Albrecht B.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 1529-1538Google Scholar), the IL-4 promoter (17Curiel R.E. Lahesmaa R. Subleski J. Cippitelli M. Kirken R.A. Young H.A. Ghosh P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1982-1987Google Scholar), and other enhancer elements. Recently, we compared gene expression profiles of IL-4- and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells obtained from STAT6+/+ and STAT6–/– mice using GeneChips analysis (18Schroder A.J. Pavlidis P. Arimura A. Capece D. Rothman P.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 996-1000Google Scholar). Statistical analysis revealed that 31 of 70 known genes were expressed at higher levels, and 39 of 70 genes were expressed at lower levels in B cells from STAT6+/+ mice in comparison with B cells from STAT6–/– mice. This suggests that STAT6 acts as a positive and negative regulator of gene expression in IL-4-mediated gene expression. Among the genes that were found to be up-regulated through a STAT6-dependent mechanism, the present study focuses on the function of p300/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) co-integrating protein (p/CIP) in transcriptional activation by STAT6. p/CIP, also called nuclear receptor co-activator-3 (NCoA-3), ACTR, or AIB1, is known to be one of the p160/SRC co-activator family members (19Torchia J.

Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Google Scholar), p/CIP may serve as a co-activator via p300/CBP protein in STAT6-dependent transcriptional activation. Here, we demonstrate that p/CIP protein expression is dramatically up-regulated by IL-4 in primary B cells at 4 h, with a peak expression at 24 h post-stimulation. Furthermore, the interaction of p/CIP with p300 bound to STAT6 can potentiate IL-4-mediated promoter transactivation, and the interference of p/CIP binding to p300 by expression of the CBP-interacting domain of p/CIP results in a strong down-regulation of IL-4-mediated gene transcription. In addition, p/CIP interaction with the IL-4-inducible immunoglobulin heavy chain I epsilon promoter is increased in IL-4-stimulated B cells. This study suggests that p/CIP functions as a co-activator for STAT6-mediated activation of gene transcription through interaction with p300/CBP in a positive feedback loop. Primary Culture of B Cells and Cell Culture—Naïve splenic B cells from BALB/c (Charles River) mice were purified to >95% purity by means of negative selection using MACS® magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc., Auburn, CA) specific for anti-CD43 antibody as described previously (30Hein K. Lorenz M.G. Siebenkotten G. Petry K. Christine R. Radbruch A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2369-2374Google Scholar). Isolated B cells were cultured at 2 × 106 cell/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acid, 50 μm 2-mercaptethanol, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. 293T human embryonic kidney epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. The murine B cell line M12.4.1 was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Plasmid Constructs—The STAT6 response element reporter construct was described previously (31Harris M.B. Chang C.C. Berton M.T. Danial N.N. Zhang J. Kuehner D. Ye B. Kvatyuk M. Pandolfi P.P. Cattoretti G. Dalla-Favera R. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7264-7275Google Scholar). pRL-TK containing Renilla luciferase was purchased from Promega. HA-tagged p300 subcloned in pCMV was kindly donated by Dr. Bing-Feng Lu (Yale University). Xpress-tagged p/CIP was constructed by PCR amplification of the p/CIP open reading frame from pCMX-p/CIP kindly provided by Dr. Michael Rosenfeld (University of California, San Diego), using primers 5′-GGCGGTACCTAGTGGACTAGGCGAAAGCTC-3′ containing KpnI at the 5′ end and 5′-GGCGATATCGTCAGCAGTATTTCTGATCGG-3′ containing EcoRI at the 5′ end. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 HisA that contains Xpress tag and confirmed by sequencing. FLAG-tagged p/CIP947–1084 was generated by PCR using primers 5′-CGGGGATCCACCATGGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAGTGTGTGCCTACCTTGCCACTTCGTTCTAATCG-3′ containing BamHI site at the 5′ end and 5′-CGGCTCGAGTCATCCCAAGGCCCTGTCGATCTCCTCC-3′ containing stop codon and XhoI site at the 5′ end. The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into pcDNA 3.1 (+) (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. To construct retroviral vectors carrying cDNA for Xpress-tagged p/CIP and FLAG-tagged p/CIP947–1084, the DNA fragments of Xpress-tagged p/CIP and FLAG-tagged p/CIP947–1084 were inserted into pMX-IRES/GFP (pMIG) upstream of an internal ribosome entry site and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transfection and Retroviral Infection—Transient transfection of 293T cells was performed by the calcium-phosphate co-precipitation method with 2.5 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish. Total DNA (20–30 μg) was adjusted with empty plasmid. For retroviral transduction of M12.4.1, ecotropic retroviruses were generated by co-transfection of 293T cells with pMIG retroviral vector carrying cDNA for Xpress-tagged p/CIP or FLAG-tagged p/CIP947–1084 along with the packaging vector pCL-Eco (26McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Google Scholar). After 2 days of culture, the supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. M12.4.1 cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/ml into 24-well plates and were incubated with virus-containing medium supernatant in the presence of polybrene for 24 h. This procedure was repeated once. Then the medium was changed to fresh culture medium for M12.4.1 cells and cultured for 2 more days before use. Antibodies—Anti-p/CIP (F-2), anti-p300 (N-15), anti-STAT6 (M-20), anti-HA-probe (Y-11), and anti-His-probe (H-15) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-FLAG M2 was from Sigma, anti-Xpress mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody was from Invitrogen, and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal mouse IgG2b antibody (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. For flow cytometry, phycoerythirin-conjugated anti-CD23 and anti-CD16/CD32 (FcIII/II receptor) antibodies (Fc block) were purchased from PharMingen. Co-immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot—For co-immunoprecipitation assay, transfected 293T cells were cultured in the presence or absence of human IL-4 during the last 24 h of culture. They were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline at 40 h posttransfection and lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. The cell extracts (1 mg) were precleared by incubation with control immunoglobulin for 1 h followed by the addition of either protein A- or protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. Cleared extracts were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h followed by the addition of 30 μl of either protein A- or protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed in cell lysis buffer four times and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by Western blot with the indicated antibodies diluted in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Tween 20) supplemented with milk powder (5%), whereas only bovine serum albumin (1%) was added for phosphotyrosine antibody. The proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For straight Western blotting, cultured splenic B cells stimulated with murine IL-4 for various durations of time and M12.4.1 cells infected with pMIG, pMIG-p/CIP, or pMIG-p/CIP947–1084 were lysed in cell lysis buffer described above. Thirty micrograms of whole cell lysate were used for SDS-PAGE, and Western blot was carried out with the indicated antibodies. Luciferase Assays—293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 in 12-well plates 24 h before transfection. For transfection, 0.1 μg of STAT6 response element reporter construct and 0.3 μg of STAT6 were used in combination with 0.1–1 μg of either Xpress-tagged p/CIP or FLAG-tagged p/CIP947–1084. Total DNA was adjusted by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). As an internal control for transfection efficiency, 10 ng of pRL containing the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega) was co-transfected. 24 h after the transfection, the transfected cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-4 for 24 h, after which cell extracts were prepared and assayed using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized based on Renilla luciferase activity (relative luciferase activity). This experiment was repeated at least four times. Flow Cytometry—Transduced M12.4.1 cells (2 × 105/ml) were stimulated with IL-4 (kindly provided by W. Paul, National Institutes of Health) for 48 h. The cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1% FBS and stained with phycoerythirin-conjugated antimouse CD23 antibody in the presence of anti-Fc receptor antibody for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1% FBS and analyzed on a FACScan instrument. The mean fluorescence intensity of CD23 expression in GFP+ cells was assessed. Fold induction of CD23 expression by IL-4 was calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity of CD23 expressed on IL-4-stimulated cells by that expressed on nonstimulated cells. This experiment was repeated three times. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed based on the protocol described by Yu et al. (32Yu J. Angelin-Duclos C. Greenwood J. Liao J. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2592-2603Google Scholar). 15 × 106/10 ml transduced M12.4.1 cells, after 4 h of IL-4 stimulation, were formaldehyde cross-linked by the addition of fixing solution (0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 27% formaldehyde) directly into the medium to achieve a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Formaldehyde was quenched with 0.125 m glycine. The cells were washed, suspended in PIPES buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, pelleted, and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were subsequently subjected to sonication to reduce DNA length to between 200 and 1,000 bp. The samples were diluted 10-fold by using dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl) and precleared by incubating with protein A beads overnight. Anti-STAT6 antibody or anti-His probe were added, and immunoprecipitation was done overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immunocomplexes were collected with protein A agarose beads and eluted after extensive washing, and the cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C. Samples were subjected to proteinase K treatment. DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol-precipitated, and used as a template for PCR (5-fold serial dilutions) using I epsilon promoter-specific primers (5′-CTAGAAAGAGGCCTCACCTG-3′ and 5′-GCCAGACTGTTCTTATTCG-3′) and proteasome-specific primers (5′-TTTGAACTGGAGCTCAGCTGG-3′ and 5′-TCCATGGTGCTAGCCATATGC-3′). The general conditions for PCR were the following: 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 5 min for 37 cycles. All PCRs were amplified in 25-μl mixtures containing 1× PCR buffer, 280 nm concentrations of each primer, 200 μm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1.5 mm MgSO4, and 1 unit of DNA platinum Taq polymerase (Sigma). PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Induction of p/CIP by IL-4 in Splenic B Cells—We have recently demonstrated by GeneChip expression analysis that, among the p160/SRC family members, only p/CIP (NCoA-3) mRNA is up-regulated by IL-4 through a STAT6-dependent mechanism in murine primary B cells (18Schroder A.J. Pavlidis P. Arimura A. Capece D. Rothman P.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 996-1000Google Scholar), whereas NCoA-1 and NCoA-2 mRNA are not up-regulated (data not shown). To determine whether IL-4 also induced p/CIP (NCoA-3) protein levels, we carried out Western blotting analysis using whole cell lysates obtained from mouse splenic B cells stimulated with IL-4. Low levels of p/CIP protein were detected in resting B cells. After IL-4 stimulation, the amount of p/CIP protein was dramatically increased at 4 h and peaked at 24 h, whereas there was little or no increase in p300 and STAT6 protein expression (Fig. 1). Interaction of p/CIP with STAT6 Depends on p300/CBP— Previous studies have shown that among the p160 co-activator family, only NCoA-1, but not NCoA-2 and NCoA-3, directly bind to STAT6 and enhance the transactivation by STAT6 (28Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Google Scholar). Because transcriptional activation by STAT6 requires interactions with p300/CBP and p/CIP can interact with p300/CBP, we hypothesized that the up-regulated p/CIP might potentiate the transcriptional activity of STAT6 through p300/CBP. To analyze whether p/CIP interacts with STAT6 via p300, the protein interaction between STAT6 and p/CIP was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 293T cells were transfected with expression vector encoding STAT6 and Xpress-tagged p/CIP with or without p300, and 24 h later the cells were stimulated with IL-4 for 24 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared, and co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out with anti-STAT6 monoclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Xpress antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, anti-STAT6 antibodies co-immunoprecipitate a small amount of p/CIP irrespective of IL-4 stimulation (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). Co-transfection with p300 strongly enhances the amount of p/CIP co-immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT6 (lanes 7 and 8). Because no significant change in the amount of p/CIP was found in whole cell lysate (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), the interaction of p/CIP to STAT6 seems to be mediated via p300. The small amounts of p/CIP co-immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT6 in 293T cells not transfected with p300 seems to be mediated by small amounts of endogenous p300 (lanes 3 and 4). No p/CIP co-immunoprecipitation was seen using control antibody instead of anti-STAT6 for immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Next, we investigated whether the CBP-binding domain of p/CIP (p/CIP947–1084) would act as a competitor for the interaction of p/CIP and p300 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 293T cells were transfected with expression vector encoding Xpress-tagged p/CIP and HA-tagged p300 along with increasing amounts of FLAG-tagged p/CIP947–1084 expression vector. Co-immunoprecipitation was reciprocally carried out with either anti-Xpress or anti-HA antibody, and the proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA or anti-Xpress antibodies, respectively. As expected, p/CIP co-immunoprecipitated with anti-p300 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–6) and vice versa. The amount of p300 that co-immunoprecipitated with anti-p/CIP (lanes 7–12) decreased dose-dependently when p/CIP947–1084 was co-transfected, although equal amounts of p300 and p/CIP were expressed (lanes 13–15). This indicates that p/CIP947–1084 can inhibit the interaction of p300 and p/CIP. Furthermore, we investigated whether p/CIP947–1084 also prevents the formation of the STAT6/p300/p/CIP complex. 293T cells were transfected with expression vector encoding Xpress-tagged p/CIP and STAT6 along with increasing amounts of FLAG-tagged p/CIP947–1084 expression vector. Co-immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-STAT6 antibody, and precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Xpress. p/CIP co-immunoprecipitated with STAT6 decreased by co-transfection with p/CIP947–1084 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–6). Similar amounts of STAT6 were precipitated in each lane, and p/CIP was expressed at similar levels in all lysates (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 7–9). This result suggests that p/CIP947–1084 prevents the formation of a STAT6/p300/p/CIP complex. Endogenous p/CIP Potentiates STAT6 Transcriptional Activity—To investigate whether the p/CIP co-activator is involved in the transcriptional regulation exerted by IL-4, 293T cells were transfected with an expression vector for STAT6 and a luciferase reporter construct containing four copies of the STAT6 response element from the Ig heavy chain ϵ promoter linked to the minimal thymidine kinase promoter together with increasing amounts of wild type p/CIP and p/CIP947–1084. When stimulated with IL-4, a dramatic increase in luciferase activity was observed. Overexpression of wild type p/CIP further increased the IL-4-dependent transactivation without affecting the basal activity. Enhancement of luciferase activity by overexpression of p/CIP upon IL-4 stimulation was only about 40% (Fig. 4A), suggesting that p/CIP is expressed at nearly saturating levels in 293T cells. In contrast, overexpression of p/CIP947–1084 markedly suppressed IL-4-stimulated reporter gene activation, suggesting that endogenous p/CIP positively regulates transcriptional activation by STAT6. Next, we investigated whether overexpression of p/CIP or p/CIP947–1084 affects the phosphorylation of STAT6. As shown in Fig. 4B, there was no significant change in the phosphorylation or expression of STAT6 in 293T cells expressing either p/CIP or p/CIP947–1084. p/CIP Enhances Surface CD23 Expression in M12.4.1 B Cells Stimulated with IL-4 —To confirm the function of p/CIP in B cells, M12.4.1 B cells were stably transduced with wild type p/CIP or p/CIP947–1084 by retroviral infection using a bicistronic vector also encoding GFP. The transduced cells were stimulated with IL-4 for 40 h, and the levels of CD23 expression in GFP+ cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Expression of p/CIP947–1084 suppressed CD23 expression, whereas overexpression of p/CIP enhanced it (Fig. 5A); the fold induction of CD23 expression by IL-4, as assessed by flow cytometry in B cells transduced with control virus was 13.1 ± 0.4 (n = 3), whereas expression of p/CIP947–1084 inhibited IL-4-induced CD23 expression (4.0-fold induction ± 0.3 or 85% inhibition, n = 3, p < 0.01), and overexpression of p/CIP enhanced it (27.0-fold induction ± 2.3 or 207% enhancement, n = 3, p < 0.01; Fig. 5B). Expression of p/CIP947–1084 or p/CIP from retrovirally transduced cDNA was confirmed by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibody and anti-Xpress antibody in infected B cells (Fig. 5C, lanes 2 and 3). Significant amounts of endogenous p/CIP (lanes 1 and 2) were also detectable. There was no change in endogenous p300 and STAT6 expression in transduced B cells. p/CIP Interacts with the Heavy Chain Germ Line Epsilon Promoter in Murine B Lymphoid Cells Stimulated with IL-4 — The interaction of p/CIP and STAT6 and the enhancement of IL-4 mediated transcription by p/CIP suggests that p/CIP may be recruited to IL-4-inducible promoters by STAT6. We characterized functional STAT6-binding sites that are present within the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain germ line ϵ (I epsilon). Transcriptional activation of this promoter is required for immunoglobulin heavy chain class switching to IgE (33Rothman P. Chen Y.Y. Lutzker S. Li S.C. Stewart V. Coffman R. Alt F.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 4: 1672-1679Google Scholar, 34Rothman P. Li S.C. Gorham B. Glimcher L. Alt F. Boothby M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5551-5561Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to determine whether there is an association of p/CIP with the I epsilon promoter. M12.4.1 B cells were stably transduced with empty vector or His-tagged wild type p/CIP by retroviral infection using a bicistronic vector also encoding GFP. The percentage of GFP positive cells was shown to be over 80% by flow cytometry (data not shown). Protein expression of immunoprecipitated His-tagged p/CIP was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-His probe (data not shown). Without IL-4 stimulation, endogenous STAT6 did not show binding to the I epsilon promoter ((Fig. 6, top right panel). After 4 h of IL-4 stimulation, an increased interaction of STAT6 with the I epsilon promoter was demonstrated. Overexpression of tagged p/CIP did not alter the interaction of STAT6 with the I epsilon promoter either before or after IL-4 stimulation. Without stimulation, immunoprecipitated His-tagged wild type p/CIP showed minimal binding to I epsilon. In contrast, after 4 h of IL-4 treatment, p/CIP showed increased binding to the I epsilon promoter. To exclude nonspecific PCR-product amplification, only input samples and none of the immunoprecipitated samples showed amplification using primers specific for the proteasome-gene (Fig. 6, second and fourth panels from the top). In a previous study, we have shown by using GeneChip expression analysis that p/CIP, but not NCoA-1 and NCoA-2, is up-regulated by IL-4 in splenic B cells through a STAT6-dependent mechanism (18Schroder A.J. Pavlidis P. Arimura A. Capece D. Rothman P.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 996-1000Google Scholar). However, the functional role of this finding remained uncertain. In the present study, we have provided new evidence suggesting that STAT6 requires p/CIP as a co-activator for transcriptional activation. The p160/steroid receptor co-activator family, NCoA-1, NCoA-2, and NCoA-3 (p/CIP), is thought to be involved in transcriptional activation by various nuclear proteins such as p53, AP-1, NF-κB, retinoic acid receptor, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6 (19Torchia J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8004-8011Google Scholar). Their co-activator activity is mainly mediated by the recruitment of other co-activators such as p300 and CBP to transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery (24Kamei Y. Xu L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Google Scholar, 29Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2722-2729Google Scholar, 38Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29291-29294Google Scholar). In one study, the authors argued that p/CIP does not seem to be required for STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation, because p/CIP is not able to directly bind to STAT6, and overexpression of p/CIP did not affect STAT6 transcriptional activation (28Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown here that p/CIP associates with STAT6 in vivo as detected by co-immunoprecipitation, and the amount of co-precipitated p/CIP is enhanced by overexpression of p300. This suggests that p/CIP indirectly associates with STAT6 via p300. Interestingly, expression of the CBP-interacting domain of p/CIP (amino acids 947–1084), which blocks the binding of p/CIP to p300, prevented the formation of a STAT6/p/CIP/p300 complex and resulted in a dramatic decrease in STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation. Also, IL-4-induced CD23 expression was markedly inhibited by expression of the CBP-interacting domain of p/CIP in M12.4.1 B cells. These results indicate that endogenous p/CIP functions as a STAT6 co-activator. In addition, overexpression of wild type p/CIP resulted in a subtle but statistically significant enhancement of STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation and also enhanced IL-4-induced CD23 expression in B cells. This is inconsistent with the previous report demonstrating that overexpression of p/CIP showed no enhancement of transcriptional activation by STAT6 (28Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Google Scholar). The precise reason for this discrepancy remains uncertain. One possibility is that endogenous p/CIP is expressed at amounts of nearly saturating to completely saturating in the various cell types used in the different studies. We found detectable but obviously not limiting amounts of endogenous p/CIP both in M12.4.1 B cells and 293T cells (data not shown). Thus, overexpression of p/CIP enhanced STAT6-mediated transcription about 40% in 293T cells and enhanced CD23 surface expression about 200% in B cells. In mouse primary splenic B cells, a small amount of p/CIP protein was detected by Western blotting analysis in primary B cells before IL-4 stimulation. This is consistent with our previous report demonstrating that p/CIP mRNA was expressed in resting B cells obtained from either STAT6+/+ or STAT6–/– mice. This suggests that p/CIP can co-activate STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation immediately after IL-4 stimulation. After IL-4 stimulation, the level of p/CIP expression increased at 4 h and peaked at 24 h, after which it decreased to prestimulation levels. In contrast, little or no increase in p300 and STAT6 protein expression or tyrosine phosphorylation was observed, further supporting a model of specific enhancement of STAT6-mediated transcription by p/CIP. Recently, STAT6 activation has been shown to be maintained in the nucleus indefinitely by continuous cycling of STAT6, i.e. phosphorylation, nuclear import, DNA binding, deactivation, nuclear export, and reactivation, under continuous IL-4 stimulation. In contrast, the half-life of phosphorylated STAT6 and STAT6 DNA binding activity was less than 1 h in the absence of IL-4 stimulation (42Andrews R.P. Erichsen M.B. Cunningham C.M. Daines M.O. Khurana Hershey G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36563-36569Google Scholar). This is consistent with the results of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, in which there was little or no binding to the I epsilon promoter without IL-4 stimulation. However, in the IL-4-stimulated samples, either with endogenous STAT6 alone or in combination with exogenous p/CIP, we saw a significant increase in binding activity to the I epsilon promoter. Because we demonstrated a strong tripartite interaction between p/CIP, STAT6, and p300 upon IL-4 stimulation, leading to enhanced STAT6-mediated luciferase activity, these findings support an important positive regulatory role of this complex in transcriptional activation leading to isotype switching. Interestingly, upon IL-4 stimulation the binding level to the I epsilon promoter of endogenous STAT6 in combination with overexpressed p/CIP did not prove to be significantly higher than endogenous STAT6 in combination with just empty vector, suggesting that p/CIP does not affect the affinity of STAT6 for this promoter. Taken together, we propose a model where p/CIP enhances STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation immediately after IL-4 receptor triggering as well as during ongoing IL-4 stimulation. Because p/CIP induction by IL-4 peaks at 24 h of stimulation and drops nearly to prestimulation levels thereafter, p/CIP may also serve to limit STAT6-mediated gene transcription to some extent. The precise mechanism by which endogenous p/CIP enhances transcriptional activation by STAT6 remains uncertain. Although NCoA-1 is considered to contribute to transcriptional activation through further recruitment of p300/CBP to STAT6 (28Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Google Scholar) and histone acetylation through its intrinsic HAT activity (43Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M. David-Allis C. Zhou J. Mizzen C. Mckenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Google Scholar), there has been no evidence that p/CIP has HAT activity or can directly associate with STAT6. Therefore, we propose a possible mechanism where p/CIP causes a conformational alteration in CBP holoprotein, resulting in modulation not only of interactions with other co-activators, such as P/CAF (CBP-associated factor) (44Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Google Scholar), that possess HAT activity or the basal transcriptional machinery such as RNA polymerase II (45Cho H.

The interaction of p/CIP with CBP may also result in modulation of the intrinsic HAT activity of p300/CBP (48Perissi V. Jeremy S.D. Kurokawa R. Wang Z. Korzus E. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3652-3657Google Scholar). This change in HAT activity would probably lead to altered luciferase activity (49Huuskonen J. Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; : 703-708Google Scholar, 50Yasuda J. Yokoo H. Yamada T. Kitabayashi I. Sekiya T. Ichikawa H. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 52-57Google Scholar). HAT activity of the CBP co-activator complex enhanced by interaction with p/CIP through p300/CBP might result in further STAT6 transcriptional activation through chromatin remodeling and thereby allow the basal transcriptional machinery at the promoter of target genes (51Wolffe A.P.

The intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in this process remain incompletely understood. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a major stress signal transducing pathway that is rapidly activated by TGF-β1 in mesangial cells. We have previously demonstrated MKK3 as the immediate upstream MAPK kinase required for selective activation of p38 MAPK isoforms, p38α and p38δ, and stimulation of pro-α1(I) collagen by TGF-β1 in murine mesangial cells. In this study, we further sought to determine MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3)-dependent TGF-β1 responses by gene expression profiling analysis utilizing mesangial cells isolated from Mkk3(-/-) mice compared with Mkk3(+/+) controls. Interestingly, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was identified as a TGF-β1-induced gene affected by deletion of Mkk3. VEGF is a well known endothelial mitogen, whose actions in nonendothelial cell types are still not well understood. We confirmed that TGF-β1 increased VEGF mRNA and protein synthesis of VEGF164 and VEGF188 isoforms in wild-type mesangial cells. However, in the Mkk3(-/-) mesangial cells, both TGF-β1-induced VEGF mRNA and VEGF164 protein expression were inhibited, whereas TGF-β1-induced VEGF188 protein expression was unaffected. Furthermore, transfection of dominant negative mutants of p38α and p38δ resulted in marked inhibition of TGF-β1-induced VEGF164 expression but not VEGF188, and treatment with recombinant mouse VEGF164 increased collagen and fibronectin mRNA expression in mesangial cells. Taken together, our findings suggest a critical role for the MKK3-p38α and p38δ MAPK pathway in mediating VEGF164 isoform-specific stimulation by TGF-β1 in mesangial cells. Further, VEGF164 stimulates collagen and fibronectin expression in mesangial cells and thus in turn enhances TGF-β1-induced extracellular matrix and may play an important role in progressive glomerular fibrosis.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TGF, transforming growth factor; MKK, MAPK kinase; ECM, extracellular matrix; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; dnm, dominant negative mutant. constitute a family of serine/threonine kinases that are central in the signaling cascades regulating a wide array of intracellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cellular responses to external stress signals (1Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). Three major subfamilies of MAPKs have been identified in mammalian cells and include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 MAPK (2Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). These protein kinases share ∼60-70% identity, but differ in the sequence and size of their activation loop, and are activated by different stimuli, and each MAPK subfamily consists of several isoforms and members, which often have distinct functions. Activation of the MAPK signaling cascade involves a series of three protein kinases consisting of a MAPK that is activated by the dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues in a TXY motif by specific upstream MAPK kinases (MKKs), which in turn are phosphorylated by MAPK kinase kinases. The TXY motif is unique to each of the MAPK subfamilies, where X is Glu, Pro, and Gly in ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, respectively (2Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). In general, ERK1 and ERK2, also known as p44 and p42 MAPKs, are prototypically activated by mitogenic stimuli and growth factors, whereas JNK and p38 MAPK are activated predominantly by environmental stresses such as osmotic changes, ultraviolet light, heat shock, and inflammation (2Pearson G.

More recent investigations including ours have revealed that p38 MAPK is also activated by a variety of cytokines including transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (6Ravanti L. Hakkinen L. Larjava H.

TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates multiple cellular functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

TGF-β1 also plays a key role in progressive diseases as a potent inducer of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein synthesis and progressive tissue fibrosis, including the kidney (12Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D. Annunziata N. Doetschman T. Nature. 1992; 359: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2653) Google Scholar, 13Kulkarni A.B.

There is now increasing body of evidence to provide support for the involvement of p38 MAPK pathway in pathological processes and implicate an important role in mediating TGF-β1 signals. For instance, activation of p38 MAPK has been demonstrated in various disease models such as inflammation, septic shock, ischemia, ischemia-reperfusion, vascular injury, and pulmonary fibrosis (15Ju H. Nerurkar S. Sauermelch C.F. Olzinski A.R. Mirabile R. Zimmerman D. Lee J.C. Adams J. Sisko J. Berova M. Willette R.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In the kidney, increased p38 MAPK activation has been demonstrated in ischemic and ischemic-reperfused rat kidneys and in glomeruli isolated from rats with experimental proliferative glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy, and administration of a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor ameliorated acute glomerulonephritis (18Yin T.

We have previously demonstrated that TGF-β1 rapidly and strongly activated p38 MAPK in cultured glomerular mesangial cells from the rat and mouse (8Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Activation of the p38 MAPK involves phosphorylation by upstream MKKs in the protein kinase cascade and includes MKK3, MKK6, and possibly MKK4 (22Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have also demonstrated MKK3 as the immediate upstream MAPK kinase required for selective activation of p38 MAPK isoforms, p38α and p38δ, and stimulation of pro-α1(I) collagen by TGF-β1 in mouse mesangial cells (9Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further sought to determine MKK3-dependent TGF-β1 responses by gene expression profiling analysis utilizing mesangial cells isolated from MKK3-null (Mkk3-/-) mice compared with wild-type (Mkk3+/+) control mice. Interestingly, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was identified as a TGF-β1-induced gene affected by the deletion of Mkk3 in mesangial cells. VEGF is a well known endothelial mitogen that plays an important role in angiogenesis, wound repair, tumorigenesis, and vascular diseases (23Yamamoto T. Kozawa O. Tanabe K. Akamatsu S. Matsuno H.

Wiedenmann B. Neuhaus P. Höcker M. Rosewicz S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1083-1092PubMed Google Scholar). However, its actions in nonendothelial cell types are still not well understood. Moreover, the molecular mechanism responsible for isoform-specific VEGF gene regulation are not known. Our data provide novel evidence that this occurs through activation of distinct intracellular signaling molecules. Here we report that the MKK3-p38α and p38δ MAPK pathway is required in mediating VEGF164 isoform-specific stimulation by TGF-β1 in mouse mesangial cells. Further, VEGF164 induces collagen and fibronectin expression in mouse mesangial cells and thus in turn enhances TGF-β1-induced ECM and may play an important role in progressive glomerular fibrosis. Reagents—Recombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). VEGF (147) rabbit polyclonal antibodies and α-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse recombinant VEGF164 was purchased from Sigma. The specific inhibitor of p38α MAPK, SB203580, was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Geneticin® (G418 sulfate) and LipofectAMINE Plus™ reagent were obtained from Invitrogen. Murine Mesangial Cell Culture—Glomerular mesangial cells were isolated and characterized as previously described, from glomeruli of MKK3-null (Mkk3-/-) mice and wild-type (Mkk3+/+) control mice and from C57BL/6 mice, using differential sieving technique with the following modifications (9Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Following collagenase digestion, the cells were plated in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 20% FBS (Bio-Whittaker), insulin (10 μg/ml), 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Using this technique, we have been successful in establishing homogeneous cultures of glomerular mesangial cells that immunostain for anti-vimentin (Dako) and anti-myosin antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc. and negative staining for cytokeratin (Roche Applied Science) and von Willebrand's factor (Dianova) as well as negative fluorescent acetylated low density lipoprotein uptake (Biomedical Technologies Inc.). Cells between 7 and 16 passages were used for the experiments. The targeted disruption of the Mkk3 gene by homologous recombination and the generation of Mkk3(-/-) mice were as previously described (9Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Once the cells were established in culture, they were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 15% FBS, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin. In experiments involving treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) or VEGF (100 ng/ml), the cells grown to subconfluence were rendered quiescent in serum-free medium for 24 h, followed by treatment with human TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) (R & D Systems) or VEGF (100 ng/ml) (Sigma). In experiments using the p38 MAPK inhibitors, the cells were preincubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of 10-30 μm SB203580, prior to treatment with or without exogenous TGF-β1. cDNA Array Analysis—Quiescent MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) and wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells were incubated in the absence or presence of exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 6 h, and total RNA was isolated by cell lysis with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNase-treated RNA (4 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA and labeled with [α-32P]dATP and then hybridized to the Atlas™ mouse 1.2 arrays containing 1176 mouse genes (Clontech). After exposure to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics), the signals were analyzed using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The relative levels of gene expression were quantified after subtraction of the background, and signal values were normalized by dividing by the mean filter hybridization signal. Three independent experiments were performed. Genes were considered differentially expressed when they exhibited a 2-fold or greater increase in the TGF-β1-treated cells compared with the untreated cells. The relative expression of housekeeping genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, β-actin, and 40 S ribosomal protein S29) served to normalize gene expression levels and did not differ by more than 10% between the Mkk3-/- and Mkk3+/+ mesangial cells. Stable Transfection of Murine Mesangial Cells—To generate clones that stably expressed p38α and p38δ dominant negative mutant (dnm), cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen) as follows. Cells grown to ∼60% confluence on 100-mm plates were incubated with 5 μg of DNA, p38α, and p38δ dnm constructs ligated in pcDNA3.1, as previously described (25Ning W. Song R. Li C. Park E. Mohsenin A. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L1094-L1102PubMed Google Scholar), in RPMI and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent complex at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Control cells were incubated with empty vector pcDNA3.1 (not containing p38α and p38δ dnm) in RPMI and Plus-LipofectAMINE™ reagent complex. After 3-4 h of incubation, the transfection media were replaced with RPMI containing 20% FBS (no antibiotics), and cells were incubated for another 24 h. To select for stable transfectants, the cells were treated with 400 μg/ml Geneticin® (G418 Sulfate) in RPMI medium containing 20% FBS, and the medium was changed every 3-4 days. G418-resistant clones emerging ∼14 days after transfection were subcloned using ring cylinders, expanded, and maintained in RPMI medium containing 15% FBS, 200 μg/ml G418, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF). The cell lysates were passed through 21-gauge needles several times and then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). 80-μg protein samples for each group were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and incubated with anti-VEGF antibodies (1:1000 dilution) overnight on a rocker at 4 °C followed by four or five washes (30 min/each) with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Signal development was carried out using LumiGLO (New England Biolabs) and exposure x-ray film. Three independent experiments were performed with essentially the same results, and representative blots are shown. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA in each group was isolated by cell lysis with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was size-fractionated (15 μg/lane) on a 1% agarose, 2% formaldehyde gel in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2). mRNA was transferred and UV cross-linked to nylon membranes (Gene Screen Plus; Dupont). The blots were prehybridized for 2 h in Church Gilbert's hybridization buffer (Quality Biological, Inc.) and hybridized overnight in same solution containing the appropriate 32P-labeled probe at 65 °C. The VEGF cDNA probe used was a 0.65-kb EcoRI insert of the human full-length VEGF cDNA cloned in pGEMT (Promega) and verified by sequencing. The human pro-α1(I)collagen, fibronectin 1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 cDNA probes used were previously described (8Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The blots were then washed two times in solution containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5% SDS, 40 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 30 min each at 65 °C, followed by 15-min washes with solution containing 1% SDS, 40 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) at 65 °C. The blots were exposed to Kodak X-AR film. Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments, and representative blots are shown. To control for the relative equivalence of RNA loading, the same blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the 18 S rRNA as previously described (9Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Identification of VEGF a TGF-β1-induced Gene Affected by the Deletion of Mkk3 in Murine Mesangial Cells—To identify genes regulated by TGF-β1 via MKK3-dependent pathway, we performed gene expression profiling analysis utilizing mesangial cells isolated from Mkk3(-/-) mice compared with Mkk3(+/+) controls. We screened a high density cDNA array (Clontech Atlas™ mouse 1.2 array) with labeled cDNA obtained from MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) and wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells incubated in the absence or presence of exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml). One gene that was observed to be consistently induced by TGF-β1 in wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells but not in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) mesangial cells was VEGF (Fig. 1). TGF-β1 Induces VEGF Gene Expression in Murine Mesangial Cells—We first sought to confirm whether TGF-β1 stimulated VEGF mRNA expression in cultured wild-type murine mesangial cells by Northern blot analyses. As shown in Fig. 2, VEGF mRNA was detected in wild-type mesangial cells by bands of ∼3.7 kb in size. Exposure to exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) resulted in increased VEGF mRNA levels as early as after 4 h of treatment in mesangial cells and up to 24 h after TGF-β1 treatment. TGF-β1 Induces VEGF164and VEGF188Isoforms in Murine Mesangial Cells—We next determined whether TGF-β1 stimulated the synthesis of VEGF protein by Western blot analyses using polyclonal VEGF. As shown in Fig. 3, two bands, ∼19-21 and 28-30 kDa in size, were observed in cultured wild-type murine mesangial cells corresponding to VEGF164 and VEGF188 isoforms, respectively. Exposure to exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) resulted in time-dependent increases in the levels of VEGF164 and VEGF188 isoforms up to 24 h after TGF-β1 treatment. Deletion of Mkk3 Inhibits TGF-β1-induced VEGF Gene Expression in Murine Mesangial Cells—To confirm that the TGF-β1 induction of VEGF is a MKK3-dependent TGF-β1 response, we examined whether TGF-β1-induced VEGF gene expression was affected by targeted disruption of the Mkk3 gene utilizing MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) and wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells incubated in the absence or presence of exogenous TGF-β1. As shown in Fig. 4, treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) resulted in increased VEGF mRNA expression within 4 h in wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells. However, in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) mesangial cells, TGF-β1-induced VEGF mRNA expression was markedly inhibited. MKK3 Is Required for Induction of VEGF164Isoform by TGF-β1 in Murine Mesangial Cells—We also examined the effects of MKK3 deficiency on TGF-β1-stimulated protein synthesis of VEGF isoforms. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) resulted in increased protein expression of VEGF isoforms VEGF164 and VEGF188 as expected in wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells. In contrast, in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) mesangial cells, TGF-β1 treatment resulted in increased expression of the VEGF188 protein but not the VEGF164 isoform. The previously observed TGF-β1 stimulated VEGF164 isoform expression in the wild-type mesangial cells was completely abrogated in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) mesangial cells. A higher concentration of exogenous TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) also failed to induce VEGF164 isoform expression in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) mesangial cells (data not shown). Dominant Negative Mutants of p38α and p38δ Inhibits Induction of VEGF164Isoform by TGF-β1 in Murine Mesangial Cells—Our previous study had demonstrated that MKK3 is the upstream MAPK kinase for the selective activation of p38α and p38δ MAPK isoforms by TGF-β1 in murine mesangial cells (9Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we further investigated whether p38α and/or p38δ were involved in mediating the TGF-β1-stimulated VEGF expression in murine mesangial cells. We employed an approach of stable transfection of dominant negative mutants of p38α or p38δ (p38α dnm and p38δ dnm) to block the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, in an isoform-specific fashion, in wild-type murine mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 6, following treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) increased protein levels of VEGF188 were observed in mesangial cells stably transfected with p38α dnm or p38δ dnm, as well as in empty vector (pcDNA3.1) transfected control cells. In contrast, TGF-β1-stimulated VEGF164 isoform observed in the empty vector (pcDNA3.1) control cells was markedly inhibited in mesangial cells stably transfected with p38α dnm or p38δ dnm. p38 MAPK Inhibitor SB 203580 Inhibits Induction of VEGF164isoform by TGF-β1 in Murine Mesangial Cells—We next utilized an alternative approach to block the p38 MAPK signaling pathway through chemical inhibition using SB203580, an inhibitor of p38α and p38β activation. As seen in Fig. 7, in wild-type murine mesangial cells, dose-dependent inhibition of the TGF-β1-stimulated VEGF164 isoform was observed after pretreatment with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Given that SB203580 specifically inhibits p38α and p38β, but the other p38 isoforms including p38δ are insensitive to inhibition by SB203580, we examined the combined effects of SB203580 and overexpression of dominant negative mutant p38δ in cultured wild-type murine mesangial cells. Fig. 8 demonstrates that pretreatment of SB203580 in mesangial cells stably transfected with p38δ dnm resulted in a more complete inhibition of VEGF164 isoform induction by TGF-β1, compared with similar pretreatment of SB203580 in empty vector (pcDNA3.1)-transfected control cells.Fig. 8Cooperative inhibition of TGF-β1-stimulated VEGF164 isoform in murine mesangial cells carrying dominant negative mutant p38δ by SB 203580. Wild-type mouse mesangial cells transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3.1) or dominant negative mutant of p38δ (p38δ dnm) were pretreated without (-) or with SB203580 (30 μm) and incubated in the absence (-) or in the presence (+) of exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 24 h. Total cell lysates were isolated and subjected to Western blot analyses using polyclonal anti-VEGF antibodies, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As loading controls, the same cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recombinant Mouse VEGF164Induces ECM Genes in Murine Mesangial Cells—It is well known that VEGF is an endothelial mitogen, but little is known about its actions in nonendothelial cell types, including glomerular mesangial cells. Here we used recombinant mouse VEGF164 to investigate its effects in murine mesangial cells. The effects of VEGF164 on the expression of ECM genes, namely collagen α1(I) and fibronectin and PAI-1, were examined by Northern analyses. As shown in Fig. 9, treatment with recombinant mouse VEGF164 (100 ng/ml) resulted in increased expression of collagen α1(I) and fibronectin mRNA in cultured wild-type murine mesangial cells. Both collagen and fibronectin are known to be potently induced by TGF-β1 in mesangial cells. Although it is known that TGF-β1 is a potent inducer of ECM synthesis and is largely regarded as a key mediator in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in this process remain incompletely understood. The MKK3-p38 MAPK is emerging as a major stress signal transducing pathway activated by TGF-β1 and implicating an important role in mediating TGF-β1 signals. Our previous studies have demonstrated that TGF-β1 rapidly and strongly activated p38 MAPK and its immediate upstream MAPK kinase, MKK3, in cultured glomerular mesangial cells, a major target cell type is a variety of renal glomerular injury (8Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol.

In the present study, gene expression profiling analysis, utilizing mesangial cells isolated from Mkk3(-/-) mice compared with Mkk3(+/+) controls, have identified VEGF as a MKK3-dependent TGF-β1 target gene in mesangial cells (Fig. 1). VEGF was initially described as a vascular permeability factor and subsequently as an endothelial mitogen (26Senger D.R. Galli S."

The correct figure is shown below: Full-Text PDF Open Access Classical cadherins are the transmembrane components of the adherens junction. E-Cadherin is found in epithelial cell junctions (E-cadherin), 1The abbreviations used are: E-cadherin, epithelial cadherin; N-cadherin, neuronal cadherin; VE-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin; R-cadherin, retinal cadherin; P-cadherin, placental cadherin; MEM, minimal essential medium; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac1 interactive binding; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DN, dominant-negative. whereas other cadherins are found in similar structures in other cell types (1Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Google Scholar, 2Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 509-514Google Scholar). Disruption of E-cadherin function through mutations in E-cadherin itself, through modifications to the E-cadherin promoter or through disruption of the cadherin/catenin complex, contributes to the aggressive behavior of epithelial-derived tumor cells (1Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory and others have shown that expression of an inappropriate cadherin in epithelial cells is another way that tumor cells can alter their adhesive function (3Hazan R.B. Kang L. Whooley B.P. Borgen P.I. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; 4: 399-411Google Scholar, 4Islam S. Carey T.E. Wolf G.T. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1643-1654Google Scholar, 5Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Google Scholar, 6Pishvaian M.J. Feltes C.M. Thompson P. Bussemakers M.J. Schalken J.A. Byers S.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 947-952Google Scholar). In some cases, this is due to down-regulation of E-cadherin upon expression of the inappropriate cadherin (4Islam S. Carey T.E. Wolf G.T. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1643-1654Google Scholar). In other cases, neuronal cadherin (N-cadherin) can have a direct and dominant influence upon the phenotype of epithelial cells, despite their continued expression of E-cadherin. For example, expression of N-cadherin by oral squamous epithelial cells results in decreased expression of the endogenous cadherins, whereas expression of N-cadherin by some breast epithelial cells has no effect upon expression of endogenous cadherins, but none the less influences cell adhesion and behavior (4Islam S. Carey T.E. Wolf G.T. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1643-1654Google Scholar, 5Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Google Scholar). Thus, exogenous expression of N-cadherin can modulate the expression of endogenous cadherins in some cell types but not in others. Interestingly, exogenous expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) in a variety of cell types does not influence the expression levels of any endogenous cadherins (7Jaggi M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2002; 9: 103-115Google Scholar). However, VE-cadherin does prevent proper junctional localization of N-cadherin, but has no influence upon the localization of other cadherins (7Jaggi M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2002; 9: 103-115Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that exogenous expression of retinal cadherin (R-cadherin) down-regulates the expression of all endogenous cadherins in every cell type examined. Thus, it is clear that cells have a mechanism for sensing cadherin expression and that different cell types respond differently when they express various cadherins. R-cadherin resembles E- and N-cadherin structurally and is ∼74% identical to N-cadherin. Shapiro and co-workers (8Shan W.S. Tanaka H. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Yoshida M. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 579-590Google Scholar) showed that R-cadherin can form both trans and cis heterodimers with N-cadherin. In addition, the expression patterns of these two cadherins overlap in some tissues (9Inuzuka H. Redies C. Takeichi M. Development. 1991; 113: 959-967Google Scholar). R-cadherin is highly expressed in the brain and plays crucial roles in the segmentation of the developing brain and in neuronal outgrowth (10Redies C. Engelhart K. Takeichi M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 333: 398-416Google Scholar). Expression of R-cadherin is necessary for the epithelial to mesenchymal transition that occurs in developing kidneys and is important in striated muscle development (11Rosenberg P. Esni F. Sjodin A. Larue L. Carlsson L. Gullberg D. Takeichi M. Kemler R. Semb H. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 55-70Google Scholar). Whether or not R-cadherin plays a role in tumorigenesis similar to that played by N-cadherin has not been investigated. However, high levels of R-cadherin mRNA have been detected in several bladder and prostate carcinoma cell lines (12Giroldi L.A. Shimazui T. Schalken J.A. Yamasaki H. Bringuier P.P. Morphologie. 2000; 84: 31-38Google Scholar, 13Bussemakers M.J. Van Bokhoven A. Tomita K. Jansen C.F. Schalken J.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 446-450Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact can activate Rac1 and/or Cdc42, depending upon the experimental system, whereas RhoA activity decreases as cells become confluent (14Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Google Scholar, 15Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Google Scholar, 16Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36962-36969Google Scholar). Nelson and co-workers (19Ehrlich J.S. Hansen M.D. Nelson W.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Google Scholar) showed that as individual cells make contact using E-cadherin, cell protrusions become focused on the area of cell-cell contact where Rac1 accumulates. Likewise, Yap and co-workers (16Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Google Scholar) plated cells on immobilized E-cadherin extracellular domain dimers to show that cadherin ligation recruits Rac1 to nascent contacts at the leading edges of cadherin-based lamellipodia. These investigators also showed that the ability to bind p120 catenin is critical to the ability of E-cadherin to rapidly activate Rac1 (20Goodwin M. Kovacs E.M. Thoreson M.A. Reynolds A.B. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20533-20539Google Scholar). Reynolds and co-workers (21Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Google Scholar) showed that cytosolic p120 catenin inhibits the activity of RhoA by acting as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. The laboratories of Burridge and co-workers (22Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Google Scholar) and Bershadsky and co-workers (23Grosheva I. Shtutman M. Elbaum M. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 695-707Google Scholar) have suggested that p120 catenin activates Vav2, which has been reported to be a guanine exchange factor for RhoA, RhoG, Cdc42, and Rac1. Rac1 and Cdc42 seem to have similar functions in E-cadherin-mediated adhesion, whereas RhoA performs a separate function (2Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 509-514Google Scholar, 24Fukata M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 887-897Google Scholar, 25Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 604-610Google Scholar, 26Braga V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 546-556Google Scholar). Gauthier-Rouviere and co-workers (27Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Google Scholar) used myogenic cells to show that RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42, was activated upon N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact. Mege and co-workers (28Lambert M. Choquet D. Mege R.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 469-479Google Scholar) used the same system to show that inhibiting Rac1 did not influence initial N-cadherin cell-cell contact, but that Rac1 was important in connecting the cadherin to the cytoskeleton. Dejana and co-workers (29Lampugnani M.G. Zanetti A. Breviario F. Balconi G. Orsenigo F. Corada M. Spagnuolo R. Betson M. Braga V. Dejana E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1175-1189Google Scholar) showed that Rac1, but not RhoA, was activated in VE-cadherin-expressing endothelial cells, and Kouklis et al. (30Kouklis P. Konstantoulaki M. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16230-16236Google Scholar) showed that non-junctional VE-cadherin induced Cdc42 activation, which led to membrane protrusions. In the present study, we show that R-cadherin expression by a variety of cell types results in increased steady-state activity levels of Rac1 and Cdc42, that activation of these GTPases correlates with increased cell motility, and that dominant-negative forms of these GTPases inhibit R-cadherin-dependent cell motility. These studies are significant because they highlight the importance of cellular context in cadherin-mediated GTPase activation and demonstrate that Rho GTPases and cadherins cooperate not only in cell adhesion but also in cell motility. Cell Culture—The human breast cancer cell line BT-20 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Hyclone Laboratories). BT-20R cells are BT-20 cells retrovirally transduced to express R-cadherin. A431 cells (ATCC), Phoenix cells (a kind gift from Dr. Albert Reynolds, Vanderbilt University), and A431Ds were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% FCS. A431 is a squamous epithelial cell line derived from a cervical cancer. A431D cells were derived in our lab by long-term treatment of A431 cells with dexamethasone. These cells have lost expression of all classical cadherins and have been described previously in more detail (31Lewis J.E. Wahl 3rd, J.K. Sass K.M. Jensen P.J. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 919-934Google Scholar). A431DR and A431DE are A431D cells retrovirally transduced to express R-cadherin or E-cadherin, respectively. The human squamous carcinoma cell line UM-SCC-1 (SCC-1; a kind gift of Dr. Thomas Carey, University of Michigan) was maintained in MEM with 10% FCS. HT1080, HACAT, SkBr3, and MCF-7 (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS. Culture medium was supplemented with 50 units/liter penicillin and 50 mg/liter streptomycin (Sigma). Where appropriate, cells that were infected with recombinant retroviruses were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Cellgro). Aggregation and Motility Assays—Aggregation assays were performed as described (32Redfield A. Nieman M.T. Knudsen K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1323-1331Google Scholar). Briefly, trypsinized cells were resuspended in 50-μl drops of medium containing 5000 cells/drop and pipetted onto the inner surface of the lid of a 100-mm Petri dish and incubated over culture medium for 24 h at 37 °C. The drops were pipetted 10 times to disrupt weak aggregates prior to photography. Transwell filter motility assays were performed as described previously (5Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Google Scholar). Constructs—PCR products utilized in any of the constructions described below were sequenced and shown to contain only the intended changes. The mouse R-cadherin cDNA (GenBank accession no. D14888) was a kind gift from Dr. Masatoshi Takeichi (33Matsunami H. Miyatani S. Inoue T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Takeichi M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106 (Pt 1): 401-409Google Scholar). Using PCR, the R-cadherin stop codon was replaced with a ClaI site, allowing insertion into a derivative of pSPUTK (34Falcone D. Andrews D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2656-2664Google Scholar) that added a C-terminal 2×myc tag. The modified cDNA was then inserted into LZRS-MS-Neo/GFP (35Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Google Scholar). Two C-terminal myc tags were added to human E-cadherin using a similar strategy, and the modified cDNA was inserted into the LZRS vector. The Cdc42/Rac1 interactive binding (CRIB) domain of p21-activated kinase 1 was amplified from total RNA of MDA-MB-435 cells. The resulting sequence was identical to the one used by Benard et al. (36Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Google Scholar). The primers PAK1.1 5′-CGTGGATCCAAGAAAGAGAAAGAGCGGCCA-3′ and PAK1.2 5′-CTAGAATTCAGCTGACTTATCTGTAAA-3′ added 5′ BamHI and 3′ EcoRI sites for insertion into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), resulting in a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CRIB fusion. The Cdc42-binding domain (CBD) of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (15Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Google Scholar) was amplified from IMAGE cDNA clone 344979 (ATCC). The primers 5′-ATATATG GATCCCTCCCAGCACCTGGACC-3′ and 5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCTCAATGAAGTCGT-3′ added 5′ BamHI and 3′ EcoRI sites for insertion into pGEX-2T, resulting in a GST-CBD fusion. The plasmid encoding the rhotekin Rho-binding domain-GST fusion consisting of amino acids 7–89 of mouse Rhotekin fused to GST was a kind gift of Dr. Richard Cerione (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) and was provided by Dr. Robert Lewis (Eppley Cancer Institute). The N-terminal GFP-tagged constructs Cdc42N17, Rac1N17, and RhoAN19 (kind gifts of Dr. Klaus Hohn, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) were subcloned into LZRS-MS-Neo. Transfection, Virus Production, and Infection—Phoenix cells (37Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19Google Scholar) were transfected using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Stratagene) with LZRS-MS-Neo/GFP (35Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Google Scholar) and selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Cells were cultured until confluent, split, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Transfected Phoenix cells were grown at 37 °C in selective medium until 50–80% confluent, at which time the medium was replaced with fresh medium without puromycin and cells were grown overnight at 32 °C. Virus-containing medium was removed, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and supplemented with polybrene (4 μg/μl, Sigma). Target cells were plated overnight at low density to ensure formation of single cells and then incubated in the virus-containing media at 32 °C for 2–6 h. Infected cells were cultured until ∼80% confluent and then either selected in 1 mg/ml G418 or sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for GFP expression. Cells infected with the empty LZRS-MS-Neo virus were used to set the background fluorescence. Cell sorting was performed by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Cell Analysis Facility. Pull-down Assays for Rac1/Cdc42—Fusion protein was prepared and coated onto beads as described (15Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Google Scholar, 36Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Google Scholar). The beads were resuspended in an equal volume of wash buffer and stored at –80 °C. Tissue culture cells were rinsed twice with cold Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and scraped in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The mixture was incubated on ice for several min, clarified by centrifugation, and used immediately. 10% of the cell lysate was used for the total protein control, whereas the remainder was incubated with beads coated with the GST-CRIB or GST-CBD fusion proteins for 45 min to 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged, washed 3× in lysis buffer, and resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). For RhoA pull-down assays, fusion protein was prepared and coated onto beads as described (39O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Tissue culture cells were treated the same as above except that the lysis buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm MgCl2. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies against human E-cadherin and mouse R-cadherin were provided by Dr. Masatoshi Takeichi. Monoclonal antibodies against human placental cadherin (P-cadherin) (6A9), α-catenin (1G5), and β-catenin (15B8) have been described (40Johnson K.R. Lewis J.E. Li D. Wahl J. Soler A.P. Knudsen K.A. Wheelock M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 252-260Google Scholar, 41Sacco P.A. McGranahan T.M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20201-20206Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody against the myc epitope (9E10) was a kind gift from Dr. Kathleen Green (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). Antibodies against Rac1, Cdc42, and p120 catenin were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratory. Secondary antibodies used for Western blot analysis were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunofluorescence, Cell Extraction, and Immunoprecipitation— Cells plated on glass coverslips for 24–48 h were fixed and stained as described (42Wahl 3rd, J.K. Kim Y.J. Cullen J.M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17269-17276Google Scholar), viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M equipped with an ORCA-ER (Hamamatsu) digital camera, and processed using OpenLab software (Improvision Inc.). Confluent cell monolayers were extracted and immunoprecipitated as described (42Wahl 3rd, J.K. Kim Y.J. Cullen J.M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17269-17276Google Scholar). The pellets were resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described (43Nieman M.T. Kim J.B. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112 (Pt 10): 1621-1632Google Scholar). Exogenous Expression of R-Cadherin Down-regulates Endogenous Cadherins—To facilitate detection of R-cadherin in transfected cells, we myc-tagged mouse R-cadherin, cloned it into the viral expression vector LZRS-MS-Neo, and produced infective virus. Biological activity of the tagged construct was confirmed by stably expressing it in A431D cells, a cadherin-negative derivative of A431 cells (31Lewis J.E. Wahl 3rd, J.K. Sass K.M. Jensen P.J. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 919-934Google Scholar). After infection, a population of cells was selected with G418 and designated A431DR. Control A431D cells infected with viral particles containing only the neomycin resistance gene were designated A431DNeo. Extracts of A431DNeo and A431DR cells were immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies against myc, α-catenin, and β-catenin (Fig. 1A). A431DNeo cells did not exhibit a myc signal at the correct size for R-cadherin-2×-myc whereas the A431DR cell extract had such a signal. We have shown previously that the transfection of a cadherin into A431D cells results in the stabilization of α- and β-catenin (43Nieman M.T. Kim J.B. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112 (Pt 10): 1621-1632Google Scholar). Thus, as expected, expression of R-cadherin in these cells resulted in increased signals for α- and β-catenin. To mediate full adhesion, classical cadherins must be attached to the cytoskeleton via catenins. Extracts from A431DNeo or A431DR cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for α-catenin (Fig. 1B) or β-catenin (data not shown). The catenins co-immunoprecipitated with R-cadherin-2×-myc, indicating that this cadherin was anchored to the actin cytoskeleton. To further show that R-cadherin-2×-myc was functional, we performed aggregation assays and immunofluorescence localization. Fig. 1C shows that A431DR cells form large aggregates, whereas A431Neo cells do not aggregate. In addition, A431DR cells show cell border staining with anti-myc antibodies (R-cadherin) and with anti-β-catenin antibodies (Fig. 1D). Together, the data presented in Fig. 1 show that R-cadherin-2×-myc is correctly processed, localized at cell borders, interacts with catenins, and mediates cell adhesion. Previous work from our laboratory (4Islam S. Carey T.E. Wolf G.T. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1643-1654Google Scholar, 5Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Google Scholar) showed that exogenous expression of N-cadherin down-regulated expression of endogenous cadherins in some cells but not in others, suggesting that N-cadherin-mediated down-regulation of endogenous cadherins was cell-type specific. To determine whether R-cadherin influenced endogenous cadherin expression, we infected a number of cell lines with recombinant retrovirus encoding R-cadherin-2×-myc. In every case, endogenous cadherins were down-regulated. Fig. 2A shows immunofluorescence localization of cadherins in control BT-20Neo cells (panels a–c) and in BT-20R cells (panels d–f). The control cells did not exhibit plasma membrane staining with the myc antibody, but the R-cadherin-expressing cells showed membrane localization with this antibody. Timed exposures of BT-20R cells and the neomycin counterparts showed that the R-cadherin-expressing cells had diminished signal for both E- and P-cadherin at cell-cell borders (compare panels d and e with panels a and b, respectively). Immunoblot analysis further showed that BT-20R cells had a decreased expression of E-cadherin and P-cadherin when compared with control BT-20Neo cells (Fig. 2B). In addition to the BT-20 cells, exogenous expression of R-cadherin-2×-myc in A431 (E- and P-cadherin), HT-1080 (N-cadherin), HACAT (E-, P-, and N-cadherin), MCF-7 (E-cadherin), or SCC-1 (E- and P-cadherin) cells resulted in reduced expression of all endogenous cadherins (data not shown). These data suggest that R-cadherin differs from N-cadherin in its ability to regulate endogenous cadherin expression. Exogenous Expression of R-Cadherin Increases Cell Motility— To examine the effect of R-cadherin expression on cell motility, 5 × 105 BT-20Neo or BT-20R cells were plated in three separate transwell inserts and incubated overnight with NIH3T3-conditioned medium in the bottom chamber as a chemoattractant. Nonmotile cells were removed from the top of the insert, and the cells on the bottom of the filter were counted. Fig. 3A shows the average number of cells per field of view from the three independent experiments. BT-20 cells expressing R-cadherin were significantly more motile than the control BT-20Neo cells. A complicating factor in this experiment was that R-cadherin expression resulted in down-regulation of E- and P-cadherin in BT-20 cells. To determine whether R-cadherin could influence cell motility independently of its ability to decrease endogenous cadherins, we investigated the influence R-cadherin had on motility in cadherin-null cells. The cadherin-null cell lines A431D and SkBr3 were infected with control neomycin resistance virus or with R-cadherin-2×-myc-expressing virus and used in motility assays. Expression of R-cadherin increased the motility of both A431D (Fig. 3B) and SkBR-3 (data not shown) cell lines. Interestingly, in the case of A431D cells, the motility rate was only two times that of the parental cell line. Because the increase in motility was roughly 4-fold higher in BT-20R cells than in BT20Neo cells, it is likely that the down-regulation of endogenous E- and P-cadherins in BT-20R contributed to the difference in motility. In any case, the experiments with A431D and SkBr3 cells showed that R-cadherin has an intrinsic ability to influence cell motility. R-Cadherin-based Motility Is Due in Part to the Activation of Rac1 and Cdc42—A separate method to measure cell motility is a wound-healing assay, in which a confluent monolayer of cells is wounded and the cells are allowed to migrate into the denuded area. Such an assay is more difficult to quantify than the assays used above, but it can provide information about how the cells move. When A431Neo cells were compared with A431R cells in a wound-healing assay, the R-cadherin-expressing cells not only migrated significantly further than the A431Neo cells but also displayed robust lamellipodia at the leading edge of the wound (Fig. 4, compare B with A). Similarly, the expression of R-cadherin in A431D cells caused these cells to display membrane protrusions (Fig. 1D), and immunofluorescence of BT-20 cells showed that E-cadherin contacts were more linear than R-cadherin contacts, which were jagged and suggestive of membrane protrusions (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence localization of R-cadherin (Fig. 4D) and E-cadherin (Fig. 4C) in A431D cells using higher magnification suggested that R-cadherin-expressing cells interact through overlapping membranous structures, whereas E-cadherin interactions produce a smoother interface. Indeed, even when we expressed R-cadherin in A431 cells, which endogenously express E- and P-cadherin, the cell borders displayed long membrane protrusions (Fig. 4F), resembling filopodia or microspikes. Experiments from other laboratories have shown a connection between cadherins and the activity of Rho GTPases (15Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Google Scholar, 16Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Google Scholar, 29Lampugnani M.G. Zanetti A. Breviario F. Balconi G.

The increased motility of R-cadherin-expressing cells, together with the increased membrane ruffling observed in these cells, led us to hypothesize that expression of R-cadherin may alter the steady-state activity levels of one or more of the Rho GTPases Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA. To assay for activated GTPases, we employed GST fused to the GTPase-binding domain of PAK1, WASP, and Rhotekin, which bind respectively to the active, GTP-bound forms of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, and we performed pull-down assays with extracts of A431D cells, A431D cells expressing E-cadherin or R-cadherin, BT-20 cells, and BT-20 cells expressing R-cadherin. The A431D cell line is a good model system because it lacks endogenous cadherin expression, allowing us to investigate the absolute influence of cadherin expression on GTPase activation. 3 × 106 cells were plated overnight, then lysed and incubated with fusion proteins conjugated to g"
https://openalex.org/W2160796771,"Inhibition of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) activity by high concentrations of extracellular Na+ is referred to as Na+ self-inhibition. We investigated the effects of external Zn2+ on whole cell Na+ currents and on the Na+ self-inhibition response in Xenopus oocytes expressing mouse αβγ ENaC. Na+ self-inhibition was examined by analyzing inward current decay from a peak current to a steady-state current following a fast switching of a low Na+ (1 mm) bath solution to a high Na+ (110 mm) solution. Our results indicate that external Zn2+ rapidly and reversibly activates ENaC in a dose-dependent manner with an estimated EC50 of 2 μm. External Zn2+ in the high Na+ bath also prevents or reverses Na+ self-inhibition with similar affinity. Zn2+ activation is dependent on extracellular Na+ concentration and is absent in ENaCs containing γH239 mutations that eliminate Na+ self-inhibition and in αS580Cβγ following covalent modification by a sulfhydryl-reactive reagent that locks the channels in a fully open state. In contrast, external Ni2+ inhibition of ENaC currents appears to be additive to Na+ self-inhibition when Ni2+ is present in the high Na+ bath. Pretreatment of oocytes with Ni2+ in a low Na+ bath also prevents the current decay following a switch to a high Na+ bath but rendered the currents below the control steady-state level measured in the absence of Ni2+ pretreatment. Our results suggest that external Zn2+ activates ENaC by relieving the channel from Na+ self-inhibition, and that external Ni2+ mimics or masks Na+ self-inhibition.

Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; mENaC, mouse ENaC; Po, open probability; WT, wild type; Ki, inhibitory constant; ECL, extracellular loop; MBS, modified Barth's saline; EARS, extracellular allosteric regulatory site; cRNA, complementary RNA; MTSET, 2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide. 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; mENaC, mouse ENaC; Po, open probability; WT, wild type; Ki, inhibitory constant; ECL, extracellular loop; MBS, modified Barth's saline; EARS, extracellular allosteric regulatory site; cRNA, complementary RNA; MTSET, 2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide. mediate Na+ transport across apical membranes of high resistance epithelia. The regulation of Na+ transport via ENaC has an important role in the maintenance of extracellular fluid volume homeostasis and the control of blood pressure in humans (1Rossier B.C. Pradervand S. Schild L. Hummler E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 877-897Google Scholar). Alterations in channel activity have been associated with several disorders, including Liddle's syndrome, pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, and cystic fibrosis (2Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Google Scholar). ENaC activity is regulated by a variety of both intracellular and extracellular factors, including selected hormones, cations, enzymes, and other channel proteins (3Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Google Scholar, 4Schafer J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2002; 283: F221-F235Google Scholar). Na+ exhibits two types of inhibitory effects on ENaC activity: self-inhibition and feedback inhibition that are due to increases in either extracellular or intracellular Na+ concentration, respectively. These regulatory phenomena have been proposed to provide a mechanism to prevent sudden or excessive increases in intracellular Na+ concentration (5Van Driessche W. Zeiske W. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 833-903Google Scholar, 6Turnheim K. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 429-445Google Scholar). Although most studies on Na+ self-inhibition have utilized native Na+-transporting tissues, including frog skin, toad urinary bladder, and kidney collecting tubule, Na+ self-inhibition has also been observed in Xenopus oocytes expressing ENaCs (7Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Google Scholar, 8Babini E. Geisler H.S. Siba M. Grunder S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28418-28426Google Scholar, 9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). Extracellular cations have been reported to affect ENaC activity in native tissues that may reflect changes in Na+ self-inhibition (3Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Google Scholar, 5Van Driessche W. Zeiske W. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 833-903Google Scholar). We and others previously reported that external Ni2+ blocks whole cell currents of αβγ ENaCs expressed in oocytes (10Segal A. Cucu D. Van Driessche W. Weber W.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 177-183Google Scholar, 11Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Google Scholar). In contrast, external Ni2+ is reported to stimulate Na+ currents in A6 cells by relieving ENaC from Na+ self-inhibition (12Cucu D. Simaels J. Van Driessche W. Zeiske W. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 194: 33-45Google Scholar). Recent work suggested that external Zn2+ is a voltage-dependent blocker of ENaC (13Amuzescu B. Segal A. Flonta M.L. Simaels J. Van Driessche W. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 69-77Google Scholar). In this report, we examined the effects of external Zn2+ on amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in oocytes expressing αβγ mouse ENaC (mENaC), and the effects of external Zn2+ and Ni2+ on Na+ self-inhibition of αβγ mENaC. We report that external Zn2+ reversibly activates ENaC by eliminating Na+ self-inhibition, whereas external Ni2+ appears to mimic Na+ self-inhibition. Site-directed Mutagenesis—All ENaC clones used in this study are mouse ENaC subunits whose cDNAs were inserted into pBluescript SK-(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (14Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-F129Google Scholar). Point mutations were generated previously by using a PCR-based method (11Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Google Scholar). ENaC Expression and Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—ENaC expression in Xenopus oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp were performed as previously reported (11Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Google Scholar). Stage V and VI oocytes free of follicle cell layers were injected with 1–4 ng of cRNA for each mENaC subunit per oocyte and incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (MBS, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca (NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.4). All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–24 °C). Oocytes were continuously clamped at -60 or -100 mV in most experiments. Current-voltage relationships were determined by clamping oocytes at holding potentials in the range of -140 to 60 mV in 20-mV increments. The responses of Na+ self-inhibition were examined as previously reported (7Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Google Scholar, 9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). A current decay from a peak current to a relatively steady-state current was considered the response for Na+ self-inhibition. The current decay was initiated by rapidly replacing a low Na+ bath solution (NaCl-1: containing 1 mm NaCl, 109 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with a high Na+ bath solution (NaCl-110: containing 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Rapid solution exchange was performed with a 6-channel Teflon valve perfusion system from Warner Instruments (Hamden, CT). At the end of an experiment, 10 μm amiloride was added to the bath to obtain the amiloride-insensitive current. Whole cell currents in the presence of 10 μm amiloride were generally less than 200 nA at -60 or -100 mV. Results from oocytes that showed unusually large amiloride-insensitive currents (>5% of total currents) were discarded to minimize current contamination from endogenous channels and membrane leak. The Na+ self-inhibition response was described with two parameters, a time constant (τ) and the ratio of the steady-state current (Iss) and the peak current (Ipeak) (see Ref. 9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). The time course of Na+ self-inhibition and the effects of Zn2+ and Ni2+ on this process were analyzed as previously described (9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). Briefly, the first 40 s of current decay (or increase) were fitted with an exponential equation by Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments Inc.). The concentration at which half-maximal effects were observed (EC50) were estimated by non-linear least square curve fitting of the dose response data with the Hill equation: (R=Cn/(Cn+EC50n)), in which R is the relative response, C is the concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient. Michaelis constants (Km) for Na+ concentration-current relationships were obtained by a best fitting of the data according to the following equation with non-linear least square curve fitting: I = Vmax · C/(C + Km), in which I is the relative Ipeak or Iss, and C refers to the Na+ concentration used to initiate self-inhibition. The apparent inhibitory constant (Ki) of Na+ self-inhibition was estimated from a best fitting of the data with the equation: (Iss/Ipeak=Kin/(Cn+Kin))in which C and n are the concentration of Na+ and Hill coefficient, respectively. Superpure NiCl2 and ZnCl2 (>99.999%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved at 1 m in water and diluted to the desired concentrations in bath solutions. The addition of NiCl2 or ZnCl2 to the bath solutions at the highest concentrations (1 mm for NiCl2 and 5 mm for ZnCl2) used in this study did not alter the pH of the solutions or form precipitates. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Significance comparisons between groups were performed using Student's t test. Curve fittings were performed with Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA) and Origin Pro 7.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). External Zn2+ Activates αβγ mENaC Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—The effect of extracellular Zn2+ on αβγ mENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes was examined by comparing amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents prior to and following the addition of ZnCl2 into the bath solution. Oocytes expressing wild type (WT) αβγ mENaC were clamped from a holding potential equaling the measured membrane potential to a series of voltages from -140 to 60 mV in 20-mV increments. Whole cell Na+ currents were recorded prior to and 60 s following the addition of varying concentrations of ZnCl2 to a bath solution containing 110 mm Na+ (NaCl-110). 100 μm ZnCl2 increased amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents by 1.66 ± 0.06-fold (Fig. 1, A–C). External Zn2+ did not alter the current-voltage relationship, indicating a lack of voltage dependence of Zn2+ activation (Fig. 1B). The Zn2+ stimulation of whole cell currents was completely reversed following washout of Zn2+, with currents returning to the original level prior to Zn2+ addition (Fig. 1, A, B, and E). The Zn2+ dose response was analyzed with increasing concentrations of ZnCl2 (10-8, 10-7, 10-6, 10-5, 10-4, 10-3, and 5 × 10-3m). Stimulatory effects on the amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents measured at -60 mV were observed in the range of 10-6 to 10-3m in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal activation at 10-4m. Currents in the presence of Zn2+ at concentrations higher than 100 μm tended to return to the basal level, and 5 mm Zn2+ did not affect whole cell currents (Fig. 1C). To exclude the possibility of an influence of a prior Zn2+ exposure on channel activity in the presence of 5 mm Zn2+, whole cell currents were measured prior to and following 5 mm Zn2+ in oocytes that had not been previously exposed to Zn2+. In agreement with results presented in Fig. 1C, the current ratio in the presence of 5 mm Zn2+, relative to current prior to Zn2+ addition, was 1.00 ± 0.06 (n = 7). The apparent affinity for Zn2+ activation of ENaC currents was estimated by analyzing dose-response data with Zn2+ concentrations varying from 10-8 to 10-4m (Fig. 1D). The EC50, Hill coefficient, and correlation coefficient from a best fitting using Hill equation were 1.99 ± 0.28 μm (n = 10), 0.87 ± 0.10 (n = 10), and 0.97 ± 0.01 (n = 10), respectively. To examine the time course of the Zn2+ effect, experiments were performed with oocytes that were continuously voltage-clamped at either -60 or -100 mV prior to and following application of external Zn2+. A typical recording is shown in Fig. 1E. The stimulatory effect was rapid with a time constant of 4.9 ± 0.4 s (n = 6). The ratio of the whole cell current in the presence of 100 μm Zn2+, relative to the current prior to Zn2+ addition, was 1.78 ± 0.09 (n = 6). The current in the presence of Zn2+ returned to basal level following washout and was blocked completely by 10 μm amiloride. Similar magnitude of stimulation of the current was observed with repetitive applications of Zn2+ without an obvious decline in its effect. Xenopus oocytes express several types of endogenous channels that may conduct Na+ (15Reifarth F.W. Clauss W. Weber W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 63-76Google Scholar, 16Wagner C.A.

To exclude the possibility that the observed increase in whole cell currents by extracellular Zn2+ was due to activation of an endogenous channel, we examined the effect of 100 μm ZnCl2 on the whole cell currents in H2O-injected oocytes. The currents measured from six oocytes at -100 mV in NaCl-110 NaCl-110 with 100 μm ZnCl2, and NaCl-110 with 10 μm amiloride were -66.7 ± 27.9, -50.0 ± 12.9, and -83.2 ± 16.7 nA (p > 0.05), respectively, suggesting that 100 μm external Zn2+ does not activate endogenous currents. Furthermore, no changes in whole cell currents were observed in oocytes expressing αβγ mENaC when 10 μm ZnCl2 was externally applied in the presence of 10 μm amiloride. The relative currents (i.e. currents normalized to values in the absence of amiloride) in the presence of amiloride alone and amiloride with Zn2+ were 1.9 ± 0.6 and 1.7 ± 0.3% (n = 6), respectively (p > 0.05). The results suggest that the stimulatory effect of external Zn2+ on currents in oocytes expressing ENaC results from activation of ENaC. These findings differ from the reported blocking effect of external Zn2+ in oocytes expressing αβγ rat ENaCs and in A6 cells that express endogenous ENaC (13Amuzescu B. Segal A. Flonta M.L. Simaels J. Van Driessche W. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 69-77Google Scholar). External Zn2+ Eliminates Na+ Self-inhibition—The stimulation of the amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents by extracellular Zn2+ may result from an increase in unitary current, open probability, or number of active channels in oocyte membranes. Because the extracellular Na+ concentration was constant and Zn2+ did not change the reversal potentials (Fig. 1B), it is unlikely that Zn2+ had a significant effect on the driving forces for generating the whole cell currents. The rapid time course of Zn2+ activation and recovery following washout of Zn2+ suggest a direct effect of Zn2+ on single channel properties rather than a change in surface channel density. Several extracellular divalent cations are known to stimulate Na+ transport in model epithelia such as frog skin and toad bladder, possibly through interfering with Na+ self-inhibition (5Van Driessche W. Zeiske W. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 833-903Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of ENaC activation by external Zn2+, we examined whether extracellular Zn2+ altered the Na+ self-inhibition response of αβγ mENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Na+ self-inhibition was studied by monitoring changes in whole cell Na+ currents measured at either -60 or -100 mV by two-electrode voltage clamp during a rapid increase in extracellular Na+ concentration. We previously reported that αβγ mENaCs exhibit a Na+ self-inhibition response that is similar to that of rat, human, and Xenopus αβγ ENaC (7Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Google Scholar, 8Babini E. Geisler H.S. Siba M. Grunder S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28418-28426Google Scholar, 9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). The effects of external Zn2+ on Na+ self-inhibition were studied with two sets of experiments. First, we examined the effect of the presence of Zn2+ in the high Na+ bath solution (NaCl-110). A typical response for Na+ self-inhibition of αβγ mENaC is shown in Fig. 2A. The current reached a maximal level (termed as Ipeak) and declined to a relatively steady level (termed as Iss) following a fast solution exchange that increased the extracellular Na+ concentration from 1 to 110 mm. The current decay reflects the Na+ self-inhibition response. After successful observation of a typical response of Na+ self-inhibition in oocytes expressing αβγ mENaC, we examined the self-inhibition response when the low Na+ solution (NaCl-1) was replaced by the NaCl-110 solution containing 100 μm ZnCl2. No current decay was observed, and the current remained at a level slightly higher than the Ipeak observed in the previous test, as shown in Fig. 2A. The Zn2+-activated currents were completely blocked by 10 μm amiloride or by reducing bath Na+ to 1 mm (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that all the currents in the presence of Zn2+ were conducted through ENaC. These results indicate that external Zn2+ at 100 μm completely prevented Na+ self-inhibition. This Zn2+ effect was also reversible, because washout of Zn2+ quickly restored the typical self-inhibition response (Fig. 2A). We also examined whether the addition of Zn2+ was able to reverse current inhibition by extracellular Na+ by adding 100 μm Zn2+ to NaCl-110 when the currents reached a steadystate level following the Na+ self-inhibition response. As seen in Fig. 2C, Zn2+ increased the current to a level near the Ipeak observed in the absence of Zn2+, and washout of Zn2+ returned the current to the inhibited level. Therefore, external Zn2+ not only prevents Na+ self-inhibition, it also reverses Na+ self-inhibition. In the second set of experiments, we examined whether pretreatment of oocytes expressing αβγ mENaC with Zn2+ affected Na+ self-inhibition. Oocytes were perfused with NaCl-1 containing 100 μm ZnCl2 and then perfused with NaCl-110 without ZnCl2. A current decay was observed with an elevated Ipeak and an unchanged Iss compared with the values in the control test (Fig. 2D). Although Zn2+ added at the same time as high concentration of Na+ was sufficient to prevent Na+ from causing the self-inhibition, Zn2+ pretreatment was unable to prevent Na+ self-inhibition (Fig. 2). To estimate the apparent affinity for Zn2+ elimination of Na+ self-inhibition, we examined Na+ self-inhibition responses in the presence of increasing concentrations of ZnCl2 in the NaCl-110 solution (Table I). A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 3A. The effect of external Zn2+ on preventing Na+ self-inhibition was dose-dependent (Fig. 3B and Table I). The estimated EC50 for Zn2+ was 1.3 μm by a best fitting of the dose-response relationship (Fig. 3B, inset). The EC50 value was almost identical to that obtained from analysis of the Zn2+ dose-response curve for activation of ENaC currents (Fig. 1D), suggesting a link between ENaC activation and loss of Na+ self-inhibition by external Zn2+.Table ICharacterizations of Na+ self-inhibition in the absence and presence of external Zn2+ or Ni2+ The time constants (τ) for Na+ self-inhibition were obtained by exponential fitting of the current decay at the clamping voltage of -60 mV following a rapid increase of bath Na+ concentrations from 1 to 110 mm. Both Ipeak and Iss are amiloride-sensitive inward Na+ currents expressed as negative values by convention and are not compared due to different batches of oocytes used in the experiments. Fitting for 100 μm Zn2+ and 1 mm Ni2+ pretreatment failed to generate a time constant due to a absence of current decay. Zn2+ and Ni2+ were added to either the NaCl-110 solution or the NaCl-1 solution (pretreatment).ExperimentOocytestIpeakIssIss/IpeaksμAControl257.4 ± 0.2-7.2 ± 0.8-4.9 ± 0.60.66 ± 0.021 μm Zn2+1312.9 ± 0.8aValues are p < 0.001 from Student's t test between control and other groups-6.4 ± 1.0-5.1 ± 0.80.81 ± 0.01aValues are p < 0.001 from Student's t test between control and other groups10 μm Zn2+1119.0 ± 2.5aValues are p < 0.001 from Student's t test between control and other groups-8.7 ± 1.1-7.9 ± 1.00.91 ± 0.02aValues are p < 0.001 from Student's t test between control and other groups100 μm Zn2+10NDbND, not determined-4.9 ± 0.8-4.7 ± 0.80.97 ± 0.02aValues are p < 0.001 from Student's t test between control and other groups100 μm Zn2+ pretreatment812.2 ± 1.0cValues are p < 0.01 from Student's t test between control and other groups-5.6 ± 0.8-2.9 ± 0.60.49 ± 0.05dValues are p < 0.05 from Student's t test between control and other groups1 mm Ni2+64.5 ± 0.5cValues are p < 0.01 from Student's t test between control and other groups-3.2 ± 0.8-1.5 ± 0.40.43 ± 0.03aValues are p < 0.001 from Student's t test between control and other groups1 mm Ni2+ pretreatment7NDbND, not determined-1.1 ± 0.4-1.1 ± 0.31.03 ± 0.05aValues are p < 0.001 from Student's t test between control and other groupsa Values are p < 0.001 from Student's t test between control and other groupsb ND, not determinedc Values are p < 0.01 from Student's t test between control and other groupsd Values are p < 0.05 from Student's t test between control and other groups Open table in a new tab The Effect of External Zn2+ on ENaC Is Dependent on the Extracellular Na+ Concentration—External Zn2+ may eliminate Na+ self-inhibition by three possible mechanisms: (i) interfering with Na+ binding to a “receptor,” (ii) preventing conformational changes induced by Na+ binding, or (iii) locking ENaC in a fully open state that is insensitive to regulation by extracellular Na+. Na+ self-inhibition is considered a low affinity event with an estimated inhibitory constant of >100 mm (7Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Google Scholar, 9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). To determine whether Zn2+ and Na+ are binding to a common site, we analyzed the changes in the Na+ concentration-current relationship by low concentrations of Zn2+. The Na+ concentration-current relationships for the peak and steady-state currents were examined in the presence of 1 and 10 μm of ZnCl2. In the presence of 1 and 10 μm Zn2+, the estimated Km values for Iss were significantly higher than the values obtained in the absence of Zn2+ (p < 0.01 or 0.001), whereas the Km values for Ipeak were not significantly different from the control value (Table II). The apparent inhibitory constants (Ki) for Na+ self-inhibition in the presence of 1 or 10 μm Zn2+ were also significantly higher than the apparent Ki in the absence of Zn2+. As shown in Fig. 4A, Zn2+ shifted the relationship between Iss/Ipeak and Na+ concentrations to the right. A complete analysis of the shift is precluded due to limitations of further increases of the extracellular Na+ concentration. These data suggest that Zn2+ and Na+ may compete for a common binding site.Table IIFitting parameters for the relationships between Na+ concentrations and peak currents (Ipeak), steady-state currents (Iss), and current ratios (Iss/Ipeak) for αβγ mENaCs The current decays were examined in the same oocytes as external Na+ was increased rapidly from 1 mm to 110, 60, 30, 10, or 3 mm.

If extracellular Na+ concentration is below the minimal concentration causing Na+ self-inhibition, Zn2+ activation should be abolished. We examined the effect of Zn2+ on ENaC currents in oocytes that were expressing αβγ mENaCs and bathed in a low Na+ concentration solution (10 mm). External Zn2+ did not significantly alter amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in oocytes that had been incubated in either regular Na+ MBS (88 mm) or low Na+ MBS (10 mm) following cRNA injections (Fig. 4B). The MBS solution with a low Na+ concentration was used to prevent Na+ loading of oocytes in the period following the injection of ENaC cRNAs and preceding the voltage clamp experiments, as Amuzescu et al. had reported Zn2+-dependent block of ENaC in oocytes that were maintained in a low Na+ concentration bath prior to functional assays (13Amuzescu B. Segal A. Flonta M.L. Simaels J. Van Driessche W. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 69-77Google Scholar). We did not observe Zn2+-dependent inhibition of ENaC currents. The effects of external Zn2+ were also examined in studies performed with the membrane voltage held at -100 mV while continuously monitoring the whole cell current. Increasing bath Na+ concentration from 1 to 10 mm led to no obvious current decay, as we previously reported (9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). The addition and washout of 10 μm Zn2+ did not significantly affect the currents following an increase of the bath Na+ concentration from 1 mm to 10 mm (Fig. 4, C and D). Mutations at γH239 That Disrupt Na+ Self-inhibition Diminish Zn2+ Activation—We recently reported that mutations of a His residue within the extracellular loop (ECL) of γ mENaC (γH239R, γH239D, and γH239C) eliminated Na+ self-inhibition (9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). If the stimulatory effect of external Zn2+ depends on the presence of Na+ self-inhibition, Zn2+ should have no effect on channels with γH239 mutations. No current decay was observed in oocytes expressing αβγH239R following a fast increase in bath Na+ concentration to 110 mm in the absence or presence of 100 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 5A). In experiments using the same protocol as in Fig. 1C for WT ENaCs, whole cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in oocytes expressing αβγH239R also remained constant in the presence of increasing concentrations of external Zn2+ (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that external Zn2+ activation of ENaC depends on the presence of Na+ self-inhibition. In contrast to the effect of γH239 mutations, we previously reported that αH282Dβγ channels show an enhanced Na+ self-inhibition response (9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). Addition of Zn2+ to the NaCl-110 solution blunted, but did not eliminate Na+ self-inhibition in oocytes expressing αH282Dβγ mENaCs (Fig. 5C). The Iss was much higher than the Iss observed in the absence of Zn2+. Addition of 100 μm ZnCl2 into high Na+ bath significantly increased the Iss following a self-inhibition response but did not fully restore the current to the Ipeak (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that external Zn2+ results in a “partial” activation of αH282Dβγ mENaCs, in contrast to a “full” activation of WT. External Zn2+ Has No Effect on ENaCs with a High Open Probability—We previously reported that αS580Cβγ channels following modification by external MTSET have a high open probability and do not exhibit Na+ self-inhibition (9Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol."
https://openalex.org/W2134906945,"Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms have been reported to be targeted to the Golgi complex via their C1 domains. We have shown recently that the regulatory domain of PKCθ induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells and that this effect is correlated to Golgi localization via the C1b domain. This study was designed to identify specific residues in the C1 domains that mediate Golgi localization. We demonstrate that the isolated C1b domains from PKCα, -δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ are targeted to the Golgi complex, whereas the corresponding C1a domains localize throughout the cell. Sequence alignment showed that amino acid residues corresponding to Glu-246 and Met-267 in PKCθ are conserved among C1b but absent from C1a domains. Mutation of Met-267, but not of Glu-246, to glycine abolished the Golgi localization of the isolated C1b domain and the regulatory domain of PKCθ. The mutated PKCθ regulatory domain constructs lacking Golgi localization were unable to induce apoptosis, suggesting a direct correlation between Golgi localization and apoptotic activity of PKCθ regulatory domain. Mutation of analogous residues in the C1b domain of PKCϵ abrogated its Golgi localization, demonstrating that this effect is not restricted to one PKC isoform. The abolished Golgi localization did not affect neurite induction by PKCϵ. However, the PKCϵ mutant did not relocate to the Golgi network in response to ceramide and ceramide did not suppress the neurite-inducing capacity of the protein. Thus, the specific mutations in the C1b domain influence both the localization and function of full-length PKCϵ.

This family of serine/threonine kinases contains at least 10 different isoforms, which can be subgrouped into classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), and atypical PKCs (ζ and ι) (1Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar). The functions of the different isoforms are believed to be largely controlled by the localization of the proteins. Activation of both classical and novel isoforms, for instance, is frequently correlated to a translocation to the plasma membrane (3Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar, 4Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Google Scholar). The Golgi apparatus is another site at which different PKC isoforms can be located. In some cases, the Golgi localization has been suggested to be crucial for the effect of the PKC isoform (5Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Google Scholar, 6Akita Y. Ohno S. Yajima Y. Konno Y. Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Chida K. Osada S. Kuroki T. Kawashima S. Suzuki K. J. Biol.

Several reports indicate that the targeting to the Golgi network is mediated by the C1 domains in the PKC molecule (5Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Google Scholar, 8Kashiwagi K. Shirai Y. Kuriyama M. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18037-18045Google Scholar, 9Schultz A. Jönsson J.I. Larsson C. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 662-675Google Scholar). C1 domains are found in many different proteins and they are generally divided in two subgroups: typical C1 domains that bind phorbol esters and atypical C1 domains that do not bind phorbol esters (10Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Google Scholar). The classical PKCs and novel PKCs have in their regulatory domains (RD) a tandem repeat of typical C1 domains C1a and C1b. A C1 domain consists of a conserved amino acid sequence of about 50 residues, with six cysteine and two histidine residues that co-ordinate two Zn2+ ions per C1 domain (11Hubbard S.R. Bishop W.R. Kirschmeier P. George S.J. Cramer S.P. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1776-1779Google Scholar, 12Quest A.F. Bloomenthal J. Bardes E.S. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10193-10197Google Scholar). At the tip of typical C1 domains, there is a hydrophilic ligand-binding cleft that is surrounded by hydrophobic residues. Binding of diacylglycerol or phorbol esters caps the hydrophilic cleft and generates a continuously hydrophobic surface, which enables the C1 domain to penetrate membranes (13Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Google Scholar). Several studies have investigated the relative importance of residues within C1 domains for structural maintenance and ligand interaction (14Wang Q.J. Fang T.W. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Wang S. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19580-19587Google Scholar, 15Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Google Scholar, 16Wang S.

Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11590-11594Google Scholar). The Zn2+-coordinating residues are essential for the integrity of the tertiary structure, and the loops of amino acids 6–12 and 20–27 in PKCδ C1b domain have been characterized as essential for phorbol ester binding (15Kazanietz M.G.

Chem. 1996; 39: 2541-2553Google Scholar). In addition to PKC, typical C1 domains have also been found in proteins such as chimaerins, RasGRP1, protein kinase D, and Munc-13 (4Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Google Scholar, 10Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Google Scholar, 17Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M.

Several C1 domain-containing proteins have been shown to be targeted to the Golgi complex, and this is dependent on their C1 domains. Thus, the C1a domain of protein kinase D (20Maeda Y. Beznoussenko G.V. Van Lint J. Mironov A.A. Malhotra V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5982-5990Google Scholar), the C1b domains of PKCθ (9Schultz A. Jönsson J.I. Larsson C. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 662-675Google Scholar, 21Carrasco S. Merida I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; Google Scholar) and PKCϵ (8Kashiwagi K. Shirai Y. Kuriyama M. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18037-18045Google Scholar), and the C1 domain of β2-chimaerin (22Caloca M.J. Wang H. Delemos A. Wang S. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18303-18312Google Scholar) all mediate Golgi localization. For several of these proteins, targeting to the Golgi network has been suggested to be important for the function of the protein. For instance, RasGRP1 translocates to the Golgi apparatus and activates Ras at this site (23Bivona T.G. Perez De Castro I. Ahearn I.M. Grana T.M. Chiu V.K. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Pellicer A. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nature. 2003; 424: 694-698Google Scholar). Protein kinase D regulates the fission of transport carriers destined for the cell surface (24Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V. Cell. 2001; 104: 409-420Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKCϵ modulates secretion from the Golgi complex (5Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Google Scholar, 6Akita Y. Ohno S. Yajima Y. Konno Y. Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Chida K. Osada S. Kuroki T. Kawashima S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4653-4660Google Scholar), whereas PKCβ has been implicated to be involved in the regulation of coat assembly on Golgi membranes (7De Matteis M.A. Santini G. Kahn R.A. Di Tullio G. Luini A. Nature. 1993; 364: 818-821Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the RD of PKCθ induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells and this effect is correlated to a Golgi localization via the C1b domain (9Schultz A. Jönsson J.I. Larsson C. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 662-675Google Scholar). The tendency of many C1 domains to localize to the Golgi led us to hypothesize that these domains have residues in common that mediate a specific interaction with structures in the Golgi network. Our aim was to identify such residues. This study shows that mutation of Met-267 in the PKCθ C1b domain or Asp-257 and Met-278 in the PKCϵ C1b domain abolishes their Golgi localization. The mutations also inhibit the Golgi localization and apoptosis-inducing capacity of PKCθRD and suppress the responsiveness of full-length PKCϵ to ceramide. Plasmids—Plasmids encoding PKCθRD and PKCϵFL (25Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Google Scholar), the C1ab regions of PKCα and -ϵ (26Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 901-912Google Scholar), and the C1a, C1b, and C1ab domains of PKCθ (9Schultz A. Jönsson J.I. Larsson C. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 662-675Google Scholar) fused to EGFP have been described. cDNA encoding the C1a and C1b domains of PKCα, -δ, -ϵ, and -η and the C1ab regions of PKCδ and -η were generated by PCR using plasmids encoding the full-length PKC isoforms as template. The PCR reactions were performed with Pfu polymerase (Promega) to minimize introduction of mutations. Restriction enzyme sites were introduced in the primers (Table I) enabling the ligation of the PCR product in the EGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). cDNA encoding the PKCθ mutants E246G, M267G, and the double mutant E246G/M267G and the PKCϵ mutants D257G, M278G, and the double mutant D257G/M278G were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the supplier's protocol, using plasmids encoding PKCθ-EGFP and PKCϵ-EGFP as templates. Table I lists the primers used to generate the PKCθ and PKCϵ mutant fragments. To create myc-tag fusions of the PKCθC1b domain, PKCθC1b and PKCθC1b-M267G cDNA were cut out from the pEGFP-N1 vector by digestion with SalI and BglII and ligated into pcDNA4/myc-His vector (Invitrogen). All PKC cDNAs were sequenced to ensure that only the desired mutations were introduced in the mutagenesis reactions.Table IPrimers used to generate PKC constructsConstructPrimersPKCδC1aForwardGCGAGATCTGGACCATGTACATCAAGAACCATGAGTTTReverseCGCGTCGACATGTCGATGTTGAAGCGTTCTTTPKCδC1bForwardGCGAGATCTGGACCATGATCGACATGCCGCACCGCTTCReverseCGCGTCGACCGGGAGGCTCTCTGGGTGACPKCηC1aForwardGCGAGATCTGGACCATGCAGATCAATGGACACAAGTTCReverseCGCGTCGACTTGATCCCGAACCTCTGTTCTPKCηC1bForwardGCGAGATCTGGACCATGAACATCCCACACAAGTTCAGCReverseCGCGTCGACATATTTCCGGGTTGGAGACCCPKCθ-E246GForwardCCGACCTTCTGTGGACACTGTGGGACCPKCθ-M267GForwardGATGCATGTGGCGGGAATGTGCATCATAGATGCPKCϵD257GForwardGGTCCCTACCTTCTGCGGTCACTGTGGGTCCCTGCPKCϵ-M278GForwardGCAGTGTAAAGTCTGCAAAGGGAATGTTCACCGTCGATGTG Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Transfections—Human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection experiments, cells were trypsinized and seeded at a density of 150,000 cells per 35-mm cell culture dish on glass cover slips in medium containing serum and antibiotics. Transfections were initiated 24 h after seeding. Before transfection, cells were washed with serum-free medium. Cells were transfected using 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and 1.6 μg of DNA essentially according to the supplier's protocol. When indicated, cells were treated with 16 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma) or 50 μm C2-ceramide (Sigma). Ethanol or Me2SO was added to the control at the appropriate final concentration. Analysis of Apoptosis—Sixteen hours after transfection, neuroblastoma cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate in PBS for 2 min on ice. Cells were washed in PBS and then incubated with reaction mixture from in situ cell death detection kit TMR (Roche) at 37 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were washed in PBS and mounted on microscopy slides using 9.6% polyvinyl alcohol, 24% glycerol, and 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo (2.2.2) octane in 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. 200 transfected cells, visualized by the fluorescence of EGFP, were counted per experiment, and the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was determined. Cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy using standard fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC filters. Morphology Studies—Sixteen hours after end of transfections, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 min, washed in PBS, and mounted on microscopy slides using polyvinyl alcohol-diazabicyclo octane. 200 transfected cells per experiment, visualized by the fluorescence of EGFP, were counted. The transfected cells were considered to have neurites if the length of the process exceeded that of two cell bodies. Confocal Microscopy—SK-N-BE(2)C cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 min, permeabilized, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS for 30 min. Syntaxin 6 was detected with primary monoclonal mouse antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories) diluted 1:25 in TBS followed by the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat-anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:400 in TBS. Myc-tagged PKC constructs were detected with primary monoclonal anti-c-myc antibodies (Calbiochem) diluted 1:50 in TBS followed by the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat-anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:400 in TBS. Both incubations were 1 h in length. Extensive washing was done between all steps and the cover slips were mounted on object slides. The cells were examined using a 60× objective (numerical aperture, 1.4) and a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal system with excitation wavelengths at 488 nm (EGFP and Alexa Fluor 488) and 543 nm (Alexa Fluor 546) and emission filters 515HQ30 (EGFP and Alexa Fluor 488) and 600LP (Alexa Fluor 546). Live Confocal Experiments—Live SK-N-BE(2)C cells were examined by confocal microscopy on the day after transfection. The cover slips were washed twice with buffer H (20 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 3.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.6 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and mounted on the heated stage of a Nikon microscope. To study the translocation of PKCθC1b-EGFP constructs, 1 μm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (Sigma) was added to the buffer and the localization of PKC-EGFP was followed for 2 min. The cells were examined as described for fixed cells. Western Blot—Cell lysates, SDS-PAGE, blotting, and detection were done as described previously (9Schultz A. Jönsson J.I. Larsson C. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 662-675Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies toward EGFP (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:250 or actin (ICN Biomedicals) diluted 1:1000. PKC C1 Domains Localize to the Golgi Complex—It has previously been demonstrated that overexpressed C1 domains of PKCϵ (5Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Google Scholar, 8Kashiwagi K. Shirai Y. Kuriyama M. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18037-18045Google Scholar) and PKCθ (9Schultz A. Jönsson J.I. Larsson C. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 662-675Google Scholar) are enriched in the Golgi complex. To identify a putative specific motif that targets C1 domains to the Golgi network, we first compared the localization of C1 domains from several PKC isoforms. SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells were therefore transfected with plasmids encoding the two C1 domains of PKCα, -δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ fused to EGFP. The cells were fixed and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) was visualized by immunofluorescence toward the TGN marker (27Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Google Scholar) syntaxin 6 (Fig. 1). Examination of the cells with confocal microscopy confirmed the previous observations that both PKCϵC1 (5Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Google Scholar) and PKCθC1 (9Schultz A. Jönsson J.I. Larsson C. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 662-675Google Scholar, 21Carrasco S. Merida I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; Google Scholar) almost exclusively localize to the TGN. Furthermore, the C1 domains of PKCα, -δ, and -η localized to the TGN as well. All PKC C1 domains responded to TPA with an increased localization at the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that the localization of PKC C1 domains to the Golgi complex is not isoform-specific and a Golgi-targeting motif is likely to be conserved among these isoforms. The C1b Domains of PKCs Are Important for Golgi Localization—Because no differences in localization pattern could be detected between the tandem C1 domains of the different isoforms, our next approach was to compare the localization of the individual C1a and C1b domains. SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with vectors encoding the isolated C1a and C1b domains of PKCα, -δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ fused to EGFP. Transfected cells were fixed, and the TGN was visualized by staining with antibodies toward syntaxin 6 (Fig. 2). Analysis with confocal microscopy revealed that the PKC C1a fusion proteins generally localized throughout the cell, and there was no detectable localization to the Golgi complex. In contrast, PKCδC1b, PKCϵC1b, and PKCηC1b all showed a distinct co-localization with the TGN marker, and these fusion proteins were not found in the nuclear matrix. PKCαC1b and PKCθC1b both localized throughout the cell, but there was an enrichment of the fusion proteins in the TGN. Cells expressing the PKC C1a and C1b domains were also treated with TPA, and the localization of the fusion proteins was examined with confocal microscopy. The C1a domains of PKCα, -ϵ, and -η were translocated from the nuclear matrix, whereas neither PKCδC1a nor PKCθC1a responded to TPA. PKCαC1b and PKCθC1b were translocated from the nuclear matrix after TPA treatment. PKCδC1b, PKCϵC1b, and PKCηC1b lost their distinct Golgi localization and distributed to other cytoplasmic structures as well after treatment with TPA. There was also a tendency to increased localization to the nuclear and plasma membrane of some C1b domains. These results indicate that a Golgi localization motif in PKC mainly resides in the C1b domain. Such a motif is conceivably common for all the investigated C1b domains but not present in the C1a domains. Sequence Alignment of PKC C1 Domains—The differential localization pattern of the C1a and C1b domains led us to search for divergences between the domains. We aligned the protein sequences of the C1a and C1b domains of PKCα, -δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ (NCBI protein database accession numbers CAA36718, AAA03175, CAA46388, NP_006246, and AAA60101, respectively) and looked for residues that are conserved only among the C1b domains (Fig. 3A). We also took into consideration the published crystal structure of the PKCδ C1b domain (PDB code 1PTQ) (Fig. 3B) (13Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Google Scholar). One residue, Met-266 in PKCδ, which is conserved only among the C1b domains, caught our attention as an interesting candidate. Met-266 is located outside the hydrophobic part of the domain that is presumably inserted in the membrane and has its side chain exposed on the protein surface. In this context, it is interesting that conservation of methionine on the protein surface has been suggested to imply a putative protein binding site (28Ma B. Elkayam T. Wolfson H. Nussinov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5772-5777Google Scholar). We also noted that the side chain of Asp-245, which is also conserved only among the C1b domains, is near Met-266. Therefore, we decided to explore whether these amino acid residues are important for the localization of C1b domains to the Golgi complex. Mutation of Glu-246 and Met-267 in PKCθC1b—Our previous results have indicated a correlation between localization to the Golgi and induction of apoptosis by the isolated RD of PKCθ (9Schultz A. Jönsson J.I. Larsson C. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 662-675Google Scholar). We therefore focused on the C1b domain of PKCθ and altered the residues in the domain (Glu-246 and Met-267) corresponding to PKCδ Asp-245 and Met-266 with site-directed mutagenesis. Three mutated variants of θC1b-EGFP were created in which Glu-246, Met-267, or both residues were replaced by glycine (denoted θC1b-E246G, θC1b-M267G, and θC1b-DM, respectively). These vectors and a vector encoding the wild-type θC1b domain fused to EGFP (θC1b-wt) were transfected into SK-N-BE(2)C cells and expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). To confirm that the mutations do not lead to a disruption of the overall conformation of the C1b domains, we investigated whether TPA could alter the subcellular localization of the EGFP-fused C1b mutants (Fig. 4A). As previously seen, θC1b-wt localized throughout the cell but was clearly enriched in perinuclear structures. TPA treatment influenced the localization as seen by the clearance of nuclear fusion proteins. The same pattern was observed for the θC1b-E246G mutant. In contrast, θC1b-M267G and θC1b-DM were evenly distributed throughout the cells with no perinuclear enrichment. Treatment with TPA translocated the fusion proteins from the nuclear matrix to the cytoplasm and gave rise to a minor perinuclear enrichment. The phorbol ester responsiveness of the θC1b domains was further confirmed in a live confocal experiment. SK-N-BE(2)C cells expressing θC1b-wt, θC1b-M267G, or θC1b-DM were treated with 1 μm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and the localization of the fusion proteins was followed. In untreated cells, θC1b-wt, θC1b-M267G, and θC1b-DM were all distributed throughout the cells, with a perinuclear enrichment in the case of θC1b-wt (Fig. 4C). After treatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate for 2 min, the fusion proteins translocated to the nuclear membrane. The fact that all fusion proteins were sensitive to phorbol esters indicates that they are properly folded. To exclude the possibility that the localization of the θC1b domains to the Golgi network is influenced by EGFP, cells were transfected with constructs encoding wild-type θC1b and the corresponding M267G mutant, both fused to a myc tag. The fusion proteins were visualized by immunofluorescence toward myc, and their localization was examined with confocal microscopy. This experiment demonstrated that wild-type θC1b was enriched in the perinuclear region, whereas θC1b M267G resided mainly in the nucleus (Fig. 4D). Met-267 Is Necessary for Localization of PKCθC1b to the Golgi Complex—The previous experiments indicated an altered localization of the θC1b-M267G and θC1b-DM mutants compared with the wild-type protein. To characterize the differences in localization between θC1b-wt and θC1b-E246G on one hand and θC1b-M267G and θC1b-DM on the other hand, transfected and fixed SK-N-BE(2)C cells were stained with antibodies toward syntaxin 6. Co-localization of the fusion proteins with the TGN marker was then analyzed with confocal microscopy. This experiment showed a clear enrichment of θC1b-wt and θC1b-E246G in syntaxin 6-positive structures, whereas only small amounts of θC1b-M267G and θC1b-DM were present in the TGN (Fig. 5). Thus, Met-267 seems to be crucial for proper Golgi localization of the θC1b domain. To establish whether mutation of Met-267 also abolishes the Golgi localization of the entire θRD, we made three new constructs encoding θRD fused to EGFP, in which Glu-246, Met-267, or both residues were replaced by glycine (denoted θRD-E246G, θRD-M267G, and θRD-DM, respectively). SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with these vectors or a vector encoding the wild-type θRD (θRD-wt), and fixed cells were subjected to staining with antibodies toward syntaxin 6. This experiment demonstrated that both θRD-wt and θRD-E246G almost exclusively localized to syntaxin 6-positive structures (Fig. 5). However, θRD-M267G and θRD-DM were primarily targeted to the nucleus and localized to the TGN only to a minute extent. Taken together, these results further demonstrate that the localization of PKCθRD to the Golgi complex mainly is mediated by the C1b domain and points out Met-267 as an important residue for this interaction. Mutation of Met-267 Abolishes the Apoptotic Effect of PKCθRD—We next sought to determine whether the abrogated Golgi localization caused by mutation of Met-267 is correlated to a diminished apoptotic activity of θRD. SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with vectors encoding θRD-wt, θRD-E246G, θRD-M267G, θRD-DM, or empty EGFP vector (EGFP). After transfection, cells were fixed and scored for apoptosis using a TUNEL assay. As seen before, expression of θRD-wt caused a significantly higher rate of apoptosis compared with cells expressing EGFP alone (Fig. 6A). A similar effect was obtained by the θRD-E246G variant. However, expression of neither θRD-M267G nor θRD-DM led to an altered rate of apoptosis compared with control cells. The apoptotic effects of θRD-wt and θRD-M267G was further analyzed in the presence of TPA. This experiment revealed that although TPA causes an increased rate of apoptosis in cells expressing θRD-M267G, the percentage of apoptotic cells is significantly lower than for TPA-treated cells expressing θRD-wt (Fig. 6B). To exclude that the apoptotic effects of θRD-wt and θRD-E246G, compared with the θRD-M237G mutant, were caused by higher expression levels, SK-N-BE(2)C cells were also transfected with half or a quarter of the amount of these vectors. Analysis of the protein expression by Western blotting demonstrates that transfection with a smaller amount of vector reduces the amount of expressed protein (Fig. 6A). Although a lower expression level of the fusion protein correlates with a slightly lower rate of apoptosis, θRD-wt still induced a significantly higher rate of apoptosis than θRD-M267G or θRD-DM. θRD-E246G also maintained apoptotic activity at lower expression levels. To confirm that the mutations do not impede the capacity of θRD to respond to phorbol esters and thus that the general characteristics of the C1 domains are maintained, we examined whether the θRD mutants translocate after TPA treatment. θRD-wt primarily localizes to the perinuclear region in untreated cells, and TPA treatment does not alter this localization (Fig. 6C). A similar pattern is observed for θRD-E246G. However, θRD-M267G and θRD-DM, which both primarily localize to the nucleus before TPA treatment, are translocated to the plasma membrane and to punctuate cytoplasmic structures after addition of TPA. In some cells, these structures are slightly enriched in a perinuclear region. Because the mutated θRD fusion proteins were able to respond to TPA treatment, the protein conformation is probably maintained. The fact that the two PKCθRD constructs lacking Golgi localization (i.e. θRD-M267G and θRD-DM) were unable to induce apoptosis implies that Golgi localization is important for the apoptotic activity of PKCθRD. Analogous Mutations of PKCϵC1 Alter the Localization but Not the Neurite-inducing Capacity of the Protein—The finding that mutation of Met-267, and Glu-246/Met-267 in combination, abrogates the Golgi localization of both the RD and the isolated C1b domain of PKCθ, raised the question of whether this effect is isoform-specific. To test this, mutated variants of PKCϵC1ab-EGFP"
https://openalex.org/W2095047901,"The cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) from Escherichia coli activates members of the Rho family by deamidation of glutamine 61/63. Because this amino acid is crucial for GTP hydrolysis, deamidation of glutamine 61/63 results in constitutively active Rho proteins. Recently, it was shown that the level of CNF1-activated Rac is rapidly diminished in CNF1-treated cells by proteolytic degradation. Here, we studied the requirements for CNF1-induced Rac degradation. By overexpressing His-tagged activated Rac mutants we show that constitutive activation is necessary for degradation of Rac. However, permanent activation is not sufficient for degradation, because Rac that is constitutively activated by transamidation at glutamine 61 by the Bordetella dermonecrotic toxin is not degraded. Overexpression of His-tagged Rac mutants deficient in interaction with GTPase-activating protein (Rac(N92D) and Rac(Y64H)) and guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rac(H103E)) were degraded after activation by CNF1, whereas Rac(Y40C), which is not able to interact with CRIB domain effectors or plenty of SH3, was not degraded. Isoprenylation and the presence of a putative mitotic destruction box are essential for CNF-induced degradation. In contrast to Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3 were not degraded following constitutive activation by CNF1. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we defined the polybasic region and amino acids 90, 107, 147, and 151 as responsible for isotype-specific degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2000123189,"Human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) belongs to a superfamily of organic anion transporters, which play critical roles in the body disposition of clinically important drugs, including anti-human immunodeficiency virus therapeutics, anti-tumor drugs, antibiotics, anti-hypertensives, and anti-inflammatories. Previously we suggested that the predicted transmembrane domain 1 (TM1) of hOAT1 might be important for its function. In the present study, we examined the role of each residue within TM1 of hOAT1 in substrate recognition and transport. Alanine scanning was used to construct mutants of hOAT1, and the uptake of model substrate para-aminohippurate was studied in COS-7 cells expressing the mutant transporters. This approach led to the discovery of two critical amino acid residues, Leu-30 and Thr-36. A substitution of Leu-30 or Thr-36 with alanine resulted in a complete loss of transport activities. We then further characterized Leu-30 and Thr-36 by mutagenizing these residues to amino acids with different physicochemical properties. Leu-30 was replaced with amino acids with varying sizes of side chains, including glycine, valine, and isoleucine. We showed that progressively smaller side chains at position 30 increasingly impaired hOAT1 function mainly because of the impaired surface expression of the transporter. Thr-36, another critical amino acid in TM1, was replaced by serine and cysteine. Similar to the substitution of Thr-36 by alanine, substitution by serine and cysteine at this position abolished transport activity without affecting the surface expression of the transporter. The fact that Thr-36 cannot be substituted with serine and that the side chains of alanine, serine, and cysteine are smaller than that of threonine by a methyl group indicate that both the methyl group and the hydroxyl group of Thr-36 could be critical for hOAT1 activity. Together we conclude that Leu-30 and Thr-36 play distinct roles in hOAT1 function. Leu-30 is important in targeting the transporter to the plasma membrane. In contrast, Thr-36 is critical for substrate recognition. The present study provided the first molecular evidence that transmembrane domain 1 is a critical determinant of hOAT1 function and may provide important insights into the structure-function relationships of the organic anion transporter family.

Organic anion transporters (OAT) 1The abbreviations used are: OAT, organic anion transporter; mOAT, mouse OAT; hOAT, human OAT; TM1, transmembrane domain 1; PAH, [14C]p-aminohippuric acid; NHS-SS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. play essential roles in the body disposition of clinically important anionic drugs including anti-human immunodeficiency virus therapeutics, anti-tumor drugs, antibiotics, anti-hypertensives, and anti-inflammatories (1You G. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 602-616Google Scholar). Several OAT isoforms have been cloned by us and others (2You G. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 55-62Google Scholar). OAT1 and OAT3 are predominantly expressed in the kidney and the brain. In the kidney, these transporters utilize a tertiary transport mechanism to move organic anions across the basolateral membrane into the proximal tubule cells for subsequent exit/elimination across the apical membrane into the urine. Through this tertiary transport mechanism, Na+K+-ATPase maintains an inwardly directed (blood-to-cell) Na+ gradient. The Na+ gradient then drives a sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter, sustaining an outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient that is utilized by a dicarboxylate/organic anion exchanger to move the organic anion substrate into the cell. This cascade of events indirectly links organic anion transport to metabolic energy and the Na+ gradient, allowing the entry of a negatively charged substrate against both its chemical concentration gradient and the electrical potential of the cell. OAT4 is present mainly in the placenta and the kidney. In the kidney, OAT4 functions as an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger at the apical membrane of the proximal tubule and is responsible for the reabsorption of organic anions driven by an outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient (3Ekaratanawong S. Anzai N. Jutabha P. Miyazaki H. Noshiro R. Takeda M. Kanai Y. Sophasan S. Endou H. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 94: 297-304Google Scholar). OAT2 is predominantly expressed in the liver (1You G. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 602-616Google Scholar). The transport mechanism for OAT2 remains to be elucidated. Computer modeling based on hydropathy analysis predicted that these proteins have 12 putative membrane-spanning domains and multiple consensus sites for glycosylation and phosphorylation (1You G. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 602-616Google Scholar, 2You G. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 55-62Google Scholar). In a previous study (4Tanaka K. Xu W. Zhou F. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14961-14966Google Scholar) on the role of glycosylation in OAT1 function, our laboratory investigated the effect of disrupting the putative glycosylation sites in a mouse organic anion transporter (mOAT1) as well as its human counterpart hOAT1 by mutating asparagine (N) to glutamine (Q) and assessing the mutant transporters in HeLa cells. One of the key findings from that study is that the putative glycosylation site Asn-39 in mOAT1 was not glycosylated, but the corresponding site (Asn-39) in hOAT1 was glycosylated. Disrupting Asn-39 resulted in a complete loss of transport activity in both mOAT1 and hOAT1 without affecting their cell surface expression, suggesting that the loss of function is not because of deglycosylation of Asn-39 per se but rather is likely because of the change of this important amino acid critically involved in the substrate binding. Because Asn-39 in mOAT1 is located in the same position as Asn-39 in hOAT1, two amino acid residues from the mouth of the transmembrane domain 1 (TM1), we therefore hypothesize that TM1 may be critical for hOAT1 function. In the present study, we investigated the importance of TM1 in hOAT1. We identified two critical amino acid residues Leu-30 and Thr-36, which play distinct roles in hOAT1 function. Materials—[14C]p-Aminohippuric acid (PAH) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (NHS-SS-biotin) and streptavidin-agarose beads were purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant transporters were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using hOAT1-myc as a template. hOAT1-myc contains a 10-amino acid c-myc tag at the C terminus of hOAT1. Previous studies from our laboratory (4Tanaka K. Xu W. Zhou F. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14961-14966Google Scholar) showed that the myc-tagged protein retained the functional properties of the native (unmodified) structure. The mutant sequences were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method. Expression in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent cells were transfected with DNA plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the established protocol (5Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Acheson M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18752-18758Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated for 14–20 h at 37 °C and then used for transport assay and cell surface biotinylation. Transport Measurements—For each well, uptake solution was added. The uptake solution consisted of phosphate-buffered saline/CM (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3) and [14C]PAH. At the times indicated in the figure legends, the uptake was stopped by aspirating the uptake solution off and rapidly washing the well with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution. The cells were then solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH, neutralized in 0.2 n HCl, and aliquotted for liquid scintillation counting. The uptake count was standardized by the amount of protein in each well. Values were mean ± S.E. (n = 3). Isolation of Plasma Membrane Proteins by Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface expression levels of hOAT1 and their mutants were examined using the membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent, NHS-SS-biotin. The transporters were expressed in COS-7 cells in 6-well plates using LipofectAMINE 2000 as described above. After 20 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/CM (pH 8.0). The plates were kept on ice, and all solutions were ice-cold for the rest of the procedure. Each well of cells was incubated with 1 ml of NHS-SS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline/CM) in two successive 20-min incubations on ice with very gentle shaking. The reagent was freshly prepared for each incubation. After biotinylation, each well was briefly rinsed with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/CM containing 100 mm glycine and then incubated on ice with the same solution for 20 min, to ensure complete quenching of the unreacted NHS-SS-biotin. The cells were then dissolved on ice for 1 h in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml, leupeptin, 3 μg/ml, pH 7.4). The unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads was then added to the supernatant to isolate cell membrane protein. hOAT1 was detected in the pool of surface proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using an anti-myc antibody. Alanine Scanning of Residues in TM1—The proposed transmembrane domain 1 consists of 22 amino acid residues from Phe-16 to Leu-37. To probe the contribution of each residue to hOAT1 function, we systematically mutated each residue to alanine except for the pre-existing alanine at position 32, which was replaced by valine. The functional properties of these mutants were then determined by measuring the uptake of [14C]PAH in mutant-transfected COS-7 cells. A summary of data obtained from this analysis is shown in Table I. Although most of the mutants exhibited significant transport activities compared with the wild-type hOAT1, mutants L30A and T37A completely lost transport functions.Table IPAH uptake by hOAT1 wild type and its mutantsMutants[14C]PAH uptake% of controlhOAT1-Wt100.0 ± 10.1F16A55.5 ± 1.4Q17A60.0 ± 7.4Q18A105.0 ± 20.0I19A95.7 ± 11.0Q20A50.0 ± 6.5V21A122.0 ± 11.0T22A120.4 ± 18.0L23A110.2 ± 16.2V24A102.0 ± 17.2V25A59.0 ± 6.8L26A70.9 ± 9.9P27A105.3 ± 5.3L28A53.7 ± 5.4L29A55.5 ± 8.2L30A0.0M31A120.0 ± 13.1A32V62.9 ± 11S33A103.0 ± 18.0H34A50.4 ± 6.2N35A50.0 ± 4.4T36A0.0L37A54.0 ± 7.0 Open table in a new tab Functional Analysis of the Effect of Mutations in TM1—Wild-type OAT1 is known to function as an exchanger (1You G. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 602-616Google Scholar) with one organic anion being transported into the cells in exchange for another organic anion being effluxed out of the cells. To determine whether mutations of the residues in TM1 affect this functional characteristic, cells expressing hOAT1 mutants were preloaded with [14C]PAH followed by exposure to medium with or without α-ketoglutarate, another substrate for OAT1. As shown in Table II, significant efflux of intracellular [14C]PAH was observed with both wild-type hOAT1 and its mutants when cells were exposed to medium containing an exchangeable substrate α-ketoglutarate, whereas little efflux was observed with the medium lacking α-ketoglutarate. These mutants were also as sensitive to the inhibition by probenecid as wild-type hOAT1 is; probenecid is an inhibitor for OAT1 (Table III). These results suggest that the substitution by alanine at these positions preserves the basic functional characteristics of the wild-type hOAT1. Because L30A and T36A are nonfunctional, they were not included in these studies.Table IIEfflux of [14C]PAHMutantsIntracellular [14C]PAH remaining% of controlhOAT1-Wt63.0 ± 7.0F16A77.1 ± 10.0Q17A62.1 ± 8.4Q18A52.4 ± 3.0I19A65.1 ± 4.4Q20A78.8 ± 11.2V21A53.1 ± 7.4T22A59.4 ± 5.5L23A61.5 ± 6.2V24A61.7 ± 1.2V25A61.9 ± 5.0L26A79.0 ± 10.1P27A65.0 ± 4.4L28A70.0 ± 1.0L29A77.0 ± 8.2M31A57.0 ± 6.4A32V62.8 ± 4.2S33A59.0 ± 4.0H34A63.0 ± 7.2N35A71.0 ± 7.1L37A73.1 ± 4.2 Open table in a new tab Table IIIInhibition of PAH uptake by probenecidMutantsUptake remaining% of controlhOAT1-Wt35.0 ± 7.0F16A49.0 ± 10.0Q17A47.8 ± 7.0Q18A36.0 ± 3.0I19A46.0 ± 10.0Q20A44.6 ± 2.6V21A36.4 ± 1.8T22A42.0 ± 1.9L23A30.0 ± 9.2V24A33.0 ± 1.2V25A49.0 ± 11.0L26A49.0 ± 10.0P27A47.0 ± 9.4L28A38.0 ± 1.0L29A35.9 ± 1.0M31A32.0 ± 6.4A32V31.0 ± 6.7S33A37.0 ± 4.0H34A31.5 ± 7.2N35A37.4 ± 7.1L37A30.7 ± 4.2 Open table in a new tab Effect of Mutations at Leu-30 and Thr-36 on hOAT1 Function—Because of the total loss in the uptake of PAH by L30A and T36A, additional studies were focused on these two residues. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of mutations at Leu-30 and Thr-36, we mutagenized these two residues to amino acids with different physicochemical properties (Table IV). Leu-30 was replaced by amino acids with varying sizes of hydrophobic side chains, including glycine, valine, and isoleucine. As shown in Fig. 1a, substitution of Leu-30 with amino acids with large side chains such as valine and isoleucine resulted in detectable transport activities, although transport activities were reduced compared with that of wild-type hOAT1. In contrast, substitution of Leu-30 with amino acids with small side chains such as glycine and alanine rendered hOAT1 nonfunctional. This finding clearly demonstrates that progressively smaller side chains at position 30 increasingly impair hOAT1 function.Table IVProperties of amino acid residues Open table in a new tab Next, Thr-36 was replaced by the hydroxyl- or sulfur-containing polar residues serine or cysteine (Fig. 1b). Similar to the substitution by alanine, substitution by serine or cysteine at this position resulted in a nonfunctional transporter. Immunoblot Analysis of the Effect of Mutations at Leu-30 and Thr-36 on Cell Surface Expression of hOAT1—The reduced or lack of transport activities of mutant transporters could be caused by changes in the absolute number of transporters, turnover rate, substrate binding affinity, or a combination of these factors. As a first step in evaluating the possible changes, we compared the protein expression levels of wild-type hOAT1 and its mutants on the cell surface (Fig. 2) and in the total cell extracts (data not shown) by immunoblot analysis. Although the amount of total cellular proteins of the Leu-30 mutants (L30G, L30A, L30V, and L30I) were similar to that of the wild type, the membrane abundance of these mutants decreased significantly in mutant-transfected cells as compared with that of wild-type hOAT1-transfected cells; the smaller the side chains at position 30, the less expression of the mutants at the cell surface (Fig. 2a). In sharp contrast with the mutants of Leu-30, substitution of Thr-36 with alanine, serine, and cysteine had no effect on its surface expression (Fig. 2b). All of the mutants of Thr-36 had a similar amount of surface expression as compared with the wild type. Immunofluorescence Analysis of the Effect of Mutations at Leu-30 and Thr-36 on Cell Surface Expression of hOAT1—The effect of mutations at Leu-30 and Thr-36 on the cellular distribution of hOAT1 was further investigated by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 3). Although the plasma membrane was clearly labeled (shown as green fluorescence) in cells transfected with wild-type hOAT1 as well as with all of the Thr-36 mutants (Fig. 3b), fluorescence remained mainly in the intracellular compartment in cells transfected with most of the Leu-30 mutants (L30G, L30A, and L30V) (Fig. 3a). Phase contrast images showed that cells were fully attached to the culture dishes under all conditions. Considering these data together, it can be concluded that the proper targeting of hOAT1 to the plasma membrane was impaired by the substitution at position 30 but not by the substitution at position 36. Kinetic Analysis of PAH Transport Mediated by Mutant L30V—To further examine the mechanisms underlying the reduced transport activity of hOAT1 by substitution of Leu-30 with valine, we determined [14C]PAH uptake at different substrate concentrations. An Eadie-Hofstee analysis of the derived data (Fig. 4) showed that a valine substitution of Leu-30 resulted in decreased Vmax (110.8 ± 3.1 pmol/μg·3 min with wild-type hOAT1, 25.5 ± 0.5 pmol/μg·3 min with L30V) and decreased Km (14.8 ± 0.1 μm with wild-type hOAT1, 7.8 ± 0.4 μm with L30V). The vital importance of organic anion transport in body drug disposition is clear (1You G. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 602-616Google Scholar, 2You G. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 55-62Google Scholar). However, our knowledge about the structure-function relationships of organic anion transporters is minimal. Our laboratory has recently carried out a study on the role of glycosylation in OAT1 function (4Tanaka K. Xu W. Zhou F. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14961-14966Google Scholar). In that study, we disrupted putative glycosylation sites in a mOAT1 as well as its human counterpart, hOAT1, by mutating asparagine (N) to glutamine (Q) and assessing mutant transporters in HeLa cells. One of the key findings from that study is that the putative glycosylation site Asn-39 in mOAT1 was not glycosylated, whereas the corresponding site (Asn-39) in hOAT1 was glycosylated. Disrupting Asn-39 resulted in a complete loss of transport activity in both mOAT1 and hOAT1 without affecting their cell surface expression suggesting that the loss of function is not because of the deglycosylation of Asn-39 per se but rather is likely because of the change of this important amino acid that is critically involved in the substrate binding. Because Asn-39 in mOAT1 is located in the same position as Asp-39 in hOAT1, two amino acid residues from the mouth of the TM1, we therefore hypothesized that TM1 may be critical for hOAT1 function. To test this hypothesis, in the current study, we have employed alanine-scanning mutagenesis to examine the functional importance of each residue within TM1 of hOAT1. Alanine was chosen for these studies, because the substitution of alanine in helices in the core of proteins has minimal effects on secondary structure (5Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Acheson M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18752-18758Google Scholar). Substitution by alanine is therefore expected to reduce the hydrophobicity and size of the amino acid residue in each position in these putative helices without causing global conformational changes. The outcome of this alanine scanning (Table 1) drew our attention to two critical amino acid residues Leu-30 and Thr-36. Substitution of Leu-30 or Thr-36 with alanine led to a complete loss of transport function. To further investigate the significance of Leu-30 and Thr-36, we then mutagenized these two residues to several other amino acids with different physicochemical properties (Table 4). Leu-30 was replaced by amino acids with varying sizes of hydrophobic side chains such as glycine, alanine, valine, and isoleucine. We showed that the side chain size of the residues at position 30 is of functional significance provided that no charge is present. When native Leu 30 was replaced with valine and isoleucine, residues with side chains slightly smaller than or similar to that of leucine and equally neutral, the resulting hOAT1 mutants (L30V and L30I) still exhibited measurable transport activities, although transport activities were reduced compared with that of wild-type hOAT1. Isoleucine is a stereoisomer of leucine. Therefore, the steric difference between isoleucine and leucine may also contribute to the functional difference between L30I and the wild-type hOAT1. In contrast, when native Leu-30 was replaced with glycine or alanine, residues with much smaller side chains than leucine and devoid of charge, the resulting hOAT1 mutants (L30G, and L30A) became nonfunctional. Thr-36, another critical amino acid identified in TM1, was replaced by serine or cysteine. Similar to the substitution by alanine, substitution by serine or cysteine resulted in a nonfunctional transporter. The hydroxyl group on threonine and serine often participates in substrate binding or maintaining the protein structure through forming hydrogen bonds (6Leu Y.J. Chern S.S. Wang S.C. Hsiao Y.Y. Amiraslanov I. Liaw Y.C. Liao Y.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7300-7309Google Scholar, 7Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8557-8569Google Scholar, 8Diez-Sampedro A. Wright E.M. Hirayama B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49188-49194Google Scholar). If this is true, then one might expect that the substitution of Thr-36 by serine would rescue the loss of hOAT1 function that resulted from the substitution by alanine. However, this recovery of the function by serine substitution was not observed in our study. On the other hand, the size of the side chains of alanine, serine, and cysteine are smaller than that of threonine by one methyl group. Because alanine itself could not rescue the function when substituted at this position, a methyl group alone is apparently not sufficient to recapitulate the activity. Therefore, it is possible that both the methyl group and the hydroxyl group presented on threonine play critical roles in maintaining hOAT1 function. The reduced or lack of transport activity in mutants of Leu-30 and Thr-36 could result from the reduced or lack of expression of the mutant transporter protein or could result from impaired binding abilities of the mutants for their substrates. By directly measuring cell surface expression of these mutants (Figs. 2 and 3), we observed two distinct phenomena. For Leu-30, replacement by smaller side chains at this position resulted in a dramatic decrease in the expression of the mutants at the cell surface (despite the similar total cell expression of these mutants relative to that of wild-type hOAT1, data not shown). In sharp contrast, the replacement of Thr-36 by alanine, serine, and cysteine had no effect on the surface expression of the transporter. These results suggest that the trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membrane was impaired by the substitution at position 30 but not by the substitution at position 36. Finally, our kinetic analysis of L30V showed that the moderate transport activity of this mutant was contributed by a reduced surface expression (Vmax) and an increased binding affinity (1/Km) as compared with that of the wild type. In conclusion, Leu-30 and Thr-36 play distinct roles in hOAT1 function. Leu-30 is important in targeting the transporter to the plasma membrane. In contrast, Thr-36 is critical for substrate recognition. This is the first identification and characterization of critical amino acid residues in the membrane-spanning region of hOAT1 and may provide important insights into the structure-function relationships of the organic ion transporter family.

The magnitude of this loss of function is comparable with removal of the essential catalytic Cys81. Surprisingly, DNA binding is completely recovered (increase of 105-fold) with a DNA substrate lacking the target cytosine base (abasic).

Although Val121 plays a critical role in both extrahelical base stabilization and catalysis, its position and mobility are not influenced by individual residues in the adjacent peptide region.

The molecular basis of enzymatic catalysis is of broad interest, with implications for biocatalyst design and drug development. The abundance of detailed three-dimensional structures and investigational methods provides newly addressable aspects of enzymatic function. We are interested in the importance of protein motion, and particularly correlated motions, to catalysis. The underlying premise is that protein-solvent interactions are converted into peptide motions, resulting in the transient stabilization of active site elements with preferred reactivities (1Benkovic S.J. Hammes-Schiffer S. Science. 2003; 301: 1196-1202Google Scholar, 2Bruice T.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 139-148Google Scholar).Recent studies (1Benkovic S.J. Hammes-Schiffer S. Science. 2003; 301: 1196-1202Google Scholar) have provided highly suggestive evidence for this concept. Molecular dynamics investigations of dihydrofolate reductase demonstrate that strong coupled motions in the reactive complex disappear in the product complexes, indicating that these motions may be linked to catalysis. Mutants that alter the kinetics of particular catalytic steps are concentrated within segments of the protein structure shown to participate in highly correlated motions (1Benkovic S.J. Hammes-Schiffer S. Science. 2003; 301: 1196-1202Google Scholar). Solid state NMR and solution NMR relaxation studies have measured substrate and protein dynamics that are matched to the turnover time of the respective enzymes (3Rozovsky S. McDermott A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 259-270Google Scholar). Studies of hydrogen and electron tunneling during enzyme catalysis provide further evidence for the importance of protein dynamics to catalytic events at the active site (4Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3096-3102Google Scholar, 5Eisenmesser E.Z. Bosco D.A. Akke M. Kern D.

DNA methyltransferase provided initial evidence for correlated motions within the active sites of these enzymes (6Lau E.Y. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem.

We sought to test the importance to catalysis of motions made by specific distal residues (His127–Thr132) in facilitating active site chemistries by altering the position and orientation of critical residues such as Val121. Alanine scan point mutagenesis and kinetic characterization of individual steps in the catalytic cycle were used to probe the effects of such mutations and provide insights into the roles of correlated motions. M.HhaI provides an excellent structurally and functionally tractable enzyme to study various aspects of catalysis, including base flipping and the importance of motions to catalysis. M.HhaI, from Haemophilus haemolyticus, is an AdoMet-dependent C5-cytosine methyltransferase that methylates the central cytosine (C) in the recognition sequence 5′-GCGC-3′ after stabilizing the target base in an extrahelical position. Many M.HhaI crystal structures provide structural insights into the mechanisms of DNA methylation and base flipping (8Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 181-198Google Scholar). Functional analysis of the WT M.HhaI has been extensive (9Lindstrom W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Google Scholar, 10Vilkaitis G. Merkiene E. Serva S. Weinhold E.

Many structural components of the M.HhaI mechanism have been examined by mutagenesis including Gln237, which positions itself into the DNA helix and interacts with the lone guanine (15Mi S. Alonso D. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 620-627Google Scholar), and Cys81, which forms a covalent bond to the target cytosine (16Mi S. Roberts R.J.

Crystal structures have also been solved for the enzyme bound to its cofactor and enzyme bound to DNA containing modified target bases, and mutant structures have been solved (17Vilkaitis G.

Moreover, this loop is seen in the closed conformation in the co-crystal structure containing the tightly bound cognate DNA (19Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Google Scholar); thus, the enzyme appears to follow an induced fit mechanism in which tight DNA binding is coupled to loop movement to the closed conformation and, coincidentally, base flipping (14Wang P.Y. Brank A.S. Banavali N.K. Nicklaus M.C. Marquez V.E. Christman J.K. MacKerell A.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12422-12434Google Scholar, 19Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Google Scholar).Extrahelical nucleoside stabilization, or base flipping, is used by enzymes to assist in chemical modification of DNA substrates. Enzyme-DNA interactions mediate processes that allow for destabilization of the DNA helix and extrahelical stabilization of the target base. This shift in DNA conformation is utilized in a variety of biological processes, including DNA methylation and DNA repair (23Douglas K.T. Med. Res. Rev. 1987; 7: 441-475Google Scholar, 24Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 163-167Google Scholar, 25Jones P.A. Takai D. Science. 2001; 293: 1068-1070Google Scholar, 26Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 461-467Google Scholar), by providing access to buried functionalities on DNA bases that would be inaccessible in a B-form DNA helix. Current proposals on the mechanisms by which enzymes facilitate base flipping include enzymatic manipulations to either 5′- or 3′-phosphates (8Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 181-198Google Scholar, 27Lariviere L. Morera S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 483-490Google Scholar), “pinch-pull-push” mechanisms (28Wong I. Lundquist A.J. Bernards A.S. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19424-19432Google Scholar), and passive mechanisms involving stabilization of transiently flipped nucleotides in B-form DNA (29Banavali N.K. MacKerell A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 141-160Google Scholar). Studies on M.HhaI aimed at elucidating the base flipping mechanism include crystallographic studies (19Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Google Scholar), theoretical calculations (30Huang N. Banavali N.K. MacKerell A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 68-73Google Scholar), NMR studies (31Klimasauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wuthrich K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 317-324Google Scholar), mutagenesis (32Holz B. Klimasauskas S. Serva S. Weinhold E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Google Scholar, 33Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K. Mort J. Wong D. Lindstrom W. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19269-19275Google Scholar), and kinetic characterization (14Wang P.Y. Brank A.S. Banavali N.K. Nicklaus M.C. Marquez V.E. Christman J.K. MacKerell A.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12422-12434Google Scholar, 34Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Google Scholar). Many fundamental aspects of base flipping remain highly debated, including which DNA groove the target base moves through as it flips and which protein-DNA contacts facilitate this process.We initiated this study to investigate the importance of interactions between Val121 and the extrahelical cytosine, and to identify distal protein elements that provide both static and dynamic scaffolding for this interaction. Our motivation came in part from molecular dynamics simulations that identified anti-correlated active site motions (2Bruice T.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 139-148Google Scholar, 6Lau E.Y. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12387-12394Google Scholar, 7Lau E.Y. Bruice T.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 9-18Google Scholar). This anticorrelated motion could cause the active site to undergo a compression, which was previously proposed to be important for AdoMet-dependent methyl transfer reactions (35Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Spies A. Schowen R.L. Sinnott M. S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent Methyltransferases. Comprehensive Biological Catalyst. Academic Press, Manchester, United Kingdom1998: 1-30Google Scholar). Moreover, we hypothesized that such motions could be disrupted by amino acid substitutions in critical peptide elements. Residues 121–132 originate at the active site with Val121 and end on the protein surface with Thr132 (see Fig. 1). In-between these two residues, M.HhaI makes an unusual αβ-turn with multiple hydrogen bonds including an internal hydrogen bond between His127 and Thr132 (see Fig. 1C). We used alanine substitutions of residues distal from the active site (His127–Thr132) but connected to a critical residue in the active site (Val121) to probe for correlated motions. Val121 is located directly over the target cytosine, and we show its positioning is crucial for base flipping and catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification— Seven M.HhaI mutants were produced (Val121 → Ala, His127 → Ala, Asp128 → Ala, Asn129 → Ala, Gly130 → Ala, Asn131 → Ala, and Thr132 → Ala) using the QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the vector pHSHW-5 (provided by S. Kumar, New England Biolabs) as a template and seven sets of PCR primers (Genset Oligos). PCR products were digested (DpnI) to remove any WT plasmid, transformed via heat shock into competent Escherichia coli strain ER1727, and plated onto agar plates supplemented with 60 μg/ml ampicillin. Sequencing of DNA from individual colonies was done by the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Biotechnology Center (Urbana, IL). WT and mutant M.HhaI overexpression from pHSHW-5 derived vectors was accomplished with early log phase (A600 = 0.4) induction with 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were centrifugally harvested, and protein was purified according to methods published previously (36Greene P.J. Heyneker H.L. Bolivar F. Rodriguez R.L. Betlach M.C. Covarrubias A.A. Backman K. Russel D.J. Tait R. Boyer H.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 2373-2380Google Scholar). After purification, enzymes were >95% pure and were flash-frozen in 20-μl aliquots and stored at –70 °C. WT protein concentration was determined by active site titration, and mutant protein concentration was by Bradford staining based on a standard curve of the WT protein (37Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Google Scholar).Confirmation of Mutant M.HhaI Sequence by Mass Spectrometry— Nano-electrospray ionization was used to confirm the substitution of alanine at selected positions in M.HhaI. Both mutant and WT enzymes were run on SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by silver-staining (Silver-Quest, Invitrogen). Protein bands were excised from the gel and subsequently destained in 1.5-ml siliconized Eppendorf tubes. To enhance diffusion of protease into the gel matrix, gel pieces were dried by speed-vac (Savant) and incubated with 100 μl of 12.5 ng/μl sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) for 20–30 min on ice after which excess protease was removed and replaced with 50 mm NH4HCO3 for overnight digestion at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were extracted several times with a 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid solution, lyophilized, and resuspended in 5% formic acid. Digested peptides were desalted and concentrated using POROS R2 resin (Perceptive Biosystems) that had been loaded into a nanospray capillary (Proxeon Biosystems). Peptides were loaded onto the resin, washed with 5% formic acid, and eluted into a borosilicate capillary (Proxeon Biosystems) with 50% methanol, 5% formic acid. The capillary containing the eluted peptides was loaded onto an Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Q-STAR quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and data were collected over a mass range m/z 300–1500 in positive ion mode. Peptide peaks containing the desired substituted amino acids were observed for all mutants but not for the WT protein, and similarly, the WT peptide was observed in WT protein and not in the mutants. Both WT and mutant peptide were analyzed further by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for its amino acid sequence. Data (not shown) were collected over a mass range of m/z 50–2000 in positive ion mode.Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism was performed on WT and mutant M.HhaI in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at room temperature. Data were collected on an Aviv 202 Circular Dichroism Spectrophotometer using a 500-μl quartz fluorescence cuvette with a 0.2-cm slit width (Starna). Data were collected between 190 and 265 nm.Oligonucleotide Synthesis and Purification—Oligonucleotides used for kinetic analysis required the use of multiple DNA substrates with a single recognition site but with variations at the target base. The variations are shown below with the recognition sequence underlined and the target bases in boldface. C is cytosine; M is 5-methylcytosine; F is 5-fluorocytosine, and B is an abasic nucleotide. Abox, 5′-GGGAATTCATGGCGCAGTGGGTGGATCCAG-3′, and 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCGCGTCACCCACCTAGGTC-5′; FAMbox, 5′-GGGAATTCATGGFGCAGTGGGTGGATCCAG-3′, and 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCGMGTCACCCACCTAGGTC-5′; ABMbox, 5′-GGGAATTCATGGBGCAGTGGGTGGATCCAG-3′, and 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCGMGTCACCCACCTAGGTC-5′.Substrate oligonucleotides were synthesized by Midlands DNA (Midland, TX) and purified on a Dynamax PureDNA high pressure liquid chromatography column (Rainin Instrument Co.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Oligonucleotides were stored in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Concentrations were photometrically determined by using calculated extinction coefficients (9Lindstrom W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide duplexes were formed by annealing the single strands in TE buffer with 10 mm NaCl and heated to 95 °C for 5 min before being cooled slowly to room temperature. Ratios of single strands were optimized to provide the most duplex with the least amount of residual single strands. For gel mobility shift assays, DNA substrates were radiolabeled by using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs).Cofactors—AdoMet and AdoHcy were purchased from Sigma and stored in 0.1 n HCl.Steady State Assays—kcat values for WT and mutant enzymes were determined as reported previously (9Lindstrom W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Google Scholar) by using filter binding assays with a few variations. This turnover constant, and all other reported kcat values, is actually an apparent constant because it was determined at a single concentration of one or both of the two substrates. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme (10 and 20 nm) to AdoMet (1.2 μm) and Abox DNA (1 μm) in MR buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA) incubated at 37 °C. Six time points were taken at 10-s intervals, quenched on DE-81 filters, and processed as described previously (37Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2933-2939Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed with a Beckman Coulter LS6500 MultiPurpose Scintillation Counter, and linear graphs were fit using Kaleidagraph.kcat values were derived for WT and Val121 → Ala M.HhaI by another filter binding, steady state assay. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme (8 μm for Val121 → Ala and 100 pm for WT) to AdoMet (125 nm for WT and 10 μm for Val121 → Ala) and Abox DNA (100 nm for WT and 10 μm for Val121 → Ala) in PD buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) incubated at 37 °C. Time points were taken every 10 min for 1 h.AdoMet Equilibrium Dissociation Constant—KDAdoMet values were determined for WT and mutant enzymes by using native protein fluorescence as described previously (9Lindstrom W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Google Scholar). Briefly, an LS50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for fluorescence measurements at room temperature. Excitation slit width was 5 mm, and emission slit width was 7.5 mm. A xenon lamp was used to excite at a wavelength of 280 nm. Emission spectra were recorded from 320 to 430 nm at a scan speed of 100 nm/min. The samples contained enzyme (1 μm), 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and varying AdoMet concentrations (0 to 200 μm). For obtaining KDAdoMet values, areas of the spectral curves were determined using Origin, and curves were fit using SigmaPlot. The equation was fit to a rectangular hyperbola.Single Turnover Assays—Single turnover assays were conducted as reported previously (9Lindstrom W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Google Scholar) with two different DNA substrates, Abox DNA and FAMbox DNA. For Abox DNA single turnover assays, AdoMet (3 μm) and Abox DNA (100 nm) were mixed in MR buffer and incubated at 6 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of excess enzyme (0.4 to 3 μm), and time points were taken at 4, 8, 12, 16, 25, 40, and 60 s, quenched in a final concentration of 0.5% SDS, and spotted on DE-81 filters for analysis. For FAMbox DNA single turnover assays, AdoMet (800 nm) and enzyme (750 nm) in PD buffer were incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were initiated by FAMbox DNA addition (300 nm). Time points taken at 2, 4, 10, 30, 70, and 120 min were spotted on DE-81 filters for quenching. SigmaPlot was used to fit all single turnover exponential rise to maximum curves.DNA Equilibrium Dissociation Constant—KDDNA values were determined as reported previously (9Lindstrom W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Google Scholar) in the presence of the cofactor AdoHcy for two different DNA substrates, Abox and ABMbox. For KDAbox-DNA, AdoHcy (25 μm), radiolabeled Abox DNA (50 pm), and enzyme (10 pm to 1 nm) were used. For the Val121 → Ala M.HhaI Abox DNA gel shift, enzyme concentrations up to 4 μm were used. For KDABMbox-DNA, AdoHcy (25 μm), radiolabeled ABMbox DNA (200 pm), and enzyme (1 pm to 5 nm) were used. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in MR buffer and then loaded onto a pre-run, 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were run at 300 V for 150 min at room temperature. Gels were exposed to image plates and analyzed using a Storm 840 densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). SigmaPlot was used to fit the data to a rectangular hyperbola curve and obtain KDDNA values.Superimpositions and Computer-generated Graphics—Images of M.HhaI were generated using Pymol, SYBYL, and InsightII on Silicon Graphics computers. Protein Data Bank structures of M.HhaI, M.HaeIII, M.TaqI, and DNA glycosylases include codes 1MHT-9MHT, 1HMY, 1DCT, 1G38, 1BNK, 1EBM, 1DIZ, and 1EMH. Superimpositions for Fig. 10C were done on InsightII by using the Transpose function with six sets of defining atoms: C-3′ and C-4′ carbon atoms of the flipped sugar, two phosphate atoms flanking the flipped base, and side chain α-carbons for Val121 and Arg165 (Val111 and Arg155 for M.HaeIII). Superimpositions that had no DNA atoms, 1HMY, used just the protein side chain α-carbons. All structures were superimposed onto 3MHT.Fig. 10A, the active site of M.HhaI is shown with Arg165, Cys81, Glu119, flipped cytosine, and AdoHcy. The image was generated on InsightII from 3MHT.pdb, and hydrogen bonds are shown (dotted line) with distances. The Cys81 thiolate interaction with C6 of the cytosine and the C5 interaction of cytosine with the co-factor are also shown. B was constructed on Isis Draw and shows the AdoMet cofactor, many active site interactions (dotted lines), and the χ angle or propeller twist that rotates around the glycosidic bond. Improper χ angles can disrupt many of the interactions shown in A and B. C shows superimpositions of Val121, Arg165, and flipped residues for various WT M.HhaI structures and one M.HaeIII structure. M.HaeIII residues, Val111 and Arg155, are shown in parentheses. Red is the AdoMet co-crystal and has no DNA (1HMY.pdb), green is with a cytosine target base (3MHT.pdb), yellow is with an adenine target base (7MHT.pdb), pink is with uracil as the target base (8MHT.pdb), black has an abasic target base (9MHT.pdb), and blue is M.HaeIII with a cytosine target base (1DCT.pdb). Although the DNA component of the abasic structure (black) is difficult to see due to the superimpositions, it can be seen upon careful inspection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RESULTSMutant Design—We used alanine replacements in our study because it is the most common amino acid, is relatively unrestricted in conformation, and has a small and inert side chain (38Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Google Scholar). The mutated residues are not directly implicated in catalysis and, with the exception of Val121 (4 Å), are distal (13–20 Å) from the active site. Within the region selected, Lys122, Asn123, Phe124, and Ser126 were omitted because of likely DNA interactions, based on inspection of the 3MHT co-crystal structure. Ala125 was also omitted because it is already alanine. The selected region presents a stretch of peptide that molecular dynamic simulations have predicted to make anti-correlated motions to regions of peptide on the opposite side of the active site, and these motions are believed to be critical for catalysis (7Lau E.Y. Bruice T.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 9-18Google Scholar). Anti-correlated motions involve coupled spatial displacements of two elements toward and away from each other in time.Purification and Characterization—Purified proteins were initially characterized to confirm that appropriate mutations had been made, which included DNA sequencing of the encoding plasmid, peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism. Circular dichroism spectra for WT and mutant M.HhaI proteins all showed a high degree of similarity, and representative data for Val121 → Ala and WT M.HhaI are shown in Fig. 2. DNA sequencing confirmed no secondary mutations had been made, and mass spectrometry data of M.HhaI peptide fragments confirmed that the alanine mutations were appropriately made. Tryptic digested M.HhaI peptide fragment 115–122 was observed at 483.27 (483.26 theoretical) in all WT samples and was shifted in each mutant spectrum because of the alanine mutation altering the molecular mass of the fragment. The Val121 → Ala fragment was observed at 469.31 (469.24 theoretical) and is representative of other mutant proteins. The mass spectrometric analysis also revealed that Asn129 is partially deaminated to Asp129 in all M.HhaI mutants and WT (data not shown). Inspection of peak clusters from MS/MS data of a peptide fragment (residues 123–137) showed heterogeneity in all peaks for amino acids130–137 and not for amino acids 123–129. In addition, MS/MS peak values revealed the contaminant peptide fragment had a mass 1 unit higher than the WT fragment that disappeared when Asn129 was removed. This mass difference is accountable only by an asparagine that was deamidated to an aspartic acid (39Wright H.T. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 1-52Google Scholar). Although not previously reported for M.HhaI, such post-translational modifications are well characterized and can potentially affect the function of an enzyme (40Solstad T. Carvalho R.N. Andersen O.A. Waidelich D. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 929-938Google Scholar). We believe the deamidations at position 129 are unlikely to alter the function of the WT or mutant M.HhaI proteins. The Asn129 → Ala mutant has functional parameters that are indistinguishable from the WT protein. The other M.HhaI mutants have similar levels of Asn129 deamidation yet, other than the Val121 → Ala mutant, have WT functional parameters. Finally, Asn129 is a considerable distance from the active site. In summary, it is highly unlikely that the large effect on DNA binding observed for the Val121 → Ala mutant is derived from the double mutation as opposed to just the valine substitution.Fig. 2Circular diochroism spectra were collected for WT M.HhaI (dotted line) and the Val121 → Ala mutant (solid line). The spectra of alanine mutants 127–132 are also similar to WT.View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2055184294,"Git1p mediates the transport of the phospholipid metabolite, glycerophosphoinositol, into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We report that phosphate limitation and inositol limitation affect GIT1 expression and Git1p transport activity via distinct mechanisms that involve multiple transcription factors. GIT1 transcript levels and Git1p activity are greater in cells starved for phosphate, with or without inositol limitation, than in cells only limited for inositol. Furthermore, the kinetics of GIT1 transcript accumulation and Git1p activity upon transfer of cells to phosphate starvation media are different from those obtained upon transfer of cells to inositol-free media. Pho2p and Pho4p are required for GIT1 expression and for Git1p transport activity under all growth conditions tested. In contrast, Ino2p and Ino4p are required for full GIT1 expression when inositol is limiting, with or without phosphate limitation, but not when only phosphate is limiting. Greatly reduced transport activity was detected in ino2Δ and ino4Δ cells under all growth conditions. A 300-base pair region of the GIT1 promoter containing potential Pho4p binding sites was shown to be required for full GIT1 expression. Git1p appears to act as a H+-symporter, and neither inositol nor phosphate effectively compete with glycerophosphoinositol for transport by Git1p. Glycerophosphoinositol was shown previously to support the growth of an inositol auxotroph. Remarkably, we now report that glycerophosphoinositol can act as the sole source of phosphate for the cell, providing functional relevance for the regulation of Git1p transport activity by phosphate.

Cells must integrate the multiple signals that they receive from their environment and adjust their metabolism accordingly. Because phosphate is a required nutrient, organisms have evolved ways of sensing extracellular phosphate, scavenging it from the environment, and transporting it into the cell. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phosphate starvation induces the transcription of phosphatase genes (PHO5, PHO10, PHO11), the structural gene for low Km Pi transport, PHO84, and several other genes that have been identified through traditional and microarray approaches (1Lenburg M.E. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 383-387Google Scholar, 2Persson B.L. Lagerstedt J.O. Pratt J.R. Pattison-Granberg J. Lundh K. Shokrollahzadeh S. Lundh F. Curr.

Five regulatory genes control the PHO regulon, PHO2, PHO4, PHO80, PHO81, and PHO85. Pho4p, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; GroPIns, glycerophosphoinositol; PI, phosphatidylinositol; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. transcription factor, and Pho2p, a homeobox DNA-binding protein mediate the induction of PHO transcription during phosphate starvation. In a high Pi medium, Pho80p and Pho85p form a kinase complex similar to that formed by a cyclin and a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates Pho4p. Phosphorylated Pho4p is concentrated in the cytoplasm where it cannot activate transcription (6O'Neill E.M. Kaffman A. Jolly E.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1996; 271: 209-212Google Scholar). In low Pi medium, Pho81p inhibits the Pho80p-Pho85p complex, blocking phosphorylation of Pho4p. Dephosphorylated Pho4p is concentrated in the nucleus where it can activate transcription (6O'Neill E.M. Kaffman A. Jolly E.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1996; 271: 209-212Google Scholar). Growth of S. cerevisiae in inositol-free medium results in the coordinate induction of a set of genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis. The most highly regulated of these is INO1, the gene encoding inositol-1-phosphate synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in inositol biosynthesis (7Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Google Scholar). Cells starved for exogenous inositol, therefore, synthesize inositol de novo. INO1, as well as the other co-regulated genes of phospholipid biosynthesis, contains within its promoter a repeated bHLH consensus sequence (UASINO) to which the heterodimerized INO2 and INO4 gene products bind to activate transcription when inositol is limiting (8Ambroziak J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15344-15349Google Scholar, 9Nikoloff D.M. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7402-7411Google Scholar). Inositol is a precursor of phosphatidylinositol (PI), an essential lipid of eukaryotic cells. PI acts, in turn, as a precursor to sphingolipids (IPC, MIPC, M(IP)2C) and polyphosphoinositides (PIP, PI3-P, PIP2). PI deacylation via phospholipases B (encoded by PLB1, PLB2, and PLB3) results in the production of glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns). GroPIns is released into the extracellular milieu and is a major PI catabolite in cultures grown in inositol-containing medium (10Angus W.W. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 483-495Google Scholar). When inositol is limiting, GroPIns is transported into the cell, where it is catabolized, and its inositol portion is used for the synthesis of PI (Fig. 1) (11Patton J.L. Pessoa-Brandao L. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3379-3385Google Scholar). Transport of GroPIns is mediated through the permease encoded by the GIT1 gene (12Patton-Vogt J.L. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1707-1715Google Scholar). The predicted GIT1 protein product bears similarity to other S. cerevisiae transport proteins, including the inositol transporters Itr1p and Itr2p, and the inorganic phosphate transporter, Pho84p. Recent studies (13Almaguer C. Mantella D. Perez E. Patton-Vogt J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 729-736Google Scholar) have shown that in addition to inositol limitation, phosphate limitation induces increased uptake of GroPIns. In the present report, we characterize further the nature of the regulation of GroPIns transport via inositol and phosphate limitation. Regulation of GIT1 expression is shown to occur at multiple levels and to be multifactorial. Importantly, we report that GroPIns, when supplied as the sole phosphate source, supports the robust growth of S. cerevisiae in a GIT1-dependent manner. Strains and Media—Strains (Table I) were grown aerobically at 30 °C with shaking. Turbidity was monitored by measurement at A600 nm on a Biomate 3 Thermo Spectronic spectrophotometer. Synthetic complete medium was prepared as described previously (11Patton J.L. Pessoa-Brandao L. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3379-3385Google Scholar). “High Pi,” “Low Pi”, and “no Pi” media, (see Table II and Figs. 3, 4, and 5) were made by replacing the KH2PO4 (1 g/liter) in synthetic complete medium with KCl (1 g/liter) and adding KH2PO4 to 10 mm (high Pi), 0.2 mm (low Pi), or no KH2PO4 (no Pi). Where indicated, media lacked inositol (I-), contained 5 μm inositol (5I-), or contained 75 μm inositol (I+). Media may also have been supplemented with GroPIns (Sigma). YEPD medium consisted of 20 g of glucose, 10 g of yeast extract, and 20 g of bacto peptone/liter.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeSourceWild type (JPV203)his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, MATaResearch GeneticsGIT1-HA (JPV373)his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, GIT1-HA, MATaThis studyino2Δ (JPV339)his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, ino2::KanMX, MATaResearch Geneticsino4Δ (JPV340)his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, ino4::KanMX, MATaResearch Geneticspho2Δ (JPV295)his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, pho2::kanMX, MATaResearch Geneticspho4Δ (JPV296)his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, pho4::KanMX, MATaResearch Geneticsgit1Δ (JPV212)his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, git1Δ::KanMX, MATaResearch Genetics Open table in a new tab Table IIEffect of compounds on GroPIns transport Transport activity was assayed in the presence of 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0, 5 μm glycerophosphoinositol, and the indicated concentrations of added compounds.

For the inositol auxotrophs, ino2Δ and ino4Δ, 5I-media were substituted for I-media. RNA was extracted, and Northern blots were performed as described (13Almaguer C. Mantella D. Perez E. Patton-Vogt J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 729-736Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase Assays—Strains (wild type, pho2Δ, pho4Δ, ino2Δ, and ino4Δ) pregrown in high Pi, I+ medium were harvested and used to inoculate the following media: 1) low Pi, I-; 2) low Pi, I+; 3) high Pi, I-; 4) high Pi, I+. For the inositol auxotrophs, ino2Δ and ino4Δ, 5I-media were substituted for I-media. At the indicated times, aliquots of the cultures were harvested, and CAT activity was determined using the FAST CAT green (deoxy) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay kit as described (13Almaguer C. Mantella D. Perez E. Patton-Vogt J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 729-736Google Scholar). Production of Radiolabeled GroPIns—Tritium-labeled GroPIns ([3H]GroPIns) was produced through the deacylation of phosphatidyl-myo-[2-3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) as described (14Hama H. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. Methods. 2000; 20: 465-473Google Scholar). GroPIns Transport Assays—Strains (wild type, pho2Δ, pho4Δ, ino2Δ, and ino4Δ) pregrown in high Pi,I+ medium were harvested and used to inoculate the following media: 1) low Pi,I-; 2) low Pi,I+; 3) high Pi,I-; 4) high Pi, I+. For the inositol auxotrophs, ino2Δ and ino4Δ, 5I-medium was substituted for I-medium. At the indicated times, aliquots of the cultures were harvested and washed once with sterile water. The cell pellet was suspended in 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0, to A600 = 5. Where indicated (see Fig. 5) other buffers were used. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μl of 25 μm [3H]GroPIns to 200 μl of the cell suspension. Following a 5-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold H2O. The samples were filtered through glass fiber (GF/C) filters, and the filters were washed with 15 ml of ice-cold H2O. Radioactivity on the filter was determined by liquid scintillation counting using a 2100TR Packard Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. Construction of GIT1-cat Fusion Plasmids—For the construction of plasmid pWC639, a 2.4-kb fragment containing a portion of the GIT1 promoter (nucleotides from -7 to -639 upstream of the start codon) fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (cat) was amplified by PCR using pCA999 as a template. Primers contained homology to pCA999 as well as sequence to introduce flanking restriction sites for SalI (forward primer, 5′-ATCGCGAATGTCGACCGTTTTGCCAAGATAAATTAAAAAAAG-′3) and HindIII (reverse primer, 5′-TGGGTTGGAAGGCAAGAGAGCCCCGAAAGCTTAGTTACGATC-′3). The PCR product and plasmid pRS315 were digested with SalI and HindIII and ligated to produce pWC639. To produce pWC335, a 2.03-kb fragment (containing nucleotides from -7 to -335 upstream of the start codon) was amplified by PCR using pCA999 as a template. Primers contained homology to pCA999 as well as sequences to introduce flanking restriction sites for SalI (forward primer, 5′-ATCGCGAATGTCGACGGACCCCCACCTTAGCATGGATTGATT-′3) and HindIII (reverse primer, 5′-TGGGTTGGAAGGCAAGAGAGCCCCGAAAGCTTAGTTACGATC-′3). The PCR product and plasmid pRS315 were digested with SalI and HindIII and ligated to produce pWC335. Construction of Chromosomal GIT1-HA Allele—The plasmid pFA6-a-3HA-kanMX6 (15Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar) kindly provided by M. Longtine (Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK) was used as template to amplify a 3HA-KanMX module for insertion into the genome at the 3′-end of GIT1. The 5′-ends of the forward and reverse primers bore 40 nucleotides homologous to the target gene sequences, followed by 20 nucleotides homologous to the 3HA-KanMX module, forward primer 5′-AAGAAAAACGCAGAAATAATTTCAGTCAGACAGGTCGATCAACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGCTGCATCATAATAAATTAAAATTAACGCTTTAGAAAAGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′. The PCR product was transformed into S. cerevisiae (16Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Google Scholar) and G418-resistant transformants were selected as described (17Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Google Scholar). To verify integration at the correct location, genomic DNA was prepared and used as a template in PCR with forward primer 5′-AGAACTATTGAAGTTGAAGAGAATGGTACT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATGAATATATTTCAAACATTACATGCACTCTTGGG-3′. Integration of the 3HA-KanMX module resulted in the following changes in the genomic DNA, (i) deletion of the GIT1 stop codon and the codon preceding it and the addition of three copies of the HA gene to the resulting 3′-end and (ii) deletion of 15 codons downstream of the GIT1 stop codon. The resulting strain was named GIT1-HA (JPV373). Western Blot Analysis—Wild type cells grown in 20 ml of the indicated media were collected in late logarithmic phase, suspended in 200 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100), and lysed with glass beads (18Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma). Samples were heated at 37 °C for 10 min with Tris-Gly SDS sample buffer (Novex). A total of 40–50 μg were loaded/lane into 4–20% Tris-Gly gels (Invitrogen). Gels were transferred to an Invitrolon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen) using the Xcell II Blot Module (Invitrogen). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S 0.5% in 1% acetic acid to check for efficiency of transfer. Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, 20% Tween 20 containing 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were equilibrated for 15 min at room temperature with shaking. Primary antibody (monoclonal antibody HA-11, Covance catalog number MMS-101P) was added to solution at 1:5000 dilution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibody solution was removed, and membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 20% Tween 20 for 30 min, changing the solution every 5–6 min. Membranes were incubated with secondary antibody (peroxidase-labeled affinity-purified antibody to mouse IgG (H+L), KPL catalog number 074-1806) in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, 20% Tween 20 at 1:75000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed as described above, incubated with SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce) for 5 min at room temperature before exposing to Kodak Biomax MR Film for visualization. Multiple Transcription Factors Affect GIT1 Transcript Abundance—The roles of the transcription factors Ino2p, Ino4p, Pho2p, and Pho4p in regulating GIT1 transcription in response to inositol and phosphate availability were investigated. Wild type cells grown to logarithmic phase in I-, low Pi and I+, low Pi media accumulated a GIT1 transcript (Fig. 2). When cell were grown in high Pi conditions, no transcript was detected. The pho4Δ and pho2Δ mutants accumulated no detectable GIT1 transcript under any growth conditions. Interestingly, ino2Δ and ino4Δ mutants accumulated no GIT1 transcript in the I-, low Pi condition but accumulated wild type levels of transcript in the I+, low Pi condition. The inositol auxotrophs, ino2Δ and ino4Δ, were grown in 5I-instead of I-medium, which is a concentration of inositol that does not fully repress the transcription of other genes known to be regulated by inositol (19Graves J.A. Henry S.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1485-1495Google Scholar). GIT1 Promoter Activity and GroPIns Transport Activity Do Not Necessarily Correlate—Our inability to detect GIT1 transcript by Northern analysis (Fig. 2) in cells grown in I-, high Pi medium, a condition which clearly supports Git1p-mediated transport (12Patton-Vogt J.L. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1707-1715Google Scholar, 13Almaguer C. Mantella D. Perez E. Patton-Vogt J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 729-736Google Scholar), prompted us to perform a more in-depth analysis of GIT1 expression and its relationship to transport activity. GIT1 expression was monitored via a reporter construct in which the GIT1 promoter was fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (cat) (13Almaguer C. Mantella D. Perez E. Patton-Vogt J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 729-736Google Scholar). GIT1 promoter activity as well as Git1p transport activity were monitored as a function of time following the transfer of cells from fully repressing medium (I+, high Pi) to various starvation media (Fig. 3). In contrast to the results obtained by Northern analysis, transfer of wild type cells into the I-, high Pi medium did result in a modest, but clearly detectable, increase in CAT activity. The transfer of wild type cells Fig. 3A) into low phosphate media (either containing or lacking inositol) resulted in a much larger increase in CAT activity that continued to rise even as the cells entered the postdiauxic shift (growth data not shown). The transport activity profiles looked quite different from those obtained for CAT activity. When wild type cells were grown under low phosphate conditions (with or without inositol), transport activity reached a maximum at 12 h and then declined. In contrast, cells starved for inositol alone displayed a smaller but sustained increase in transport activity (Fig. 3A). We have reported previously (12Patton-Vogt J.L. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1707-1715Google Scholar) that GroPIns transport activity is entirely GIT1-dependent at the concentration used in the assay (5 μm). In addition, no transport was detected when a git1Δ strain was used as a control in the experiments presented here (data not shown). The ino4Δ mutant grown in the I+, low Pi condition exhibited CAT activity similar to wild type cells grown in the same conditions (Fig. 3B). In contrast, when ino4Δ cells were grown in the I-, low Pi condition, no CAT activity was detected. Interestingly, ino4Δ cells displayed greatly reduced transport activity as compared with wild type under all growth conditions tested. The ino2Δ strain behaved nearly identical to the ino4Δ in terms of both CAT activity and transport (data not shown). These results suggest that Ino2p and Ino4p are able to affect transport in a manner independent of their role in regulating GIT1 transcription. Strains bearing deletions in PHO4 (Fig. 3C) or PHO2 (data not shown) produced little or no GIT1 promoter-driven CAT activity or Git1p transport activity under any growth condition. Inositol and Phosphate Availability Affect Git1p Abundance—Wild type cells bearing a chromosomal GIT1-HA construct were grown in I+. High Pi medium was transferred to the three growth conditions in which transport activity was detected, I-, low Pi; I+, low Pi; and I-, high Pi. Similar to the transport profiles, Git1p levels peaked and then declined as a function of time in cells starved for phosphate (Fig. 4). Little Git1p was detected in cells grown in I-, high Pi medium, consistent with the relatively low level of transport activity present under those conditions (Fig. 3A). Deletion of Potential Pho4p Binding Sites Results in Loss of GIT1 Promoter Activity—To identify the regions of the promoter important for GIT1 expression, a promoter deletion analysis was performed (Fig. 5). GIT1 promoter-driven CAT activity was compared in cells harboring one of three plasmids, plasmid pCA999 contains nucleotides from -7to -881 relative to the start codon, plasmid pWC639 contains nucleotides from -7 to -639, and plasmid pWC335 contains nucleotides from -7 to -335. Removal of one potential Pho4p binding element resulted in a 20–30% decrease in CAT activity in response to phosphate limitation. Removal of all three potential Pho4p binding elements resulted in complete loss of CAT induction in response to phosphate limitation (Fig. 5). Inositol and Phosphate Are Not High Affinity Substrates for Git1p—To determine whether inositol and/or phosphate directly affect transport activity, competition experiments were performed (Table II). If a compound has affinity for the transporter, we would expect that the addition of that compound (nonradioactive) to the assay mixture would compete with radiolabeled GroPIns and decrease the apparent transport activity. As expected, the addition of 200-fold excess of unlabeled GroPIns caused a large reduction in transport activity. In contrast, transport of radiolabeled GroPIns was unaffected by 200-fold excess of unlabeled inositol and was actually stimulated by a 200-fold excess of unlabeled sodium phosphate. Therefore, inositol and phosphate do not compete with GroPIns for transport by the Git1p permease. The results obtained by way of optimizing the GroPIns transport assay support the prediction that Git1p acts as a H+ symporter (20Paulsen I.T. Sliwinski M.K. Nelissen B. Goffeau A. Saier Jr., M.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 116-125Google Scholar). Transport activity decreases as the pH of the assay buffer increases (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the protonophore carbonyl cyanamide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, which destroys proton gradients, completely abolished transport activity (Table II). S. cerevisiae Can Utilize GroPIns as Sole Phosphate Source— The increase in GIT1 transcript and GroPIns transport activity by phosphate starvation suggested that yeast may utilize GroPIns as a source of phosphate. To test this hypothesis, cells grown in low phosphate medium were harvested, washed, and spotted onto phosphate-free culture plates lacking a phosphate source containing 75 μm KH2PO4 or containing 75 μm GroPIns. Wild type cells grew when provided with GroPIns as their sole source of phosphate in a GIT1-dependent fashion (Fig. 7). In contrast, the pho2Δ and pho4Δ mutants could not utilize GroPIns as the sole phosphate source. Interestingly, the ino2Δ and ino4Δ mutants grew similarly to wild type in both I+, GroPIns medium and I-, GroPIns medium. When the inositol auxotrophs ino2Δ and ino4Δ are grown in I-, GroPIns medium, GroPIns is acting as the sole phosphate and sole inositol source (note that ino2Δ and ino4Δ could grow in I+ medium containing 75 μm KH2PO4 but could not grow in I-medium containing 75 μm KH2PO4). Our results indicate that the signals of phosphate limitation and inositol limitation induce different but overlapping regulatory programs with regard to GIT1 expression. For example, the induction of GIT1 transcript accumulation upon phosphate limitation does not require INO2 and INO4, but INO2 and INO4 are required when phosphate limitation is combined with inositol limitation (Figs. 2 and 3). PHO2 and PHO4, on the other hand, are required for GIT1 transcript accumulation under all growth conditions tested (Figs. 2 and 3). The magnitude of the response elicited by phosphate starvation is much larger than that caused by inositol limitation in terms of expression and transport activity. We detected abundant GIT1 transcript (Fig. 2) and GIT1 promoter-driven CAT activity (Fig. 3) in cells grown in low Pi media with or without inositol. In contrast, we detected no transcript in cells grown in I-, high Pi, medium (Fig. 2) and detected low but reproducible levels of GIT1 promoter-driven CAT activity (Fig. 3). A possible explanation for the discrepancy between GIT1 message and promoter activity in I-, high Pi conditions is that the GIT1 message is very unstable, whereas the heterologous GIT1-cat message is less so. Transport activity is also differentially affected by phosphate limitation as compared with inositol limitation. Wild type cells grown in low Pi medium with or without inositol display severalfold greater transport activity than those grown in I-, high Pi medium. Our inability to detect GroPIns transport in git1Δ delete strains indicates that Git1p is indeed responsible for the GroPIns transport detected not an alternate transporter whose transcript we did not monitor. Our results suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms are also likely to be involved in the regulation of Git1p activity. When ino2Δ and ino4Δ are transferred to I+, low Pi medium, they exhibit an induction of CAT activity similar to that seen in the wild type strain but maximal transport activity that is roughly 4-fold less than that of the wild type strain (Fig. 3). Thus, Ino2p and Ino4p appear to affect, directly or indirectly, Git1p activity via a post-transcriptional mechanism in cells grown in I+, high Pi medium. One possibility is that Ino2p and Ino4p are required for the transcription of an unknown gene whose product activates Git1p. The exact nature of the post-transcriptional control rendered by Ino2p and Ino4p will be the subject of future studies. More evidence for post-translational regulation of Git1p activity is provided by observing wild type transport activity as a function of time after transfer of cells to low Pi medium. The increase and then decline in activity (Fig. 3A) are consistent with the results of the Western blot (Fig. 4) and suggest that Git1p may be regulated at the level of protein turnover or stability. Many yeast plasma membrane permeases undergo regulated endocytosis and vacuolar degradation (18Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Google Scholar, 25Lai K. Bolognese C.P. Swift S. McGraw P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2525-2534Google Scholar) and/or are regulated by phosphorylation (26Pinson B. Pillois X. Brethes D. Chevallier J. Napias C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 439-444Google Scholar). The role of regulated degradation in controlling Git1p activity is currently being investigated. The GIT1 promoter region (Fig. 5) contains potential Pho4p (CACGTK) and Pho2p (TAATRA/TAANTAA) binding sites (21Oshima Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 1997; 72: 323-334Google Scholar). Removal of the DNA containing three potential Pho4p binding sites (-640 and -330 relative to the start codon) abolishes transcript induction in response to phosphate limitation in both the presence and absence of inositol (Fig. 5). Pho4p, like Ino2p and Ino4p are bHLH binding proteins. The GIT1 promoter does not contain a copy of the UASINO core consensus sequence (CATGTG) but does contain a bHLH consensus sequence (CACGTG) to which Ino2p and Ino4p have been shown to bind to minimally activate INO1 transcription (22Bachhawat N. Ouyang Q. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25087-25095Google Scholar). Some bHLH binding proteins are known to form multiple dimer combinations that act upon diverse sets of genes (23Robinson K.A. Lopes J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1499-1505Google Scholar). Indeed, Ino4p has been shown by yeast two-hybrid and biochemical assays to interact with Pho4p (24Robinson K.A. Koepke J.I. Kharodawala M. Lopes J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4460-4466Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that Pho4p may heterodimerize with Ino2p or Ino4p to activate GIT1 transcription. The actual mechanism of regulation, however, must be more complex, as neither Ino2p nor Ino4p is required for transcript accumulation in cells grown in inositol-containing medium, and all four transcription factors are required when cells are grown in low Pi, I-medium. Clearly, further studies are required to elucidate the details of GIT1 transcriptional regulation and to prove a direct interaction between Pho4p, or any other DNA-binding protein, and the GIT1 promoter. We showed that inositol and phosphate do not effectively compete with GroPIns for transport by the Git1p permease. Neither a 200-fold excess of Pi nor a 200-fold excess of inositol inhibits GroPIns transport in short term transport assays (Table II) (12Patton-Vogt J.L. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1707-1715Google Scholar). Others have reported that a strain in which all known phosphate transporter genes (PHO84, PHO87, PHO89, PHO90, PHO91) have been deleted is viable in high Pi medium if GIT1 is overexpressed but not when GIT1 is present in single copy (27Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Google Scholar). Because the medium did not contain exogenous GroPIns (27Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Google Scholar), Git1p must have some limited affinity for Pi. Like the major phosphate transporter, Pho84p (2Persson B.L. Lagerstedt J.O. Pratt J.R. Pattison-Granberg J. Lundh K. Shokrollahzadeh S. Lundh F. Curr. Genet. 2003; 43: 225-244Google Scholar), Git1p appears to act as a H+ symporter. The evidence for H+-coupled uptake is the observed decrease in transport activity with increasing buffer pH (Fig. 6) and the abolishment of transport activity by the protonophore carbonyl cyanamide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (Table II). In previous studies, we have shown that GroPIns can act as the sole source of inositol (12Patton-Vogt J.L. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1707-1715Google Scholar). Remarkably, we report that GroPIns can also act as the sole source of phosphate for the cell in a manner that supports robust growth (Fig. 7). In fact, there is no discernable difference in growth when the wild type strain is supplied with 75 μm GroPIns as compared with 75 μm KH2PO4. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a phosphate-containing organic molecule (GroPIns) acting as the sole phosphate source for a eukaryotic cell. Indeed, the inositol auxotrophic strains, ino2Δ and ino4Δ, grow robustly when GroPIns is acting as the sole source of both inositol and phosphate (Fig. 7). Through the action of phospholipase B, S. cerevisiae hydrolyzes external phosphatidylinositol to release GroPIns (13Almaguer C. Mantella D. Perez E. Patton-Vogt J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 729-736Google Scholar). Thus, the combination of external phospholipases and Git1p provide yeast with the capability of obtaining crucial nutrients (inositol and phosphate) from environments in which PI or its deacylation product, GroPIns, are available. In a natural environment, the source of PI or GroPIns may be such things as decaying fruit or plant exudates (28Naumov G.I. Naumova E.S. Sniegowski P.D. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 1045-1050Google Scholar). Once inside the cell, GroPIns must be metabolized to liberate inositol and phosphate (Fig. 1). The gene products involved likely include one or more glycerophosphodiesterases and glycerol phosphatases. We are in the process of determining the genes and enzymatic activities responsible for this metabolism. We thank John Lopes and George Carman for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2068588733,"Tripeptidyl-peptidase I (TPP I, CLN2 protein) is a lysosomal aminopeptidase that cleaves off tripeptides from the free N termini of oligopeptides and also shows minor endopeptidase activity. TPP I is synthesized as a preproenzyme. Its proenzyme autoactivates under acidic conditions in vitro, resulting in a rapid conversion into the mature form. In this study, we examined the process of maturation in vitro of recombinant latent human TPP I purified to homogeneity from secretions of Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing TPP I cDNA. Autoprocessing of TPP I proenzyme was carried out at a wide pH range, from ∼2.0 to 6.0, albeit with different efficiencies depending on the pH and the type of buffer. However, the acquisition of enzymatic activity in the same buffer took place in a narrower pH “window,” usually in the range of 3.6–4.2. N-terminal sequencing revealed that mature, inactive enzyme generated during autoactivation at higher pH contained N-terminal extensions (starting at 6 and 14 amino acid residues upstream of the prosegment/mature enzyme junction), which could contribute to the lack of activity of TPP I generated in this manner. Autoprocessing was not associated with any major changes of the secondary structure of the proenzyme, as revealed by CD spectroscopy. Both the activation and proteolytic processing of the recombinant TPP I precursor were primarily concentration-independent. The addition of the mature enzyme did not accelerate the processing of the proenzyme. In addition, the maturation of the proenzyme was not affected by the presence of glycerol. Finally, the proenzyme with the active site mutated (S475L) was not processed in the presence of the wild-type enzyme. All of these findings indicate a primarily intramolecular (unimolecular) mechanism of TPP I activation and autoprocessing and suggest that in vivo mature enzyme does not significantly participate in its own generation from the precursor. Tripeptidyl-peptidase I (TPP I, CLN2 protein) is a lysosomal aminopeptidase that cleaves off tripeptides from the free N termini of oligopeptides and also shows minor endopeptidase activity. TPP I is synthesized as a preproenzyme. Its proenzyme autoactivates under acidic conditions in vitro, resulting in a rapid conversion into the mature form. In this study, we examined the process of maturation in vitro of recombinant latent human TPP I purified to homogeneity from secretions of Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing TPP I cDNA. Autoprocessing of TPP I proenzyme was carried out at a wide pH range, from ∼2.0 to 6.0, albeit with different efficiencies depending on the pH and the type of buffer. However, the acquisition of enzymatic activity in the same buffer took place in a narrower pH “window,” usually in the range of 3.6–4.2. N-terminal sequencing revealed that mature, inactive enzyme generated during autoactivation at higher pH contained N-terminal extensions (starting at 6 and 14 amino acid residues upstream of the prosegment/mature enzyme junction), which could contribute to the lack of activity of TPP I generated in this manner. Autoprocessing was not associated with any major changes of the secondary structure of the proenzyme, as revealed by CD spectroscopy. Both the activation and proteolytic processing of the recombinant TPP I precursor were primarily concentration-independent. The addition of the mature enzyme did not accelerate the processing of the proenzyme. In addition, the maturation of the proenzyme was not affected by the presence of glycerol. Finally, the proenzyme with the active site mutated (S475L) was not processed in the presence of the wild-type enzyme. All of these findings indicate a primarily intramolecular (unimolecular) mechanism of TPP I activation and autoprocessing and suggest that in vivo mature enzyme does not significantly participate in its own generation from the precursor.

CLN2 protein) (EC 3.4.14.9) is a lysosomal aminopeptidase that cleaves off tripeptides from the free N termini of polypeptides (1Tomkinson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 355-359Google Scholar) and also shows minor endopeptidase activity (2Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Oda K. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 904-908Google Scholar). In humans, TPP I is widely distributed in various tissues and organs, especially those associated with the production of peptide hormones and neuropeptides (3Kida E. Golabek A.A. Walus M. Wujek P. Kaczmarski W. Wisniewski K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 280-292Google Scholar, 4Kurachi Y. Oka A. Itoh M. Misuguchi M. Hayashi M. Takashima S. Acta Neuropathol. 2001; 102: 20-26Google Scholar). The importance of TPP I to the function and structure of brain tissue is underscored by the fact that naturally occurring mutations in the enzyme lead to a fatal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, the classic late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2) (5Sleat D.E. Donnelly R.J. Lackland H. Liu C.-G. Sohar I. Pullarkat R.K. Lobel P. Science. 1997; 277: 1802-1805Google Scholar, 6Sleat D.E. Gin R.M. Sohar I. Wisniewski K.E. Sklower Brooks S. Pullarkat R. Palmer D.N. Lerner T.J. Boustany R.M. Uldall P. Siakotos A.N. Donnelly R.J. Lobel P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1511-1523Google Scholar). The CLN2 disease process is associated with the accumulation of autofluorescent storage material in various tissues and organs; however, only the brain and retinae show severe damage with neuronal loss and gliosis (7Kida E. Wisniewski K.E. Golabek A.A. Adv. Genet. 2001; 45: 35-68Google Scholar). Patients with naturally occurring mutations in TPP I develop, by the age of 2–4 years, seizures and cognitive decline, followed by visual loss and cerebellar, pyramidal, and extrapyramidal signs, causing death in the second decade of life (8Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. Golabek A.A. Kaczmarski W. Connell F. Zhong N. Adv. Genet. 2001; 45: 1-34Google Scholar). Rare mutations leading to preservation of residual TPP I activity cause protracted, slightly milder clinical phenotypes (9Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. Connell F. Kaczmarski W. Kaczmarski A. Michalewski M.P. Zhong N. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 66: 248-252Google Scholar, 10Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. Walus M. Wujek P. Kaczmarski W. Golabek A.A. Eur. J. Paediatr. Neurol. 2001; 5 (Suppl. A): 73-79Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies allowed identification of Ser475 as an active site nucleophile of TPP I and identification of Asp360 and Asp517 as residues essential for catalytic activity (11Lin L. Sohar I. Lackland H. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2249-2255Google Scholar). Sequence alignments suggested (5Sleat D.E. Donnelly R.J. Lackland H. Liu C.-G. Sohar I. Pullarkat R.K. Lobel P. Science. 1997; 277: 1802-1805Google Scholar) that TPP I may belong, together with other pepstatin-insensitive proteinases from Pseudomonas sp. 101, Bacillus novosp. MN-32, Xanthomonas sp. T-22, Bacillus coagulans (J-4), and some not yet purified proteins, to a family of serine-carboxyl proteinases (12Wlodawer A. Li M. Gustchina A. Oyama H. Dunn B.M. Oda K. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2003; 50: 81-102Google Scholar). The crystal structure of two members of the serine-carboxyl proteinase family, from Pseudomonas sp. 101 (13Wlodawer A. Li M. Dauter Z. Gustchina A. Uchida K. Oyama H. Dunn B.M. Oda K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 442-446Google Scholar) and Bacillus novosp. MN-32 (14Comellas-Bigler M. Fuentes-Prior P. Maskos K. Huber R. Oyama H. Uchida K. Dunn B.M. Oda K. Bode W. Structure. 2002; 10: 865-876Google Scholar), has been solved recently. This family, classified as S53 in the MER-OPS data base, has been recently renamed sedolisins for a unique catalytic triad, Ser-Glu-Asp (or SED) (12Wlodawer A. Li M. Gustchina A. Oyama H. Dunn B.M. Oda K. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2003; 50: 81-102Google Scholar). Thus, TPP I emerged as the first mammalian member of the sedolisin family identified to date; however, structural analyses are necessary to provide detailed characterization of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Because of the degradative function of lysosomal proteinases, it is essential that they are subjected to control mechanisms that ensure spatial and temporal regulation so that the enzymes function only where and when needed. Thus, lysosomal proteinases are synthesized as inactive precursors (zymogens), which, during or upon arrival to lysosomes, are proteolytically cleaved to yield a mature active enzyme. To date, cDNA sequences of mouse, rat, dog, cow, Macaca, and human TPP I have been described as encoding preproenzymes of 562–563 amino acid residues. The human preproenzyme contains a 19-amino acid signal peptide, which is cleaved off cotranslationally when the protein is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and a 176-amino acid propeptide removed during the maturation process to yield a mature enzyme of 368 amino acid residues (5Sleat D.E. Donnelly R.J. Lackland H. Liu C.-G. Sohar I. Pullarkat R.K. Lobel P. Science. 1997; 277: 1802-1805Google Scholar, 11Lin L. Sohar I. Lackland H. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2249-2255Google Scholar, 15Liu C.-G. Sleat D.E. Donnelly R.J. Lobel P. Genomics. 1998; 50: 206-212Google Scholar). The proteolytic removal of the inhibitory prosegment, leading to the release of the active enzyme, is also referred to as “activation” of the protease. The cleavage of the prosegment can be accomplished either by other enzymes (in an intermolecular event) or by the same enzyme, either in an intramolecular (in cis) or intermolecular (in trans) fashion. The most common factor triggering the autoactivation of the zymogens of the cysteine, aspartic, and metalloprotease classes is a drop in pH (16Erickson A.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40: 31-41Google Scholar, 17Takeda-Ezaki M. Yamamoto K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 352-358Google Scholar, 18Mach L. Mort J.S. Glossl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Google Scholar). Indeed, Lin et al. (11Lin L. Sohar I. Lackland H. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2249-2255Google Scholar) demonstrated that TPP I proenzyme (pro-TPP I), similarly to other lysosomal proteases, is activated in vitro upon acidification. Recently, we have shown that pro-TPP I is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomes mainly via the mannose 6-phosphate-dependent pathway. In lysosomes, pro-TPP I matures through a proteolytic cleavage facilitated by a serine-type protease sensitive to 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) (19Golabek A.A. Kida E. Walus M. Wujek P. Mehta P. Wisniewski K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7135-7145Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although our studies suggested that another serine-type protease assists in pro-TPP I processing in vivo, this does not preclude the possibility that under certain physiological and pathological conditions, autoactivation of pro-TPP I in vivo might play an important role. To date, no detailed description of the autoactivation mechanism of pro-TPP I in vitro has been presented. Here, by using various methods, we studied the autoactivation and autoprocessing of human pro-TPP I purified from secretions of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing TPP I cDNA, as a function of pH, concentration, and temperature. We demonstrate that recombinant pro-TPP I is predominantly activated by a unimolecular autocatalytic mechanism and that the autocatalytic conversion of the proenzyme into the mature form is primarily the result of intramolecular processing. Purification of Human TPP I Proenzyme—Human pro-TPP I was purified from serum-free secretions of CHO-DHFR– cells (ATCC CRL-9096) stably transfected with plasmid encoding the full-length human TPP I, either wild-type (wt) or S475L mutant. Vector preparation, cell transfection, and selection were performed as described previously (19Golabek A.A. Kida E. Walus M. Wujek P. Mehta P. Wisniewski K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7135-7145Google Scholar). The S475L mutation (6Sleat D.E. Gin R.M. Sohar I. Wisniewski K.E. Sklower Brooks S. Pullarkat R. Palmer D.N. Lerner T.J. Boustany R.M. Uldall P. Siakotos A.N. Donnelly R.J. Lobel P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1511-1523Google Scholar), which replaces the active site nucleophile of TPP I (11Lin L. Sohar I. Lackland H. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2249-2255Google Scholar), was introduced to wt TPP I cDNA by the PCR-based method (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) using the primers ggtgtccggaaccttggcctctactccagtg (forward) and cactggagtagaggccaaggttccggacac (reverse). As an initial purification step of wt TPP I, ∼500 ml of serum-free cell culture medium conditioned for 5 days was clarified by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), concentrated to ∼5 ml, and equilibrated with 20 mm NaCl in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) by using the Centricon Plus PL-30 centrifugal filtration device (Millipore). Concentrated cell secretions were applied to the Source 15Q HPLC anion-exchange column (0.46 × 10 cm) run on the ÄKTAexplorer HPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A and 500 mm NaCl in buffer A (buffer B) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions containing the highest TPP I activity (eluting at about 200 mm NaCl) were pooled, adjusted to buffer B, and applied to a 1 × 5 cm concanavalin A-Sepharose column (Sigma). Unbound material was washed with buffer B, and bound pro-TPP I was eluted with 500 mm methyl α-d-mannopyranoside in buffer B. Concanavalin A eluate was concentrated, and buffer was exchanged to buffer B and then applied to a calibrated Superose 12 column (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Biosciences) at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluted pro-TPP I was finally concentrated to ∼4 mg/ml and kept in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50% glycerol at –20 °C. S475L pro-TPP I mutant was purified in a similar fashion from ∼100 ml of cell secretions. Time Course Analysis of TPP I Proenzyme Activation and Processing—Twice-concentrated stock solutions of purified wt pro-TPP I in 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl at the final concentrations specified in the figure legends were mixed at zero time with an equal volume of 200 mm sodium acetate (activation buffer) and maintained at 37 °C. At the indicated time points, an aliquot of 10 μl was withdrawn and combined with either 10 μl of 0.5 m NaOH (for SDS-PAGE analysis) or 40 μl of 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (for TPP I activity measurement). Experimental data points were analyzed by least square nonlinear curve fitting with the help of GraphPad Prism 3.0 software. TPP I Activity Measurement—Unless otherwise stated, TPP I activity was measured in the presence of 100 μm substrate Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AAF-AMC) (Bachem), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, in a total volume of 100 μl. At this pH, TPP I demonstrates near-maximal activity, and no further activation of pro-TPP I takes place during TPP I activity measurements (see below). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min and was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 10% SDS. Released AMC was measured fluorometrically on a CytoFluor 2000 (Applied Biosystems) (excitation wavelength, 360 nm; emission wavelength, 460 nm; both slits set at 40 nm) after alkalizing the solution by adding 50 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 9.0. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Samples were solubilized in the reducing sample buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto 10% Tris/Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoretically separated proteins were stained with either Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver nitrate or were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose or Immobilon-PSQ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Nitrocellulose membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), incubated overnight with monoclonal antibody 8C4, an anti-TPP I monoclonal antibody characterized previously (3Kida E. Golabek A.A. Walus M. Wujek P. Kaczmarski W. Wisniewski K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 280-292Google Scholar), then washed extensively in PBST, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:5,000, and developed by using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were stained with 0.1% Amido Black in 10% acetic acid and destained in 5% acetic acid. Appropriate bands were excised from the membrane and applied to automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 494/HT PROCISE sequencer, which was controlled by PRO-CISE software and a 610/A data analysis system. Circular Dichroism Measurement—Purified TPP I proenzyme was dissolved either in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, or in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.5, 4.0, and 5.0, and 50 mm NaCl at a concentration of 60 μg/ml, was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and was centrifuged. The CD spectra were recorded on AVIV CD spectrometer model 215. A 300-μl quartz cell with a path length of 1 mm was used. Five consecutive readings at 1 nm bandwidth, response time of 0.25 s, and resolution at 1 nm were taken from each sample and were averaged, base line-subtracted, and noise-reduced. Results are expressed in terms of mean residue molar ellipticity (θ). Purification of Pro-TPP I—By using a combination of anion-exchange chromatography, concanavalin A affinity chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography, wt pro-TPP I was purified to an apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1). The overall yield was about 14 mg of purified protein/1 liter of conditioned medium with about 30% recovery. S475L pro-TPP I mutant was purified to homogeneity in a similar way, albeit with lower yield (not shown). Purified proteins remained stable in 50% glycerol and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at –20 °C (not shown). TPP I Maturation in Vitro Is a pH-driven Process—In an initial approach to characterize the maturation of pro-TPP I in vitro, purified protein was incubated at various pH levels, and then small aliquots were withdrawn at 2, 15, and 120 min and analyzed for TPP I activity. In addition, samples incubated for 120 min were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After 2-min incubation, significant activity toward a reporter substrate was present in the samples maintained at pH 2.0–3.0 and to a lesser extent at pH 3.6 (Fig. 2A). No activity was observed in the samples incubated at pH 1.0 and pH 4.0 and above. The samples incubated for 15 min showed the highest activity at pH 2.6–3.6. After 120 min, the highest activity was present in the samples incubated at pH 2.6–4.2. Again, no autoactivation was noted at pH 4.6 and above. Although TPP I activity was evident in the samples incubated at pH 2.0 for 2 min, it was absent after longer periods of incubation at this pH, suggesting that at pH 2.0, mature enzyme was inactivated shortly after its generation. Maximal TPP I activity in the samples incubated for 2, 15, and 120 min was observed at pH values 2.6, 3.0, and 3.6, respectively. This time-dependent switch of maximal activity toward less acidic pH suggests that once generated, TPP I is slowly inactivated at pH below 3.6. These findings also demonstrate that pro-TPP I does not possess an intrinsic enzymatic activity without prior activation. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that similarly to autoactivation, autoprocessing of pro-TPP I is also pH-dependent (Fig. 2B). Pro-TPP I was fully processed to the mature form at pH 2.6–4.0 and was partially processed at pH 1.0–2.0 and pH 4.6–6.0. Of interest, mature TPP I polypeptide generated at higher pH (4.6 and above) displayed slightly lower, by ∼1–2 kDa, electrophoretic mobility than mature TPP I resulting from autoactivation at pH 2.6–3.6. Notably, in the same pH range (4.6–5.0) a significant pro-TPP I processing occurred without concomitant acquisition of TPP I activity (compare A and B of Fig. 2), suggesting that mature TPP I with small N-terminal extensions is enzymatically inactive. Time Course of Autoactivation—The rate of autoactivation of pro-TPP I was measured at pH 3.5 and 4.0 as a function of time and proenzyme concentration. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, the rate of appearance of enzymatic activity versus time at pH 3.5 and 37 °C could be fit to a one-phase exponential association equation, indicating an apparent single-step process. The half-time of the acquisition of the maximal activity under these conditions is about 0.7 min. However, the rate of acquisition of enzymatic activity versus time at pH 3.5 at room temperature (Fig. 3C) could be fit to a two-phase exponential association equation, indicating an apparent two-step process. The slopes of the activation curves at both room temperature and 37 °C are largely independent of the starting pro-TPP I concentrations (Fig. 3, B and D), which suggests that the activation of the human pro-TPP I in vitro is principally an intramolecular (zero-order) process under the conditions tested. Slightly different activation curves were obtained for pro-TPP I proenzyme incubated at pH 4.0 at 37 °C. As depicted in Fig. 3E, an increase in activity versus time is characterized by a lag period, followed by a first-order process. The presence of the lag phase in autoactivation curves of pro-TPP I at pH 4.0 suggests that under these conditions, the activation is clearly a two-step reaction. However, as illustrated in Fig. 3F, the apparent rates of pro-TPP I activation are again independent of the initial proenzyme concentration, further pointing to an intramolecular mechanism of pro-TPP I autoactivation in vitro, with kinetics governed by the pH. Time Course of Autoprocessing—To study the kinetics of TPP I autoprocessing, pro-TPP I at a concentration of 50 nm was activated at pH 3.5 and 4.0 at 37 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn at the time points indicated, neutralized, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Time course analysis of the reaction mixture, seen in Fig. 4, A and B, showed that pro-TPP I at time 0 consists of a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa. During incubation at pH 3.5 and 4.0, the 70-kDa band diminishes in strength, while several new protein species with lower molecular masses appear. Split products of TPP I autocatalytic cleavage at pH 3.5 include a ∼48-kDa band corresponding to the mature enzyme and 15–19-kDa polypeptide doublets corresponding to liberated fragments of TPP I prosegment. These proteolytic fragments appear early and concomitantly with the mature TPP I polypeptide as early as ∼10 s after initiation of the activation (Fig. 4A, second lane). Autoactivation progressed so rapidly that after 2 min only a weak band corresponding to pro-TPP I could be seen. An increase in intensity of the mature TPP I band correlated well with the intensity of the generated prosegment polypeptides. With time, however, the intensity of the doublet corresponding to prosegment fragments with a lower molecular mass increased at the expense of the fragments with higher molecular mass, suggesting that prosegment fragments are processed slowly by mature TPP I. A similar pattern of pro-TPP I autoprocessing was observed at pH 4.0 (Fig. 4B). However, at this pH, the cleavage of pro-TPP I was significantly slower than at pH 3.5, requiring ∼2 h for completion. In addition, at pH 4.0, the cleaved-off polypeptides appeared to be more stable than at pH 3.5, although they became detectable later. A band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa was also occasionally detected, especially on immunoblots, which suggests that the proteolytic removal of the prosegment occurred in at least two steps. We also studied the processing of pro-TPP I as a function of its initial concentration. The kinetics of pro-TPP I autoprocessing was independent of initial pro-TPP I concentration in the range of 1.5 nm–1.5 μm (not shown). Autoprocessing of pro-TPP I was also temperature-dependent. Half-maximum cleavage of pro-TPP I at pH 3.5 occurred after 3 min at 25 °C and after 16 min at 0 °C (not shown). In addition, the full set of protease inhibitors in the activation solution (Complete, Roche Applied Science) affected neither the kinetics of autoprocessing nor the pattern of polypeptides generated (not shown), which suggests that in vitro maturation of pro-TPP I was not conferred by another, contaminating protease that might have co-purified in minute amounts along with TPP I. Edman degradation of the two prosegment fragments released during pro-TPP I autoprocessing at pH 3.5 (as in Fig. 4A) revealed that they both contain an intact N terminus of the prosegment, namely the sequence SYSPEP. Time course analysis of the proteolytic generation of mature TPP I in relation to the acquisition of enzyme activity is presented in Fig. 5. Autocatalytic cleavage of pro-TPP I at pH 3.5 (Fig. 5A) was a rapid first-order process, correlating very well with the activation curve. However, at pH 4.0 (Fig. 5B), the acquisition of specific TPP I activity was delayed in comparison with generation of the mature polypeptide. The presence of the lag period in the activation curve versus proteolytic processing suggests that an additional step of processing, structural rearrangement, and/or dissociation is required before full activity of the newly generated enzyme could be realized. We hypothesized that this second step might involve a structural change in the vicinity of the catalytic cleft. To assess whether in vitro maturation of TPP I is associated with significant structural rearrangement in pro-TPP I, we used CD measurement of pro-TPP I before and after activation. CD Analysis—The far-UV CD spectrum gives a measure of the secondary structure of the protein. Pro-TPP I was incubated for 2 h at pH 8.0, 5.0, 4.0, or 3.5, and its CD spectra were recorded. Apart from a small increase in mean residue ellipticity for pro-TPP I incubated at pH 5.0 and 4.0 in the α/β region of the spectrum (205–225 nm), the CD spectra for TPP I incubated at various pH levels were similar (Fig. 6). These results indicate that there is no large scale conformational change in the secondary structure of pro-TPP I when the pH is lowered from neutral to acidic. If conformational changes had occurred, they would have been either localized and/or very small. Transactivation of Pro-TPP I in Vitro —To determine whether the active enzyme could facilitate generation of mature TPP I from the proenzyme, pro-TPP I was activated at various pH levels in the presence or absence of mature TPP I and analyzed for both processing and activation. As depicted in Fig. 7, in the pH range of 2.8–6.2, the presence of the mature TPP I (so-called seed) at 1:100 molar ratio to pro-TPP I affected neither the pH-dependent processing (Fig. 7A) nor the activation profile (Fig. 7B) of pro-TPP I. These results confirm that in vitro maturation of pro-TPP I is an intramolecular event. In addition, analysis of Western blots revealed an additional product of pro-TPP I cleavage, evident especially at higher pH (Fig. 7A, lanes 7 and 8, asterisk). This band had an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa and was often visible on immunoblots under various conditions used for autoprocessing studies, but it was hardly distinguishable on silver-stained gels. This polypeptide might represent a short lived, unstable intermediate of pro-TPP I autoprocessing. The Effect of Buffer Type on Maturation of Pro-TPP I in Vitro —Because phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 4.6, afforded significant processing of pro-TPP I without (Fig. 2) or with (Fig. 7B) marginal activation, we also analyzed the autoactivation and autoprocessing of pro-TPP I in other types of buffers at pH 4.5. As illustrated in Fig. 8A, after 2-h incubation, autocatalytic cleavage of pro-TPP I was complete in phosphate, glycine, and formate buffers, almost complete in citrate buffer, and significant in acetate buffer, independent of the presence of the seed of mature TPP I. However, under the same experimental conditions, the complete autoactivation was achieved only in phosphate buffer, while still significant but lower TPP I activity was also present in glycine and formate buffers (Fig. 8B), again independent of the presence of the seed. In contrast, only residual TPP I activity was present in pro-TPP I activated in acetate and citrate buffers at pH 4.5, despite distinct processing of pro-TPP I in these samples. Hence, these results suggested once again that at higher pH (∼4.0 and above), in vitro maturation of pro-TPP I involves at least two steps: initial cleavage of the prosegment region and dissociation and/or degradation of the released prosegment. To evaluate whether inactive processed TPP I generated from pro-TPP I is able to resume full activity under the permissive pH, pro-TPP I was first incubated in acetate buffer at pH 4.5. Its activity was measured, and then the pH in the sample was reduced to 3.5 (Fig. 8C). After 3-h incubation at pH 4.5, a"

Although relatively less efficient compared with other aquaporins, MIP is suggested to function as a water channel, as an adhesion molecule, and is required for lens transparency. Because MIP is specifically expressed in lens fiber cells, we investigated in this study the activation of Mip expression after triggering differentiation of rat lens epithelia explants by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. Here, we show that Mip expression in the lens cells is regulated by FGF-2. Using Real time PCR we demonstrate that endogenous Mip levels in the explants were up-regulated upon FGF-2 stimulation, in a concentration-dependent manner. Up-regulation of Mip at the transcriptional level was simultaneous with the activation of the FGF down-stream signaling components, ERK1/2 and JNK. Specific inhibitors, UO126 for ERK1/2 and SP600125 for JNK, abrogated Mip expression in response to FGF-2 in the explants. This inhibition pattern was recapitulated in reporter assays for transfection of the rat lens epithelia explants, driven by the Mip promoter (-1648/+44). Our studies show that ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways are required for Mip expression in lens epithelia explants induced to differentiate by FGF-2.

Our studies show that ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways are required for Mip expression in lens epithelia explants induced to differentiate by FGF-2. The vertebrate lens is composed by an anterior layer of cuboidal epithelial cells and differentiated fiber cells that comprise the bulk of the tissue (1McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. de Iongh R.U. Hales A.M. Lovicu F.J. Eye. 1999; 13: 425-437Google Scholar). During embryonic development and throughout the life of the organism, fiber cells are added via differentiation of the lens epithelial cells. Spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression is required to maintain the transparency and correct refractive index of the ocular lens. Major intrinsic protein (MIP) 1The abbreviations used are: MIP, major intrinsic protein; AQP1, aquaporin 1; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK,c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinse; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: MIP, major intrinsic protein; AQP1, aquaporin 1; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK,c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinse; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase. is a polypeptide found exclusively in the membranes of lens fiber cells. It was first isolated as the most abundant protein of the fiber cell membrane (2Chepelinsky A.B. J. Exp. Zool. Part A Comp. Exp. Biol. 2003; 300: 41-46Google Scholar). Subsequent to the identification of AQP1 as a water channel in red blood cells, MIP (also known as AQP0) was shown to be permeable to water (3Varadaraj K. Kushmerick C. Baldo G.J. Bassnett S. Shiels A. Mathias R.T. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 191-203Google Scholar, 4Mulders S.M. Preston G.M. Deen P.M. Guggino W.B. van Os C.H. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9010-9016Google Scholar, 5Verkman A.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 137-143Google Scholar), although this permeability is much lower than for most other AQPs. MIP may also have structural roles in the lens fibers, functioning as a cell to cell adhesion molecule (6Fotiadis D. Hasler L. Muller D.J. Stahlberg H. Kistler J. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 779-789Google Scholar, 7Michea L.F. Andrinolo D. Ceppi H. Lagos N. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 293-301Google Scholar), playing a role in gap junction formation (8Yu X.S. Jiang J.X. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 871-880Google Scholar, 9Dunia I. Recouvreur M. Nicolas P. Kumar N. Bloemendal H. Benedetti E.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2109-2120Google Scholar) and in organizing γ-crystallins (10Fan J. Donovan A.K. Ledee D.R. Zelenka P.S. Fariss R.N. Chepelinsky A.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 863-871Google Scholar). In this way, MIP may play an important role in maintaining lens transparency by reducing the inter-fiber space and is required for the normal focusing properties of the lens (11Shiels A. Bassnett S. Varadaraj K. Mathias R. Al-Ghoul K. Kuszak J. Donoviel D. Lilleberg S. Friedrich G. Zambrowicz B. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 7: 179-186Google Scholar). During cataractogenesis and aging, MIP undergoes selective proteolysis that may modulate gating of the MIP channels (12Boyle D.L. Takemoto L.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 41-49Google Scholar) and its adhesive properties (13Grey A.C. Jacobs M.D. Gonen T. Kistler J. Donaldson P.J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 567-574Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the Mip gene have been linked to the mouse genetic cataracts Fraser (CatFr), lens opacity (lop), Hfi, Tohm (14Shiels A. Mackay D. Bassnett S. Al-Ghoul K. Kuszak J.

Although expression of the Mip gene in the lens is tightly regulated temporally and spatially during embryogenesis, signaling cascades involved in this process remain unidentified. Growth factors such as FGFs, insulin-like growth factor-1, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and insulin are shown to promote proliferation of lens epithelial cells and differentiation into fiber cells in rats and chicken (19Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 125-134Google Scholar, 20McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228Google Scholar, 21Kok A. Lovicu F.J. Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W.

Recently, BMP was shown to participate in fiber cell differentiation (25Belecky-Adams T.L. Adler R. Beebe D.C. Development. 2002; 129: 3795-3802Google Scholar, 26Faber S.C. Robinson M.L. Makarenkova H.P. Lang R.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3727-3737Google Scholar). The binding of growth factors to their cell surface receptors leads to the activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase eventually transducing the signals into cellular targets via distinct downstream signaling molecules (27Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2332-2337Google Scholar). FGFs regulate a multitude of biological phenomena including adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (19Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 125-134Google Scholar, 20McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228Google Scholar, 28Boilly B. Vercoutter-Edouart A.S. Hondermarck H. Nurcombe V. Le B.X Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 295-302Google Scholar). Overexpression of secreted FGF-1, -3, -4, -7, -8, and -9 in the lens of transgenic mice causes the premature differentiation of anterior epithelial cells into fiber cells (29Robinson M.L. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Thompson J.A. Overbeek P.A. Development. 1995; 121: 3959-3967Google Scholar, 30Robinson M.L. Ohtaka-Maruyama C. Chan C.C. Jamieson S. Dickson C. Overbeek P.A. Chepelinsky A.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 198: 13-31Google Scholar, 31Lovicu F.J. Overbeek P.A. Development. 1998; 125: 3365-3377Google Scholar). However, overexpression of secreted FGF-2 suggests a role in modulating fiber cell differentiation and survival (32Stolen C.M. Jackson M.W. Griep A.E. Development. 1997; 124: 4009-4017Google Scholar). Experiments using dominant-negative FGF receptors also provide insights into the role of FGFs in lens cell survival (29Robinson M.L. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Thompson J.A. Overbeek P.A. Development. 1995; 121: 3959-3967Google Scholar, 33Chow R.L. Roux G.D. Roghani M. Palmer M.A. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D.A. Lang R.A. Development. 1995; 121: 4383-4393Google Scholar, 34Stolen C.M. Griep A.E. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 205-220Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that FGF-1 or FGF-2 can stimulate either proliferation or differentiation of explanted rat lens epithelia in a dose-dependent manner (19Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 125-134Google Scholar, 20McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228Google Scholar). In this study, we have used explanted rat lens epithelia induced to differentiate by FGF-2 to address the molecular mechanisms that determine how FGF signaling regulates Mip expression. Here we show that FGF-2 induces Mip expression in explanted lens epithelia. We provide evidence that both FGF-induced ERK1/2 and JNK activation result in the up-regulation of Mip at the transcriptional level. FGF-2 ability to up-regulate Mip gene expression is obliterated in the presence of a specific JNK inhibitor. We further demonstrate that an Mip active promoter (-1648/+44 bp) responds to ERK and JNK inhibitors in a similar way as the endogenous Mip gene. Our results suggest that both ERK and JNK signaling pathways downstream of FGF activation are required for Mip expression and JNK activation is pivotal in addition to ERK activation. Reagents—The MIP-specific polyclonal antiserum was obtained from Alpha Diagnostic (San Antonio, TX). Antibodies to total ERK (rabbit polyclonal), total JNK (rabbit polyclonal), phospho-ERK (mouse monoclonal), and phospho-JNK (mouse monoclonal) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). UO126, an inhibitor of ERK activation, was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK activation, was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Plasmids—pMIP1648-luc, pMIP598-luc, and pMIP461-luc reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning the DNA fragment containing the 1648-, 598-, or 461-bp 5′-flanking regions, respectively, plus 44-bp exon 1 sequence of a mouse Mip genomic clone 2C. Ohtaka-Maruyama, X. Y. Wang, and A. B. Chepelinsky, unpublished data. into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) upstream of the luciferase gene. For internal control and positive controls, phRL-CMV and pGL3-Control (SV40 promoter) vectors were used (Promega). DNA Sequencing—DNA sequencing of plasmid constructions was performed with a commercial system (CEQ DTCS Quick Start Kit; Beckman-Coulter, Hialeah, FL) and an automated DNA analysis system (CEQ 2000XL; Beckman-Coulter), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lens Epithelia Explants Culture—Eyes were dissected from 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). The lens capsule with adhering epithelial cells was microdissected from the lens fibers and pinned down around its periphery with forceps onto the surface of a 35-mm culture dish. The resulting lens epithelia explants (3–5 explants per culture dish) were cultured according to the method previously described (19Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 125-134Google Scholar), in Medium 199 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1% gentamycin, and 100 ng/ml FGF-2 (Sigma) to induce differentiation (20McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228Google Scholar) or at the indicated FGF-2 concentrations. All animals were treated in compliance with the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC International). The study protocol was approved by the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee. Transfections of Explants and Luciferase Assays—After 24 h culture, the explants were transfected with various luciferase reporter constructs (2 μg) along with the internal control phRL-CMV Renilla luciferase vector (0.02 μg) using the Effectene transfection reagent kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. After a 72-h transfection (4 days in culture), the explants were removed with forceps under the microscope and lysed. The dual luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a PE Applied Biosystems TR717 Microplate Luminometer. The dual luciferase activity was measured according to the protocol described by the manufacturer. The reporter luciferase activity was normalized by calculating its ratio to the Renilla luciferase activity. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—RNA was isolated by using the Absolutely RNA Nanoprep Kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was prepared with the SuperScript First-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Relative Quantification of Gene Expression Using Real Time PCR— Relative amounts of Mip mRNA and that of the control gene were quantified by real time PCR using the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection system. Primers and probe design for the real time PCR was made with Primer Express version 2 from Applied Biosystems. The Mip-specific primer pair was 5′-CACCAGCTGTCCGAGGAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGTCAGGAAGATCTCCACAGT-3′ (reverse) and the probe (FAM-MGB) specific for Mip was FAM-5′-TCAACACGCTGCATGC-3′-MGB. Primers for mouse 18 S ribosomal RNA (as control) were 5′-AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGAGGGCCTCACTAAACC-3′ (reverse), and the VIC-Tamra probe sequence for 18 S ribosomal RNA was 5′-CCCATCAACAGAGAGCGAACT-3′. The Mip forward primer spans the exon 1–exon 2 boundary to avoid amplification of possible contaminating MIP genomic sequences. All runs were performed in triplicate according to the default PCR protocol (50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min) or the default one-step RT-PCR protocol (42 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min). Relative standard curves were generated for each primer set so that the input amount from unknown samples could be calculated. Expression of Mip was normalized with 18 S ribosomal RNA expression. Expression was compared and expressed in graph format (Excel; Microsoft,Redmond, WA). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Total cell lysates (containing 10 μg of total proteins) prepared from the harvested lens explants were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Novex). Blots were blocked with a 5% solution of nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the blots were incubated in buffer containing appropriate antisera (1:1000 for total ERK; 1:1000 for total JNK, 1:1000 for phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the blots were incubated in buffer containing the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then developed using an ECL-Plus chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray films. The x-ray films were subsequently scanned (ScanJet 6100C; Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Confocal Immunofluorescence—The lens explants were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Cellular localization of MIP, phospho-ERK, and phospho-JNK in the explants was examined by indirect immunofluorescence labeling. Briefly, the explants were incubated in ICC buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.20% Tween 20, 0.05% sodium azide, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3) for 20 min at room temperature. The explants were then incubated in ICC buffer with rabbit anti-MIP (1:50), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK (1:50), or rabbit anti-phospho-JNK (1:50) for 1 h at 37 °C. The explants were washed in ICC buffer, followed by incubation for 1 h in ICC buffer containing fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit biotinylated and Alexa 488-streptavidin or Alexa 555-streptavidin, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After washing, the explants were mounted with Tris-buffered saline/glycerol (1:1) containing p-phenylenediamine (Sigma) and covered by a coverslip. The explants were viewed with a confocal microscope (model SP2; Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA). Images were assembled for publication using computer software Corel Draw 9.0 (Corel Corp.). Scanning Electron Microscopy—All lens epithelia explants in plastic culture dishes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) at room temperature for 48–72 h. They were postfixed in 1% aqueous OsO4 for 1 h at room temperature, then each explant was carefully cut out of the dish with a jewelers saw. Dehydration of the epithelia explants was done in a graded ethanol series followed by critical point drying. The samples were then mounted on specimen stubs, and subsequently sputter-coated with gold palladium alloy. Micrographs of epithelial cells were taken from the apical surface in peripheral regions of the explants using a JEOL 820 scanning electron microscope at 10 kV. FGF-2 Induces Mip Expression in Rat Lens Explants—Previous studies have shown that FGF-1 and FGF-2 promote lens epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation in lens explant cultures (19Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Growth Factors. 1989; 1: 125-134Google Scholar, 20McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228Google Scholar). We used the rat lens explant cultures to determine the effect of FGF-2 on MIP protein expression (Fig. 1). A lens epithelia explant in culture is shown in Fig. 1A. Because the expression of fiber cell markers in the explants occurs in 3 days of culture with 100 ng/ml FGF-2, we monitored MIP protein expression in the explants by immunocytochemical analysis after 3 days in culture. A polyclonal antibody specific to the MIP protein revealed the expression of MIP in the explants (Fig. 1B). No MIP expression is observed at time 0. A higher magnification of a demarcated region of the explant demonstrated that many MIP expressing cells present elongated morphology as opposed to the cuboidal morphology of the epithelial cells (Fig. 1C). Next we examined the Mip mRNA levels in the FGF2-treated and untreated explants. RT-PCR analyses demonstrated the up-regulation of Mip mRNA as evidenced by the detection of a 693-bp amplicon of the Mip gene in the explants treated with 100 ng/ml FGF-2. Mip gene transcripts were absent in the control explants cultured without FGF-2 (Fig. 1D). In the absence of FGF-2, the lens epithelia explants were still viable as observed by the expression of AP2, a transcription factor expressed in lens epithelia and not in lens fibers (35Ohtaka-Maruyama C. Hanaoka F. Chepelinsky A.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 125-135Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). FGF-2 Activates Mip Promoter Activity in Lens Epithelia Explants—On the basis of the observation that the Mip mRNA level was up-regulated in the explants treated with FGF-2, a follow-up study was designed to determine whether the Mip gene promoter harbored the response elements required to drive transcription triggered by FGF-2. Mip 5′-flanking promoter constructs spanning 461, 598, and 1,648 bp upstream of the Mip transcription start site and 44 bp of exon 1 fused to the luciferase reporter gene were used for transfection assays. In the presence of 100 ng/ml FGF-2, the lens explants 3-day post-transfection with the reporter plasmids displayed activation of the Mip promoter (Fig. 2A). The Mip 5′-flanking promoter sequence -1,648 bp showed a ∼20-fold increase in reporter activity relative to the control empty vector. However, the Mip promoter activity drastically decreases when only 598 bp of Mip 5′-flanking sequence are used. To test the specificity of the Mip promoter response to FGF-2 in lens epithelia explants, we also monitored the Mip promoter activity in the presence of FGF-2 in two cell lines that do not express Mip (RK13 and AMLE cell lines). Fig. 2B shows that in the presence of FGF-2, the -1648 Mip 5′-flanking sequence lacks an active promoter, whereas a control SV40 promoter is active in rat kidney (RK13) cells. We obtained similar results using AMLE1, a mouse lens epithelial cell line (36Sax C.M. Dziedzic D.C. Piatigorsky J. Reddan J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 125-127Google Scholar) that does not express endogenous MIP. Transfection of either the -461- or -1648-bp reporter constructs resulted in a null response to transcriptional activation by FGF-2 (100 ng/ml), whereas SV40 driven reporter activity was noticeable (Fig. 2C). These results confirm that not only the 5′-flanking sequences, at least up to -1648 bp, of the Mip gene harbor positive response element(s) to FGF stimulation but also that this response is specific to differentiating lens epithelia cells. FGF-2 Concentration Is Pivotal for Lens Fiber Cell Differentiation—McAvoy and Chamberlain (20McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228Google Scholar) have demonstrated that FGF induces proliferation and differentiation of cultured rat lens epithelia explants. Upon adopting this differentiation study model by FGF-2 stimulation in lens explants, our goal was to first demonstrate the optimal dose of FGF-2 to induce differentiation in our culture system. We confirmed this observation by using scanning electron microscopy on cultured explants in the presence of 0.05, 5, and 100 ng/ml FGF, respectively. After 14 days in culture, morphological analyses by scanning electron microscopy revealed an elongating fiber cell phenotype in the explants treated with high concentration (100 ng/ml) of FGF-2, whereas the explants treated with low doses of FGF-2 (0.05 and 5 ng/ml) retained their epithelial characteristics (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3, A and B, cuboidal morphology typical of lens epithelial cells can be contrasted with the appearance of apical protrusions in the differentiating fiber cells in Fig. 3C, and these cells eventually assume a typical elongated fiber cell phenotype after 14 days of culture (Fig. 3D). These results confirm that in our culture conditions, lens explants are capable of undergoing differentiation to fiber cells under the influence of 100 ng/ml FGF-2. Endogenous Mip mRNA Level in Lens Explants Is FGF-2 Dose-dependent—Results demonstrating that 100 ng/ml FGF-2, but not low doses of FGF-2, induces lens fiber cell differentiation were followed up by experiments to determine the Mip expression pattern in the presence of various concentrations of FGF. Real time PCR was performed to determine the endogenous Mip mRNA level in the cultured explants. Based on our prior observation that 100 ng/ml FGF-2 efficiently induced Mip expression, we used this dose to demonstrate a time course response. Mip mRNA levels after 1, 2, 3, and 4 days are shown in Fig. 4A. The Mip expression in explants after 3 or 4 days in culture showed ∼70-fold increase over day 1. The significant increase in Mip transcripts appears between 2 and 3 days in culture. These results indicate that Mip transcripts appear as fiber cell differentiation begins to be underway. We performed a dose-response study to determine whether the Mip transcript level is induced by different concentrations of FGF-2 (0.01, 5 or 100 ng/ml) (Fig. 4B). Real time PCR results demonstrated that at the highest dose (100 ng/ml), FGF-2 is significantly more potent in inducing Mip transcription after 3 to 4 days in culture. These results demonstrate that the concentration of FGF-2 is critical both for the morphological changes and Mip expression associated with lens fiber cell differentiation. FGF-2 Induces ERK1/2 Activation in Lens Explants in a Concentration-dependent Manner—FGF-2 is known to stimulate the MAPK (ERK) signaling cascade in various types of cells. In our study, we attempted to determine whether ERK is phosphorylated and thereby activated by FGF-2. Using a gradient of doses from very low to high concentrations of FGF-2, ERK phosphorylation was evaluated by immunoblot assays. An antibody specific to activated phospho-ERK was used to probe the proteins extracted from the explants and resolved on SDS-PAGE. Fig. 5 shows the total and activated ERK in explants treated for 30 min with either 0.01 ng, 5 ng, or 100 ng/ml FGF-2. The two isoforms, p44 (ERK1) and p42 (ERK2), are indicated. Compared against a non-variable level of total ERK1/2 in all the explants (Fig. 5A), a sparse and robust increase in activated phospho-ERK1/2 was evident following 5 ng and 100 ng/ml FGF2 treatments, respectively (Fig. 5B). Densitometric analyses revealed 2- and 5-fold increases in phospho-ERK1, and 2- and 12-fold increases in phospho-ERK2 in the 5 ng and 100 ng/ml FGF2-treated explants over the 0.01 ng/ml FGF2-treated explant (Fig. 5, C and D). Consistent with this observation, immunocytochemical analyses of the explants treated for 30 min with 0.01 ng, 5 ng, and 100 ng/ml FGF-2 and imaged by confocal microscopy reveal the presence of activated ERK. In a low dose (0.01 ng/ml), activated phospho-ERK was present in the cell cytoplasm and represents the basal level (Fig. 5E). We did not observe any difference in ERK phosphorylation in the absence of FGF compared with 0.01 ng/ml FGF (data not shown). However, in 5 ng/ml, FGF-2 treatment enhanced the level of activated ERK in the cells. In explants treated with 100 ng/ml FGF-2, the intensity of the signal was higher than in the 5 ng/ml FGF-2-treated explants (Fig. 5, F and G), confirming the results obtained by immunoblot. The immunocytochemical analysis of the explants treated for 3 days with 0.01 ng, 5 ng, and 100 ng/ml FGF-2 revealed similar results for 0.01 and 5 ng/ml FGF-2-treated explants. However, in the explants treated with 100 ng/ml FGF-2, the activated ERK was mainly present in the cytoplasm compared with 5 ng/ml FGF-2-treated explants (Fig. 5, H–J). These data suggest a reduction in ERK activation as the cells begin to enter a differentiation pathway. A sustained ERK activation in explants cultured in 5 ng/ml FGF-2 for 3 days is consistent with the non-entry of epithelial cells to a differentiation program that still remains responsive to FGF. These results establish that FGF-2 in a high dose activates ERK that is simultaneous with an inductive potential to drive fiber cell differentiation and eventual loss of sustained ERK activation. On the other hand, in the presence of a lower dose (5 ng/ml) of FGF-2, explant cells that remain epithelial display the activation downstream of ERK. ERK Inhibitor Reduces Mip Expression in Lens Explants—To determine whether FGF-induced ERK activation is required for Mip expression in the differentiating lens fiber cells, we designed two experiments, first, to test whether the cells in the explants that failed to differentiate in the presence of UO126 (specific inhibitor of phospho-ERK) expressed any endogenous Mip mRNA; second, to test whether a reporter activity driven by the Mip promoter was attenuated by the ERK inhibitor, UO126. Immunoblot assays to probe activated ERK showed that in the presence of UO126, ERK activation by FGF-2 at various concentrations was completely inhibited (Fig. 6A). In the presence of 100 ng/ml FGF-2, UO126 completely inhibited cells from undergoing differentiation as evidenced by the typical epithelial morphology of the treated cells that had similar morphology as those of undifferentiated epithelial cells (compare Figs. 6, B, with 3, A and B). In contrast, as expected, untreated control cells were undergoing differentiation as shown by the formation of numerous apical protrusions and disappearance of their typical epithelial morphology (Fig. 6B). Real time PCR results revealed a 5-fold decrease in the Mip transcript level in the presence of UO126 in FGF-treated explants (Fig. 6C). Explants transfected with the Mip promoter construct (-1,648/+44 bp) showed a significant 3-fold reduction in normalized promoter activity with 10 μm UO126; further increase in the inhibitor dose to 20 μm did not result in any additional inhibition (Fig. 6D).

https://openalex.org/W2161852363,"pH and salts have a marked effect on the stability, structure, and function of many globular proteins due to their ability to influence the electrostatic interactions. In this work, calorimetry, CD, and fluorescence studies have been carried out to understand the pH-dependent conformational changes of the two-domain protein yeast hexokinase A. In conjunction with the crystal structural data available, the present results have enabled the complete characterization and analysis of the pH-dependent conformational changes of the enzyme that have strong implications in understanding its structure-function relationship. The calorimetric profiles show a single thermal transition in the acidic pH range, whereas two independent transitions were observed in the alkaline pH range, suggesting the structural merger of the domains at the acidic pH. Comparison of the thermal transitions at pH 8.5 studied by different techniques suggests that the first transition corresponds to the smaller domain, and the second transition corresponds to the larger domain. The acid-denatured state of hexokinase A has high secondary structure content with little or no tertiary interactions and binds to the hydrophobic dye 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, suggesting that it is a molten globule-like state, whereas the alkali-denatured state is less structured than the acid-denatured state but more structured than the urea-denatured state, suggestive of a premolten globule-like state. Structural analysis using the published hexokinase B structure as well as the hexokinase A structure with the revised amino acid sequence in conjunction with the results obtained by us suggests that the ionization state of the acidic residues at the active site could regulate domain movements that are responsible for the opening and the closure of the cleft between the two domains and in turn affect the structure and function of the enzyme. pH and salts have a marked effect on the stability, structure, and function of many globular proteins due to their ability to influence the electrostatic interactions.

Hexokinase is a member of the kinase family of tissue-specific isozymes and is the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, catalyzing the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to glucose to form glucose 6-phosphate and ADP with the release of a proton. Its malfunction has been implicated in a number of diseases in humans. Reduction in the activity of hexokinase due to mutations at the active site in humans causes hemolytic anemia (1Magnani M. Stocchi V. Cucchiarini L. Novelli G. Lodi S. Isa L. Fornaini G. Blood. 1985; 66: 690-697Google Scholar, 2Peters L.L. Lane P.W. Andersen S.G. Gwynn B. Barker J.E. Beutler E. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 850-860Google Scholar) and cardiomyopathy (3Barrie S.E. Saad E.A. Ubatuba S. Da Silva Lacaz P. Harris P. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1979; 23: 375-381Google Scholar). Type II hexokinase-mitochondrial interactions were observed to promote tumor cell growth, and hexokinase has been suggested as the ideal target for therapeutic intervention (4Smith T.A. Br. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 57: 170-178Google Scholar, 5Pedersen P.L. Mathupala S. Rempel A. Geschwind J.F. Ko Y.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 14-20Google Scholar). Modifications in the catalytic activity of hexokinase have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of the Alzheimer's disease (6Sorbi S. Mortilla M. Piacentini S. Tonini S. Amaducci L. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 117: 165-168Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that hexokinase plays a role in sensing and maintaining the glucose levels and in signal transduction to regulate the expression of genes in plants (7Moore B. Zhou L. Rolland F. Hall Q. Cheng W.H. Liu Y.X. Hwang I. Jones T. Sheen J. Science. 2003; 300: 332-336Google Scholar, 8Frommer W.B. Schulze W.X. Lalonde S. Science. 2003; 300: 261-263Google Scholar). In yeast, two isozymes named A and B (hexokinase PI and PII, respectively (9Womack F.C. Welch M.K. Nielsen J. Colowick S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 451-457Google Scholar)) are known, with 76% overall homology of the amino acid sequence (10Kuser P.R. Krauchenco S. Antunes O.A. Polikarpov I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20814-20821Google Scholar). Hexokinase isozymes are known to exist as dimers of 100 kDa. Endogenous protease action during purification leads to the loss of 11 amino acids from the N terminus, resulting in a predominantly monomeric form of 50 kDa (11Colowick S.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 9. Academic Press, New York1973: 1-48Google Scholar, 12Schmidt J.J. Colowick S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 458-470Google Scholar). The crystal structures are available for both of the hexokinase isozymes, for hexokinase PI complexed with glucose (13Bennett W.S.J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 183-209Google Scholar, 14Bennett W.S.J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 211-230Google Scholar) and for hexokinase PII complexed with ortho-toluoylglucosamine, a competitive inhibitor (15Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 61: 695-700Google Scholar). Both of these crystal structures, however, have missing residues, since at that time the amino acid sequence was not available, and the side chains were deduced from the electron density with only 30% of the amino acid sequence homology between the primary structure of the crystallographic models and the one obtained from cDNA sequence (10Kuser P.R. Krauchenco S. Antunes O.A. Polikarpov I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20814-20821Google Scholar). Recently, the PII structure without any bound ligands and with a correct amino acid sequence has become available (10Kuser P.R. Krauchenco S. Antunes O.A. Polikarpov I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20814-20821Google Scholar). Also the crystal structure of PI complexed with glucose has been elucidated with the correct amino acid sequence. 1T. A. Steitz, personal communication. Both of the isozymes share a similar α/β fold, and the polypeptide chain is distinctly folded into two domains of unequal size, the large and the small domain. These domains are separated by a large cleft forming the active site. The large domain consists of residues 19–76 and 212–457, whereas the small domain consists of residues 77–211 and 458–486. Comparison of the two crystal structures of hexokinase with and without bound glucose reveals that the conformational changes involved upon binding of the substrate are due to the domain movements. These conformational changes have earlier been observed spectroscopically for various substrates (16Feldman I. Kramp D.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1541-1547Google Scholar, 17Peters B.A. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6826-6831Google Scholar, 18Ohning G.V. Neet K.E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2986-2995Google Scholar). In the era of proteomics, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the structure-function relationship of proteins using various biophysical tools (19Neet K.E. Lee J.C. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 415-420Google Scholar). Despite the importance of hexokinase as an enzyme, relatively few biophysical studies have been carried out on this protein. From the structures with the correct amino acid sequence available now, it is clear that the interface between the two domains is rich in acidic residues. Therefore, it will be of importance to study the effect of pH on domain interactions and hence the structure and stability of the enzyme. We have selected yeast hexokinase A as a model protein for such studies and employed various biophysical techniques such as DSC, 2The abbreviations used are: DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ΔHcal, calorimteric enthalpy; ΔHv, van't Hoff enthalpy; Tm, transition temperature; ANS, 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Ampso, 3-[dimethyl(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid. CD, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results in conjunction with the new structural data available have been discussed in terms of domain-domain interactions and their relation to the catalytic activity as well as the stability of the enzyme and the formation of intermediates at extremes of pH. The results are likely to throw further light on the role of electrostatic interactions in the structure-function aspects of the enzyme and can have far reaching implications in our understanding of the structural abnormalities caused by the mutations leading to several diseases. Materials—Yeast hexokinase A used in these experiments was obtained from Sigma, supplied as a mixture of isozymes PI and PII. The mixture of isozymes was separated by using the procedure of Womack et al., (9Womack F.C. Welch M.K. Nielsen J. Colowick S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 451-457Google Scholar), which is based on the differential adsorption of hexokinase isozymes to hydroxyapatite. The PI fraction was eluted by 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. The specific activity was determined using glucose and fructose as substrates to ascertain purity. The ratio of activities obtained for the substrates glucose/fructose was within the limits of 2.3–3.1. Tris, Hepes, Mops, ANS, NaCl, Ampso, and the pH standards used for calibrating the pH meter were procured from Sigma. Glycine, acetic acid, and sodium acetate were from Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. Potassium dihydrogen phosphate and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate were from Merck. Either glass double-distilled or Milli-Q water from Millipore set-up was used to make the buffers. The pH of the buffer solutions was adjusted on a Control Dynamics pH meter model APX 175 by adding hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide solutions. Preparation of Solutions and DSC Measurements—The following solutions were prepared for the pH-dependent studies: 20 mm glycine-HCl or NaOH, for pH 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 10.5, 11.0, 11.5, 12.0, and 12.5; 20 mm acetate for pH 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0; 20 mm Hepes for pH 6.25; 20 mm Tris for pH 6.5–9.0; 20 mm Ampso for pH 9.5 and 10.0; and 20 mm glycine, pH 3.5, containing 50, 100, and 200 mm NaCl for studies on the stability of hexokinase A carried out by DSC. The protein solutions were equilibrated with the corresponding buffers prior to their use in Centrikon ultrafiltration devices obtained from Amicon Inc. The protein and the buffer solutions were degassed for 15 min prior to loading into the DSC cells. The instrument used for the calorimetric studies was either an MC-2D or a VP-DSC calorimeter from Microcal, LLC (Northampton, MA). The machines were calibrated with the temperature standards provided by the company. A scan rate of 1 °C min–1 was used, and the data were acquired through an in-built data translation board DT 2801 interfaced to a PC in the case of MC-2D or directly in the case of VP-DSC using Origin™ software. The data were analyzed using the non-two-state model provided in the Origin™ software. CD and Fluorescence—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter. The instrument was calibrated with (+)-10-camphor sulfonic acid. In general, an average of 4–6 scans were used, and the data were presented either as molar ellipticity or mean residue ellipticity expressed in degrees cm2 dmol–1. All of the spectra were obtained at an interval of 0.1 nm with a scanning speed of 50 nm/min at 18 °C. Nitrogen gas was continually flushed at the rate of 5 liters min–1 through the instrument. 0.2- and 1-cm path length cuvettes were used in the far and near-UV regions, respectively. The protein concentrations for the far-UV and the near-UV spectra acquisition were 200 μg/ml and 1.0 mg/ml, respectively. Thermal denaturation experiments were carried out at 222 nm on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with a Peltier attachment at a scan rate of 1 °C min–1 using a 0.2-cm path length cuvette. A molecular mass of 50 kDa and a total number of 468 residues for yeast hexokinase A (since crystal structure shows only 18–486 residues) were used in the calculation. Tryptophan as well as ANS fluorescence studies were carried out to characterize the intermediates as well as to determine the pH-induced transition curves. Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Cary Varian Eclipse spectrofluorimeter interfaced with a Peltier temperature controller and a temperature programmer. 1-cm path length cuvettes were used to record the spectra of the samples under constant stirring. A protein concentration of 30 μg/ml for the intrinsic fluorescence and 10 μg/ml for the ANS fluorescence was used. For intrinsic fluorescence, an excitation wavelength of either 280 or 295 nm was used, with an excitation slit width of 5 nm and an emission slit width of 10 nm. The emission was recorded from 300 to 450 nm. For ANS fluorescence, an excitation wavelength of 400 nm was used, and the emission was measured from 410 to 600 nm with slit widths of 5 nm for excitation and 10 nm for emission. All of the spectra and the transition curves were recorded at 18 °C. ANS titrations were carried out at various pH values to determine the saturation for ANS binding at a fixed protein concentration of 10 μg/ml. Following this, ANS concentration of 50 μm was used for the emission scans as a function of pH. The concentration of ANS was determined in a Hitachi U-2000 UV spectrophotometer using an extinction coefficient of 7800 mol–1 cm–1 at 372 nm (20Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy,2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Google Scholar). Structural Analysis—Structural analysis was carried out on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station using the Insight II software. Crystal structures of hexokinase representing the closed1 and open conformations (Protein Data Bank code 1IG8) (10Kuser P.R. Krauchenco S. Antunes O.A. Polikarpov I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20814-20821Google Scholar) were used. The algorithm used for the calculation of accessible surface area is a version of the Lee and Richards (21Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Google Scholar) method modified by Shrake and Rupley (22Shrake A. Rupley J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 351-371Google Scholar) in which a probe size of 1.4 Å was used. The distances between the acidic residues were calculated by considering the oxygen atoms of the side chains of a given acidic residue as the reference points. Thermal Denaturation—Thermal denaturation of yeast hexokinase A monitored by DSC in the pH range of 7.0–10.0 results in two independent thermal transitions, whereas only a single transition has been observed in the acidic pH range of 3.0–6.75 (Fig. 1). Thermal denaturation profiles of the protein monitored by ellipticity at 222 nm also match with the nature of transitions observed by DSC at acidic (pH 3.0) and alkaline (pH 8.5) pH that show monophasic and biphasic transitions, respectively (Fig. 2). A similar temperature dependence of ellipticity observed for the heat-denatured states of hexokinase A, both at the acidic (pH 3.0) and the alkaline pH (pH 8.5), suggests that the extent of unfolding is similar in both of the conditions. Thermal denaturation was observed to be partially reversible between pH 8.5 and 10, whereas below pH 7.5, it was completely irreversible. Two independent transitions for thermal denaturation of yeast hexokinase A at pH 8.0 and 8.5 have been reported previously (23Takahashi K. Casey J.L. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4693-4697Google Scholar, 24Catanzano F. Gambuti A. Graziano G. Barone G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 568-577Google Scholar). The two transitions have been assumed to result from the unfolding of the two domains, but these transitions have not been assigned to the individual domains previously. Thermal denaturation monitored by a decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity at 330 nm at pH 8.5 reveals only a single cooperative transition that shows correspondence to the first transition on the temperature axis with the biphasic transition observed by DSC and CD at 222 nm (Fig. 2). Yeast hexokinase A contains four tryptophans, three of which are buried in the hydrophobic core in the smaller domain, whereas the larger domain contains only a single partially exposed tryptophan. Hence, a comparison of the temperature denaturation curves of hexokinase A at pH 8.5 monitored by the different techniques suggests that the first transition is likely to be due to the melting of the smaller domain, whereas the second transition corresponds to the unfolding of the larger domain.Fig. 2Temperature denaturation curves for hexokinase A at different pH values monitored by CD at 222 nm (1–4) and fluorescence intensity at 330 nm, excited at 280 nm (5). The numbers represent the pH values of buffers as follows. 1, pH 8.5; 2, pH 3.0; 3, pH 2.5; 4, pH 2.0; 5, pH 8.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) At acidic pH, thermal transitions consist of a single peak, indicating the merger of the two domains. Between pH 4.0 and 6.75, the ΔHcal/ΔHv (data not shown) is close to unity, suggesting a two-state unfolding with both the domains melting cooperatively. However, between pH 3.0 and 4.0, the ΔHcal/ΔHv ratio is less than unity, possibly due to the existence of considerable amounts of the partially denatured species as suggested by near-UV CD data (Fig. 5). The Tm values have been observed to decrease at the extremes of pH in general, whereas Tm1, corresponding to the smaller domain, decreases drastically compared with Tm2, corresponding to the larger domain in the alkaline pH range (Fig. 3), suggesting that the interdomain interactions are stabilizing the smaller domain to a greater extent than the larger domain. This is in agreement with the model of Brandts et al. (25Brandts J.F. Hu C.Q. Lin L.N. Mos M.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8588-8595Google Scholar), which suggests that in multidomain proteins, the interdomain interactions stabilize the domain with a lower Tm to a greater extent. At pH 2.5, we did not observe any transition, suggesting that the pH 2.5 state is an acid-denatured state. Since pH affects the stability and structure of hexokinase A, it is important to probe whether the buffer components make any contribution to the structure and stability at any given pH. We used Hepes, Tris, Mops, and phosphate buffers at 20 mm concentrations in the pH region 6.5–8.5 and did not observe any effect on stability as monitored by DSC and structure as monitored by CD and fluorescence for the protein at a given pH using the various buffer systems.Fig. 3Dependence of the transition temperature, Tm of hexokinase A on the pH of the buffer. □, the Tm of either the first transition, where two transitions are observed (at alkaline pH), or the single transition (at acidic pH). ○, Tm of the second transition at alkaline pH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to probe the contribution of electrostatic interactions to domain merger, thermal denaturation at pH 3.5 was carried out in the presence of 50–200 mm NaCl (Fig. 4). pH 3.5 condition was selected, since minimal aggregation was observed in the presence of salt at this pH compared with higher pH values in the acidic pH range, where a single transition has been observed. At pH 3.5, the DSC profile shows a single transition with a Tm of 38.9 °C in the absence of salt, whereas the addition of the salt leads to a slight destabilization. Interestingly, the transition peak observed was asymmetric toward the pretransition zone, and the whole transition could be deconvoluted into two transitions. The deconvoluted thermogram shows that the first transition is getting more destabilized than the second transition. However, enthalpy changes are not very dependent on salt concentration (data not shown). Salt-induced destabilization with no enthalpy change has also been observed in a fragment representing the leucine zipper of GCN4 at low salt concentrations, whereas there was stabilization at higher salt concentrations (26Kenar K.T. Garcia-Moreno B. Freire E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1934-1938Google Scholar). The destabilizing effect is saturating at 100 mm salt, and a further increase to 200 mm has essentially the same effect (Fig. 4). Irreversibility, strong aggregation, and weak calorimetric signal at pH 3.5 restrained us from carrying out detailed studies on the salt effect. Near-UV CD—The near-UV CD spectrum of the native state of hexokinase A reveals three negative ellipticity peaks at 268, 277, and 286 nm and a positive one at 291 nm (Fig. 5). In acidic conditions (Fig. 5a), the ellipticity values at these wavelengths respond differently to changes in the pH. Whereas there is a decrease in the intensity as a result of decrease in the pH at 268, 277, and 286 nm, the intensity of the peak at 291 nm initially increases with a decrease in the pH, reaching a maximum at pH 3.5 followed by a decrease below this pH (Fig. 5a, inset). The positive ellipticity at 291 nm could be attributed to tryptophan's environment, since tryptophan absorbs in this region. The differential changes observed at 291 nm might, thus, be related to a change in the tryptophan environment as a result of the loss of some tertiary interactions. In alkaline conditions (Fig. 5b), the native spectrum of hexokinase is nearly preserved up to pH 10.0, whereas at pH 11.0, the protein loses most of its tertiary interactions. At 258 nm, there is a considerable increase in the ellipticity at pH 11.0. This could be due to the abrupt exposure of phenylalanine residues or due to the formation of disulfides in the extreme alkaline pH region. Far-UV CD—In the far-UV region, the CD spectra of the native hexokinase A show characteristic double minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 6). Yeast hexokinase A belongs to a α/β class of proteins (10Kuser P.R. Krauchenco S. Antunes O.A. Polikarpov I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20814-20821Google Scholar), and the secondary structure content determined from the crystal structure consists of 39.7% helices and 16.6% β-strands. The calculated α-helical contents as a function of pH using the method of Chen et al. (27Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Google Scholar), which is based on far-UV CD data at 222 nm, are listed in Table I. In the native pH conditions, helical content is about 35.7%, which is in close agreement with that derived from the crystal structure data.Table Iα-Helix content of hexokinase A as a function of pH calculated from the CD datapHPercentage of α-helixpHPercentage of α-helix7.535.78.535.76.535.89.035.15.035.79.534.14.535.710.032.44.036.010.526.83.535.411.019.33.028.411.58.82.522.212.06.72.023.712.58.0 Open table in a new tab The native secondary structure is preserved up to pH 3.5 in the acidic conditions (Fig. 6a). However, at pH 2.5, the protein loses 38% helicity with no minimum observed at 222 nm in CD. At pH 2.0, there is a slight increase in the helicity, thus suggesting that the pH 2.5 state is an acid-denatured state. In the alkaline conditions, hexokinase A loses secondary structure rapidly at pH >10.0 and reaches a plateau at pH 12.0 (Fig. 6b, inset). As compared with the acid-denatured state, the alkali-denatured state is more unstructured, and it loses ∼77% helicity. In both the acidic and the alkaline pH range, the spectra show an isodichroic point at 207 nm, suggesting that the acid and alkali denaturation is a two-state process. Intrinsic Fluorescence—Hexokinase A has 16 tyrosine residues distributed all over the protein and four tryptophan residues, of which three are located in the small domain and one in the large domain. The accessibility of Trp ranges from being completely buried to being partially solvent-exposed. Fluorescence emission was measured either upon excitation at 295 nm to follow the changes in the environment of the Trp residues specifically or upon excitation at 280 nm, in which case the emission arises both from Tyr and Trp residues as well as due to the result of energy transfer from Tyr to Trp residues. Thus, the excitation wavelength of 280 nm links the Tyr probes distributed throughout the protein with fluorescence emission from the four Trp residues. Emission spectra of the native state have an emission maximum of 330 nm, suggesting that the tryptophan residues are buried in a nonpolar environment. The emission maximum of the acid-denatured protein is red-shifted to 340 nm, and that of the alkali-denatured protein is shifted to 350 nm (Fig. 7), indicating that the solvent exposure of tryptophans in the acid and the alkali-denatured protein takes place to varying extents. These data are in accordance with the far-UV CD data, which shows more secondary structure content for the acid-denatured protein as compared with the alkali-denatured protein. The emission intensity of the protein also decreases upon deviation from the native state due to the solvent quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. ANS Fluorescence—ANS has been shown to bind to hydrophobic regions of partially unfolded proteins that become exposed to solvent (28Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Google Scholar). The results of ANS binding to hexokinase A are shown in Fig. 8. Titration of the protein with ANS as a function of pH ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 and at pH 12.5 suggests binding of ANS in the acidic region, whereas no binding was observed at pH 12.5. ANS binding was also saturating at concentrations of >25 μm (Fig. 8a). ANS binding in the acidic region led to an increase in the emission intensity as well as a concomitant shift in the emission maximum, indicating the presence of exposed hydrophobic groups (Fig. 8b). These studies also support the near-UV CD absorption data at pH 3.5 that show partial loss of tertiary interactions without any secondary structure loss. The lack of binding of ANS to the alkali-denatured protein suggests complete unfolding as evidenced by far-UV CD and by wavelength of emission maximum at pH 12.5. However, in addition to the alkali-induced conformational changes responsible for the effect of ANS, repulsive electrostatic interactions at alkaline pH between ANS and the exposed protein surface could also prevent ANS from having any binding effect. pH Dependence of Domain Interactions—From Fig. 1, a and b, it is evident that yeast hexokinase A exists in two alternative conformations below and above pH 6.75. Hexokinase A crystal structure reveals two domains, and its calorimetric profile at pH 8.5 consists of two transitions that have been attributed to the independent unfolding of the two domains (23Takahashi K. Casey J.L. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4693-4697Google Scholar). At acidic pH (pH 4.0–6.75), the thermal transitions consist of a single peak with ΔHcal/ΔHv ratio of unity. This is similar to the results obtained at pH 8.5 in the presence of glucose, where the thermal transition consists of a single cooperative peak with a ΔHcal/ΔHv value close to unity (23Takahashi K. Casey J.L. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4693-4697Google Scholar). This suggests that at low pH, the two domains could be structurally interacting with each other just as in the presence of glucose at pH 8.5. The pH optimum for the activity of hexokinase is 7.5, and it rapidly loses its activity below pH 6.5 with no enzymatic activity obtained at pH 4.0 (29Sols A. De La Fuente G. Villar-Palasi C. Asensio C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 30: 92-101Google Scholar). These results correlate very well with the domain merger as a function of pH observed by DSC (Fig. 1). At pH 6.5, where only one transition has been observed, the enzyme has 80% of its activity compared with that at pH 7.5 where two transitions are observed. Above pH 8.0, the transitions are broader and well separated, with the first transition getting considerably destabilized (Fig. 1b). This could be related to the rapid loss in the enzymatic activity at pH >8.5. However, using near- and far-UV CD, we did not observe any significant conf"
https://openalex.org/W2000917954,"The endoproteolytic processing of proproteins in the secretory pathway depends on the expression of selected members of a family of subtilisin-like endoproteases known as the prohormone convertases (PCs). The main PC family members expressed in mammalian neuroendocrine cells are PC2 and PC1/3. The differential processing of proglucagon in pancreatic alpha-cells and intestinal L cells leads to production of distinct hormonal products with opposing physiological effects from the same precursor. Here we describe the establishment and characterization of a novel alpha-cell line (alphaTC-DeltaPC2) derived from PC2 homozygous null animals. The alphaTC-DeltaPC2 cells are shown to be similar to the well characterized alphaTC1-6 cell line in both morphology and overall gene expression. However, the absence of PC2 activity in alphaTC-DeltaPC2 leads to a complete block in the production of mature glucagon. Surprisingly, alphaTC-DeltaPC2 cells are able to efficiently cleave the interdomain site in proglucagon (KR 70-71). Further analysis reveals that alphaTC-DeltaPC2 cells, unlike alphaTC1-6 cells, express low levels of PC1/3 that lead to the generation of glicentin as well as low amounts of oxyntomodulin, GLP-1, truncated GLP-1, and N-terminally extended GLP-2. We conclude that alphaTC-DeltaPC2 cells provide additional evidence for PC2 as the major convertase in alpha-cells leading to mature glucagon production and provide a robust model for further analysis of the mechanisms of proprotein processing by the prohormone convertases."
https://openalex.org/W2146081036,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (encoded by the Ahr locus) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the toxicology and teratology of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin). In an effort to understand the role of the maternal compartment in dioxin teratology, we designed a breeding strategy that allowed us to compare the teratogenic response in embryos from Ahr–/– (null) and Ahr+/+ (wild-type) dams. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that embryos from the Ahr–/– dams are 5-fold more sensitive to dioxin-induced cleft palate and hydronephrosis as compared with embryos from an Ahr+/+ dam. Moreover, this increased teratogenic sensitivity extends beyond dioxin, because embryos from Ahr–/– dams exhibited a 9-fold increase in their sensitivity to the fetotoxic effects of the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. In searching for an explanation for this increased sensitivity, we found that more dioxin and dexamethasone reached the embryos from Ahr–/– dams as compared with embryos from Ahr+/+ dams. We propose that increased deposition of teratogens/fetotoxicants to the embryonic compartment is the result of porto-systemic shunting and/or blocked P4501A induction in Ahr–/– dams. In addition to demonstrating the importance of maternal AHR in teratogenesis, these data may have implications that reach beyond the mechanism of action of dioxin. In this regard, the Ahr–/– mouse may provide a system that allows pharmacological agents and toxicants to be more easily studied in a model where first pass clearance is a significant obstacle.

In this regard, the Ahr–/– mouse may provide a system that allows pharmacological agents and toxicants to be more easily studied in a model where first pass clearance is a significant obstacle. Chemical teratogens can perturb normal mammalian development through direct action on the embryo, indirectly through maternal toxicity, or as the result of a combination of both of these mechanisms. The maternal compartment can afford protection by functioning as a metabolic or physical barrier that reduces embryonic exposure to a given agent (1Beer A.E. Quebbeman J.F. Mead Johnson Symp. Perinat. Dev. Med. 1986; 24: 20-26Google Scholar). The maternal compartment also holds the potential to serve as a site of teratogen bioactivation and may serve to increase the concentrations of active metabolites that directly perturb normal embryonic development (2Kulkarni A.P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 833-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Wells P.G. Winn L.M. Cri. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Understanding the relative contributions of maternal and embryonic physiology for a given teratogen can be difficult, especially when chemical agents induce a variety of teratogenic end points or display remarkable pharmacological potency. One approach to understanding the relative contributions of the maternal and embryonic physiology is to define these two compartments via their respective genotypes. Such an approach is particularly powerful when working with null alleles that have been generated via gene targeting. In such cases, the dominance order is clear, as is the functional relationship between one or two copies of the wild-type allele. Through appropriate genetic crosses one can then generate informative combinations of maternal and embryonic genotypes that can help identify when maternally or embryonically expressed loci play a differential role in the teratogenic response to a specific chemical (4Nebert D.W. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1989; 20: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Based on these ideas, we began a series of experiments to determine the role that the maternal compartment plays in the teratogenicity of the environmental contaminant, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin). 1The abbreviations used are: dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; En, embryonic day n; TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; DV, ductus venosus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. In mice, the hallmark teratogenic responses to dioxin are clefting of the palate and hydronephrosis (5Birnbaum L.S. Weber H. Harris M.W. Lamb J.C.T. McKinney J.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1985; 77: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6Weber H. Harris M.W. Haseman J.K. Birnbaum L.S. Toxicol.

Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 86-94PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports have provided compelling evidence that dioxin-induced cleft palate is likely to be a direct response of this compound on the developing embryo (9Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 86-94PubMed Google Scholar). Given that teratogenic doses of dioxin, 25 μg/kg, are near those that are likely to induce various aspects of toxicity in the dam (e.g. thymic atrophy and metabolizing enzyme induction), we became interested in determining whether maternal toxicity was playing any role in dioxin teratology (10De Waal E.J. Schuurman H.J. Loeber J.G. Van Loveren H. Vos J.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1992; 115: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Cummings A.M. Metcalf J.L. Birnbaum L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 138: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We attempted to take advantage of the fact that essentially all aspects of dioxin action require signal transduction through a ligand-activated transcription factor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (12Chan W.K.

Given that mice harboring null alleles of the Ahr locus are viable, we were able to generate cohorts of animals where the maternal genotype was homozygous for either the wild-type (Ahr+/+) or null allele (Ahr–/–). Through crosses to the appropriate paternal genotype, all embryos generated were heterozygous for the wild-type and null alleles. With embryo genotype identical, we could then attribute any differential response/sensitivity to the differences in the maternal genotypes at Ahr. Our initial hypothesis was that Ahr+/+ dams would give rise to embryos that were more sensitive to dioxin-induced terata. This was based on the idea that AHR-mediated toxicity within the maternal compartment would exacerbate the teratogenic action of dioxin in the developing embryos. What we observed was the opposite. We found that embryos from Ahr–/– dams were five times more sensitive to the teratogenic action of dioxin. To explain this observation, we demonstrate that dams lacking a functional AHR provide a less efficient maternal barrier and allow increased concentrations of chemical teratogens to reach the developing embryo. Our additional observation that this decreased maternal barrier extends to dexamethasone-induced fetotoxicity suggests that this system may provide a general model for the more sensitive detection of chemical teratogens. Mice—The animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility on corncob bedding with food and water ad libitum according to the rules and regulations set by the University of Wisconsin. Congenic Ahr–/– mice were generated by 20 backcrosses (N20) to the C57BL6/J background with continual selection for the Ahr null allele (16Schmidt J.V. Su G.H. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). All of the Ahr+/+ mice were C57BL6/J mice originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred “in house.” Dose Response in Vivo Experiment—Females (Ahr+/+ or Ahr–/–) were weighed at E0. E0 is defined as the time directly prior to females being mated for 12 h to Ahr–/– or Ahr+/+ male mice. At E10, the females were weighed, and those gaining at least two grams were assumed pregnant. Pregnant females were dosed intraperitoneally with 0.03, 0.3, 0.7, 2.0, 5.0, 15.0, 25.0, 48.0, or 64.0 μg of dioxin/kg of body weight. At E18, the embryos and placentae were harvested and weighed. The embryos were scored for sex based on internal reproductive anatomy. Hydronephrosis was scored based on gross examination of the urogenital tract and observation of swelling of the kidneys and ureters with urine. Normal palatogenesis was assessed based on gross examination of the palate surface after an incision was made through the temporal-mandibular joint. Cleft palate was scored if there was not fusion between the secondary palatal shelves. Three millimeters of tail was taken from each embryo for DNA to confirm genotype. Palate Culture in Vitro Experiment—At E13, the embryos were harvested from the uterus, and the palatal shelves were dissected from embryos. The shelves were separated from the embryo proper by an incision at the temporal-mandibular joint, and the cerebrum and cerebellum were removed by dissection. The remaining opposing shelves were placed into cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Suspended palate organ cultures were performed as described (22Taya Y. O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W. Development. 1999; 126: 3869-3879PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pisano M.M. Greene R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 137: 267-274PubMed Google Scholar). The shelves were cultured in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 1% l-glutamine, 1% ascorbate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (w/v). The cultures were treated with varying concentrations of dioxin in Me2SO or with Me2SO alone. After 72 h, the organ cultures were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and stained with hematoxilin for visualization. Fusion of the opposing palatal shelves was assessed under microscopy and scored as either fused or not fused. Receptor Ligand Binding Affinity—To measure levels of functional AHR, photo affinity labeling experiments were performed on each of the dams, Ahr–/– and Ahr+/+ and the respective Ahr+/– progeny cohorts (i.e. from either Ahr–/– or Ahr+/+ dams). At E18, the embryos were harvested, and the livers were dissected from the embryos. The livers from each litter were pooled, and the cytosolic fraction was isolated and used for photo affinity labeling experiments as described previously (24Bradfield C.A. Kende A.S. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bradfield C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 682-688PubMed Google Scholar). The photo affinity ligand 2-azido-3-[125I]iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin was added to a final concentration of 1 nm into tubes containing 150 μg/ml of cytosolic protein. The mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 30 min, followed by a 5-min incubation on ice. Unbound ligand was removed by the addition of a 10% volume of charcoal/gelatin (10%/1%, w/v) in MEN (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The mixture was subjected to centrifugation (2000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove the charcoal. The supernatant was then irradiated (300 nm at 4 cm) with four Photodyne lamps for 1 min. The sample was then precipitated in ice cold acetone. After an overnight precipitation at –20 °C, the protein was pelleted by centrifugation and rinsed with acetone/water (90%/10%, v/v). The pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer. One hundred fifty micrograms of protein was loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to PAGE (24Bradfield C.A. Kende A.S. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar). After the proteins were separated by electrophoresis, the gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The 97-kDa bands were cut out and counted on a Minaxiγ counter (Packard Instrument Company, Meridian, CT). Dexamethasone Survival—Pregnant Ahr+/+ and Ahr–/– females harboring Ahr+/– embryos were given an intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg of dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) in Me2SO at E12. The embryos were assessed for survival at E18.5. Dead embryos were identified through their exhibition of severe necrosis, runting, and abnormal morphology. Conversely live embryos were defined as those exhibiting normal growth and morphology. High Resolution Chromatography/Low Resolution Mass Spectrometry of Embryonic Dioxin Levels—Pregnant female Ahr+/+ and Ahr–/– mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 25 μg/kg of dioxin in Me2SO at E14.5. At E15.5, the embryos were harvested from the uterine tract and placed into an amber glass vial. Three embryos (∼1.5 grams) from three separate litters of each maternal genotype were pooled, and high resolution chromatography/low resolution mass spectrometry was performed to assess the level of the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin isomer present (26EPA U.S. Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods. 3rd Ed. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.2002: 1-72Google Scholar). A dioxin standard was provided at a concentration of 625 ng/ml. Analysis was performed by Triangle Laboratories, Inc. (Durham, NC). Radiometric Measurement of Dioxin Levels—[1,6-3H]-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was purified via high pressure liquid chromatography to a specific activity of 9.02 Ci/mmol (a generous gift from Alan Poland, NCI, National Institutes of Health). Three pregnant female mice of the Ahr+/+ and Ahr–/– genotypes were given an intraperitoneal injection at E15 with 15 μCi of [3H]TCDD. At E16, each individual embryo and each placenta were harvested from the uterine tract. Embryos, placentae, and maternal skin, liver, thymus, kidney, spleen, heart, adipose, intestine, and lung were weighed, and no more than 200 mg of tissue was placed into a scintillation vial containing 1 ml of TS-2 tissue solubilizer (Research Products Inc., Mount Prospect, IL). The tissues were dissolved to completion, and background was minimized with the addition of 100 μl of glacial acetic acid (Fisher). Radioactivity of each sample was measured using the LS6000SC (Beckman-Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). Radiometric Measurement of Dexamethasone Levels—The radiolabeled congener [6,7-3H]-dexamethasone was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), at a specific activity of 37 Ci/mmol. Three pregnant mice of the Ahr+/+ and two pregnant mice of the Ahr–/– genotypes were given 15 μCi of [3H]dexamethasone via intraperitoneal injection at E16. Two hours after injection, the embryos and placentae were weighed, and no more than 200 mg of tissue was placed into a scintillation vial containing 1 ml of TS-2 tissue solubilizer (Research Products Inc.). The tissues were dissolved to completion, and background was minimized with the addition of 100 μl of glacial acetic acid (Fisher). The radioactivity of each sample was measured using the LS6000SC (Beckman-Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). Breeding Strategy—The pedigree scheme in Fig. 1 illustrates the breeding strategy used in the subsequent experiments. This scheme allowed for manipulation of the maternal genotypes while keeping the embryonic genotypes the same. Dose Response, in Vivo—To analyze the susceptibility of embryos to dioxin-induced teratogenesis, we performed dose-response assessment using cleft palate and hydronephrosis as end points. The dams were dosed at E10 with increasing concentrations of dioxin, and the embryos were harvested and scored for teratogenesis at E18. We observed that Ahr+/– embryos derived from Ahr–/– dams were more sensitive to hydronephrosis and cleft palate than Ahr+/– embryos from Ahr+/+ dams (Fig. 2). Hydronephrosis in embryos from an Ahr+/+ versus and Ahr–/– female exhibited EC50 values of 2.5 and 0.5 μg/kg, respectively. Cleft palate in embryos from Ahr+/+ versus and Ahr–/– female exhibited EC50 values of 48 and 10 μg/kg, respectively. Dose-response Assessment, Palate Organ Culture—As one method to determine whether the increase in sensitivity of progeny from Ahr–/– dams to teratogenesis was the result of increased dioxin sensitivity of embryonic tissues, we took advantage of in vitro palate organ culture. The Ahr+/– embryos were harvested from their respective dams, and palatal shelves were placed into organ culture and dosed with various concentrations of dioxin. After 72 h, the palatal cultures were assessed for fusion and scored accordingly. We observed that palatal shelves harvested from either an Ahr+/+ or an Ahr–/– responded identically at 0.3 nm, 1.0 nm, 3.3 nm, and 10 nm doses when cultured (Fig. 3). Receptor Binding—To demonstrate that the receptor concentration in each of the Ahr+/– embryo cohorts was similar, we compared their ability to bind ligand. Photo affinity ligand binding experiments were performed on maternal and embryonic liver cytosols to examine the binding capacity of the receptor in Ahr+/– embryos from Ahr+/+ or Ahr–/– dams. After normalization for protein concentration, we found no difference in the concentration of AHR in any of the experimental groups (Fig. 4). Embryo Survival after Dexamethasone Treatment—To determine whether embryos from Ahr–/– dams were also more sensitive to compounds structurally unrelated to dioxins, we examined their response to dexamethasone. Dexamethasone is a known teratogen and fetotoxicant (27Bittencourt M.A. Bolognese A.M. Braz. Dent. J. 2000; 11: 117-126PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hansen D.K. LaBorde J.B. Wall K.S. Holson R.R.

We observed that at a maternal dose of 15 mg/kg of dexamethasone, embryos from Ahr–/– dams exhibited a 9-fold higher level of mortality than those from Ahr+/+ dams (p < 0.0006, Fig. 5). Dioxin Disposition in Embryonic Tissues—To test the idea that the embryos derived from Ahr–/– dams were receiving a higher dose of dioxin, we dosed E14 pregnant females with 25 μg/kg of dioxin (intraperitoneal). At E15 the Ahr+/– embryos were harvested, and the amount of dioxin was assessed by mass spectrometry (26EPA U.S. Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods. 3rd Ed. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.2002: 1-72Google Scholar). We found that embryos derived from Ahr–/– dams had dioxin body burdens ∼3-fold greater than embryos derived from Ahr+/+ dams, p < 0.05 (Fig. 6, top panel). An independent analysis of dioxin disposition was performed using a radiometric approach. In this experiment, we intraperitoneally dosed E15 pregnant females with 15 μCi of [3H]TCDD. This dose is ∼25 μg/kg of dioxin, the same dose used in the mass spectrometry analysis. At E16 the Ahr+/– embryos and placentae were harvested and dissolved in tissue solubilizer, and radioactivity was measured. After normalization to tissue weight, we found that embryos derived from Ahr–/– dams had dioxin body burdens that were ∼3-fold greater than in embryos derived from Ahr+/+ dams (p < 0.05; Fig. 6, middle panel). In the radiometric study, we also examined the [3H]TCDD levels in individual placentae of the embryos from each progeny cohort. After normalization to tissue weight, we found a 9-fold greater concentration of [3H]TCDD in the placentae of embryos derived from an Ahr–/– dam (p < 0.05; Fig. 6, bottom panel). Dioxin Disposition in Maternal Tissue—To determine whether maternal disposition of dioxin was influenced by genotype at the Ahr locus, we employed the radiometric method and assessed levels of dioxin in various major organs of exposed dams. We found that the livers of Ahr+/+ dams retained 60% of the total dioxin dose compared with 8% of the total dose in the livers of Ahr–/– dams (p < 0.0001; Fig. 7). There was significantly more dioxin in the skin, thymus, and lung of Ahr–/– versus Ahr+/+ dams. In all other tissues there were no significant differences in dioxin levels. Dexamethasone Disposition in Embryonic Tissues—To test the idea that the embryos derived from Ahr–/– dams were receiving a higher dose of dexamethasone, we dosed E16 pregnant females with 15 μCi of [3H]dexamethasone. Two hours later, Ahr+/– embryos, and placentae were harvested and dissolved in tissue solubilizer, and radioactivity was measured. After normalization to tissue weight, we found that embryos derived from Ahr–/– dams had dexamethasone body burdens that were 2–3-fold greater than in embryos derived from Ahr+/+ dams (p < 0.0001; Fig. 8, top panel). In the radiometric study, we also examined the [3H]dexamethasone levels in individual placentae of the embryos from each progeny cohort. After normalization to tissue weight, we found nearly a 3-fold greater concentration of [3H]dexamethasone in the placentae of embryos derived from an Ahr–/– dam (p < 0.0001; Fig. 8, bottom panel). The AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays multiple roles in mammalian biology. In response to certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the AHR up-regulates a battery of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochromes P450, 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 (14Burbach K.M. Poland A.

First they oxidize a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to more polar and excretable forms (39Luch A. Coffing S.L. Tang Y.M. Schneider A. Soballa V. Greim H. Jefcoate C.R. Seidel A.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 908-915PubMed Google Scholar). Second, they can serve as inducible sinks for recalcitrant substrates such as dioxin, thus markedly influencing their disposition (41Poland A. Teitelbaum P. Glover E. Kende A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 121-127PubMed Google Scholar, 42Poland A. Teitelbaum P. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar). Because this system commonly results in a substrate inducing its own metabolism, we refer to it as an adaptive response pathway (43Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). When more potent agonists, like dioxin, bind to the receptor, the adaptive pathway is up-regulated, as well as an additional battery of toxic responses (9Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 86-94PubMed Google Scholar, 38Poland A.P. Glover E. Robinson J.R. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5599-5606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Knutson J.C.

Hydronephrosis and cleft palate are classic end points of dioxin-induced teratogenesis (8Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Pratt R.M.

The observation that the AHR is highly expressed in the urogenital tract and craniofacial tissues of the developing embryo supports the idea that dioxin-induced terata are largely a tissue autonomous process (49Jain S. Maltepe E. Lu M.M. Simon C. Bradfield C.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Additional evidence to support this idea comes from palate culture experiments where fusion between two palatal shelves can be blocked by exposure to dioxin in vitro (50Abbott B.D. Diliberto J.J. Birnbaum L.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1989; 100: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also supports the concept that the toxicity/teratogenesis associated with dioxin exposure is mediated through the action of AHR within the nucleus, presumably transcriptional (51Bunger M.K.

The AHR has also been shown to play an important role in normal development (16Schmidt J.V. Su G.H. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 18Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M.

Mice that harbor a null allele at the Ahr locus display reduced liver weights and subtle vascular changes in a number of organs (16Schmidt J.V. Su G.H. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 19Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Ward J.M. Sundberg J.P. Gonzalez F.J. Vet.

The most prominent vascular abnormality reported in these nulls is the presence of a patent ductus venosus (DV) throughout life (53Lahvis G.P. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The DV is a porto-systemic shunt that allows blood to bypass the hepatic circulation during embryogenesis (55Uchino T. Endo F. Ikeda S. Shiraki K. Sera Y. Matsuda I. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1964-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 56Jacob S. Farr G. De Vun D. Takiff H. Mason A.

Genet. 2000; 25: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In the Ahr–/– mouse, the DV allows a significant fraction of the portal blood supply to bypass liver perfusion and exit through the inferior vena cava. The observation that Ahr–/– mice exhibit a patent DV coupled to their demonstrated inability to mount a metabolic defense against certain xenobiotics provided early suggestions that these mice would display altered xenobiotic disposition, especially for those xenobiotics cleared by the liver and metabolized by cytochromes P4501A monooxygenases. Evidence for the Role of Maternal AHR in Dioxin-induced Terata—The initial focus of this investigation was to determine whether there was any contribution of the maternal AHR on the teratogenic response of the embryo to dioxin. To this end, we utilized the Ahr–/– mouse model. In one set of two crosses, we mated the Ahr–/– female to an Ahr+/+ male. In the second cross, an Ahr+/+ female was mated to an Ahr–/– male. We then compared induction of terata in the two progeny cohorts that were genetically identical at the Ahr locus (i.e. Ahr+/–). Through our analysis, we observed that offspring from Ahr–/– dams were 5-fold more sensitive to dioxin-induced cleft palate and hydronephrosis (Fig. 2). Based upon these results, it was clear that a maternal Ahr null allele had a significant influence on dioxin teratogenicity. Altered Disposition of Dioxin—To explain the increased sensitivity, we hypothesized that more dioxin was reaching the embryos in Ahr–/– dams. This idea was supported by the observation of a “left shift” in the dose-response curves for both the cleft palate and hydronephrosis end points (Fig. 2). Importantly, this equivalent left shift occurred for two independent processes, responding at markedly different dioxin doses. That is hydronephrosis is 100% penetrant at 15 μg/kg dioxin, whereas cleft palate formation is not fully penetrant until 64 μg/kg dioxin. To examine disposition, we quantified the amount of dioxin that reached the embryo from each of the maternal genotypes. To this end, we employed both mass spectrometry and radiometric measurements. Using both of these methods, we found that there was ∼3-fold more dioxin reaching the embryos from an Ahr–/– dam (Fig. 6, top and middle panel). A 9-fold greater concentration of dioxin was measured in the placentae of Ahr+/– embryos from Ahr–/– versus Ahr+/+ dams (Fig. 6, bottom panel). It has been well established that dioxin crosses the placental barrier and reaches the embryo (58Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Diliberto J.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 256-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Nau H. Bass R. Toxicology. 1981; 20: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Previous experiments have measured the embryo dioxin levels between 0.04 and 0.14% of the maternal dose/gram of tissue (59Nau H. Bass R. Toxicology. 1981; 20: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In these earlier experiments, the dam retains between 30 and 40% of the dose/gram of tissue, with the liver retaining the highest percentage of dioxin, 10% (59Nau H. Bass R. Toxicology. 1981; 20: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The data presented here largely agree with these earlier reports, with dioxin levels in Ahr+/– embryos being found to lie between 0.15 and 0.26% of the maternal Ahr+/+ dose/gram of tissue. Importantly, disposition to the embryos from the maternal null was higher, lying in the range of 0.41 ± 0.12% of the maternal dose/gram of tissue. Similarly, the Ahr+/+ dam retained 64 ± 4% of the dose/gram in the liver, whereas the Ahr–/– dam retained only 8 ± 1% of the dose/gram in the liver. The Ahr–/– dams retained the highest dose of dioxin in the adipose tissue at ∼23% of the dose/gram of adipose tissue, which was not statistically different from the amount measured in the Ahr+/+ dams. Increased Sensitivity to Dexamethasone—The dioxin experiments were initially designed to examine the role of the maternal AHR in the formation of dioxin-induced terata. In an attempt to delve more deeply into the mechanism for this sensitivity, we administered the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. Dexamethasone is a known fetotoxicant that does not bind the AHR (60Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-36159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Our approach was to compare the fetotoxic response to dexamethasone in progeny from Ahr+/+ versus Ahr–/– dams. This experiment was performed to determine whether the relationship between the Ahr locus and increased chemical sensitivity extended beyond AHR agonists. What we found was that the embryos from Ahr–/– dams were 9-fold more sensitive to dexamethasone treatment. This experiment suggests that Ahr–/– dams provide less efficient protection of their developing offspring from a spectrum of chemical teratogens, even those that are structurally unrelated to AHR agonists. Altered Disposition of Dexamethasone—One of our hypotheses is that the DV results in an ineffective maternal barrier to chemical teratogens. To test this idea, the disposition of dexamethasone, a fetotoxicant that does not bind directly to the AHR, was examined. To this end, we quantified the amount of dexamethasone that reached the embryo from each of the maternal genotypes. We employed radiometric methods and found that there was 2–3-fold more dexamethasone reaching the embryos from an Ahr–/– dam (Fig. 8, top panel). A 2.7-fold greater concentration of dexamethasone was measured in the placentae of Ahr+/– embryos from Ahr–/– versus Ahr+/+ dams (Fig. 8, bottom panel). Our disposition studies strongly support the idea that the higher embryonic sensitivity to both dioxin and dexamethasone is the result of an ineffective maternal barrier. This inefficiency could result from decreased hepatic or first pass clearance of chemical teratogens in the maternal compartment. Two observations regarding Ahr–/– mice lead us to this hypothesis. The first is a substantial porto-caval shunt, known as the DV, present in essentially all Ahr–/– mice. Such shunting would be predicted to have a profound effect on a broad spectrum of chemical teratogens. Second, Ahr–/– mice display a marked reduction in inducible CYP1A monooxygenases. Given that these P450s can act as sinks or degrading enzymes for certain chemical teratogens, their decreased expression could also play a significant role in teratogen disposition and availability to the embryo compartment. The bottom line is that one or both of these mechanisms could result in a higher concentration of dioxin, dexamethasone, or any number of teratogens. Initially, we predicted that if altered disposition was at the heart of increase embryo sensitivity, then removal of the maternal variable should result in embryos exhibiting similar sensitivity to dioxin. To test this idea, we performed palate culture experiments that allowed the dosing of the developing organ in vitro, eliminating the influence of the maternal compartment. By scoring “failure to fuse” as an end point, we observed identical dioxin dose-response curves for palates obtained from embryos derived from either an Ahr+/+ or an Ahr–/– dam. This demonstrates that the maternal component is critical in determining the susceptibility of her offspring to dioxin-induced terata. As a supporting experiment, we characterized the AHR found in the embryonic palate derived from Ahr+/+ and Ahr–/– dams to determine whether they bound ligand with the same capacity. We found ligand binding to be indistinguishable, suggesting that receptor biochemistry in the embryo was not directly affected by maternal genotype. Conclusions—Two important conclusions can be drawn from our results. First, these experiments provide one of the most compelling proofs that the maternal genotype harbors considerable influence over the teratogenic action of chemical agents. Although polymorphisms in genes important in the maternal barrier have been proposed, strong examples in the literature are rare (35Dao D. Frank D. Qian N. O'Keefe D. Vosatka R.J. Walsh C.P. Tycko B. Human Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 44Giannoukakis N. Deal C. Paquette J. Goodyer C.G. Polychronakos C. Nat.

Genet. 1995; 9: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Second, the Ahr–/– mutant may provide a powerful system for the identification of chemical teratogens. Given that hepatic first pass and maternal clearance are both significant modifiers of pharmacological action, this model may extend to numerous biologically active compounds where experimental studies are enhanced when the agent under study is not sequestered or metabolized."
