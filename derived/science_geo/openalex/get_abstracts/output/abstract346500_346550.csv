https://openalex.org/W2159257250,"microRNAs have recently emerged as master regulators of gene expression during development and cell differentiation. Although profound changes in gene expression also occur during antigen-induced T cell differentiation, the role of miRNAs in the process is not known. We compared the miRNA expression profiles between antigen-specific naïve, effector and memory CD8+ T cells using 3 different methods-small RNA cloning, miRNA microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Although many miRNAs were expressed in all the T cell subsets, the frequency of 7 miRNAs (miR-16, miR-21, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-150, miR-15b and let-7f) alone accounted for ∼60% of all miRNAs, and their expression was several fold higher than the other expressed miRNAs. Global downregulation of miRNAs (including 6/7 dominantly expressed miRNAs) was observed in effector T cells compared to naïve cells and the miRNA expression levels tended to come back up in memory T cells. However, a few miRNAs, notably miR-21 were higher in effector and memory T cells compared to naïve T cells. These results suggest that concomitant with profound changes in gene expression, miRNA profile also changes dynamically during T cell differentiation. Sequence analysis of the cloned mature miRNAs revealed an extensive degree of end polymorphism. While 3′end polymorphisms dominated, heterogeneity at both ends, resembling drosha/dicer processing shift was also seen in miR-142, suggesting a possible novel mechanism to generate new miRNA and/or to diversify miRNA target selection. Overall, our results suggest that dynamic changes in the expression of miRNAs may be important for the regulation of gene expression during antigen-induced T cell differentiation. Our study also suggests possible novel mechanisms for miRNA biogenesis and function."
https://openalex.org/W2086727433,"Edge effects are major drivers of change in many fragmented landscapes, but are often highly variable in space and time. Here we assess variability in edge effects altering Amazon forest dynamics, plant community composition, invading species, and carbon storage, in the world's largest and longest-running experimental study of habitat fragmentation. Despite detailed knowledge of local landscape conditions, spatial variability in edge effects was only partially foreseeable: relatively predictable effects were caused by the differing proximity of plots to forest edge and varying matrix vegetation, but windstorms generated much random variability. Temporal variability in edge phenomena was also only partially predictable: forest dynamics varied somewhat with fragment age, but also fluctuated markedly over time, evidently because of sporadic droughts and windstorms. Given the acute sensitivity of habitat fragments to local landscape and weather dynamics, we predict that fragments within the same landscape will tend to converge in species composition, whereas those in different landscapes will diverge in composition. This ‘landscape-divergence hypothesis’, if generally valid, will have key implications for biodiversity-conservation strategies and for understanding the dynamics of fragmented ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2044107405,"The delta(B) and delta(C) splice variants of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which differ by the presence of a nuclear localization sequence, are both expressed in cardiomyocytes. We used transgenic (TG) mice and CaMKII expression in cardiomyocytes to test the hypothesis that the CaMKIIdelta(C) isoform regulates cytosolic Ca(2+) handling and the delta(B) isoform, which localizes to the nucleus, regulates gene transcription. Phosphorylation of CaMKII sites on the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and on phospholamban (PLB) were increased in CaMKIIdelta(C) TG. This was associated with markedly enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) spark frequency and decreased SR Ca(2+) content in cardiomyocytes. None of these parameters were altered in TG mice expressing the nuclear-targeted CaMKIIdelta(B). In contrast, cardiac expression of either CaMKIIdelta(B) or delta(C) induced transactivation of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) gene expression and up-regulated hypertrophic marker genes. Studies using rat ventricular cardiomyocytes confirmed that CaMKIIdelta(B) and delta(C) both regulate MEF2-luciferase gene expression, increase histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) association with 14-3-3, and induce HDAC4 translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm, indicating that either isoform can stimulate HDAC4 phosphorylation. Finally, HDAC4 kinase activity was shown to be increased in cardiac homogenates from either CaMKIIdelta(B) or delta(C) TG mice. Thus CaMKIIdelta isoforms have similar effects on hypertrophic gene expression but disparate effects on Ca(2+) handling, suggesting distinct roles for CaMKIIdelta isoform activation in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy versus heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1978653936,"Background From the beginning of domestication, the transportation of domestic animals resulted in genetic and demographic processes that explain their present distribution and genetic structure. Thus studying the present genetic diversity helps to better understand the history of domestic species. Methodology/Principal Findings The genetic diversity of domestic goats has been characterized with 2430 individuals from all over the old world, including 946 new individuals from regions poorly studied until now (mainly the Fertile Crescent). These individuals represented 1540 haplotypes for the HVI segment of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. This large-scale study allowed the establishment of a clear nomenclature of the goat maternal haplogroups. Only five of the six previously defined groups of haplotypes were divergent enough to be considered as different haplogroups. Moreover a new mitochondrial group has been localized around the Fertile Crescent. All groups showed very high haplotype diversity. Most of this diversity was distributed among groups and within geographic regions. The weak geographic structure may result from the worldwide distribution of the dominant A haplogroup (more than 90% of the individuals). The large-scale distribution of other haplogroups (except one), may be related to human migration. The recent fragmentation of local goat populations into discrete breeds is not detectable with mitochondrial markers. The estimation of demographic parameters from mismatch analyses showed that all groups had a recent demographic expansion corresponding roughly to the period when domestication took place. But even with a large data set it remains difficult to give relative dates of expansion for different haplogroups because of large confidence intervals. Conclusions/Significance We propose standard criteria for the definition of the different haplogroups based on the result of mismatch analysis and on the use of sequences of reference. Such a method could be also applied for clarifying the nomenclature of mitochondrial haplogroups in other domestic species."

The endogenous cellular antioxidant defense system plays an important role in protecting cells from various external and internal stresses caused by xenobiotics and drugs (1Dhakshinamoorthy S.

The perturbation of these cytoprotective regulations causes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species or electrophilic insults contributing to the pathogenesis of various diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and atherosclerosis. Proper detoxification is mediated by the immediate expression of antioxidant proteins and phase 2 detoxifying enzymes through the activation of antioxidant-response element (ARE) 2The abbreviations used are:AREantioxidant-response elementINrf2inhibitor of Nrf2 also known as Keap1Nrf2nuclear transcription factorNQO1NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1t-BHQtert-butyl hydroquinoneChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationsiRNAshort interfering RNARTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHA-Ubhemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin. -binding transcription factors (4Hayes J.D.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The ARE is recognized by a subset of Cap'n'Collar-containing basic leucine zipper proteins, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factors (Nrfs), including Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3. Among the three protein factors, Nrf2 is most potent transcription factor in regulation of basal and induced expression of antioxidant enzyme genes (11Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Gene deletion studies also supported the important function of Nrf2 in cellular protection against oxidative stress and neoplasia (12Ramos-Gomez M. Kwak M.K. Dolan P.M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Kensler T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3410-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 resides predominantly within the cytoplasm of the cells by an interaction between Nrf2 and actin-bound cytosolic protein, INrf2 (inhibitor of Nrf2) or Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) (13Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M.

A. 2004; 101: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). INrf2 functions as a substrate adaptor protein for a Cul3-dependent ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase complex to maintain the steady-state levels of Nrf2 (16Zhang D.D. Lo S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10941-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). It is also believed that Nrf2 is rapidly degraded by INrf2-mediated ubiquitination because Nrf2 is barely detected in the cytoplasm. However, the exposure to oxidative stress leads to dissociation of Nrf2 from INrf2. Nrf2 is stabilized, translocates into the nucleus, and activates transcription of a battery of antioxidant genes. Recently, the mechanisms by which Nrf2 is released from INrf2 under stress have been actively investigated. One mechanism is that antioxidant-induced protein kinase C phosphorylation of serine 40 in Nrf2 leads to dissociation of Nrf2 from INrf2 (17Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42769-42774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 18Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44675-44682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In addition, several protein kinases, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase have also been involved in post-translational modification of Nrf2 and activation of Nrf2 (11Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 19Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2006; 46: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cysteine thiol groups of INrf2 were shown to function as sensors for oxidative stress that are modified by the chemical inducers, causing formation of disulfide bonds between cysteines of two INrf2 peptides. This results in conformational change that renders INrf2 unable to bind to Nrf2 (20Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 21Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2040-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The free Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and activate genes leading to cytoprotection. Several reports suggest that persistent accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus is harmful. INrf2-null mice demonstrated persistent accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus that led to postnatal death from malnutrition resulting from hyperkeratosis in the esophagus and forestomach (22Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi J. Motohashi H. Noda S. Takahashi S. Imakado S. Kotsuji T. Otsuka F. Roop D.R. Harada T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Reversed phenotype of INrf2 deficiency by breeding to Nrf2-null mice suggested tightly regulated negative feedback might be essential for cell survival (23Kwak M. Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8135-8145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The recent systemic analysis of INRF2 genomic locus in human lung cancer patients and cell lines showed that deletion, insertion, and missense mutations in functionally important domains of INrf2 results in reduction of INrf2 affinity for Nrf2 and elevated expression of cytoprotective genes (24Padmanabhan B.

Taken together, unrestrained activation of Nrf2 in cells increases a risk of adverse effects, including tumorigenesis. On the other hand, stress-induced activation of the Nrf2 pathway in normal cells is tightly regulated and confers cytoprotection against oxidative and electrophilic stress and carcinogens. Therefore, it appears that cells contain mechanisms that autoregulate cellular abundance of Nrf2. In this study, we demonstrate that there is an autoregulatory feedback loop in the Nrf2 pathway. After Nrf2 activation by antioxidant, an increase in INrf2 expression was detected. INrf2 promoter and Nrf2 knockdown/overexpression studies show that Nrf2 induces promoter activity of the INrf2 gene through Nrf2 binding to an ARE in the reverse strand of the proximal promoter of the INrf2 gene. The induced INrf2 protein accelerates ubiquitination of Nrf2 for degradation. Therefore, Nrf2 controls its own degradation by regulating INrf2 levels in the cells. Cell Cultures—Human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) and mouse hepatoma (Hepa-1) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HepG2 cells were grown in minimum essential α medium and Hepa-1 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (40 units/ml), and streptomycin (40 μg/ml). The cells were grown in monolayer in an incubator at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. Generation of Stable Flp-In T-REx HEK293 Cells Expressing Tetracycline-inducible Nrf2—Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells purchased from Invitrogen were co-transfected with FLAG-Nrf2 cDNA in pcDNA5/FRT/TO and pOG44 plasmids (Invitrogen) by Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) method and the manufacturer's instructions. Forty eight hours after transfection, the cells were grown in medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). The 293/FRT/FLAG-Nrf2 cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible N-terminal FLAG-tagged Nrf2 were selected. The stably selected cells were grown and treated with 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma) for varying periods of time to follow the overexpression of FLAG-tagged Nrf2. Plasmid Constructs—Genomic clones (BAC vector) containing mouse INrf2 loci were purchased from BACPAC Resources Center, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA. A 2,706-bp fragment of INrf2 promoter was isolated via PCR using the 5′-CGAGATCTGAGCTCTGAACTGCAAAGCAGAGTGAAAGCAGGTGGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGAGATCTGAGCTCCGCGCTCTGCCTCCGCCTCCGCCGCGC-3′ primer pairs and high fidelity platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR-amplified promoter fragments were first subcloned in to pSC-B vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and then subcloned into pGL2-basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using SacI restriction site. The construct was designed as pGL2–2.7 kb (-2,700/-1, +1 is transcription initiation site). The sequence of the PCR forward primers for a series of deletion constructs is as follows: 1.7 kb forward, 5′-CGAGATCTGAGCTCTTCACCACCTACCTGCATGGTGCCCACAGAGGTCA-3′; 1.1 kb forward, 5′-CGAGATCTGAGCTCTGGAGCACTCGAGCTGCACTTTGCAGGCTCCA-3′. The same reverse primer, as used to construct 2.7-kb plasmid, was used. To generate pGL2–0.08-kb deletion construct, pGL2–1.1 kb was digested by SmaI and re-ligated after removing -1100/-82 promoter region. pGL2–1.1 and 0.08 kb with mutated ARE were produced by site-directed mutagenesis with the PCR-based QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, pGL2–1.1 kb or 0.08 kb was denatured for 1 min at 95 °C in the presence of mutagenic primers as follows: mARE-1 forward, 5′-GGGTGGGACGGAGGGTCGCGATAGCCCGCGGAGGATGC-3′; mARE-r1 forward, 5′-GGGTGGCGCGCTGTTATTAGGACCCGTGACCCGCGCGG-3′; mARE-r2 forward, 5′-GGGAGGGTCCGCCGGTTAAGGTGACGCTGGAGGCGTACCGG-3′. To clarify which ARE has an essential role in Nrf2-induced INrf2 promoter activity, oligonucleotides containing each ARE sequence were synthesized and cloned into the pGL2 promoter vector. The sequences of oligonucleotides of AREs are as follows: ARE-1, 5′-GTGGGACGGAGGTGAGCGAGCGCCCGCGGAT-3′; ARE-r1, 5′-GCGCGCTGTGCTTAGTCACCGTGACGCTA-3′; ARE-r2, 5′-TCCGCCGGTGCAGGTTCAGCTGGAGGCGTA-3′. The sequence accuracy of all constructs was confirmed by using ABI 3700 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The luciferase plasmid harboring human NQO1 gene ARE is described earlier (13Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Plasmids, pcDNA-Nrf2-V5, pCMV-FLAG-INrf2, and HA-Ub are also described previously (26Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16502-16510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). RT-PCR and Northern Analysis—Cells were treated with t-BHQ ± actinomycin D as indicated in the figures. The RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 250 ng of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using a Superscript one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). After synthesis of cDNA at 50 °C for 30 min, the PCR was performed for 27 cycles consisting of the following steps: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers for RT-PCR were as follows: mouse INrf2, forward 5′-GGCAGGACCAGTTGAACAGT-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGTCACCTCACTCCAGGTA-3′; human INRF2, forward 5′-CAGAGGTGGTGGTGTTGCTTAT-3′ and reverse 5′-AGCTCGTTCATGATGCCAAAG-3′; mouse Nrf2, forward 5′-CTCGCTGGAAAAAGAAGTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-CCGTCCAGGAGTTCAGAGAG-3′; human NRF2, forward 5′-CGGTATGCAACAGGACATTG-3′ and reverse 5′-ACTGGTTGGGGTCTTCTGTG-3′; human NQO1, forward 5′-CCTGGCCCTTGCAATCTTCTAC-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGCTCGGTCCAATCCCTTCA-3′; mouse GAPDH, forward 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA-3′; human GAPDH, forward 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. RT-PCR products were resolved on 1% ethidium bromide-containing agarose gel and imaged using an Eagle Eye System (Stratagene). Ten micrograms of RNA were also analyzed by Northern blotting and hybridization with 32P-labeled mouse INrf2 cDNA. The blot was washed and autoradiographed. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA-B buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Nuclear extracts were made using a nuclear extract kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Thirty micrograms of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with anti-INrf2 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Nrf2 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (1:5000, Sigma), or anti-actin (1:5000, Sigma) antibodies, washed, and probed with electrochemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To confirm the purity of nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation, the membranes were reprobed with cytoplasm-specific, anti-lactate dehydrogenase (Chemicon) and nuclear specific, anti-lamin B antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein expression was quantified by using NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on line at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). In related experiments, the cells were treated with 50 μm t-BHQ in the absence or presence of 30 μg/ml cycloheximide for different time intervals. The cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting and probed with INrf2 antibody. The blot was stripped and reprobed with β-actin antibody. Ubiquitination Assay—Hepa-1 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates and co-transfected with pCMV-FLAG-Nrf2 (1.0 μg) and pCMV-HA-Ub (0.5 μg) as described previously (26Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16502-16510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were treated with either Me2SO or 50 μm t-BHQ (Sigma) for the indicated time. To check Nrf2 ubiquitination, 1 mg of protein lysate was used to immunoprecipitate with anti-FLAGM2 beads (Sigma). To analyze Nrf2 ubiquitination in cytoplasm and nuclear extracts, Hepa1 cells in 100-mm plates were co-transfected with pcDNA-Nrf2-V5 (1.0 μg) with or without plasmids encoding HA-Ub (0.l5 μg) and pCMV-FLAG-INrf2 (0.5 μg). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using active motif kit, and 1 mg of extracts was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HepG2, Flp-In T-REx HEK293, or 293/FRT/FLAG-Nrf2 cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of the indicated luciferase plasmid using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The pRL-TK plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (0.01 μg; Promega) was included as an internal control of transfection efficiency. After 32 h, transfected HepG2 cells were stimulated with Me2SO or 50 μm t-BHQ for 16 h. Otherwise, transfected Flp-In T-REx HEK293 or 293/FRT/FLAG-Nrf2 cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml of tetracycline for 8 or 16 h. The cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed using a kit from Active Motif as described previously (8Wang W. Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 70% confluent Hepa-1 cells were treated with Me2SO or 50 μm t-BHQ for 4 h and then fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were lysed and nuclei pelleted by centrifugation. Nuclei were resuspended and sheared using a sonicator (Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY) with five pulses of 20 s at 25% of maximum output. Sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-Nrf2 or control IgG antibody. The cross-links reversed overnight at 65 °C and deproteinated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K. Nrf2-associated INrf2-ARE was detected by PCR amplification with the primers as follows: ARE-r1, forward, 5′-GAGCCCTCGTAGGGTGGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTGGAGCGGCTCACTCAC-3′; ARE-r2, forward, 5′-GGTCTAGTTGGACCGTGCAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTACGCAGAGGCAGTTCCAG-3′. The PCR condition used for ChIP assay was 37 cycles of a denaturing step at 94 °C for 30 s, an annealing step at 65 °C for 30 s, and an extension step at 72 °C for 30 s. PCR products (∼167 bp with ARE-r1 primers and ∼165 with ARE-r2 primers) were separated on 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and imaged using an Eagle Eye System (Stratagene). Gel and Supershift Assay—INrf2 ARE-r2 and ARE-r1 was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase. 100,000 cpm was incubated with 10 μg of HepG2 nuclear extract, and band shift reaction performed as described earlier (13Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In the same experiment the gel shift mixture was incubated with 2 μg of control IgG or Nrf2 antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixtures were separated on polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Nrf2 siRNA Interference Assay—Nrf2 siRNA was used to inhibit Nrf2 by a procedure described previously (8Wang W. Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nrf2 siRNA and control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. HepG2 and human 293 kidney cells were transfected with 25 and 50 nm control siRNA or Nrf2 siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours later, cells were co-transfected with 0.1 μg of INrf2 promoter-luciferase and 0.01 μg of pRL-TK Renilla plasmids. Thirty two hours after the second transfection, cells were treated either with Me2SO or with 50 μm t-BHQ for 16 or 4 h. The cells at the end of treatment were harvested and analyzed by measuring luciferase activity, INrf2 and Nrf2 RNA by RT-PCR, and INrf2 and Nrf2 protein by Western blot analysis and probing with INrf2 and Nrf2 antibodies. Statistical Analyses—The data from luciferase assays were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Antioxidant t-BHQ Up-regulates INrf2 Gene Expression—RT-PCR analysis of mouse Hepa-1 cells treated with t-BHQ showed a concentration- and time-dependent increase in INrf2 gene expression (Fig. 1A, left and middle panels, also see the quantitative densitometry graph below the figure). Preincubation with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D blocked the t-BHQ-mediated induced expression of INrf2 (Fig. 1A, right panel). Northern analysis also demonstrated the t-BHQ concentration-dependent increase in INrf2 RNA (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis supported RT-PCR and Northern analysis data (Fig. 1C). The t-BHQ treatment of Hepa-1 cells showed a time-dependent increase in INrf2 protein until 8 h (Fig. 1C). The increase in INrf2 protein was reduced at 16 h after t-BHQ treatment. However, in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, INrf2 protein induction with t-BHQ was more or less blocked (Fig. 1C, right panel) confirming the increase in INrf2 is because of new protein synthesis. Replacement of mouse Hepa-1 cells with human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells also demonstrated time- and concentration-dependent increase in INrf2 RNA in response to t-BHQ treatment (Fig. 1D). The t-BHQ induced expression of INrf2 was comparable with NQO1, a known t-BHQ-inducible protein (11Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). ARE in the Proximal Promoter on Reverse Strand (ARE-r1) Mediates Expression and t-BHQ Induction of INrf2 Gene Expression—Deletion/internal mutagenesis followed by transfection assays investigated the cis-element(s) required for expression and t-BHQ induction of mouse INrf2 gene (Fig. 2). A 2.7-kb INrf2 gene promoter attached to the luciferase gene upon transfection in HepG2 cells produced luciferase activity that was induced in response to t-BHQ treatment (Fig. 2A). Deletion mutagenesis in 2.7-kb INrf2 gene promoter and transfection analysis in HepG2 revealed that 80 bp upstream to the start site of transcription is required for basal expression and induction in response to t-BHQ (Fig. 2A). Mouse INrf2 promoter was analyzed for various putative cis-elements, including Nrf2-binding AREs. Mouse-INrf2 promoter analysis was done using the genomatix web tool, Matinspector, available on line. The binding sites with a matrix similarity score over 0.9 were considered. Analysis of 2.7-kb INrf2 promoter sequence revealed the presence of putative binding sites for transcription factors, hepatic nuclear factor (HNF-1), signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT-6), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, OCT1, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr)/Arnt heterodimers, and hypoxia-inducible factor-binding sites. Interestingly, nucleotide sequence analyses of 2.7-kb INrf2 promoter also revealed the presence of three putative AREs (Fig. 2A). Two of these elements were on the reverse strand at nucleotide position -591 (ARE-r2) and -46 (ARE-r1) from the start site of transcription. The third element was located at nucleotide position -272 on the sense strand. The AREs were individually mutated in 1.1-kb INrf2 gene promoter-luciferase plasmid. The mutated plasmids were transfected in HepG2 cells and analyzed for luciferase activity in the absence and presence of t-BHQ to determine the role of individual AREs in expression and t-BHQ induction of the INrf2 gene (Fig. 2B). An ARE from the human NQO1 gene cloned into luciferase reporter plasmid was used as a positive control for t-BHQ-mediated luciferase gene induction (Fig. 2B, last panel). The results revealed that mutation of the ARE-r1 element in 1.1-kb INrf2 promoter resulted in the significant reduction in basal expression and abrogation of t-BHQ induction as compared with the normal 1.1-kb INrf2 promoter (p > 0.001). The mutation of ARE-r2 had no effect, whereas mutation of ARE-1 had minimal effect on 1.1-kb INrf2 gene expression and induction in response to t-BHQ. Mutation of ARE-r1 in the 0.08-kb INrf2 promoter also resulted in a significant decrease in basal expression and loss of t-BHQ induction of expression as compared with normal 0.08-kb INrf2 promoter (Fig. 2B). The NQO1 gene hARE-luciferase plasmid was used as a positive control for the assay (Fig. 2B). The three AREs were individually cloned in the pGL2 promoter vector, transfected in HepG2, and analyzed for luciferase activity to determine its role in t-BHQ induction of luciferase gene expression through the heterologous promoter (Fig. 2C). The results demonstrated that ARE-r1 and not other two AREs efficiently mediated expression and t-BHQ induction of luciferase gene expression. Antioxidant Increases in Vivo Binding of Nrf2 to ARE-r1—We performed ChIP assay in Hepa-1 cells using an Nrf2-specific antibody and PCR primers covering the ARE-r1 and ARE-r2 regions in the INrf2 promoter to determine the binding of Nrf2 to ARE-r1 of the INrf2 gene in Me2SO- and t-BHQ-treated Hepa-1 cells. The results demonstrated binding of Nrf2 to the ARE-r1 but not ARE-r2 in INrf2 gene promoter (Fig. 3A). The Nrf2 binding to ARE-r1 was enhanced by 1.7-fold in response to t-BHQ, but there was no Nrf2 bound to ARE-r2 of INrf2 even after t-BHQ treatment (Fig. 3, A and B; p > 0.05). These data indicate a specific interaction of Nrf2 to ARE-r1 of the INrf2 gene promoter, which is enhanced upon t-BHQ treatment. INrf2 gene ARE-r1 was also used in a gel/supershift analysis to analyze the specificity of Nrf2 binding (Fig. 3C). The results demonstrate that Nrf2 antibody resulted in a supershifted band indicating the specificity of the interaction (Fig. 3C). Nrf2 Mediates t-BHQ Induction of INrf2 Gene Expression—Oxidative and electrophilic stresses are known to induce the stability of Nrf2 that leads to nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 resulting in transcriptional activation of antioxidant and phase II drug-metabolizing enzyme genes, including NQO1 gene (11Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of increased and decreased expression of Nrf2 in regulation of INrf2 gene expression. We used overexpression of Nrf2 and siRNA inhibition of Nrf2 to demonstrate a role of Nrf2 in ARE-r1-mediated expression and t-BHQ induction of INrf2 gene expression (Figs. 4 and 5). We also successfully established the Flp-In T-Rex 293 cell lines (293/FRT/FLAG-Nrf2) that upon stimulation with tetracycline showed a time-dependent increase in FLAG-Nrf2 RNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4B). The RT-PCR analysis also revealed that tetracycline-induced overexpression of FLAG-Nrf2 led to time-dependent increases in INrf2 gene expression. In the same experiment, the Nrf2 downstream gene NQO1 was also induced. The transfection of Flp-In T-Rex 293 or 293/FRT/FLAG-Nrf2 cells with ARE-r1-luciferase plasmid revealed time-dependent increases in ARE-r1-luciferase gene expression upon stimulation with tetracycline (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 5siRNA inhibition of Nrf2 decreases t-BHQ-inducible expression of INrf2. A, HepG2 cells were transfected with 25 and 50 nm control or Nrf2 siRNA. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, lysed, and immunoblotted with anti-Nrf2 and actin antibodies. B and C, HepG2 cells were transfected with control or Nrf2 siRNA. Twenty four hours after siRNA transfection, HepG2 cells were transfected with pGL2, pGL2-ARE-r1, pGL2-INrf2-1.1 kb, or pGL2-INrf2-1.1kb-ARE-r1. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence of Me2SO (DMSO) or t-BHQ (50 μm). Transfected cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity. D and E, HepG2 cells were transfected with 25 nm control or Nrf2 siRNA. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with 50 μm t-BHQ for 4 h. INRF2 and NRF2 expression was examined by RT-PCR (D) and Western blot analysis (E) using specific primers and antibodies for INrf2 and Nrf2. GAPDH and β-actin were used as loading controls. The relative intensities of amplified bands were quantitated, normalized to GAPDH/β-actin signals, and plotted as fold induction versus treatment. The experiments were repeated three times. The representative results are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further explore the role of Nrf2 in the t-BHQ-induced INrf2 gene expression, we co-transfected HepG2 cells with control or Nrf2 siRNA and ARE-r1-Luc plasmids and analyzed for luciferase gene expression (Fig. 5, A and B). Nrf2 siRNA, but not control siRNA, effectively inhibited the expression of Nrf2 (Fig. 5A) and ARE-r1-mediated luciferase gene expression (Fig. 5B). In similar experiments, Nrf2 siRNA also inhibited 1.1-kb normal INrf2 but not ARE-r1 mutant 1.1-kb INrf2 gene-mediated luciferase gene expression and induction in response to t-BHQ (Fig. 5C). RT-PCR analysis showed that siRNA inhibition of Nrf2 in HepG2 cells led to abrogation of t-BHQ induction of INrf2 gene expression (Fig. 5D). The replacement of Hepa-1 with HepG2 cells also demonstrated Nrf2 mediated regulation of INrf2 gene expression (data not shown). Western analysis showed that the transfection of HepG2 cells with Nrf2 siRNA resulted in inhibition of Nrf2 and abrogation of t-BHQ induction of INrf2 (Fig. 5E). Nrf2-mediated Up-regulation of INrf2 Led to Increased Degradation of Nrf2—The treatment of Hepa-1 cells with antioxidant t-BHQ resulted in stabilization of Nrf2 that started within 0.5 h and peaked at 4 h after treatment (Fig. 6A). The Nrf2 levels declined at 8 and 16 h after t-BHQ treatment. At 16 h, the Nrf2 levels were reduced to almost normal cellular levels. The stabilization of Nrf2 between 0.5 and 4 h led to increased expression of INrf2 starting at 2 h and maximizing at 8 h and then plateauing at 16 h after t-BHQ treatment. The ubiquitination of Nrf2 reduced at 2 and 4 h after t-BHQ treatment and then significantly increased at 8 and 16 h after t-BHQ treatment. In other words, t-BHQ-induced stabilization of Nrf2 was followed by increased expression of INrf2 followed by increased ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. Our earlier published work has suggested that the Nrf2 is mostly degraded in cytoplasm as its degradation could be blocked in the presence of nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (27Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, we also found evidence that some of Nrf2 might also be degraded inside the nucleus (27Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed the cellular compartment-specific ubiquitination/degradation of Nrf2. Cytosol and nuclear extracts obtained from Nrf2-V5-transfected Hepa-1 cells were subjected to ubiquitination analysis (Fig. 6B). The results demonstrate that overexpression of FLAG-INrf2 leads to reduced levels of Nrf2 in both cytosol and nucleus confirming INrf2-mediated Nrf2 degradation (Fig. 6B, lower panel). However, enriching the ubiquitinated-Nrf2 indicated that most of the Nrf2 gets ubiquitinated in the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 6B, upper panel). These results are complementary to our earlier published data and together conclude that Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation mostly takes place in cytosol. The results showed that antioxidant treatment induced the expression of INrf2. This raised an interesting question regarding the mechanism of expression and antioxidant induction of INrf2 and the in vivo role of increased INrf2. The results also demonstrated the presence of a functional ARE on the reverse strand at position -46 of the INrf2 promoter. Nrf2 bound to this ARE on the reverse strand. The increase in expression of Nrf2 resulted in increased INrf2 gene expression. Mutations in ARE at the -46 position and siRNA inhibition of Nrf2 significantly reduced both the expression and antioxidant induction of the INrf2 gene. These experiments concluded that an ARE on the reverse strand at nucleotide position -46 and transcription factor Nrf2 regulated the expression and antioxidant induction of INrf2 gene expression. The role of other AREs in INrf2 gene promoter was minimal in expression and induction of the INrf2 gene. Further studies showed that increased INrf2 blocked Nrf2 activity by enhancing the ubiquitination and rapid degradation of Nrf2. In other words, Nrf2 induced INrf2 for its own degradation. These results suggested the presence of a novel feedback autoregulatory loop between INrf2 and Nrf2 that controls cellular abundance of INrf2 and Nrf2. The regulation of the INrf2 gene by the Nrf2 protein has an interesting consequence because INrf2 protein can combine with Nrf2 and modulate down its activity as a transcription factor through degradation of Nrf2 (28McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 29Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. O'Connor T. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). When INrf2 protein is expressed in a cell, it blocks Nrf2 function, which results in less Nrf2 being made. Thus, the activity of Nrf2 and the levels of INrf2 in a cell are kept in balance by the autoregulatory feedback loop. Factors that activate or inactivate either INrf2 or Nrf2 are expected to disrupt the autoregulatory loop with functional consequences. Chemicals and radiation that disrupt this loop by dissociating Nrf2 from INrf2 act to increase Nrf2 activity and Nrf2 downstream antioxidant gene expressions. This leads to protection and cell survival. Factors like mutations in INrf2 leads to inactivate INrf2 resulting in persistent nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 with adverse effects on cell survival. The INrf2-null mice demonstrated persistent accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus that led to postnatal death from malnutrition resulting from hyperkeratosis in the esophagus and forestomach (22Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi J. Motohashi H. Noda S. Takahashi S. Imakado S. Kotsuji T. Otsuka F. Roop D.R. Harada T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In addition, the recent INrf2 genomic locus analysis in human lung cancer patients and cell lines showed that deletion, insertion, and missense mutations in functionally important domains of INrf2 results in reduction of INrf2 affinity for Nrf2 and elevated expression of cytoprotective genes (24Padmanabhan B.

In summary, Nrf2:INrf2 serves as sensors of chemical- and radiation-induced oxidative/electrophilic stress (Fig. 7). Nrf2 is translocated in the nucleus leading to activation of antioxidant genes that protect cells against adverse effects of chemical/radiation exposure. The Nrf2 is exported out of the nucleus, ubiquitinated, and degraded (30Jain A.K. Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29158-29168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). INrf2 is required for ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. INrf2 is also capable of entering inside the nucleus to facilitate degradation of Nrf2 (31Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Nioi P. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32485-32492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). A feedback autoregulatory loop between INrf2 and Nrf2 controls cellular abundance of INrf2 and Nrf2. Nrf2 regulates the expression and induction of INrf2. The induction of INrf2 follows ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2 and suppression of INrf2 gene expression. In other words, Nrf2 regulates INrf2 by controlling its transcription, and INrf2 controls Nrf2 by facilitating its degradation. We thank our colleagues for their help and discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2079843273,"Diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease in humans and ruminants relies on the detection in post-mortem brain tissue of the protease-resistant form of the host glycoprotein PrP. The presence of this abnormal isoform (PrP(Sc)) in tissues is taken as indicative of the presence of TSE infectivity. Here we demonstrate conclusively that high titers of TSE infectivity can be present in brain tissue of animals that show clinical and vacuolar signs of TSE disease but contain low or undetectable levels of PrP(Sc). This work questions the correlation between PrP(Sc) level and the titer of infectivity and shows that tissues containing little or no proteinase K-resistant PrP can be infectious and harbor high titers of TSE infectivity. Reliance on protease-resistant PrP(Sc) as a sole measure of infectivity may therefore in some instances significantly underestimate biological properties of diagnostic samples, thereby undermining efforts to contain and eradicate TSEs."

Type 3 IP3R is expressed in taste cells, but the physiological relevance of this receptor in taste perception in vivo is still unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking IP3R3 show abnormal behavioral and electrophysiological responses to sweet, umami, and bitter substances that trigger G-protein-coupled receptor activation. In contrast, responses to salty and acid tastes are largely normal in the mutant mice. We conclude that IP3R3 is a principal mediator of sweet, bitter, and umami taste perception and would be a missing molecule linking phospholipase C β2 to TRPM5 activation.

Taste perception is a pivotal and primitive sensory system for survival in animals. By sensing taste, animals are provided with valuable information about foods (e.g. qualities and nature) and can choose the nutrient-rich foods necessary for living or avoid harmful and toxic substances. There are five taste categories (sweet, bitter, umami, sour, and salty), and recent studies have furthered our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of taste perception, especially for sweet, bitter, and umami tastes (1Scott K.

Because PLCβ2 activation actually leads to production of both IP3 and diacylglycerol, it is an important issue to definitely determine, which is a major player for gustatory systems. To clarify whether IP3R is necessary for taste perception in vivo, we analyzed the taste signaling of IP3R-deficient mice in this study (16Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K.

We found that mice lacking IP3R3 showed altered taste recognition for sweet, bitter, and umami, whereas they were indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) mice in their recognition for salty and sour stimuli. However, they showed residual responses to high concentrations of sweets and bitter. Our data present the direct validation that IP3R3 is a key molecule in taste perception for sweet, bitter, and umami and also suggest the existence of IP3R3-independent taste signal transduction for recognition of high dose of these tastants. phospholipase C β2 wild-type chorda tympani monosodium glutamate glossopharyngeal nerve inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor transient-receptor potential receptor M5 phosphate-buffered saline reverse transcription. Mice—IP3R3- and IP3R2-deficient mice were generated as described previously (16Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Science. 2005; 309: 2232-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and the mice intercrossed with C57BL/6 mice at least twelve times were used. WT C57BL/6 mice were littermates or purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). All experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Experiment Committee of RIKEN Brain Science Institute. Detection of Taste-related Proteins in Mouse Taste Buds—Two mouse tongues were removed and a protease solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4) containing 0.25 mg/ml elastase and 2 mg/ml collagenase type I was injected under the circumvallate papilla, and the epithelium was peeled away after 15 min. The peeled epithelium was then incubated in the enzyme solution (0.25 mg/ml elastase, 2.0 mg/ml collagenase, and 1.6 mg/ml dispase) for 5 min at room temperature and further incubated in Ca2+-free solution of tyrode. After 30 min, taste buds became to be loosely attached to the epithelium, and we gently detached all taste buds using forceps in the buffer as possible as we could. The buffer containing all taste buds of two mice circumvallate papilla were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the precipitated taste buds were lysed with 50 μl of sample buffer. Fifteen μl of the lysate per lane was used for Western blotting analysis. Although we could not count the accurate number of taste buds, re-immunoblotting of β-actin of the same membrane helped us to confirm that lysates of WT and IP3R3-deficient samples largely contained similar numbers of taste buds. Proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was treated with the blocking solution (0.05% Tween/PBS) containing 5.0% skim milk for 1 h and probed with the indicated primary antibodies. Monoclonal mouse antibodies, KM1112, KM1083, and KM1082 were used for detection of IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3, respectively (17Sugiyama T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-gustducin and -PLCβ2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Monoclonal mouse anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies, the immobilized specific antigen was visualized with ECL plus detection kit (GE Healthcare). Immunocytochemistry—Mouse tongue was removed and fixed with 4.0% formaldehyde/PBS for 3 h at 4°C, then immerged in 30% sucrose/PBS for overnight. The tissues were embedded in tissue compound, and the frozen sections at 12-μm thickness were created using cryostat. Frozen sections of mouse lingual tissue were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton/PBS for 10 min and blocked with 1.0% goat serum or 3.0% skim milk/PBS for 1 h. Then, sections were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies used for the experiments were: rabbit anti-IP3R3 antibody (raised in rabbit using amino acid 2391-2463 peptide of mIP3R3 for an antigen), rabbit anti-PLCβ2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-gustducin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-TRPM5 (kind gifts from Dr. Robert F. Margolskee), and rabbit anti-T1R3 (kind gifts from Dr. Charles S. Zuker). After washing with PBS for 15 min, sections were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG) (Invitrogen) for 1 h at RT. After washing with PBS for 15 min, the sections were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed under IX-70 confocal fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from taste cells of three WT and IP3R3KO mice using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was produced from the total RNA using reverse transcriptase Superscript II (Invitrogen) and oligonucleotide (dT) primers. The cDNAs were amplified with specific primers for mT2R108: sense 5′-ggcaccaaacgaggaaagatg-3′, antisense 5′-tcaggaccaaagaggctactaacg-3′; mT2R138: sense 5′-atgctgagtctgactcctgtcttaac-3′, antisense 5′-gcaggagagaagaagaacaactag-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): sense 5′-atggtgaaggtcggtgtgaaccg-3′, antisense 5′-aaacatgggggcatcggcagaa-3′. After an initial cycle of 2 min at 95 °C, the reaction was cycled 30 times for 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2.0% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Electron Microscopy—Young adult KO mice and their littermates of wild-type mice, 4 in number for each group, were examined. Under an inhalation anesthesia with diethyl ether, the animals were perfused transcardially with Ringer's solution saturated with O2 and subsequently with a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% paraformaldehyde buffered at pH 7.3 with 0.1 m phosphate. The circumvallate papilla was excised, halved on the midline, and kept overnight in the same fixative. The tissue pieces were postfixed in 1.0% OsO4, buffered at pH 7.2 with 0.1 m phosphate for 2 h at 4 °C, dehydrated through a series of ethanol, and embedded in Epon-812. Ultrathin sections were examined in a Hitachi H-7100 transmission electron microscope after double staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Two-bottle Preference Tests—Two-bottle preference tests were performed as described previously (18Wong G.T. Gannon K.S. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1996; 381: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were individually housed and given to food ad libitum. Two sipper bottles, one containing distilled water and the other containing tastant solution were presented. After 24 h, intakes of each solution were recorded, and the positions of the two sipper bottles were replaced to reduce the preference of the position of the bottle in a cage. Tastants were presented in an ascending order. Preference ratios were calculated as the intake of tastant compared with total intake. Electrophysiological Recordings—Whole-nerve responses of the CT and glossopharyngeal nerves (NGs) to lingual application of tastants were recorded as described previously (19Kawai K. Sugimoto K. Nakashima K. Miura H. Ninomiya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11044-11049Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, tastants were applied to the tongue for 30 (CT) and 60 s NG at a regular flow rate. Integrated whole-nerve response magnitudes (time constant, 1 s) were measured 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 s (for CT) and 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 s (for NG) after stimulus onset. These data were averaged, normalized to the responses to 0.1 m NH4Cl, and analyzed with the general linear model multiple measures of the statistics package SPSS. For nerve recordings to monosodium glutamate (MSG), we performed the experiments in the presence of 10 μm amiloride. Taste Bud Morphology and the Expression of Taste-related Proteins in IP3R3KO Mice—We first examined the expression level of several taste-related proteins and taste bud morphology in WT and IP3R3-deficient mice. As shown in Fig. 1A, we detected all three subtypes of IP3Rs in WT taste bud lysates by Western blotting. Consistent with the previous data using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR (20Miyoshi M.A. Abe K. Emori Y. Chem. Senses. 2001; 26: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Clapp T.R. Stone L.M. Margolskee R.F. Kinnamon S.C. BMC Neurosci. 2001; 2: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the expression of IP3R3 is predominant among the three subtypes of IP3R because the pan-IP3R antibody, which recognizes all types of IP3Rs at a similar level (22Hattori M. Suzuki A.Z. Higo T. Miyauchi H. Michikawa T. Nakamura T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11967-11975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), detected the bands for IP3Rs in WT taste bud lysates but not in IP3R3-deficient taste bud lysates (Fig. 1A). The expression levels of PLCβ2 and gustducin in IP3R3-deficient taste buds were equivalent to those in WT taste buds (Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical studies also indicated that PLCβ2, gustducin, T1R3, and TRPM5, which are crucial molecules for taste signaling, were normally expressed in IP3R3-deficient mice at levels comparable with those in WT mice (Fig. 1B). Immuno-signals for IP3R3 were completely abolished in IP3R3-deficient mice, whereas IP3R3 signal was detected in WT taste buds (Fig. 1B), confirming the specificity of the antibody. We also tried to detect the immunosignals for IP3R1 and IP3R2 in taste buds, but they were under the detection level (data not shown). At the morphological level, no apparent alterations were detected in the taste buds of IP3R3-deficient mice as compared with WT mice by hematoxylin-eosin staining (Fig. 1C). We further examined the taste bud morphology in electron microscopy (Fig. 2). The taste buds in the IP3R3 KO mice, as well as those in the control mice, were represented by tight aggregates of spindle-shaped cells, each of which extended from the base to the taste pore (Fig. 2, A and B). As originally described by Takeda (23Takeda M. Arch. Histol. Jpn. 1976; 39: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the three major types of intragemmal cells (17Sugiyama T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were identifiable by their cytoplasmic constituents: the type I cell possessing a nucleus with deep indentations and apical granules of high electron density, the type II cell with an oval nucleus and considerable amounts of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2, C and D), and the type III cell that is characterized by a round clear nucleus and synaptic specialization; elevation in the electron density of the cell membrane and accumulation of granules. In both IP3R3 KO and WT mice, the taste-sensing type II and III cells frequently contacted with nerve endings that were rich in mitochondria and dense and clear vesicles, and type II taste cells displayed subsurface cisterns and atypical mitochondria in the contacting area (Fig. 2, E and F) (24Royer S.M. Kinnamon J.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1988; 270: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because taste bud sectioned through the axis, passing from the base to the pore, exhibited at least two type II cells and a single type III cell with their typical features in IP3R3 KO mice as similar to WT mice, the number of these cells constituting each taste bud did not seem to be largely different between IP3R3 KO and WT mice; a more detailed analysis might be required for evaluation of subtle changes in ultrastructure. Abnormal Taste Perception of Sweet, Bitter, and Umami in IP3R3KO Mice—We next examined the taste perception of IP3R3-deficient mice using the 48-hour two-bottle preference tests. Mice were provided with two sipper bottles (one bottle contained distilled water and the other contained a tastant solution), and the preference ratio (intake of tastant solution to total liquid intake) was calculated for each tastant solution at various concentrations. We found an obvious abnormality in taste perception in the IP3R3-deficient mice as shown in Fig. 3. Mice deficient for IP3R3 showed decreased responses to sweet (sucrose and saccharin), umami (monosodium glutamate), and bitter (quinine sulfate, denatonium benzoate, and cycloheximide) tastes, whereas WT mice responded to the tastes in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the behavioral response of IP3R3-deficient mice to salty taste (NaCl) was normal (Fig. 3). Likewise, IP3R3-deficient mice avoided the sour solution (HCl) in a dose-dependent manner, similar to the WT mice. By contrast, mutant mice lacking IP3R2 largely did not show any apparent abnormalities in taste perception, although there was a tendency that the mice showed a slightly reduced (sucrose, HCl) and stronger (denatonium, quinine sulfate, and NaCl) behavior responses compared with WT mice. Because we detected the IP3R2 expression in taste buds at a lower level (Fig. 1A), IP3R2 may be partially involved in the signal transduction for these tastants. Even if, our data strongly indicated a specific role for IP3R3 in in vivo taste signaling. We could not perform similar experiments in IP3R1-deficient mice because of their epilepsy and postnatal death within 21 days (25Matsumoto M. Nakagawa T. Inoue T. Nagata E. Tanaka K. Takano H. Minowa O. Kuno J. Sakakibara S. Yamada M. Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Fukuuchi Y. Furuichi T. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Noda T. Nature. 1996; 379: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of IP3R1 to taste signal transduction remains unknown. Electrical Recordings of Taste Nerve Responses in IP3R3KO Mice—To further test the deficit of peripheral taste signaling in the IP3R3-deficient mice, we finally took electrical recordings of the CT branch of the facial nerve and the NG, which innervated taste buds in the anterior and the posterior part of the tongue, respectively. Consistent with the behavioral data described above, the CT and NG electrical responses in IP3R3-deficient mice to sweet (sucrose, glucose, sorbitol, sucralose, maltose, and fructose, SC45647, acesulfame K, and saccharin), bitter (denatonium, cycloheximide, and quinine), and umami tastes were greatly reduced but not abolished compared with those of the WT mice, as shown in Fig. 4. On the contrary, almost no significant differences were observed between IP3R3-deficient mice and WT mice in the CT and NG responses to sour and salty tastes, which again was consistent with the behavioral data described in Fig. 3. Taken together, these results indicate that IP3R3 is a crucial mediator of sweet, bitter, and umami taste perception. Here, we have presented conclusive evidence from the behavioral experiments and electrical recordings that mice lacking IP3R3 show abnormal taste perception for sweet, bitter, and umami tastes, with gustation of sour and salty compounds being well preserved. Because the taste bud morphology of IP3R3 KO mice was apparently normal both in light and electron microscopic observation (Figs. 1C and 2), and the taste cells normally expressed several taste-related proteins other than IP3R3 at an equivalent level to WT cells by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR (Fig. 1, A and B and supplemental Fig. 1), the abnormal development of taste buds in IP3R3 KO mice did not explain the deficit of taste recognition. Consistent with the finding that IP3R3 was the dominant isoform among the three types of IP3Rs in taste buds (Fig. 1A), the abnormality of taste perception was specific for IP3R3-deficient mice, and IP3R2-deficient mice generally showed normal taste perception (Fig. 3). Interestingly, however, IP3R3-deficient mice showed a residual behavioral response to sweet and bitter substances at high concentration (Fig. 3). Electrical recordings of taste nerve responses further supported the behavioral results and showed a slight difference in the degree of the reduction in responses from the two taste nerves. As for the sweet taste, CT responses were almost completely diminished, whereas NG responses were reduced but were still weak with a dose-dependent increase (e.g. sucrose (>0.3 mm) and acesulfame potassium at 0.3 m). Electrophysiological responses of both CT and NG nerves to bitter substances (quinine sulfate and denatonium) were generally reduced but were not diminished in response to high concentrations. As for the umami taste response, CT nerve responses were significantly reduced in IP3R3-deficient mice, whereas considerable responses were observed in IP3R3-deficient NGs. Recently, similar residual responses to a higher dose of tastants were found in TRPM5-deficient mice (26Damak S. Rong M. Yasumatsu K. Kokrashvili Z. Perez C.A. Shigemura N. Yoshida R. Mosinger Jr., B. Glendinning J.I. Ninomiya Y. Margolskee R.F. Chem. Senses. 2006; 31: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition, taste recognition of high doses of quinine and denatonium but not sucrose in PLCβ2-deficient mice was also reported by Dotson et al. (27Dotson C.D. Roper S.D. Spector A.C. Chem. Senses. 2005; 30: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reason for the residual behavioral and electrophysiological responses to sweet, bitter, and umami tastes in IP3R3-deficient mice is unknown; however our results indicate the contribution of IP3R-independent signal transduction; although we cannot rule out the involvement of a residual amount of expression of IP3R1, IP3R2, or other subtypes of PLC on taste signaling. Judging from the evidence that IP3R3-deficient but not PLCβ2-deficient mice showed residual responses to high concentrations of sucrose, diacylglycerol produced by PLCβ2 may play an important role in taste perception for sucrose at a high concentration (Fig. 5). By contrast, taste recognition of high doses of denatonium and quinine seems to be completely independent from the PLCβ2-IP3R3 signal pathway because both IP3R3- and PLCβ2-deficient mice showed behavioral responses to the bitter compounds. Excitation of taste cells through activation of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (28Misaka T. Kusakabe Y. Emori Y. Arai S. Abe K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 855: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Kolesnikov S.S. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or inactivation of K+ channels (30Avenet P. Hofmann F. Lindemann B. Nature. 1988; 331: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Cummings T.A. Kinnamon S.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 591-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in the downstream events of taste receptor activation may explain the PLCβ2-independent residual response to high doses of bitter stimuli. Although our behavioral data were generally consistent with the electrophysiological data, there is a dichotomy between the behavior and the neural responses in IP3R3 KO mice: the mutant mice showed residual nerve response to MSG (the reduced CT nerve responses and the considerable NG responses) but abolished their preference for MSG. The similar dichotomy for MSG is also reported in α-transducin and -gustducin double KO mice (32He W. Yasumatsu K. Varadarajan V. Yamada A. Lem J. Ninomiya Y. Margolskee R.F. Damak S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7674-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In mice, umami taste is known to elicit both CT and NG nerve responses (33Ninomiya Y. Nakashima K. Fukuda A. Nishino H. Sugimura T. Hino A. Danilova V. Hellekant G. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 950S-953SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). CT nerve response is related to the preference for MSG, whereas the NG neural response is related to aversion at higher concentrations (32He W. Yasumatsu K. Varadarajan V. Yamada A. Lem J. Ninomiya Y. Margolskee R.F. Damak S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7674-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, one explanation is that if the inputs from the two nerves are equal in net, the two signals may cancel each other, resulting in their behavior responses to be indifferent. Alternatively, electrophysiological signals may not be enough to elicit the behavioral response in the two-bottle preference tests. Based on our data and the previous findings that Ca2+ activates TRPM5 in heterologous cells (10Ullrich N.D. Voets T. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Talavera K. Droogmans G. Nilius B.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5777-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we propose the following model: IP3 produced by PLCβ2 in response to G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation triggers Ca2+ release through IP3R3 from the endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn activates TRPM5 in vivo (Fig. 5). Thus, IP3R3 is a key molecule to couple PLC with TRPM5 and plays an indispensable role in taste perception for sweet, bitter, and umami tastes. We thank Drs. Robert F. Margolskee and Charles S.

https://openalex.org/W2091684277,"Background P. falciparum gametocytes may persist after treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus artesunate (AS) and contribute considerably to malaria transmission. We determined the efficacy of SP+AS plus a single dose of primaquine (PQ, 0.75 mg/kg) on clearing gametocytaemia measured by molecular methods. Methodology The study was conducted in Mnyuzi, an area of hyperendemic malaria in north-eastern Tanzania. Children aged 3–15 years with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria with an asexual parasite density between 500–100,000 parasites/µL were randomized to receive treatment with either SP+AS or SP+AS+PQ. P. falciparum gametocyte prevalence and density during the 42-day follow-up period were determined by real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA). Haemoglobin levels (Hb) were determined to address concerns about haemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. Results 108 individuals were randomized. Pfs25 QT-NASBA gametocyte prevalence was 88–91% at enrolment and decreased afterwards for both treatment arms. Gametocyte prevalence and density were significantly lower in children treated with SP+AS+PQ. On day 14 after treatment 3.9% (2/51) of the SP+AS+PQ treated children harboured gametocytes compared to 62.7% (32/51) of those treated with SP+AS (p<0.001). Hb levels were reduced in the week following treatment with SP+AS+PQ and this reduction was related to G6PD deficiency. The Hb levels of all patients recovered to pre-treatment levels or greater within one month after treatment. Conclusions PQ clears submicroscopic gametocytes after treatment with SP+AS and the persisting gametocytes circulated at densities that are unlikely to contribute to malaria transmission. For individuals without severe anaemia, addition of a single dose of PQ to an efficacious antimalarial drug combination is a safe approach to reduce malaria transmission following treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2169037579,"Avian and human influenza viruses preferentially bind to alpha-2,3-linked and alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids, respectively. Until today, the distributions of these two receptor types had never been investigated in H5N1-infected human tissue samples. Here, the expression of avian (AIV-Rs) and human influenza receptors (HuIV-Rs) is studied in various organs (upper and lower respiratory tracts, brain, placenta, liver, kidney, heart, intestines, and spleen) of two H5N1 cases and 14 control cases. Histochemical stains using biotinylated Maackia amurensis lectin II and Sambucus nigra agglutinin were performed to localize AIV-Rs and HuIV-Rs, respectively. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed to identify the receptor-bearing cells. AIV-Rs were detected on type II pneumocytes; a limited number of epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract; and the bronchi, bronchioli, and trachea; as well as on Kupffer cells, glomerular cells, splenic T cells, and neurons in the brain and intestines. HuIV-Rs were abundantly present in the respiratory tract and lungs. They were also detected on Hofbauer cells, glomerular cells, splenic B cells, and in the liver. Moreover, endothelial cells of all organs examined expressed both receptor types. In conclusion, the distribution pattern of AIV-Rs is partially inconsistent with the pattern of infected cells as detected in previous studies, which suggests there may be other receptors or mechanisms involved in H5N1 infection. In addition, the diffuse presence of receptors on endothelial cells may account for the multiple organ involvement in H5N1 influenza. Finally, the relative lack of AIV-Rs in the upper airway may be a one of the factors preventing efficient human-to-human transmission of H5N1 influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2085793595,"FoxO1, a member of the forkhead rabdomyosarcoma (FoxO) subfamily of transcription factors, binds DNA via a highly conserved winged-helix “forkhead box” motif used by other regulatory proteins to mediate their effects through chromatin binding and remodeling. To examine how FoxO1 regulates target genes in chromatin, we studied the binding of purified recombinant FoxO1 protein to nucleosome particles and chromatin arrays containing the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 promoter. We found that FoxO1 is able to bind to its cognate sites within the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 promoter on a nucleosome. This binding stably perturbs core histone:DNA contacts extending up- and downstream from sites of FoxO1 binding without disrupting the underlying core particle. FoxO1 is able to harness these capabilities to bind to and de-condense linker histone-compacted chromatin arrays. Chromatin opening by FoxO1 requires both the N and C termini of the protein, which are also required for high affinity core histone binding and, in the case of the N terminus, nucleosome perturbation. We suggest that the chromatin binding and remodeling functions revealed here for FoxO1 endow all FoxO factors with the ability to initiate and dynamically modulate active chromatin states, enabling their diverse roles as gene regulatory factors in metabolism, cell survival, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and protection against oxidative stress.

Transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes occurs through the coordinated binding and interaction of multiple regulatory factors at promoters and enhancers. Because the eukaryotic genome is assembled into chromatin, it follows that transcriptional activation in eukaryotes occurs in the context of DNA organized into higher order chromatin structure. Chromatin is organized into repeating units of nucleosome core particles made up of nearly two turns of DNA wrapped around an octamer of the four core histone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and further condensed by binding of the linker histone H1. Higher order folding and oligomerization of H1-compacted chromatin, together with core histone:DNA contacts within individual nucleosome cores, block access of transcription factors to their cognate DNA sequences. It follows that, in order for transcription activation to occur, chromatin at regulatory regions must be remodeled to allow transcription factors access to the DNA. The perturbations in chromatin structure required to poise genes for activation and modulate their expression are mediated, at least in part, by certain regulatory factors capable of binding to their sites in chromatin. Chromatin-binding transcription factors can indirectly contribute to alterations in chromatin structure by recruiting chromatin remodeling and histone modifying coactivator proteins (1Becker P.B.

All forkhead proteins contain this highly conserved “winged-helix” DNA binding domain made up of three helices and two loops or “wings” folded into a variant helix-turn-helix (12Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar); sequence variants of this motif define the forkhead classes FOXA–FOXQ (16Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar, 17Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 1495-1500PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography has demonstrated that the winged-helix domain of the forkhead transcription factor FoxA3 has an overall structure similar to the globular domain of the linker histones H1 and H5 (12Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 18Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This structural similarity has been shown to endow certain forkhead proteins with the ability to bind their sites within condensed chromatin, a DNA context from which most other transcription factors are excluded. This is clearly seen in the case of the early developmental transcription factor FoxA1, whose ability to stably bind its sites within linker histone-compacted chromatin at the serum albumin enhancer has been shown to open the local domain to binding by additional regulatory proteins (9Cirillo L. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Jarnik M. Zaret K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 13Cirillo L.A. McPherson C.E. Bossard P. Stevens K. Cherian S.

Cell. 1999; 4: 961-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). More recently, the signaling factor FoxI1 was shown to use its ability to remodel chromatin higher order structure to stably create or remove DNase I-hypersensitive sites in a cell-cycle-dependent fashion (15Yan J. Xu L. Crawford G. Wang Z. Burgess S.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the winged helix is a structural hallmark of all forkhead family members, it might be assumed that chromatin binding and remodeling would be an important determinant in how these proteins function. However, out of the 100 members of the forkhead gene family that have been identified to date, only a handful have been demonstrated to mediate their effects on cellular processes through chromatin remodeling (9Cirillo L. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Jarnik M. Zaret K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 14Hollenhorst P.C. Bose M.E. Mielke M.R. Muller U. Fox K.A.

Schlelffer A. Endler L. Ammerer G. Nature. 2000; 406: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Of these, only one, FoxA, has been studied in combination with purified nucleosome templates to allow mechanistic questions to be addressed (9Cirillo L. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Jarnik M. Zaret K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 13Cirillo L.A. McPherson C.E. Bossard P. Stevens K. Cherian S. Shim E.-Y. Clark E.A. Burley S.K. Zaret K.S.

Additionally, structure-function analyses of the few forkhead proteins for which chromatin binding has been demonstrated have established the contribution of non-conserved protein sequences outside the forkhead box to chromatin binding and remodeling. For example, domain-swap studies have demonstrated that the forkhead domain alone does not define the differential function of the yeast transcription factors fkh1p and fkh2p in chromatin (14Hollenhorst P.C. Bose M.E. Mielke M.R. Muller U. Fox K.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1533-1548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the case of FoxA1, the C terminus, in addition to the DNA binding domain, participates in high affinity core histone binding and chromatin opening by this protein (9Cirillo L. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Jarnik M. Zaret K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). It is therefore unknown whether the majority of forkhead proteins bind to and remodel chromatin, and, equally important, how their ability to do so might translate into the diverse roles in cell cycle regulation, early embryonic lineage decisions, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis in which these factors have been implicated to date (reviewed in Ref. 17Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 1495-1500PubMed Google Scholar). Recent NMR studies demonstrating a strong structural similarity between the winged-helix motifs of the otherwise divergent FoxA and FoxO factors (21Weigelt J. Climent I. Dahlman-Wright K. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5861-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that the FoxO factors might activate their target genes by binding to and remodeling chromatin structure in a similar fashion to FoxA1. This possibility was particularly exciting, because FoxO factors (FoxO1 (FKHR), FoxO3a (FKHRL1), FoxO4 (AFX), and FoxO6) regulate the expression of numerous genes, such as glucose metabolic enzymes, proapoptotic factors, and cell cycle regulators, in multiple tissues (reviewed in Refs. 22Barthel A.

Trans. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the recent demonstration of FoxO1 as a potentiation factor for vascular development (24Hosaka T. Biggs 3rd, W.H. Tieu D.

FoxO proteins are transcription factors that bind to an insulin response element (IRE) located in the promoters of its target genes, transactivating their expression (28Nakae J. Kitamura T.

In response to insulin or insulin-like growth factors, protein kinase B/Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO leads to its cytoplasmic retention and the inhibition of transcriptional activity (33Biggs III, W.H.

In the absence of stimulation by insulin or growth factors, FoxO is de-phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus. In the liver, target FoxO genes include the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), glucose 6-phosphatase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes (28Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 29Ayala J.E. Streeper R.S. Desgrosellier J.S. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Svitek C.A.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In particular, the IGFBP1 gene, whose expression commences during early embryonic liver development (38Schuller A.G. Zwarthoff E.C. Drop S.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2544-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), is stimulated to high levels following liver injury and in response to glucocorticoid hormone and nutritional changes (39Lee J.

DNase-hypersensitive sites, suggestive of chromatin rearrangement, have been mapped to the region of the proximal promoter of the IGFBP1 gene encompassing the two FoxO1/3 binding sites within the IRE (42Crissey M.A. Leu J.I. De Angelis R.A. Greenbaum L.E. Scearce L.M. Kovalovich K. Taub R. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This, together with its winged-helix DNA binding domain, suggests a role for FoxO in these perturbations. However, to date, all studies of FoxO binding have been performed using free DNA promoter fragments or binding site oligonucleotides together with recombinant FoxO proteins containing only the winged-helix domain (36Zhang X.

Therefore whether and, if so, how FoxO proteins organize chromatin structure at the promoters to which they bind and the contribution of protein sequences outside the winged-helix domain to potential chromatin remodeling functions is unknown. To address these issues we studied the binding of purified, recombinant, full-length FoxO1 protein to nucleosome particles and chromatin arrays containing the IGFBP1 promoter. We demonstrate that FoxO1 is able to bind to its cognate sites within the IGFBP1 promoter on a nucleosome and to stably disrupt core histone:DNA contacts. FoxO1 is able to harness these capabilities to bind to and de-condense linker histone-compacted chromatin arrays. Chromatin opening by FoxO1 requires both the N and C termini of the protein, which are also required for high affinity core histone binding and, in the case of the N terminus, nucleosome perturbation by this protein. This study, which implicates FoxO1 as a pioneer factor for gene activation in chromatin, provides the first demonstration of FoxO protein binding to extended and condensed chromatin structures. It is also the first to directly map chromatin-remodeling capabilities, other than chromatin opening, to amino acid sequences located outside the winged-helix domain of a forkhead protein. We suggest a model for FoxO function through potentiation and modulation of active chromatin states. Plasmid Construction—The bacterial expression plasmid encoding histidine-tagged full-length FoxO1 (pET16b-10xhis-FoxO1) was created by subcloning the mouse FoxO1 cDNA (gift of Dr. Tatsuo Furuyama, Kumamoto University, Japan) in-frame into the NdeI-BamHI site of pET16b (Novagen). To generate FoxO1 truncation constructs, DNA fragments corresponding to partial amino acid sequences of FoxO1 were amplified by PCR using the following primers: FoxO1-DBD (amino acids 144–266, 5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG GAC AGC CGC GCA AGA CCA G-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA CCG CCC TCG GCT CTT AGC AAA-3′); FoxO1-N-term (amino acids 1–150, 5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG CCG AGG CGC CCC AGG TG-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA GCT GGT CTT GCG CGG CTG TCC-3′); FoxO1-C-term (amino acids 260–652, 5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGT TTG CTA AGA GCC GAG GGC GG-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA GCC TGA CAC CCA GCT ATG-3′); FoxO1-ΔN (amino acids 144–652, 5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG GAC AGC CGC GCA AGA CCA G-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA GCC TGA CAC CCA GCT ATG-3′); and FoxO1-ΔC (amino acids 1–266, 5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG CCG AGG CGC CCC AGG TG-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA CCG CCC TCG GCT CTT AGC AAA-3′). The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET-16b. To create the nucleosome array construct containing the IGFBP1 promoter, the DNA fragment corresponding to positions –371 to –11 of the mouse IGFBP1 promoter was amplified by PCR using the primers (5′-TGC TCT AGA CCC ACT CTT CCC TTC CCT TTG-3′ and 5′-CGG ACT AGT CGT ACC CAG AGC CTT ATG AAG-3′), followed by digestion with NheI and SpeI and gel purification. The MluI-NcoI fragment from p208-10.N1N2P (9Cirillo L. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Jarnik M. Zaret K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the MluI-NcoI site of pGL3 (Promega) to create pGL3.208-10.N1N2P. pGL3.208-10.IGFBP1 was then generated by subcloning the NheI-SpeI IGFBP1 promoter DNA fragment into XbaI and SpeI digested pGL3.208-10.N1N2P in place of the N1N2P albumin enhancer sequences. Protein Preparation—Native core histones were purified from nuclei isolated from livers of 6-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (47McPherson C.E. Horowitz R. Woodcock C.L. Jiang C. Zaret K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recombinant, high-performance liquid chromatography-purified Xenopus H2A and H2B were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies. Recombinant, high-performance liquid chromatography-purified Xenopus H3 and H4 were the gift of Dr. Vaughn Jackson (Medical College of Wisconsin). Purity and integrity of all histone preparations (≥95%) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. For purification of recombinant histidine-tagged FoxO1 proteins, the pET16b-10xhis-FoxO1 plasmids were introduced into the Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (Novagen). Transformants were cultured in 250 ml of LB media and grown to A600 = 0.4 at 25 °C, followed by induction of recombinant protein with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Three hours after induction, the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of dLysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT), and sonicated twice for 20 s. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove cell debris and then loaded onto a 1-ml anion exchange column, Hi Trap Q FF (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with dLysis buffer. Flow-through fractions containing FoxO1 proteins were collected and adjusted to a final concentration of 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole and loaded onto a 2-ml His Bond Resin (Novagen) column. The column was washed with five column volumes of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 6 m urea) and three column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 6 m urea). Histidine-tagged FoxO1 proteins were eluted with two column volumes of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 6 m urea), and dialyzed against 100 volumes of E. coli dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1% IGEPAL, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm DTT) containing 5 m urea for 16 h, followed by dialysis in the same buffer containing 4 m and 2 m urea for 2 h each. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Assembly and Purification of Nucleosome Cores and Arrays—Nucleosome cores were prepared as previously described (13Cirillo L.A. McPherson C.E. Bossard P. Stevens K. Cherian S. Shim E.-Y. Clark E.A. Burley S.K. Zaret K.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mouse IGFBP1 promoter DNA fragment corresponding to positions –204 to –25 was amplified by PCR using [γ32-P]ATP end-labeled primers (5′-TTA GCT CCT GTC CCA GTC CA-3′ and 5′-TTA TGA AGG GCT GGC TGT G-3′) followed by gel purification. The 32P-end-labeled DNA was then assembled onto purified native core histones at a DNA:histone ratio of 1:0.8 to 1:1 by salt-urea gradient dialysis. Assembled nucleosome cores were purified by glycerol gradient sedimentation and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. To generate the end-labeled array templates, pGL3.208-10.IGFBP1 was digested with MluI and PvuII and labeled with [α32-P]dCTP using Klenow, followed by purification of the 2.5-kb MluI-PvuII fragment. Assembly reactions containing 2 μg of end-labeled fragment and core histones at a 1:1.2 molar ratio of octamers to nucleosomal sites, 1 μg of BSA, and 2 m NaCl in a total of 10 μl, were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, serially diluted by adding 3.3, 6.7, 5, 3.6, 4.7, 6.7, 10, 30, and 20 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 15-min incubation steps at 30 °C, and brought to 0.1 m NaCl by adding 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, and 100 mg/ml of BSA, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 15 min. Binding Reactions and Enzymatic Assays—Binding reactions of FoxO1 proteins to free DNA templates or nucleosome cores were performed in final buffer conditions of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 40 mm KCl, 0.5% glycerol, 3 mg/ml BSA, and 1% Ficoll at 21–25 °C for 1 h (electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), DNase I footprinting assay, and SacI digestion assays) or overnight (DNase I footprinting competition assay). For the EMSAs, the binding reactions were loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA (TBE) buffer, followed by exposure to a phosphorimaging screen. For DNase I footprinting assays, the binding reactions were digested with 100 ng (free DNA templates) or 300 ng (nucleosome cores) of DNase I (diluted in 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) for 1 min at 21–25 °C. For DNase I footprinting competition assays, 80-fold (free DNA templates, FoxO1, 0.4 pmol) or 800-fold (nucleosome cores, FoxO1, 4 pmol) excess FoxO1 binding sites of cold double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the IGFBP1 promoter IRE (5′-AAG CAA AAC AAA CTT ATT TTG AAC-3′) was added to the binding reaction, and the mixture was incubated for 0, 20, and 180 s, followed by digestion with DNase I. For the SacI digestion assay, the binding reactions were diluted into 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm DTT and digested by the designated units of SacI for 30 min at 37 °C. Digestions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of stop buffer (30 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 50 mg/ml tRNA, 0.35 m NaCl), and DNA fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1), then chloroform alone, followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide-7 m urea sequencing gels in 1× TBE buffer and detected by both autoradiography and exposure to a phosphorimaging screen. Binding reactions for the DNase I digestion and SpeI assays on the nucleosome arrays were carried out with 1 nm nucleosome array (13 nm nucleosomes) in final buffer conditions of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 35 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 4% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml BSA. In experiments with compacted nucleosome arrays, purified mouse liver histone H1 (13 nm) was incubated with the nucleosome arrays for 1 h at 21–25 °C. Purified FoxO1 proteins were then incubated with the nucleosomal or mock assembled substrates for 1 h at 21–25 °C. DNase I digestions were performed by adding 40 or 80 ng of DNase I (diluted in 50 mm MgCl2), followed by incubation at 21–25 °C for 1 min. SpeI digestion was carried out in 6 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 35 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 45 min. Digestion reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 25 mg/ml tRNA, 0.2 mg/ml Proteinase K and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. DNA fragments were purified by ethanol precipitation and separated on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol and dried,"

The dopamine transporter, which terminates dopamine transmission via reuptake of released neurotransmitter, is regulated by receptor- and second messenger-linked signaling pathways. Whether D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function is unknown. We addressed this issue using a fluorescent imaging technique that permits real time quantification of dopamine transporter function in living single cells. Accumulation of the fluorescent dopamine transporter substrate trans-4-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium (ASP+) in human embryonic kidney cells expressing human dopamine transporter was saturable and temperature-dependent. In cells co-expressing dopamine transporter and D3 receptors, the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole produced a rapid, concentration-dependent, and pertussis toxin-sensitive increase of ASP+ uptake. Similar agonist effects were observed in Neuro2A cells and replicated in human embryonic kidney cells using a radioligand uptake assay in which binding to and activation of D3 receptors by [3H]dopamine was prevented. D3 receptor stimulation activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MAPK. Inhibition of either kinase prevented the quinpirole-induced increase in uptake. D3 receptor activation differentially affected dopamine transporter function and subcellular distribution depending on the duration of agonist exposure. Biotinylation experiments revealed that the rapid increase of uptake was associated with increased cell surface and decreased intracellular expression and increased dopamine transporter exocytosis. In contrast, prolonged agonist exposure reduced uptake and transporter cell surface expression. These results demonstrate that D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function and identify a novel mechanism by which D3 receptors regulate extracellular dopamine concentrations.

The D3 receptor has gained increasing attention as a target for the treatment of schizophrenia, psycho-stimulant abuse, and DA cell neurodegeneration (1Schwartz J.C. Diaz J. Pilon C. Sokoloff P.

Its restricted central nervous system distribution, relative to D2 receptors, suggests that D3 receptor ligands may have fewer side effects than currently available therapeutic agents. Studies using D3 receptor knock-out mice (5Koeltzow T.E. Xu M. Cooper D.C. Hu X.T. Tonegawa S. Wolf M.E. White F.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2231-2238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zapata A.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2519-2530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that D3 receptors regulate extracellular DA in ventral striatum. This effect was attributed to D3 regulation of a long negative feedback loop in which postsynaptic D3 receptors on medium spiny neurons modulate the activity of accumbens output neurons projecting to DA cell bodies in mid-brain (5Koeltzow T.E. Xu M. Cooper D.C. Hu X.T. Tonegawa S. Wolf M.E. White F.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2231-2238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis is incompatible with the effects of DA receptor ligands in tissue preparations in which efferent projections to midbrain DA nuclei are disrupted; modulation of extracellular DA by D3 receptors has been demonstrated in striatal slices (7Joseph J.D. Wang Y.M. Miles P.R. Budygin E.A. Picetti R. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Wightman R.M. Neuroscience. 2002; 112: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and tissue suspensions (10Zapata A. Shippenberg T.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies examining the mechanism of such regulation have been precluded by the lack of selective ligands that discriminate between D2 and D3 receptors in vivo (5Koeltzow T.E. Xu M.

DA signaling is terminated by the DA transporter (DAT), an integral membrane protein that re-uptakes DA released into the extracellular space (14Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Receptor and second messenger-linked kinase cascades regulate DAT function and cell surface expression (15Zahniser N.R. Doolen S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 21-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). An involvement of D2 DA receptors in regulating DAT function was suggested previously (16Cass W.A. Gerhardt G.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 176: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Meiergerd S.M. Patterson T.A. Schenk J.O. J.

J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, DA uptake and transporter-associated currents are increased in oocytes (19Mayfield R.D. Zahniser N.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) co-expressing human DAT (hDAT) and D2 receptors, and D2 receptor stimulation increases DAT activity in transfected HEK293 cells (20Bolan E.A. Kivell B. Jaligam V. Oz M. Jayanthi L.D. Han Y. Sen N. Urizar E. Gomes I. Devi L.A. Ramamoorthy S. Javitch J.A. Zapata A. Shippenberg T.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, modulation of DA uptake by low concentrations of D3-preferring ligands was reported in vivo (10Zapata A. Shippenberg T.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Such findings suggest that D3 receptors may regulate DA neurotransmission via a DAT-mediated mechanism. However, because the brain regions examined contain D2 and D3 receptors and the ligands employed bind to both receptor subtypes, the role of D3 receptors remains unclear. The present studies aimed to determine whether D3 receptors regulate DAT function in heterologous expression systems and to identify the intracellular mechanisms mediating this effect. We show that acute D3 receptor activation increases DAT activity in human embryonic kidney and mouse neuroblastoma cells co-expressing hDAT and human D3 receptors (hD3). This acute effect is pertussis toxin-sensitive and requires the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Interestingly, sustained D3 receptor activation has opposite effects, decreasing DAT activity. Furthermore, biotinylation studies show that D3 receptor stimulation regulates DAT trafficking by affecting both DAT endocytosis and exocytosis.

Cell Culture—Experiments were conducted in EM4 cells (R. Horlick, Pharmacopeia, Cranberry, NJ), HEK293 cells stably expressing macrophage scavenger receptor (21Robbins A.K. Horlick R.A. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and Neuro2A cells (N2A, American Type Culture Collection) unless otherwise indicated. ASP+ experiments were performed in EM4 cells stably transfected with FLAG-hDAT (22Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A.

Caron, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) and in EM4 or N2A cells transiently co-transfected with GFP-hD3 receptors and either FLAG-hDAT or YFP-hDAT (23Khoshbouei H. Wang H. Lechleiter J.D.

EM4 and N2A cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 and minimum Eagle's medium (Cellgro®, Mediatech, Inc, Herndon, VA), respectively, and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded on day 1 at 1.5 × 105 cells/35-mm glass-bottomed Petri dish (BiOptechs, Butler, PA), and transient transfections were performed on day 2 using Lipofectamine 2000. Experiments were performed 32–48 h after transfection when cells were 70–90% confluent. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. [3H]DA Uptake—EM4 cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate vector (FLAG-DAT, myc-hD3, and FLAG-DAT plus myc-hD3 receptor and pcDNA3 plasmids) as indicated in figures and legends. DA uptake was performed as described. Briefly, cells were washed with 1.0 ml of Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer, pH 7.4 (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm Tris, and 10 mm d-glucose), containing 0.1 mm ascorbic acid and 0.1 mm pargyline. Cells were then preincubated with the modulators for the indicated times followed by the addition of 20 nm [3H]DA to initiate DA uptake for 1 min. Uptake was terminated after 1.0 min of incubation at 22 °C by rapid washings with cold KRH assay buffer. Cells were lysed in 0.1% SDS, and accumulated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Initial studies revealed that part of the [3H]DA signal in cells transfected with hDAT plus hD3 was insensitive to the DAT blocker nomifensine but was blocked by the D3 antagonist spiperone or agonist quinpirole (Fig. 1, A and B, see “Results”). Therefore, for each experiment specific [3H]DA binding to the hD3 receptor was obtained from cells transfected with hD3 receptor plasmid alone or DAT plus hD3 receptor plasmids in the presence of 50 μm nomifensine. DAT-specific [3H]DA uptake was defined as the accumulation of [3H]DA in the presence of 0.1 μm spiperone (no receptor stimulation) or 10 μm quinpirole (maximal receptor stimulation). Note that [3H]DA signal obtained in the presence of spiperone or quinpirole was sensitive to DAT blocker nomifensine indicative of DAT-specific [3H]DA uptake. Nonspecific [3H]DA uptake and binding was defined as the accumulation/binding in the presence of both spiperone (or quinpirole) and nomifensine and was subtracted from total counts. Nonspecific background was also compared with cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone. Cell-based ELISA for pERK Activation—A phosphospecific cell-based ELISA (modified from Versteeg et al. (71Versteeg H.H. Nijhuis E. van den Brink G.R. Evertzen M. Pynaert G.N. van Deventer S.J. Coffer P.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)) for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK) was used to determine whether DA (1 pm to 10 μm) or the DAT substrates, tyramine (1 pm to 100 μm) and ASP+ (1 pm to 100 μm), activate D3 receptors. Flp-in T-rex 293 cells (Invitrogen) stably expressing FLAG-tagged hD3 receptors were used. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (50,000 cells/cm2) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Tetracycline (0.1 μm) was added for an additional 16–20 h to induce hD3 receptor expression. Cells were serum-starved in serum-free media for 2 h prior to substrate addition (100 μl). After 3 min, media were aspirated, and cells were immediately fixed by adding 150 μl of 4% formaldehyde/PBS solution for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS solution (three times for 10 min). After blocking with 10% BSA in Triton/PBS solution for 1 h, cells were washed with Triton/PBS solution. Primary p-ERK monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was diluted 1:400 in Triton/PBS solution containing 5% BSA, and cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing cells three times with PBS/Triton solution, and 1 h of incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse 2° antibody (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS/Triton solution containing 5% BSA, cells were again washed with Triton/PBS solution. Pierce supersignal ELISA Pico substrate (100 μl) was added to each well for 2 min, and the luminescence signal was measured with a BMG PolarStar reader. The values from each experiment were normalized to the basal level for that experiment. The means ± S.E. are shown for these determinations from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. The data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism using a one-site sigmoidal dose-response curve. Live Cell Imaging of ASP+ Uptake—Time-resolved quantification of DAT function in single cells was achieved using the fluorescent, high affinity DAT substrate ASP+ (27Schwartz J.W. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9768-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to experiments, growth media were removed, and cells were washed two times in Krebs-Ringer/HEPES medium (KRH (in mm): 130 NaCl, 1.3 KCl, 2.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 10 HEPES, and 1.8 g/liter glucose, pH 7.4). After washing, fresh KRH was added, and the culture dish was mounted on an UltraVIEW™ LCI spinning-disk confocal microscope fitted with a ×60 water objective lens (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A within cell design was used to assess the effects of the D2/D3 agonists, quinpirole (0.1–10 μm) and PD12897 (10 μm) on ASP+ uptake. Immediately after mounting of the culture dish, the microscope was focused on the center of a monolayer of cells, and background auto-fluorescence was determined by collecting an image immediately prior to replacement of the KRH buffer with buffer containing ASP+ (10 μm). Vehicle or agonist was added 5 min later, and the slope of ASP+ accumulation was determined over a 1-min period both before and after their addition. Control studies showed that ASP+ uptake by DAT was linear over the first 10 min after ASP+ addition (28Kivell, B. M., Kahlig, K. M., Galli, A., Javitch, J. A., and Shippenberg, T. S. (2004) Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. Viewer/Itinerary Planner 280.12Google Scholar). Images were collected every 20 s for 10 min to enable capture of either GFP or YFP (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 525–575 nm) and ASP+ fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 607–652 nm). A between cell design was used for control experiments assessing saturability, temperature dependence, and the influence of DAT substrates and blockers on ASP+ uptake. Cells were preincubated with test drug or vehicle for the designated time periods, and total intracellular ASP+ accumulation over a 5-min time period was quantified. Saturation of ASP+ uptake was tested using a range of ASP+ concentrations (5–70 μm), and temperature dependence was determined by measuring total ASP+ accumulation at 22 and 6 °C. The influence of the DAT substrates d-amphetamine (0.1–10 μm), dopamine (0.1–10 μm), or cocaine (3–15 μm) on ASP+ uptake was examined by preincubating cells for 15 min and then adding ASP+ and measuring total intracellular ASP+ accumulation for 5 min in the continued presence of substrate or inhibitor. The sodium dependence was investigated by measuring ASP+ uptake in the presence or absence of the monovalent cation channel-forming peptide gramicidin (10 μg/ml, 10 min of preincubation) (29Kelkar D.A. Chattopadhyay A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2011-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The influence of the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (30Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T.

ASP+ was then added, and the effects of the D3 agonist on the rate of intracellular ASP+ accumulation were determined using a within cell design as described above, in the presence or absence of the corresponding kinase inhibitor. The concentrations of inhibitors used were chosen based on reported effective concentrations (30Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 31Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

For ASP+ uptake, fluorescent accumulation within the cell was measured as the average pixel intensity of time-resolved images. The intracellular fluorescence is the signal contained inside the cell as defined by the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane was identified by either GFP-D3 or YFP-DAT visualization (which are localized mainly in the plasma membrane) or bright field optics (in the case of FLAG-hDAT or N2A cells). Data are expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units or as a percent change in the rate of ASP+ uptake after drug addition. The total intracellular ASP+ fluorescence 5 min after addition of ASP+ was used as a measure of basal uptake (ASP+ accumulation over 5 min, see Figs. 2 and 3). To measure drug-induced effects on uptake, the rate of ASP+ fluorescence accumulation during the minutes before and after drug addition was calculated as the increase in intracellular ASP+ signal over that min. The effect of the drug was calculated as the percent change in the rate of ASP+ accumulation before and after the drug addition. Typically 10–100 cells were used for each experiment. These cells were from at least two culture dishes from three separate transfection experiments. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons between groups. Statistical significance was achieved at p < 0.05.FIGURE 3ASP+ uptake in hDAT-expressing EM4 cells. ASP+ uptake is inhibited by the DAT substrates d-amphetamine and DA (A) and the transporter blocker cocaine (B) in EM4 cells stably expressing YFP-hDAT. EM4 cells stably expressing FLAG-hDAT and transiently transfected with GFP-hD3 cDNA readily express the receptor, which is targeted to the plasma membrane (C). The time course of ASP+ uptake in a representative within the cell experiment is shown in D. Note the initial rapid binding phase after ASP+ addition, followed by the linear uptake phase. Addition of quinpirole increases the rate of ASP+ uptake relative to pre-drug values. The increase in DAT function is measured as a change in the slope of uptake measured within 1 min before and after addition of drug.

On the day of the assay, cells were treated for 15 min with kinase inhibitor or vehicle prior to stimulation with quinpirole (10 μm) for 1 min at 37 °C. After incubation, media were aspirated, and boiling Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added directly to the wells. Lysates were then collected and boiled for 10 min. For DAT protein immunoblot analysis, samples were incubated with Laemmli buffer for 30 min at room temperature (see below). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20% Duramide gradient gel; Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bellerica, MA). The membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat milk. Phosphorylated MAPK was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for p44/42 MAPK phosphorylated at residues threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 (p-ERK). Phosphorylated Akt was detected utilizing a rabbit polyclonal antibody that detects levels of Akt only when phosphorylated at serine 473 (p-Akt). To control for differences in protein loading, blots were stripped with 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, for 1 h at 50 °C and reprobed with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes total p44/42 MAPK or total Akt. All kinase antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Blots were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. For quantification, films were scanned at high resolution using a Scanjet 7400c (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA), and band densities were quantified using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). The relative amounts of phosphorylated kinases were normalized against those of the corresponding total kinase. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison post hoc test using the GraphPad Prism version 4.0. The significance level for all analyses was p ≤ 0.05. Surface Biotinylation of DAT—Cell surface biotinylation and immunoblot analyses were performed as described (33Li L.B. Chen N. Ramamoorthy S. Chi L. Cui X.N. Wang L.C. Reith M.E. J. Biol.

EM4 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 12-well plates containing DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% O2 at 37 °C. After 24 h, cells were transfected with FLAG-hDAT and myc-hD3 receptor cDNA plasmids (0.9 μg of D3 receptor and 0.3 μg of DAT) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. In all wells, the total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with the corresponding empty vector. Where indicated, cells were treated with different modulators 24 h after transfection, as described in the figure legends. At the end of the treatment, cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS/Ca-Mg (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3) and incubated with EZ link NHS-Sulfo-SS-biotin (1 mg/ml) in PBS/Ca-Mg for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by two washes with cold 100 mm glycine in PBS/Ca-Mg and further incubation with 100 mm glycine in PBS/Ca-Mg at 4 °C for 20 min. The cells were then lysed in 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholic acid) containing protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin A, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) for 1 h at 4 °C with constant shaking. Lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with streptavidin beads (100 μl of beads/400 μl of cell lysates from one well) for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 30 min at 22 °C. Aliquots from total cell lysates (50 μl) and unbound fractions (100 μl), and all (50 μl) of the streptavidin-bound samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal DAT-specific antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). To validate the surface localization of biotinylated DAT protein, blots were stripped and reprobed with anticalnexin antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Band intensities were quantified using NIH Image J software (version 1.32j).

https://openalex.org/W2100112739,"Microcephalin (MCPH1) is one of the causative genes for the autosomal recessive disorder, primary microcephaly, characterized by dramatic reduction in brain size and mental retardation. MCPH1 also functions in the DNA damage response, participating in cell cycle checkpoint control. However, how MCPH1 is regulated in the DNA damage response still remains unknown. Here we report that the ability of MCPH1 to localize to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks depends on its C-terminal tandem BRCT domains. Although MCPH1 foci formation depends on H2AX phosphorylation after DNA damage, it can occur independently of MDC1. We also show that MCPH1 binds to a phospho-H2AX peptide in vitro with an affinity similar to that of MDC1, and overexpression of wild type, but not C-BRCT mutants of MCPH1, can interfere with the foci formation of MDC1 and 53BP1. Collectively, our data suggest MCPH1 is recruited to double-strand breaks via its interaction with γH2AX, which is mediated by MCPH1 C-terminal BRCT domains. These observations support that MCPH1 acts early in DNA damage responsive pathways.

These observations support that MCPH1 acts early in DNA damage responsive pathways. Cell cycle checkpoints are critical for detecting damaged DNA and delaying cell cycle progression to allow time for DNA repair. If the damage is too great, they can also trigger cell death. Increasing evidence has shown that defects within these DNA damage checkpoints can lead to genetic instability, a hallmark of cancer cells (1Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cells. 2003; 3: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). The DNA damage response is a complex network of proteins that can sense DNA lesions and relay and amplify the signal to downstream effectors to promote accurate and safe transmission of genetic material to the next generation. This pathway is usually classified as having groups of proteins involved in different steps; that is, sensors, mediators, and effectors. Canonically, the DNA damage response is a signal transduction cascade triggered by a series of phosphorylation-dependent events that activate proteins involved in transducing the DNA damage signal (ionizing radiation (IR) 3The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; PTIP, Pax2 transactivation-interacting protein; MCPH1, microcephalin; MDC1, mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1; Gy, gray; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT, wild type; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. 3The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; PTIP, Pax2 transactivation-interacting protein; MCPH1, microcephalin; MDC1, mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1; Gy, gray; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT, wild type; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. or stalled replication) to different effector proteins that evoke specific effects, namely halting cell cycle progression, activating DNA repair mechanisms and transcription, and triggering apoptosis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) becomes active upon IR and relocalizes to the sites of double-strand breaks and phosphorylates H2AX, a histone variant that marks sites of damaged DNA. This then allows for the recruitment of other mediator proteins like MDC1, BRCA1, and 53BP1. These proteins help promote the damage signal to Chk1 and Chk2, which can phosphorylate various substrates to modulate the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. However, increasing evidence has shown that the DNA damage response is not a linear pathway; DNA damage proteins can also act both upstream and downstream of their respective functions and maintain cross-talk with other proteins. Instead of a linear pathway as previously thought, there is an intricate network of proteins that function independently and dependently to coordinate the response to DNA damage and maintain genomic stability.Because of their important roles in maintaining genomic stability, this pathway has been shown to be mutated and deactivated in human cancer, and inherited mutations in several of these proteins cause cancer susceptibility syndromes. Indeed, proteins involved in the DNA damage response and DNA repair, when mutated, cause genetic diseases that predispose individuals to cancer. BRCA1 mutations account for >50% of familial breast cancer cases, and mutations in ATM cause ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome, causing sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents as well as cancer. Recent studies have also provided evidence that the DNA damage response is an anti-cancer barrier, which must be overcome in early neoplastic lesions for tumorigenesis to occur (2Gorgoulis V.G.

MCPH1 function as a mediator is still in debate. Using siRNA targeting MCPH1, several groups have shown that MCPH1 depletion affects BRCA1 and Chk1 protein levels as well as the foci formation of ATM, MDC1, and 53BP1, potentially placing MCPH1 as an early participant in the DNA damage response (4Xu X.

However, cells derived from patients with mutations in MCPH1 do not have differences in BRCA1 and Chk1 protein levels and raise the possibility that MCPH1 may function downstream of ATR and Chk1 in regulating G2/M transition (7Alderton G.K.

The purpose of our study was to delineate how MCPH1 is regulated in the DNA damage response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Plasmids—Human MCPH1 cDNA was graciously provided by Dr. David Stern at Yale University. Full-length and deletions of MCPH1 were generated by PCR and cloned by EcoRI and XmaI sites into a modified pIRES2-EGFP vector that contains an N-terminal S, FLAG, and streptavidin binding peptide tag. MCPH1 BRCT point mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and verified by sequencing. All primer sequences used are available upon request. HeLa and 293T cells were purchased from American Tissue Type Culture (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (v/v).

FANCD2-reconstituted and -deficient cells were a generous gift of Dr. Alan D'Andrea at the Department of Pediatric Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). For irradiation, cells were irradiated using a JL Shepherd Cs137 source at the indicated doses.Antibodies and Transfection—Rabbit anti-MCPH1 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide containing residues 96-110 of MCPH1 (MNEHLSSLIKKRKC). The antibody was affinity-purified using SulfoLink Plus Immobilization kit (Pierce). BACH1, Claspin, Chk2, 53BP1, MDC1, and H2AX antibodies have been previously described (8Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K.

Polyclonal anti-rabbit MCPH1 was purchased from Abcam (ab2612) for Western blotting. Monoclonal ATM clone 2C1 antibody was purchased from GeneTex. Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 was purchased from Sigma. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine per the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA was performed using Oligofectamine per manufacturer's instructions and as indicated. Control siRNA, ATM SMARTpool, and MDC1 siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon.Viral Infection—Full-length MCPH1 was cloned into pEF1A-HA/FLAG retroviral vector using the gateway system. pEF1A-MCPH1 was co-transfected with pCL-Amphobac in BOSC23 packaging cell lines to produce virus. Virus was collected 48 and 72 h after transfection and subsequently used to infect MEF cell lines. 48 h after the last infection, MEFs were irradiated as indicated, and immunofluoresence was performed or selected in puromycin for stable clones.Immunofluoresence and Western Blotting—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min, rinsed 1× with PBS, and then permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then washed and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% goat serum at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were washed again 1× in PBS and incubated in secondary antibodies, either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, for 20 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were counterstained with DAPI, washed with PBS, and then mounted onto slides with anti-Fade. Images were taken using a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 microscope.Cells were lysed with NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice and then rocked for 10 min at 4 °C. Crude cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and cleared lysates were collected. Samples were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer and run on SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk, Tris-buffered saline-Tween and then probed with antibodies as indicated.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—For cell cycle analysis, cells were either trypsinized or collected by mitotic shake-off. Cells were washed in cold PBS 2×, then resuspended in 300 μl of cold PBS and fixed with 700 μl of ice-cold 100% ethanol. Cells were then incubated in RNase A in sodium citrate buffer (100 units/sample) for 30 min, then stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 30 min. Cells were then run on a FACScan, and cell cycle analysis was performed.Preparation of MCPH1 and MDC1 BRCT Domains—The tandem BRCT domains of human MCPH1 (MCPH1-BRCT, residues 640-835) and human MDC1 (MDC1-BRCT, residues 1884-2089) were cloned in an expression plasmid derived from pET15b (Novagen) encoding an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. For protein production, the plasmid was transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen), and the cells were grown in LB media at 37 °C until they reach an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼0.8 and then at 18 °C for ∼16 h after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in a bind buffer made up of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl. The cells were lysed with a high pressure microfluidizer Emulsiflex C-5 (Avestin Inc.) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant fraction was passed through a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Subsequently, the column was washed with a solution of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl, and the protein was eluted with a similar solution but with 500 mm imidazole. Tobacco etch virus protease was added to the protein at room temperature overnight to cleave the polyhistidine tag. Further purification was carried out by size exclusion chromatography using a preparative Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were carried out at 10 °C with a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal). The concentrated stocks of MCPH1-BRCT, MDC1-BRCT, and γH2AX peptide (residues 130-142) were in the target buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl) and diluted with the same buffer to achieve a protein concentration of 35 μm and 1.3 mm for γH2AX. In a typical experiment the peptide solution was placed in a 298-μl calorimeter syringe and delivered initially as a 3-μl injection and then as a series of 5-μl injections every 5 min to the reaction cell containing 1.4 ml of the protein. Under identical conditions control experiments were also performed to determine the heat of dilution. The initial data point was routinely deleted. Data were analyzed with Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear regression using a single-binding site model with the software ORIGIN 7.0 (OriginLab).RESULTSMCPH1 Localizes to the Sites of DNA Damage—MCPH1 has been shown to relocalize to the sites of DNA breaks generated by IR and ultraviolet (UV) light. We developed an antibody raised against amino acids 96-110 of MCPH1, which readily detects MCPH1 foci in irradiated HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). Damage-induced MCPH1 foci formation was not only detected in cells after IR but was also apparent in cells treated with various DNA-damaging or replication-stressing agents, including hydroxyurea (HU), mitomycin C (MMC), methylmelanosulfate (MMS), and etoposide (Fig. 1A). These induced MCPH1 foci always co-localize with that of γH2AX (Fig. 1A), confirming that MCPH1 relocates to the sites of DNA damage.Past studies have shown that several proteins in the DNA damage response are cell cycle-regulated, which impacts on how they function in checkpoint control and in DNA repair (13Peschiaroli A. Dorrello N.V. Guardavaccaro D. Venere M. Halazonetis T. Sherman N.E. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 14Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We investigated whether MCPH1 expression is cell cycle-regulated using T24 cells that when grown confluent arrest in the G0 or quiescent stage of the cell cycle. After 96 h of contact inhibition these cells were trypsinized and replated to allow re-entry into the cell cycle. We also performed a mitotic shake off experiment using HeLa cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole. Cells from each were taken at specific time intervals and assayed for MCPH1 protein expression by Western blot and cell cycle analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Fig. 1, B and C). There is no apparent cell cycle regulation of MCPH1 protein levels, as MCPH1 is detected in all cell cycle phases by immunoblotting. Consistent with this result, we also routinely observe the expression of MCPH1 at all cell cycle stages by immunofluoresence staining (data not shown). Thus, MCPH1 is expressed throughout the cell cycle,; raising the possibility that MCPH1 may function to maintain genomic stability throughout the cell cycle.C-terminal BRCT Domains of MCPH1 Are Required for Its Foci Formation after DNA Damage—Next, we explored what region of MCPH1 is important for foci formation. Previous reports have shown that the C-terminal BRCT domains of BRCA1 are important for its localization to the sites of DNA damage (15Au W.W. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6993-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether the MCPH1 C-terminal BRCT domains are required for its localization to the sites of DNA damage, we generated epitope-tagged consecutive C-terminal truncation mutants of MCPH1 (Fig. 2A). We expressed wild-type MCPH1 and these MCPH1 deletion mutants in 293T cells and determined their cellular distribution after IR. Indeed, disruption of the C-terminal BRCT domains abolished MCPH1 nuclear foci formation after IR; however, deletion of the N-terminal domain of MCPH1 has no affect on foci formation (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, deletion of residues 301-400 caused abnormal localization of these truncated proteins to the cytoplasm. Within this region spanning amino acids 355-375 there is a canonical nuclear localization signal, RKRVSHGSHSPPKEKCKRKR, that appears to be important for the nuclear localization of MCPH1.FIGURE 2The tandem C-terminal BRCT domains of MCPH1 are required for foci formation. A, diagram of different tagged-MCPH1 (SFB-MCPH1) deletion mutants. 293T cells grown on coverslips were transfected with plasmids encoding wild type or each of these deletion mutants of MCPH1. 24 h after transfection cells were treated with 10 Gy and allowed to recover for 6 h before fixation and immunostaining (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because deletion of the C-terminal BRCT domains abrogated the foci formation of MCPH1, we analyzed if specific mutations within the BRCT domains would affect focus localization of MCPH1. MCPH1 BRCT domains share extended sequence similarity with BRCA1 BRCT domains (Fig. 3A). All of these BRCT domains contain an invariable tryptophan residue, which is important for the three-dimensional structure of the BRCT domain because mutation of this residue abolished the phosphopeptide binding activity of BRCT domains (16Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). We generated arginine substitution mutations for each of the four conserved tryptophans within MCPH1 BRCT domains (W75R mutation in the N-terminal BRCT domain, W706R, W712R, and W815R mutations in the C-terminal first and second BRCT domains) and evaluated the localization of W75R, W706R, and W815R MCPH1 mutants after IR. Point mutations of the C-terminal BRCT domains abolished foci formation, but mutating the N-terminal BRCT domain had no affect on MCPH1 localization (Fig. 3B). Together with the deletion mutants shown in Fig. 2, these data demonstrate that the C-terminal BRCT domains are crucial for the localization of MCPH1 to the sites of DNA damage.FIGURE 3Mutations within the C-terminal BRCT domains abolish MCPH1 foci formation.

These range from defective cell cycle checkpoints and abolishment of foci formation for several important mediator and effector proteins in the DNA damage response to impacting on Cdc25A degradation and normal G2/M transition. However, the results are still controversial, as a MCPH1 knock-out mouse model has not been characterized as of yet, and these studies with siRNA may have off-target effects. Because there are still differing viewpoints on how MCPH1 functions in the DNA damage response, we focused on determining how MCPH1 is regulated upon DNA damage. To answer this question we have evaluated the dependence of MCPH1 foci formation in response to IR using an exhaustive panel of human cells and MEFs that are defective in various DNA damage checkpoint components. As shown in Fig. 4A, MCPH1 forms foci independently of ATM after IR. Similar phenomena have been observed for 53BP1, H2AX, and Pax2 transactivation-interacting protein (PTIP) (8Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K. Franco S. Gostissa M. Rivera M.A. Celeste A. Manis J.P. van Deursen J. Nussenzweig A. Paull T.T. Alt F.W. Chen J. Mol.

MCPH1 appears to also be independent of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex and Fanconi anemia (FA) complex, as MCPH1 forms foci in response to IR in Nbs1-deficient and in PD20 (FANCD2−/-) cells (Fig. 4A). We further examined whether MCPH1 foci formation would depend on several mediator proteins, like MDC1, 53BP1, and BRCA1. MCPH1 foci formation was the same in BRCA1-deficient HCC1937 cells as that in HCC1937 cells reconstituted with wild-type BRCA1 (Fig. 4A). Our anti-MCPH1 antibody was generated against human MCPH1 and did not cross-react with mouse MCPH1. To study whether MCPH1 focus localization depends on MDC1, 53BP1, or H2AX using their corresponding knock-out MEFs, we used a retrovirus-based system to express tagged MCPH1 in these MEFs. As shown in Fig. 4B, tagged wild-type MCPH1 readily formed foci after IR in wild-type MEFs. Although MCPH1 foci formation was abolished in H2AX−/- MEFs, the correct localization of MCPH1 was restored when H2AX−/- MEFs were reconstituted with a WT H2AX transgene but not when a H2AX S139A mutant transgene was used (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the focus localization of MCPH1 depends on H2AX phosphorylation in vivo. Interestingly, we observed normal MCPH1 foci formation in MDC1−/- or 53BP1−/- cells, suggesting that MCPH1 acts downstream of H2AX but is independent of MDC1, 53BP1, or BRCA1 after DNA damage. This places MCPH1 at the early steps in the DNA damage induced signal transduction pathways.FIGURE 4MCPH1 foci formation depends on H2AX but not on ATM, NBS1, FANCD2, BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1. A, ATM-deficient cells and cells expressing wild-type ATM were evaluated for MCPH1 foci formation before and after ionizing radiation. The same experiments were carried out using Nbs1 wild type and Nbs1-deficient fibroblasts, PD20 wild type and PD20 null fibroblasts, BRCA1-deficient HCC1937 cells and HCC1937 cells reconstituted with wild-type BRCA1. B, Viral transduction of myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor cell lines was performed using retroviral particles expressing hemagglutinin/FLAG-tagged MCPH1. Myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor cell lines were infected twice before they were irradiated with 10 Gy of ionizing radiation.

To further confirm this result, we used siRNA to down-regulate both ATM and MDC1 and check for MCPH1 foci after irradiation. As a control, we also examined 53BP1 foci in these depleted cells; 53BP1 recruitment to double-strand breaks has been reported to be ATM-independent but MDC1-dependent (8Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K.

As expected, 53BP1 foci formation is not reduced in cells treated with ATM siRNA; however, 53BP1 foci are decreased in MDC1 knock-down cells (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, MCPH1 foci formation is not dependent on either ATM or MDC1 (Fig. 5B), which support our observations using ATM- or MDC1-deficient cells (Fig. 4A). There is a slight decrease of MCPH1 foci formation in the MDC1 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5B). We have shown previously that MDC1 functions to amplify the DNA damage signaling cascade by promoting further phosphorylation of H2AX near the sites of DNA damage (8Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K.

It is, therefore, possible that with the depletion of MDC1, the amplification step of H2AX phosphorylation is absent and may cause the slight defect in MCPH1 foci formation observed in these experiments.FIGURE 553BP1, but not MCPH1, recruitment to double-strand breaks is dependent on MDC1.

https://openalex.org/W1984795026,"von Willebrand factor (VWF) is the largest multimeric adhesion ligand circulating in blood. Its adhesion activity is related to multimer size, with the ultra-large forms freshly released from the activated endothelial cells being most active, capable of spontaneously binding to platelets. In comparison, smaller plasma forms circulating in blood bind platelets only under high fluid shear stress or induced by modulators. The structure-function relationships that distinguish the two types of VWF multimers are not known. In this study, we demonstrate that some of the plasma VWF multimers contain surface-exposed free thiols. Physiological and pathological levels of shear stresses (50 and 100 dynes/cm(2)) promote the formation of disulfide bonds utilizing these free thiols. The shear-induced thiol-disulfide exchange increases VWF binding to platelets. The thiol-disulfide exchange involves some or all of nine cysteine residues (Cys(889), Cys(898), Cys(2448), Cys(2451), Cys(2490), Cys(2491), Cys(2453), Cys(2528), and Cys(2533)) in the D3 and C domains as determined by mass spectrometry of the tryptic VWF peptides. These results suggest that the thiol-disulfide state may serve as an important structural determinant of VWF adhesion activity and can be modified by fluid shear stress."
https://openalex.org/W2002647662,"Grp94, the Hsp90 paralog of the endoplasmic reticulum, plays a crucial role in protein secretion. Like cytoplasmic Hsp90, Grp94 is regulated by nucleotide binding to its N-terminal domain. However, the question of whether Grp94 hydrolyzes ATP was controversial. This sets Grp94 apart from other members of the Hsp90 family where a slow but specific turnover of ATP has been unambiguously established. In this study we aimed at analyzing the nucleotide binding properties and the potential ATPase activity of Grp94. We show here that Grp94 has an ATPase activity comparable with that of yeast Hsp90 with a k(cat) of 0.36 min(-1) at 25 degrees C. Kinetic and equilibrium constants of the partial reactions of the ATPase cycle were determined using transient kinetic methods. Nucleotide binding appears to be tighter compared with other Hsp90s investigated, with dissociation constants (K(D)) of approximately 4 microm for ADP, ATP, and AMP-PCP. Interestingly, all nucleotides and inhibitors (radicicol, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) studied here bind with similar rate constants for association (0.2-0.3 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1)). Furthermore, there is a marked difference from cytosolic Hsp90s in that after binding, the ATP molecule does not seem to become trapped by conformational changes in Grp94. Grp94 stays predominantly in the open state concerning the nucleotide-binding pocket as evidenced by kinetic analyses. Thus, Grp94 shows mechanistically important differences in the interaction with adenosine nucleotides, but the basic hydrolysis reaction seems to be conserved between cytosolic and endoplasmic members of the Hsp90 family."
https://openalex.org/W2048564333,"Human protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT8 has been recently described as a type I enzyme in brain that is localized to the plasma membrane by N-terminal myristoylation. The amino acid sequence of human PRMT8 is almost 80% identical to human PRMT1, the major protein arginine methyltransferase activity in mammalian cells. However, the activity of a recombinant PRMT8 GST fusion protein toward methyl-accepting substrates is much lower than that of a GST fusion of PRMT1. We show here that both His-tagged and GST fusion species lacking the initial 60 amino acid residues of PRMT8 have enhanced enzymatic activity, suggesting that the N-terminal domain may regulate PRMT8 activity. This conclusion is supported by limited proteolysis experiments showing an increase in the activity of the digested full-length protein, consistent with the loss of the N-terminal domain. In contrast, the activity of the N-terminal truncated protein was slightly diminished by limited proteolysis. Significantly, we detect automethylation at two sites in the N-terminal domain, as well as binding sites for SH3 domain-containing proteins. We suggest that the N-terminal domain may function as an autoregulator that may be displaced by interaction with one or more physiological inducers.

Type I, II, and III enzymes catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the ω-nitrogen of the guanidino group to produce ω-NG-monomethylarginine (MMA), while type IV enzymes catalyze the addition of the methyl group to the internal δ-nitrogen of arginine residues (19Gary J.

Because of the importance of PRMT1 in cellular physiology, we were thus interested in its close homolog PRMT8. PRMT8 differs, however, from both PRMT1 and other family members in that it has a limited tissue distribution and is associated with the plasma membrane (25Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S.

In addition, expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis of human and mouse PRMT8 revealed that the majority of sequence tags arose from brain cDNA libraries (25Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S.

In mice, in situ hybridization experiments suggest that the PRMT8 gene is only expressed in neurons (33Taneda T. Miyata S. Kousaka A. Inoue K. Koyama Y. Mori Y. Tohyama M. Brain Res. 2007; 1155: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PRMT8 localizes to the plasma membrane via N-terminal myristoylation (25Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32890-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This irreversible modification is achieved through the covalent addition of the 14 carbon saturated fatty acyl chain to the glycine residue adjacent to the N-terminal initiator methionine residue. N-Myristoylation has been shown to be involved in modifying proteins in signal transduction cascades (34Rowe D.C. McGettrick A.F. Latz E. Monks B.G. Gay N.J. Yamamoto M. Akira S. O'Neill L.A.

In this work, we have examined the catalytic activity of full-length and N-terminal-truncated forms of PRMT8 that differ in their activity. We find that the presence of the N-terminal region attenuates the activity of PRMT8 and suggest that the activity of this enzyme may be regulated by altering the conformation of the protein in this region. PRMT8 Expression Vector Construction—For this work, we prepared a plasmid expressing an N-terminal GST fusion of a N-terminal-truncated form of human PRMT8, which removes the first 60 amino acids of full-length PRMT8. The primers used to generate this fragment were: 5′-TAC GAA TTC AAG CTG CTG AAC CCA-3′ and 5′-AAG GTC GAC CTT AAC GCA TTT TGT AGT CAT TA-3′. EcoR1 and SalI digestions were used to clone this fragment into pGex-6P-1. We also prepared plasmids expressing N-terminal His-tagged full-length and truncated PRMT8 proteins. We obtained a full-length cDNA clone of human PRMT8 (2024 nucleotides) from Invitrogen (Homo sapiens HMT1 hnRNP methyltransferase-like 4 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mRNA; cDNA clone MGC: 26069; IMAGE:4796524; GenBank™ accession number BC022458). Purified plasmid DNA was used as a template to PCR amplify bases 36-1220 (full-length) and bases 216-1220 (Δ1-60 N-terminal truncation) using 20-mer primers. The forward primers contained at the 5′-end four non-coding bases (5′-CACC) to allow vector construction via Champion pET Directional TOPO cloning (Invitrogen, pET 100/d-TOPO Expression kit). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and purified using Quantum Prep Gel Slice kit (Bio-Rad). The TOPO cloning reaction was performed using 1 μl of purified PCR product (the full-length or truncated PRMT8 insert), 1 μl of salt solution (1.2 m NaCl, 0.06 m MgCl2), 1 μl of TOPO vector (20 ng/μl), and 3 μl of water, incubated at room temperature for 10 min followed by transformation into One Shot Top10 Escherichia coli cells. Positive clones were screened by restriction digestion with BamHI enzyme followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region was confirmed by overlapping DNA sequencing of both strands (Davis Sequencing, Inc., Davis, CA). Positive clones were transformed into the BL21(DE3) E. coli strain. A full-length human PRMT8 construct expressing an N-terminal GST fusion protein has been previously described (25Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32890-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This protein has a Tyr residue at position 45 and a C-terminal extension of QSTRAAAS. Purification of Full-length and Truncated His-PRMT8, GST-PRMT8, GST-PRMT1, and GST-GAR—His-tagged full-length and truncated (Δ1-60) PRMT8 was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB media with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 and then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h at 25 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, and 4.3 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.4. Protease inhibitor (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from a 1000-fold concentrated stock in Me2SO) was added, and cells were resuspended in 8 ml of PBS. Cells were lysed on ice by sonication using a Sonifier cell disrupter W-350 (Smith-Kline Corp, 50% duty cycle, setting 4) for seven cycles of 20 s of sonication with 1 min of cooling in between. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 23,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a 1.5-ml column of Ni2+-charged His-binding resin (Novagen His-Bind purification kit; Madison, WI). Bound His-PRMT8 proteins were washed with 10 ml of 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and eluted with 5 ml of 1 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 in 1-ml fractions. GST-GAR is a fusion protein containing the first 148 amino acids of human fibrillarin (22Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This protein, as well as GST-PRMT1 (35Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Cell lysates were added to 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Bound proteins were washed three times with 10 ml of PBS and eluted with 1 ml of 30 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl. In Vitro Methylation of GST-GAR, Myelin Basic Protein, and Histones H2A and H4 by Recombinant PRMT1 and PRMT8 and SDS-PAGE and Amino Acid Analysis—His- and GST-tagged PRMT8 proteins (2 μg of protein) were incubated with and without 10 μg of methyl-accepting proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP, purified from bovine brain, lyophilized powder, product M1891, Sigma), GST-GAR, and histones H2A and H4 (purified from calf thymus, Roche Applied Science). Incubations were performed in the presence of 0.61 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet, 81.0 Ci/mmol, dilute HCl: ethanol (9:1), pH 2.0 to 2.5, Amersham Biosciences), and 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) in a final volume of 60 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. For amino acid analysis, the reaction mixtures were precipitated with an equal volume of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid with 20 μg of bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. Precipitated proteins were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature, and the pellets were washed with acetone at 4 °C and centrifuged again for 30 min. The pellet was acid hydrolyzed with 100 μl of 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 20 h in vacuo in a Waters Pico-Tag Vapor Phase apparatus and dried. The hydrolyzed sample was resuspended in 50 μl of water and added to 500 μl of citrate buffer (0.2 m Na+, pH 2.2) along with 1.0 μmol each of unlabeled standards of ω-NG-monomethylarginine (acetate salt, Sigma) (MMA) and ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine (hydrochloride, Sigma) (ADMA). The sample was loaded onto a cation-exchange column previously equilibrated with sodium citrate buffer (0.35 m Na+, pH 5.27) (column resin consisted of Beckman AA-15 sulfonated polystyrene beads; column length of 0.9 cm inner diameter × 7 cm column height), and eluted at 1 ml/min at 55 °C. To detect 3H radioactivity, 200 μl of each fraction was mixed with 400 μl of water and 5 ml of fluor (Safety Solve, Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL). Radioactivity was determined using a Beckman LS6500 counter as an average of three 3-min counting cycles. Unlabeled standards were detected with a ninhydrin assay using 100 μl of each fraction (36Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE analysis, methylation reactions were stopped with the addition of an equal volume of SDS gel sample buffer (180 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue), heated at 100 °C for 3 min, and loaded on a 12.6% acrylamide and 0.43% N,N-methylene bisacrylamide gel (1.5-mm thick, 10.5-cm resolving gel, 2-cm stacking gel). Using the Laemmli buffer system, electrophoresis was performed at 35 mA for 4.5 h. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 1 h and destained with 10% methanol and 5% acetic acid for 5 h. The destained gel was prepared for fluorography by incubation in EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h and washed with water for 20 min. The gel was dried at 70 °C in vacuo and exposed to Kodak BIOMAX XAR scientific imaging film at -80 °C. Limited Trypsin Digestion of Recombinant PRMT8—His- and GST-tagged PRMT8 full-length and truncated proteins (10 μg of protein) were incubated in a final volume of 50 μl with 0.06 μg of trypsin (TPCK-treated, from bovine pancreas, type XII, Sigma) and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 5, 10, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.6 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Control samples were incubated at 0 °C without trypsin or with the PRMT8 protein pretreated for 5 min at 0 °C with 0.6 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor before the addition of trypsin. Samples from each time point containing 5 μg of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Separate samples containing 2 μg of digested protein from each time point were incubated with 10 μg of GST-GAR, 0.61 μm [3H]AdoMet, and 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described above. Automethylation of GST-PRMT8—Purified GST-PRMT8 (20 μg) was incubated with [3H]AdoMet (0.34 μm) and 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) in a final volume of 60 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. The methylation reaction was stopped with the addition of 60 μl of sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above. The corresponding GST-PRMT8 protein band was gel extracted, acid hydrolyzed, and subjected to amino acid analysis as described above with the addition of an additional unlabeled standard of 1 μmol of ω-NG,N′G-dimethylarginine (di(p-hydroxyazobenzene-p′-sulfonate) salt, Sigma) (SDMA). Analysis of Methylated Peptides by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS)—Full-length GST-PRMT8 bands were excised from four lanes of a Coomassie-stained SDS gel (200 μg of protein loaded per lane) and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion using the fallowing procedure. Gel slices were diced into 3 mm × 3 mm cubes and destained by vortexing for 10 min in 225 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 and 225 μl of acetonitrile, then discarding the supernatant. This procedure was followed by a similar treatment with 450 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and the entire destaining process was repeated twice more. The gel slices were then dried under vacuum. 250 μl of 10 m dithiothreitol was incubated with the sample for 1 h at 56 °C followed by 1 ml of 55 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature to reduce and alkylate the free cysteine residues. Reagents were removed by repeating the destain protocol twice more. The gel slices were again dried and 4 μg of trypsin (Sequencing grade modified trypsin; Promega, Madison, WI) dissolved in 250 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 was added. After 16 h at 37 °C, peptides were extracted in 500 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid, and 45% 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.0 with sonication for 5 min. The lyophilized extract was brought up in 30 μl of water, and three 10-μl injections were analyzed using LC-MS/MS data-dependent acquisition on a Thermo LTQ ion trap instrument. A reverse-phase column (150 mm × 1 mm; Develosil RP-Aqueous-AR[C30] 5 μm, 140 Å; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) was equilibrated for 30 min at 50 μl/min with 100% A (A, 0.1% formic acid in water; B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) prior to sample injection. A linear gradient was initiated 10 min after sample injection ramping buffer A to 40% and buffer B to 60% at 70 min; buffer A to 5% and buffer B to 95% at 80 min; buffer A to 100% at 110 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in information-dependent acquisition mode. Data were analyzed using a custom data base containing the GST-PRMT8 sequence using SEQUEST and InsPecT algorithms (37Tanner S. Shu H. Frank A. Wang L.-C. Zandi E. Mumby M. Pevzner P.A. Bafna V. Anal. Chem. 2005; 15: 4626-4629Crossref Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The SEQUEST search was based on tryptic peptides allowing for two missed cleavages and the possible modifications of mono and dimethylated arginine residues. The InsPecT algorithm allowed up to two modified mono and dimethylated arginine residues. All potential matches were validated by inspection of the b and y ions. Transient Transfection and in Vivo Methylation Assay—GFP constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (25Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32890-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were labeled using a previously described in vivo methylation assay (38Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and immunoprecipitations were performed with α-GFP antibodies. Samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, sprayed with Enhance, and exposed to film. Generation of Protein Microarrays, Peptide Synthesis, and Labeling—The generation of protein microarrays and the labeling of peptide probes has been described previously (39Espejo A. Cote J. Bednarek A. Richard S. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The peptide (Biotin-STEVNSPPSQPPQPVVPAKPVQ) was synthesized by the W.M. Keck Center (New Haven, CT). GST Pull-down Experiments—HeLa cells were transfected with the GFP-PRMT8(G>A) construct. This construct expresses a form of PRMT8 that cannot be myristoylated and is thus not membrane bound. HeLa cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of mild lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). 15 μg of GST fusion protein bound to beads was incubated with HeLa cell extracts (10-cm plate) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. After five washes with lysis buffer, the beads were boiled in loading buffer and separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. GST-PRMT8 Has a Much Lower Enzymatic Activity than GST-PRMT1—The amino acid sequence of PRMT8 is 83% identical to that of PRMT1 over 325 residues of its 347 residue total length (25Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32890-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We were surprised, however, to find that the full-length N-terminal GST fusion of PRMT8 had much lower activity than the N-terminal GST fusion of PRMT1 when either GST-GAR (22Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) or myelin basic protein were used as methylaccepting substrates (Fig. 1). N-terminal Truncated Polypeptide of PRMT8 Displays Enhanced Enzymatic Activity in Vitro—The major difference in the sequence of PRMT1 and PRMT8 occurs at the N terminus where a unique additional sequence of about 65 residues is present on PRMT8 (25Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32890-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We thus prepared both GST fusion and His-tagged constructs of PRMT8 with and without its N-terminal 60 amino acid residues. The truncated PRMT8 proteins would then closely match the sequence of PRMT1 (25Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32890-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We could then compare the activity of GST- and His-tagged species with and without the unique N-terminal domain of PRMT8. We first measured methyltransferase activity of the PRMT8 constructs toward the GST-GAR methyl-accepting substrate using amino acid analysis after incubation with [3H]AdoMet. We compared the activity of the full-length PRMT8 His-tagged fusion protein with the comparable (Δ1-60) PRMT8 species. We found that the formation of both [3H]MMA and [3H]ADMA derivatives were more than 10-fold increased when the truncated construct was used compared with the full-length form (Fig. 2). Control experiments in the absence of the GST-GAR substrate revealed only trace amounts of radiolabeled MMA and ADMA. These results suggest that the presence of the unique N-terminal domain of PRMT8 can inhibit its catalytic activity. This difference in activity between the full-length and truncated His-tagged PRMT8 species was also seen when in vitro methylation reactions were performed with [3H]AdoMet with various methyl-accepting substrates, including GST-GAR, calf thymus histones H2A and H4, and myelin basic protein. Here, the radiolabeled polypeptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, right panels). We also repeated the experiment using the full-length and truncated GST-PRMT8 enzymes (Fig. 3, left panel). For all of these substrates, the recombinant truncated PRMT8 fusion proteins had increased activity in comparison to the full-length proteins, although the"
https://openalex.org/W1986322003,"Notch signaling plays critical roles in animal development and physiology. The activation of Notch receptors by their ligands is modulated by Fringe-dependent glycosylation. Fringe catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine in a β1,3 linkage onto O-fucose on epidermal growth factor-like domains. This modification of Notch by Fringe influences the binding of Notch ligands to Notch receptors. However, prior studies have relied on in vivo glycosylation, leaving unresolved the question of whether addition of N-acetylglucosamine is sufficient to modulate Notch-ligand interactions on its own, or whether instead it serves as a precursor to subsequent post-translational modifications. Here, we describe the results of in vitro assays using purified components of the Drosophila Notch signaling pathway. In vitro glycosylation and ligand binding studies establish that the addition of N-acetylglucosamine onto O-fucose in vitro is sufficient both to enhance Notch binding to the Delta ligand and to inhibit Notch binding to the Serrate ligand. Further elongation by galactose does not detectably influence Notch-ligand binding in vitro. Consistent with these observations, carbohydrate compositional analysis and mass spectrometry on Notch isolated from cells identified only N-acetylglucosamine added onto Notch in the presence of Fringe. These observations argue against models in which Fringe-dependent glycosylation modulates Notch signaling by acting as a precursor to subsequent modifications and instead establish the simple addition of N-acetylglucosamine as a basis for the effects of Fringe on Drosophila Notch-ligand binding.

Notch proteins are transmembrane receptors for a conserved signaling pathway that mediates a wide range of cell fate decisions during development (1Schweisguth F. Curr.

Notch receptors are activated by binding to transmembrane ligands expressed on adjacent cells. In a subset of Notch signaling events, such as occurs along the dorsal-ventral boundary of the wing disc in Drosophila or in developing somites in vertebrates, the interaction of ligands with the Notch receptor is modulated by differential glycosylation of Notch (3Haines N.

Drosophila has single fringe (fng) and Notch genes, and two Notch ligands, called Delta and Serrate (SER). Expression of fng potentiates the activation of Notch by Delta while inhibiting the activation of Notch by SER (7Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D.

Mammals have four Notches, three Delta-related ligands, two Serrate-related ligands (called Jaggeds), and three Fringes. Although only some of the many possible Fringe-ligand-Notch combinations have been examined, mammalian Fringes can also modulate Notch signaling, both in vivo and in cell-based assays (6Moloney D.J.

Binding assays in which soluble forms of Notch or its ligands are bound to cells expressing a ligand or Notch have, in most cases, found that Fringes influence Notch-ligand binding, identifying this as a critical step modulated by Fringe (5Bruckner K.

However, because these studies all relied on in vivo glycosylation, they could not reveal whether glycosylation per se is sufficient to modulate Notch-ligand interactions, or instead whether it acts as a precursor to subsequent events. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the N-acetylglucosamine-fucose (GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc) disaccharide that is the product of Fringes is further elongated by other glycosyltransferases to yield a tetrasaccharide, Sia-α2,3-Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc (6Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 16Moloney D.J.

Investigations of the glycan structures that mediate Fringe-dependent modulation of Notch signaling have been carried out in CHO cells by using mutants deficient in specific steps of glycosylation. The ability of Manic fringe (Mfng) or Lunatic fringe (Lfng) to inhibit Jagged1 to Notch1 signaling in these cells requires the action of β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β4GalT-1), which is also required for the elongation of the GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc disaccharide to a Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc trisaccharide (14Chen J. Moloney D.J. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the lack of requirement for sialylation, suggested that the relevant glycan structure for Fringe-dependent modulation of Notch signaling in mammalian cells is the trisaccharide Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc (14Chen J. Moloney D.J. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Gene-targeted mutations in murine β4GalT-1 are viable and do not exhibit the defects in Notch signaling observed in Lfng mutants (17Asano M. Furukawa K. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 18Lu Q. Hasty P. Shur B.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although subtle defects in the expression of Notch pathway targets in developing somites have recently been identified (19Chen J. Lu L. Shi S. Stanley P. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2006; 6: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The absence of a Lfng phenotype in β4GalT-1 mutant mice might be due to genetic redundancy, because there are six mammalian members of the β4GalT family with similar amino acid sequences that can catalyze the transfer of Gal in a β1,4 linkage to GlcNAc acceptors (20Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 21Guo S. Sato T. Shirane K. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Furukawa K. Sato T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, Drosophila encode only two members of the β4GalT family, and animals that are doubly mutant for both genes are viable and do not exhibit fng-like phenotypes (23Haines N. Irvine K.D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although these genes actually encode GalNAcTs rather than GalTs (23Haines N. Irvine K.D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), they are highly similar at the amino acid sequence level to mammalian β4GalTs and thus the best candidates to encode any conserved biological functions of this gene family. The absence of fng phenotypes in β4GalNAcT mutants thus raised the possibility that elongation of the GlcNAc-Fuc disaccharide is not actually required for the influence of FNG on Notch signaling, at least in Drosophila. To determine whether any post-translational events subsequent to the addition of GlcNAc by FNG are required for its influence on Notch-ligand binding, we employed an in vitro glycosylation and ligand binding assay. The influence of FNG on Notch-SER and Notch-Delta binding can be reconstituted in vitro with purified components. Our results show that the simple addition of GlcNAc by FNG is sufficient to dramatically alter the interaction of Notch with its ligands, in a manner that suffices to explain the biological effects of fng on Notch signaling in vivo. Conversely, further elongation of the GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc disaccharide by Gal has no noticeable effect on Notchligand binding in vitro. These observations enhance our mechanistic understanding of the regulation of Notch signaling and confirm a striking example of the direct modulation of protein-protein interactions through glycosylation. Expression Constructs—Notch (N), Delta (DL), and Serrate (SER) constructs were all expressed under the control of the metallothionein promoter. The alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion proteins N:AP, DL:AP, and SER:AP, cloned into the pRMHa-3 vector (N:AP/pRMHa-3, DL:AP/pRMHa-3, and SER:AP/pRMHa-3), were gifts from S. Cohen and have been described previously (5Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). N:AP includes amino acids 1-1467 of Notch; DL:AP includes amino acids 1-592 of DL; and SER:AP includes amino acids 1-1213 of SER (see Fig. 1). N-EGF:FLAG includes amino acids 66-1452 of Notch and has been described previously (15Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Fc:AP includes the Fc domain from human IgG and has been described previously (15Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To facilitate production of larger quantities of DL:AP and SER:AP, these transgenes were cloned from pRMHa-3 into pMT(WB) (23Haines N. Irvine K.D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which includes the blasticidin resistance gene as a selectable marker for making stable cell lines. The plasmids Delta:AP/pMT(WB) and Serrate:AP/pMT(WB) were constructed by ligating 3.5- or 5.3-kb, respectively, EcoRI-XbaI fragments from Delta-AP/pRmHa3 or Serrate-AP/pRmHa3, respectively (5Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) into pMT(WB). To facilitate purification of ligand-AP fusion proteins, hexahistidine tags were inserted into DL:AP and SER:AP by amplifying across StuI-XbaI (for DL) or StuI-XhoI (for SER) fragments including the C terminus of AP from Delta:AP/pMT(WB) or Serrate:AP/pMT(WB) using as primers (forward) TGATGTGATCCTAGGTGGAGG and (reverse, Delta) GCTCTAGAGCATGGTGATGGTGATGATGACCCGGGTGCGCGGCGTCGGT or (reverse, Serrate) AACCGCTCGAGGCATGGTGATGGTGATGATGACCCGGGTGCGCGGCGTCGGT (underlined nucleotides encode His6 tag) and cloning into StuI-XbaI-cut Delta:AP/pMT(WB) or StuI-XhoI-cut Serrate:AP/pMT(WB) to create DL:AP:His6/pMT(WB) or SER:AP:His6/pMT(WB), respectively. Full-length, His-tagged FNG was expressed in S2 cells from a pMTHy vector construct that has been described previously (6Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Full-length β4GalNAcTA and β4GalNAcTB were expressed from pMT(WB) constructs that have been described previously and are active on a pNp-GlcNAc substrate (23Haines N. Irvine K.D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—For purification of hexahistidine-tagged proteins, stably transfected S2 cells were cultured to 40 ml in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen), and then expression was induced by addition of 0.7 mm CuSO4 for 2 days. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, and the conditioned medium was mixed with 50 μl of His-Select nickel affinity gel (Sigma) with gentle agitation on an orbital shaker overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min and washed three times in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole. The ligands were eluted from beads in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sodium chloride, 250 mm imidazole, and the eluate was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in HBSS (1.26 mm CaCl2, 5.33 mm KCl, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.41 mm MgSO4, 138 mm NaCl, 4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 5.6 mm glucose). Cell-based Binding Assays—Cell-based binding assays were conducted as described previously (5Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 15Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), using 4 μg of N:AP DNA, 2 μg each of glycosyltransferase DNA (pMTHy-FNG:His6, pMT(WB)-β4GalNAcTA, or pMT(WB)-β4GalNAcTB), and empty vector DNA (pRMHa-3) to bring the total transfected DNA to 8 μg in all cases. Knockdown of β4GalNAcTA or β4GalNAcTB by RNA interference was performed as described previously (15Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), using 40 μg of double-stranded RNA added 6 h after transfection of expression constructs. This procedure reduces but does not eliminate β4GalNAcT expression as monitored by reverse transcription-PCR. The cells were then cultured for 4 days, transgene expression was induced for 2 days using 0.7 mm CuSO4, and conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged 10 min at 14,000 × g to remove cell debris, and assayed for AP activity. In Vitro Binding Assays—In vitro binding assays were performed as described (15Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), except that in some assays, affinity-purified ligands were used. Briefly, N-EGF:FLAG (∼1 μg) was loaded onto anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) and incubated with ligand-AP fusion proteins (affinity-purified or in conditioned medium). After washing, binding was quantified by assaying for alkaline phosphatase activity. N-EGF:FLAG was modified by FNG either in vivo (by coexpressing FNG in S2 cells as described above) or in vitro. In vitro glycosylation of N-EGF: FLAG by FNG was conducted as described previously (24Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For in vitro glycosylation of N-EGF:FLAG by β4GalT-1, anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) loaded with Notch (N-EGF:FLAG or N-EGF:FLAG from cells co-transfected with FNG) or S2 conditioned medium were equilibrated with glycosylation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm MnCl2), and 5 μl of beads were incubated with 100 milliunits of β4GalT-1 (Sigma) and 2.5 μm UDP-Gal (Sigma) for 4 h at 28°C. The beads were then washed four times in HBSS and used for in vitro binding (15Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Sugars used in competition binding assays were purchased from Sigma, except for GlcNAc-β1,3-fucose, which was a gift from Dr. Kushi Matta (Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY). The sugars were premixed with ligand:AP fusion proteins, and these solutions were then mixed with beads. For quantitation of labeling with FNG β4GalNAcTA, or β4GalNAcB, 1 μg of N-EGF:FLAG on anti-FLAG beads was incubated with purified FNG (6Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), β4GalNAcTA, or β4GalNAcTB (23Haines N. Irvine K.D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and 3.6 μm UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (266 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), or 2.5 μm UDP-[14C]GalNAc (266 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in 50 μl of glycosylation buffer for 4 h at 28°C.The beads were then washed four times in HBSS and subjected to scintillation counting. The counts on mock loaded (S2 conditioned medium) beads were taken as background. To normalize counts to the amount of labeled sugar, 2 μl of labeled UDP-sugar was counted directly in scintillation fluid. Quantitation of galactose added to GlcNAc on N-EGF:FLAG was performed by in vitro radiolabeling with UDP-[3H]galactose (60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) and saturating levels of bovine β4GalT-1 (Sigma) as described (25Haltiwanger R.S. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Removal of N-glycans by digestion with peptide N-glycosidase F, release of O-glycans by alkali-induced β-elimination, and characterization of the released glycans by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex peptide column were all performed as described (26Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate Analysis—Quantitative compositional analysis of carbohydrates was performed by acid hydrolysis and Dionex high pressure anion exchange chromatography as described (27Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). N-EGF:FLAG was eluted from anti-FLAG beads using 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) by mixing 0.5-ml beads with 0.5 ml of 3× FLAG peptide (150 ng/ml in Tris-buffered saline) and incubating 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted for 30 s at 8200 × g, and the supernatant was dialyzed in HBSS to remove 3× FLAG peptide. Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels (not shown) confirmed that N-EGF:FLAG was purified to apparent homogeneity. Approximately 10 μg of N-EGF:FLAG purified from S2 cells with or without exogenous FNG was concentrated by acetone precipitation and hydrolyzed in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce) for 4 h at 100°C. The samples were dried in a SpeedVac, resuspended in water, passed through a C18 ZipTip (Millipore), and dried again. The pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of water and analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography on a CarboPac PA-1 column (20 μl/run) on a Dionex DX-300 system with pulsed amperometric detection. All of the experiments were performed in duplicate. Mass spectral analysis of O-fucose glycosylation sites was performed essentially as described (28Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 417: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 μg of N-EGF:FLAG expressed in S2 cells with exogenous FNG was reduced and alkylated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. The resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an Agilent XCT Ion Trap mass spectrometer. Glycosylated peptides were identified by searching MS/MS data for neutral losses of the GlcNAc-fucose disaccharide (349.1 Da). Loss of the disaccharide gave a characteristic fragmentation pattern allowing rapid identification of glycopeptides (see Fig. 6). The mass of the unglycosylated peptide was then matched to predicted masses of tryptic peptides from Notch containing the O-fucose consensus sequence:C2XXXX(S/T)C3, where C2 and C3 are the second and third conserved cysteines of an EGF domain (29Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). Once glycopeptides were identified, additional searches of the MS/MS data for the unmodified peptides were performed (Extracted Ion Searches). The extracted ion searches take advantage of the fact that glycosidic linkages are more labile than peptide bonds upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), and hence the major product ion from fragmentation of a glycopeptide is the unglycosylated peptide. Using this method, peptides bearing different forms of the O-fucose glycans (e.g. mono- or disaccharide) were found (see Fig. 6, Table 1, and supplemental Fig. S3). No glycopeptides with tri- or tetrasaccharide forms of O-fucose were identified, nor, aside from O-glucose glycans (to be reported elsewhere) were any other modifications of O-fucose bearing peptides identified.TABLE 1O-Fucosylated peptides from N-EGF:FLAG produced in S2 cells with FNGEGFSequenceParent ion (M+H+)Deglycosylated product (M+H+)Mass ΔPredicted mass (M+H+)373CPLGFDESLCEIAVPNACDHVTCLNGGTCQLK1043986.23636.7349.53638.1373CPLGFDESLCEIAVPNACDHVTCLNGGTCQLK1043782.23636.7145.53638.15175YGGTCVNTHGSYQCMCPTGYTGK1972949.12600.5348.62600.97236NCEQNYDDCLGHLCQNGGTCIDGISDYTCR2653945.43597.7347.73597.823866NGASCLNVPGSYR8781744.81396.0348.81395.523866NGASCLNVPGSYR8781541.81396.0145.81395.5 Open table in a new tab fng null mutant flies die as first instar larvae, whereas hypomorphic alleles are viable but exhibit defects in wing and eye development (30Irvine K.D.

Science. 1998; 281: 2031-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). By contrast, flies doubly mutant for β4GalNAcTA and β4GalNAcTB are viable and appear morphologically normal (23Haines N. Irvine K.D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because these are the only Drosophila homologues of mammalian β4GalTs that act on GlcNAc acceptors, the absence of developmental phenotypes indicated that this gene family does not influence Notch signaling during Drosophila development and suggested that further elongation of the GlcNAcβ1,3-Fuc disaccharide might not be required for modulation of Notch signaling in Drosophila. Nonetheless, we examined the influence of these glycosyltransferases in Notchligand binding assays. A secreted fragment of Notch including most of the extracellular domain fused to alkaline phosphatase (N:AP, Fig. 1) can bind specifically to ligand-expressing cells. This assay has been used previously to demonstrate that FNG can influence Notch-ligand binding (5Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 15Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To examine their potential influence, we overexpressed β4GalNAcTA or β4GalNAcTB in cells producing N:AP and FNG or down-regulated their expression by RNA interference. However, neither elevated nor decreased expression of these glycosyltransferases detectably influenced Notch-ligand binding (Fig. 2), consistent with the absence of Notch or fng phenotypes in β4GalNAcTA and β4GalNAcTB null mutant animals (23Haines N. Irvine K.D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Influence of Fringe Is Detectable in an in Vitro Binding System—The above observations argued against the possibility that β4GalNAcTA or β4GalNAcTB are required for the modulation of Notch signaling by FNG but left open the possibility that some other as yet unidentified glycosyltransferases effect a functionally important modification of GlcNAc on Notch, be it addition of Gal or some other sugar. Moreover, prior studies investigating the influence of FNG on Notch-ligand binding have all relied on in vivo glycosylation by FNG and have been conducted with conditioned medium rather than purified proteins. Thus, they could not address the potential importance of modifications subsequent to glycosylation or of additional, accessory factors in FNG-dependent modulation of Notch signaling. We established an in vitro binding assay using a Notch construct (N-EGF:FLAG; Fig. 1) comprising all 36 EGF domains of Drosophila Notch fused to a triple FLAG epitope tag (15Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This Notch polypeptide was then purified on anti-FLAG agarose beads, and the beads were mixed with ligands fused to AP (Fig. 1). This in vitro binding system provides a means for determining whether or not additional factors or modifications are required for the influence of FNG on Notch. Importantly, both the positive modulation of Notch-Delta binding and the negative modulation of Notch-Serrate can be detected with this assay when N-EGF:FLAG expressed in the presence of FNG is compared with N:EGF-FLAG expressed in the absence of FNG (Fig. 3A). Thus, the influence of FNG can be detected using an in vitro binding assay. The GlcNAc-Fuc Disaccharide Is Sufficient to Modulate Notch-Ligand Binding—To evaluate the potential significance of post-translational modifications subsequent to FNG, we modified this in vitro assay by first purifying N-EGF:FLAG expressed from S2 cells without FNG and then glycosylating it in vitro with FNG. When N-EGF:FLAG is purified on anti-FLAG beads, only a single prominent band is detected on Coomassie-stained gels (supplemental Fig. S1A). Similarly, when Fringe:His6 was purified using agarose-Ni2+ beads, only a single prominent band was detected by Coomassie staining (supplemental Fig. S1B). We then conducted in vitro glycosylation experiments, using N-EGF:FLAG attached to beads, soluble Fringe:His6, and UDP-[14C]GlcNAc. The addition of ∼4.5 mol of GlcNAc/mol of N-EGF:FLAG was catalyzed by FNG in this reaction. Although there are 23 potential sites of O-fucosylation on Drosophila Notch, it is not known whether all of them can be modified by FNG. In addition, because FNG requires a properly folded EGF domain (29Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), if any Notch on the beads was misfolded or aggregated, the calculated value of ∼5 sites/Notch could be an underestimate. Regardless, these results suggest that purified Notch can be s"

Consider the carbon fixation reaction, catalyzed by Rubisco, where d-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) is first enolized and then combines with CO2 to form 3-phosphoglycerate according to Scheme 1 (21Laing W.A. Christeller J.T. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Badger M.R. Collatz G.J. Carnegie Inst. Wash. Year Book. 1977; 76: 355-361Google Scholar, 23Andrews, T. J., and Lorimer, G. H. (1987) in The Biochemistry of Plants: A Comprehensive Treatise (Hatch, M. D., and Boardman, N. K., eds) Vol. 10, pp. 131-218, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Here, enol refers to enolized RuBP, and 2-carboxy-3-keto-d-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (CKABP) is the carboxylated reaction intermediate in this simplified scheme (24Schloss J.V. Lorimer G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4691-4694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whether the latter exists in this form or as the hydrated gem-diol (25Lorimer G.H. Andrews T.J. Pierce J. Schloss J.V. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 313: 397-407Crossref Google Scholar). CKABP will undergo subsequent hydrolysis and cleavage to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, whereas the gem-diol will require only cleavage. The intrinsic reaction steps are characterized by the rate constants (forwards and backwards) for enolization (kenol and kde-enol) and for carboxylation (kcarb and kdecarb) and the turnover number (kcat, which may be two steps combined). Because it is only the steps involving the carbon atom from CO2 that have an effect on discrimination, enolization (occurring before CO2 addition) does not have impact on fractionation by the enzyme (see supplemental “Appendix”). Similarly, the turnover number does not affect fractionation because neither hydration nor cleavage exhibits isotopic carbon bond formation or breakage involving the carbon atom inherited from CO2. Then, the fractionation factor associated with CO2 addition is as in Equation 6 (20Tcherkez G. Farquhar G.D. Funct. Plant Biol. 2005; 32: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Berti, P. J. (1999) in Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanism. Part E: Energetics of Enzyme Catalysis (Schramm, V. L., and Purich, D. L., eds) pp. 355-397, Academic Press, San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar). αRubisco≈kcarb12kcarb13·1+kdecarb13/kcat1+kdecarb12/kcat(Eq. 6) Furthermore, if the decarboxylation rate constant is very small compared with the turnover number (i.e. if kdecarb ≪ kcat), then the kinetic isotope effect for the overall enzyme-catalyzed process reduces to the kinetic isotope effect for the carboxylation step as in Equation 7. αRubisco≈kcarb12kcarb13(Eq. 7) This is the intrinsic (carbon bond-forming) isotope effect and represents the upper limit for the total kinetic isotope effect for carboxylation catalyzed by Rubisco (1Paneth P. O'Leary M.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5143-5147Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Tcherkez G. Farquhar G.D. Funct. Plant Biol. 2005; 32: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The intrinsic isotope effect will depend on the vibrational energies associated with carboxyl bond formation between isotopic carbon dioxide and enolized RuBP, and its magnitude may be estimated by the methods of Bigeleisen (27Bigeleisen J. J. Chem. Phys. 1949; 17: 675-678Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and Melander (28Melander L.C.S. Isotope Effects on Reaction Rates. Ronald Press, New York1960Google Scholar). On the basis of these methods, Tcherkez et al. (29Tcherkez G.G.B. Farquhar G.D. Andrews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7246-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) predicted that the intrinsic isotope effect will increase as the carboxylation transition state comes to resemble the product, i.e. as it is delayed along the reaction coordinate. We then have two possible mechanisms by which the kinetic isotope effect may differ between Rubiscos. First, the intrinsic isotope effect ( (kcarb12/kcarb13)) may vary according to the carboxylation transition state structure with a more product-like transition state having a higher fractionation factor. Alternatively, the fractionation factor will be reduced as the decarboxylation rate increases or as the commitment of the carboxylated intermediate (CKABP) to hydrolysis and cleavage is reduced. This has the effect of replenishing free 12CO2 that has been depleted by carboxylation. Rubisco occurs as a so-called Form I enzyme in higher plants, cyanobacteria, and proteobacteria (comprising a hexadecamer of eight large and eight small subunits) and as a simpler Form II enzyme (comprising one or more dimers of large subunits) in proteobacteria and some dinoflagellates (23Andrews, T. J., and Lorimer, G. H. (1987) in The Biochemistry of Plants: A Comprehensive Treatise (Hatch, M. D., and Boardman, N. K., eds) Vol. 10, pp. 131-218, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 30Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Andersson I. Taylor T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we compare the kinetic isotope effects (in terms of discrimination (Δ)) for Rubisco from a higher plant (tobacco, Form I) and from α-proteobacterium (Rhodospirillum rubrum, Form II) and a large subunit mutant of tobacco Rubisco in which Leu335 is mutated to valine (L335V) (32Whitney S.M. von Caemmerer S. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Leu335 sits on loop 6 of the α/β-barrel at the carboxyl-terminal end of the Rubisco large subunit (32Whitney S.M. von Caemmerer S. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This loop closes over the substrate RuBP as it is bound (31Andersson I. Taylor T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Gutteridge S. Gatenby A.A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Taylor T.C. Andersson I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We speculate that this residue is involved in stabilization of the transition state for either the hydrolysis or cleavage step (or both). We have measured Δ, based on Rayleigh fractionation, by continuous real-time measurement of individual carbon isotope concentrations via membrane inlet mass spectrometry (35McNevin D. Badger M.R. Kane H.J. Farquhar G.D. Funct. Plant Biol. 2006; 33: 1115-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We show that the Δ values for R. rubrum and L335V tobacco Rubiscos are consistent with photosynthetic discrimination by transgenic tobacco plants in which native Rubisco has been replaced with Form II or a mutant variant. We examine the implications of the differences in Δ values for the catalytic mechanism of the variant enzymes. Wild-type and Transgenic Tobacco Plants—Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) grown for Rubisco harvesting and leaf tissue carbon isotope measurements included wild-type (WT) plants and two transplastomic mutants: one producing mutant tobacco Rubisco containing the large subunit mutation L335V (32Whitney S.M. von Caemmerer S. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and one producing R. rubrum Rubisco (referred to as tobacco-rubrum) (36Whitney S.M. Andrews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14738-14743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As the mutants are unable to grow in air, all plants were germinated from seed in 5-liter pots of soil in a growth chamber equilibrated with air supplemented with 1% (v/v) CO2. The air temperature was 25 °C with a 14-h photoperiod (400 μmol quanta m-2 s-1) and 60% relative humidity. The WT plants were also grown in air in an air-conditioned glasshouse as a control. RuBP, 2-Carboxypenitol 1,5-Bisphosphate, and Rubisco Purification—Pure RuBP was prepared according to Kane et al. (37Kane H.J. Wilkin J.M. Portis A.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). WT Rubisco was purified from tobacco leaves by polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by crystallization via dialysis as described by Servaites (38Servaites J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). L335V tobacco Rubisco was purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by anion-exchange chromatography (ÁKTA™ Explorer, Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) on a Waters Protein-Pak™ Q column as described by Edmondson et al. (39Edmondson D.L. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) but omitting the final gel filtration step. R. rubrum Rubisco production in XL1-Blue cells transformed with plasmid pRR1 (40Morell M.K. Kane H.J. Andrews T.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 6 h, and the enzyme was purified according to Andrews and Kane (41Andrews T.J. Kane H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9447-9452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All enzymes were >95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE. They were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C in storage buffer (25 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The active-site concentration for each enzyme was determined by the 2-[14C]carboxy-d-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate binding method of Butz and Sharkey (42Butz N.D. Sharkey T.D. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 735-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Ruuska et al. (43Ruuska S. Andrews T.J. Badger M.R. Hudson G.S. Laisk A. Price G.D. von Caemmerer S. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 25: 859-870Google Scholar) using 2-[14C]carboxypenitol 1,5-bisphosphate (an isomeric mixture of 2-[14C]carboxy-d-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate and 2-[14C]carboxyribitol 1,5-bisphosphate) that was synthesized according to Pierce et al. (44Pierce J. Tolbert N.E. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry Isotope Discrimination Analyses—CO2 uptake in the carboxylation reactions facilitated by purified Rubiscos was monitored by membrane inlet mass spectrometry as described (35McNevin D. Badger M.R. Kane H.J. Farquhar G.D. Funct. Plant Biol. 2006; 33: 1115-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The signals for each isotope were corrected for their zero offsets, and the corrected signals were then used to obtain a raw discrimination (Δtotal) with respect to aqueous CO2 according to Equation 8, 1+Î”total=Î±total=d(ln[12C])d(ln[13C])(Eq. 8) where αtotal is the slope of a line of best fit through a plot of points (ln[13C] and ln[12C]). An enzyme discrimination was then calculated for each reaction according to Equation 9 (35McNevin D. Badger M.R. Kane H.J. Farquhar G.D. Funct. Plant Biol. 2006; 33: 1115-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), ΔRubisco=1+Δtotal1+Δpart−1(Eq. 9) where Δpart is the discrimination due to partitioning of inorganic carbon between CO2 and (HCO3−) in solution given by Equation 10 (35McNevin D. Badger M.R. Kane H.J. Farquhar G.D. Funct. Plant Biol. 2006; 33: 1115-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Δpart=−Δeq1+(1+Δeq)10pKeq−pH+Δeq(Eq. 10) Here, Δeq is the discrimination due to the equilibrium isotope effect between CO2(aq) and (HCO3(aq)−) (relative to CO2) equal to -8.9‰ (45Mook W.G. Bommerson J.C. Staverman W.H. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 1974; 22: 169-176Crossref Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), and pKeq is the equilibrium dissociation constant for (CO2(aq)/HCO3(aq)−) equal to 6.25 at 25 °C. Rubisco Activity—Purified Rubisco was used to measure substrate-saturated carboxylase activities at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C using a 14CO2 fixation assay based on that of Andrews (46Andrews T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12213-12219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions (200 μl) were prepared in 7-ml scintillation vials and were buffered with 80 mm EPPS, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml carbonic anhydrase (Sigma). The final concentrations of purified Rubisco and NaHCO3 varied as follows: 0.1 mg/ml WT tobacco enzyme (1.6 μm active sites) with 20 mm NaHCO3, 0.05 mg/ml R. rubrum enzyme (0.9 μm active sites) with 40 mm NaHCO3, and 0.15 mg/ml L335V tobacco enzyme (2.2 μm active sites) with 20 mm NaHCO3. One microliter of 74 MBq/ml NaH14CO3 was added to the reactions, resulting in specific activities of 15 (WT tobacco), 7 (R. rubrum), and 15 (L335V tobacco) Bq/nmol. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at the different temperatures before initiating catalysis by adding RuBP to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 1 min, the reactions were quenched with 100 μl of 25% (v/v) formic acid and heated to dryness at 80 °C. The residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of water and then mixed with 1 ml of liquid scintillant (Ultima Gold™ XR, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and acid-stable 14C was measured in a Searle Delta 300 scintillation counter. The turnover number (kcat) was calculated by dividing the carboxylation rate by the active-site content quantified by 2-[14C]carboxy-d-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate binding (see above). Isotope Composition of Tobacco Leaf Tissue and Air from the Growth Environment—The isotope composition of whole leaves from tobacco plants (three each of WT, tobacco-rubrum, and L335V) was determined according to Wright et al. (47Wright G.C. Hubick K.T. Farquhar G.D. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 15: 815-825Google Scholar). The third and fourth leaves of each plant were harvested after 63 days (WT; ambient air), 37 days (WT; 1% CO2), and 51 days (L335V and R. rubrum mutants; 1% CO2). The mid-vein from each leaf was removed, and the leaves were then dried at 80 °C before grinding in a ball mill (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany). Approximately 1 mg of each dried and ground sample was dropped into an EA1110 elemental analyzer (Fisons Instruments S.p.A., Milan, Italy) in a helium carrier and combusted in a pulse of oxygen. The oxidized products were then reduced to CO2, N2, and water before separation in a Porapak QS packed column (Alltech Biotechnology). The pulses of pure CO2 then passed into an IsoChrom continuous flow stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Micromass UK Ltd.) in the helium carrier, and the ratios of masses 45:44 and 46:44 were determined. Calibration was performed against similarly analyzed beet sucrose internal standard (δ13C =-24.62‰ VPDB) and Australian National University sucrose (δ13C =-10.45‰ VPDB). Measurements had a Craig correction applied to compensate for contributions to mass 45 from other isotopic combinations (e.g. 12C17O16O rather than 13C16O16O). The carbon isotope composition in the air from the two growth environments (air in the glasshouse and air plus 1% (v/v) CO2 in the growth chamber) was also sampled at least three times into a vacuum-evacuated 1-liter stainless steel cylinder. The sampled air was drawn at low pressure (<10 millibars) into a vacuum line through a dry ice/ethanol bath (to condense water vapor) and then a liquid nitrogen trap (to condense CO2 but not O2). The condensed CO2 was subjected to high vacuum (<10-2 millibars) to evacuate the trap of all but CO2. The liquid nitrogen bath was replaced with a dry ice/ethanol bath so that CO2 was evaporated from the trap and recondensed in a connected glass tube immersed in liquid nitrogen. The tube was sealed under vacuum with an oxyacetylene torch. The carbon isotope ratios of these samples were then determined by analysis on a GV Instruments IsoPrime stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer fitted with a dual inlet. The glass tubes containing the sample CO2 were broken in an evacuated tube cracker, expanding the gas into the bellows of the dual inlet. The bellows were then compressed to produce a beam of ∼8 nA for beam 1 (mass 44). The reference bellows were filled with a laboratory internal standard CO2 (δ13C =-25.54‰ VPDB), and the two gases were compared using six pulses of each. The overall precision of the analyses was ∼0.1‰. The measured enzyme discriminations (Δ) with respect to aqueous CO2 were 27.4 ± 0.9‰ for WT tobacco, 22.2 ± 2.1‰ for R. rubrum, and 11.2 ± 1.6‰ for L335V tobacco, all expressed with respect to aqueous CO2 as the source. These and other enzyme discriminations measured by us (35McNevin D. Badger M.R. Kane H.J. Farquhar G.D. Funct. Plant Biol. 2006; 33: 1115-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and other workers (Table 1) are shown in Fig. 1 for discriminations measured under comparable experimental conditions. The Rubiscos are classified as of either higher plant or prokaryotic origin and as either Form I or II. The maximum carboxylation rate (kcat (s-1)) was determined for each purified enzyme at temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C. These data were used to construct an Arrhenius plot (Fig. 2) of R ln kcat versus T-1 (K-1), where the slope is the activation energy (Ea, kJ/mol), for hydrolysis/cleavage of the CKABP intermediate according to Equation 11 (see supplemental “Appendix”), Rd ln kcatd(T−1)=−Ea(Eq. 11) and where R is the molar gas constant. The turnover number (kcat) is also related to the standard free energy difference (ΔG‡) between the intermediate and the transition state for hydrolysis/cleavage according to Equation 12 (see supplemental “Appendix”), R ln(kcathkBT)=−ΔG‡T=ΔS‡−ΔH‡T(Eq. 12) where h is the Planck constant; kB is the Boltzmann constant; and ΔS‡ and ΔH‡ are the standard entropy and standard enthalpy differences, respectively, between the intermediate and the transition state for hydrolysis/cleavage (i.e. the transition state value minus the bound intermediate value). Hence, a plot of the left-hand side of this equation versus T-1 has a slope equal to -ΔH‡ and an intercept (at T-1 = 0 or T → ∞) equal to ΔS‡ (Fig. 2). The activation energy is related to (and, for ambient temperatures, almost equal to) the standard enthalpy difference according to Equation 13 (see supplemental “Appendix”). Ea=ΔH‡+RT≈ΔH‡(Eq. 13) The activation energy and standard entropy and enthalpy differences obtained from Fig. 2 are shown for each of the purified enzymes in Fig. 3, together with the free energy difference at 25 °C obtained from Equation 14. ΔG‡=ΔH‡−TΔS‡=ΔH‡−(298 K)ΔS‡(Eq. 14) Both ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ depend on temperature, but in the temperature range investigated, their variation is clearly negligible, so they are considered constant. Furthermore, the entropic component of the free energy difference (TΔS‡) does not vary significantly between 15 and 35 °C, and hence, the total free energy difference (ΔG‡) is relatively constant in this temperature range.FIGURE 3Standard entropy difference (ΔS‡; left axis), standard enthalpy difference (ΔH‡; right axis), and standard free energy difference at 25 °C (ΔG‡298; right axis) associated with kcat as well as activation energy (Ea; right axis) for hydrolysis/cleavage for purified Rubiscos from WT tobacco, R. rubrum, and L335V tobacco.

This is particularly true for musculoskeletal infections. Bacteria possess a thymidine kinase (TK) whose substrate specificity is distinct from that of the major human TK. The substrate specificity difference has been exploited to develop a new imaging technique that can detect the presence of viable bacteria.Eight subjects with suspected musculoskeletal infections and one healthy control were studied by a combination of [(124)I]FIAU-positron emission tomography and CT ([(124)I]FIAU-PET/CT). All patients with proven musculoskeletal infections demonstrated positive [(124)I]FIAU-PET/CT signals in the sites of concern at two hours after radiopharmaceutical administration.

T-2 toxin is an A type trichothecene with an ester-linked isovaleryl group at C8, whereas DON and nivalenol (NIV) are both B type trichothecenes with a ketone moiety at C8 and are further differentiated by their substitution patterns at C4 (Fig. 1). The nature of the side chains can have drastic effects on the cytotoxicity of these compounds. As much as 5 × 103-fold difference in LC50 has been observed among these toxins (7Anderson D.W. Black R.M. Lee C.G. Pottage C. Rickard R.L. Sandford M.S. Webber T.D. Williams N.E. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Significantly, the presence of an acetyl group attached to the C3 hydroxyl lowers the toxicity considerably and has been implicated as the self-protection mechanism in the trichothecene mycotoxin producing Fusarium species (8Kimura M. Shingu Y. Yoneyama K. Yamaguchi I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1033-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The trichothecene biosynthetic pathway for the T-2 toxin producing strain, Fusarium sporotrichioides, has been established from gene disruption mutants and the analysis of intermediate trichothecene metabolites (Refs. 9McCormick S.P. Alexander N.J. Proctor R.H. Can. J. Microbiol. 2006; 52: 636-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Tokai T. Koshino H. Takahashi-Ando N. Sato M. Fujimura M. Kimura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and references cited therein). The pathway begins with the cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate by trichodiene synthase, tri5 (11Hohn T.M. Vanmiddlesworth F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Rynkiewicz M.J. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The next enzyme in the pathway, TRI4, catalyzes multiple oxygenations to produce the toxic intermediate, isotrichodermol (7Anderson D.W. Black R.M. Lee C.G. Pottage C. Rickard R.L. Sandford M.S. Webber T.D. Williams N.E. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Kimura M. Kaneko I. Komiyama M. Takatsuki A. Koshino H. Yoneyama K. Yamaguchi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1654-1661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thereafter, TRI101 catalyzes the acetylation of the C3 hydroxyl group, which has been demonstrated to lower the toxicity of trichothecene mycotoxins 100-fold (7Anderson D.W. Black R.M. Lee C.G. Pottage C. Rickard R.L. Sandford M.S. Webber T.D. Williams N.E. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Kimura M. Kaneko I. Komiyama M. Takatsuki A. Koshino H. Yoneyama K. Yamaguchi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1654-1661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The acetylation at C3 has been proposed to protect the Fusarium through the remainder of the biosynthetic pathway (8Kimura M. Shingu Y. Yoneyama K. Yamaguchi I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1033-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, TRI101 will acetylate and reduce the toxicity of the final products of the biosynthetic pathway including T-2, NIV, and DON (13Kimura M. Kaneko I. Komiyama M. Takatsuki A. Koshino H. Yoneyama K. Yamaguchi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1654-1661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The last step in the biosynthetic pathway is removal of the protecting C3 acetyl group before being secreted by the organism (14McCormick S.P. Alexander N.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Alexander N.J. McCormick S.P. Hohn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Control of the toxicity of trichothecene mycotoxins by modification of the C3 hydroxyl moiety has been identified as a resistance mechanism to FHB and DON. In Arabidopsis thaliana addition of a glucose moiety to the C3 hydroxyl group of DON and 15-ADON by a glucosyltransferase has been shown to reduce their toxic effects (16Poppenberger B. Berthiller F. Lucyshyn D. Sieberer T. Schuhmacher R. Krska R. Kuchler K. Glossl J. Luschnig C. Adam G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47905-47914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Likewise, modification of the C3 hydroxyl group to a ketone by a soil bacterium in the Agrobacterium-Rhizobium group reduced DON toxicity 10-fold (17Shima J. Takase S. Takahashi Y. Iwai Y. Fujimoto H. Yamazaki M. Ochi K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3825-3830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, enzymes that modify the C3 position have proved attractive targets for the development of FHB transgenic resistance strategies. The tri101 gene from F. sporotrichioides has been isolated and transgenically inserted into yeast (18McCormick S.P. Alexander N.J. Trapp S.E. Hohn T.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5252-5256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tobacco (19Muhitch M.J. McCormick S.P. Alexander N.J. Hohn T.M. Plant Sci. 2000; 157: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), wheat (20Okubara P.A. Blechl A.E. McCormick S.P. Alexander N.J. Dill-Macky R. Hohn T.M. Theor. Appl.

Horsley R.D. Plant Sci. 2006; 171: 699-706Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Likewise, the tri101 gene from F. graminearum has been transgenically inserted into Saccharomyces pombe (13Kimura M. Kaneko I. Komiyama M. Takatsuki A. Koshino H. Yoneyama K. Yamaguchi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1654-1661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and rice (22Ohsato S. Ochiai-Fukuda T. Nishiuchi T. Takahashi-Ando N. Koizumi S. Hamamoto H. Kudo T. Yamaguchi I. Kimura M. Plant Cell Rep. 2007; 26: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In laboratory scale tests tri101 consistently provided protection against FHB, although direct comparisons are difficult. Unfortunately, field trials of transgenic wheat and barley expressing the tri101 gene from F. sporotrichioides did not show resistance to F. graminearum. It was concluded that the intense disease pressure in the field trials over-whelmed the resistance provided by FsTri101 and perhaps was compounded by the use of a tri101 gene from a T-2 producing organism rather than one from a DON producing Fusarium strain (21Manoharan M. Dahleen L.S. Hohn T.M. Neate S.M. Yu X.H. Alexander N.J. McCormick S.P. Bregitzer P. SchwarZ P.B. Horsley R.D. Plant Sci. 2006; 171: 699-706Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At the time the transgenic strains were prepared it was unknown whether there might be enzymatic differences between TRI101 orthologs from different sources. The TRI101 acetyltransferase from F. sporotrichioides was assessed for its ability to acetylate the C3 position of different trichothecene myctoxins, but the kinetic rate constants were not determined (13Kimura M. Kaneko I. Komiyama M. Takatsuki A. Koshino H. Yoneyama K. Yamaguchi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1654-1661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 18McCormick S.P.

Plant Cell Rep. 2007; 26: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Given the structural differences between T-2, DON, and isotrichodermol, it would have been reasonable to expect differences in the kinetic profiles for TRI101 from different organisms. Indeed, as demonstrated here, there are clear differences in activity that would have supported an alternative choice for the construction of transgenic species. We present here structural and kinetic data for two TRI101 orthologs isolated from F. sporotrichioides (FsTRI101) and from F. graminearum (FgTRI101). The three-dimensional structures of FsTRI101 and FgTRI101 have been determined together with a series of ternary complexes with CoA and T-2 and DON. In addition, their kinetic profiles toward A and B type trichothecene mycotoxins have been measured. The large variation in Km between these orthologs can be explained by differences in their active sites. Finally, a mechanism for catalysis is proposed. The structural and kinetic results emphasize that the choice of an enzymatic resistance gene in transgenic crop protection strategies must take into account the kinetic profile of the selected protein. Plasmid and Strain Construction—All cloning was performed in Escherichia coli strain Top10. The tri101 gene (AF127176) from F. sporotrichioides was amplified using forward primer 5′-GCTAGCATGGCCGCAACAAGCAGCACAAGCAGCCAGTCTTTTGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-gCTgAgCCTACCCAATATACTTTGCGTACTTTGTCCACTCCTCATCC-3′ from genomic DNA (a gift from Dr. Jaechuk Yu, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The tri101 gene from F. graminearum (AB000874) was isolated from genomic DNA of strain PH-1 (a gift from Dr. Nancy Keller, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) using forward primer 5′-GCTAGCATGGCTTTCAAGATACAGCTCGACACCCTCGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-gCTgAgCTTAACCAACGTACTGCGCATACTTGGTCC-3′. There are no introns in the genomic genes for either enzyme. The PCR product was ligated into the Zero Blunt TOPO vector (Invitrogen) where the sequence was verified. Thereafter the wild-type TRI101 genes were excised with restriction enzymes NheI and BlpI (New England Biolabs), and ligated into a modified pET31b (Novagen) vector that included an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cut site. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this construct is MSYYHHHHHHDYDIPTSELYFQGASM1S2. where the location of the tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site is underlined. This cloning procedure introduced three residues at the N terminus of each enzyme. Protein Expression—TRI101 from F. sporotrichioides (FsTRI101) was overexpressed in E. coli strain Rosetta(λDE3) (Novagen). A starter culture from a single colony was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin. 10 ml of the starter culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB + ampicillin media. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until they reached an optical density (A600) of ∼1.2. Cultures were cooled to 16 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 24 h by centrifugation at 5,000 × g, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Protein Purification of FSTRI101—10 g of cells containing FsTRI101 were re-suspended in 70 ml of a lysis buffer, which contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 tablet/50 ml of Complete Inhibitor (Roche), and 35 mg of lysozyme at pH 8.0. The cells were lysed by sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. After washing with lysis buffer, the FsTRI101 protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 20-300 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. Fractions containing FsTRI101 protein were identified using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, buffer 4 °C. The His6 tag was removed with tobacco etch virus protease (23Shih Y.P. Wu H.C. Hu S.M. Wang T.F. Wang A.H. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The resultant protein, after passage over a further nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, was concentrated to ∼17 mg/ml using a Centriprep YM30 concentrator (Millipore) and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, pH 7.5. Expression and Purification of TRI101 from F. graminearum—FgTRI101 was overexpressed in a similar manner to FsTRI101 except that the cells were grown in M9 minimal media (24Atlas R. Handbook of Media for Environmental Microbiology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar) and CoA (Sigma) was added to 15 μm following equilibration at 16 °C and prior to induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Inclusion of CoA increased the percentage of soluble protein. The protein was purified as above except that the final dialysis buffer contained 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, pH 7.5. The final protein concentration was 13 mg/ml. Preparation of Selenomethionine-labeled FsTRI101 Protein—Cultures of E. coli strain Rosetta(λDE3) carrying plasmid encoding FsTRi101 were grown overnight at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium (24Atlas R. Handbook of Media for Environmental Microbiology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin. 10 ml of the starter culture was used to inoculate 650 ml of M9 + ampicillin. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an optical density (A600) of ∼1.2. Cultures were cooled to 16 °C and supplemented with 65 mg each of l-lysine, l-threonine, and l-phenyalanine, and 31 mg each of l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-selenomethionine. After 30 min, expression of the Fstri101 gene was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 20 h and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The protein was purified as described above. Crystallization and Structural Determination of Selenomethionine-labeled FsTRI101—Crystals of FsTRI101 were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 23 °C by mixing a 1:1 solution of protein at 11.3 mg/ml that contained 4.2 mm CoA, 167 μm T-2, and 0.83% Me2SO with 28% methylether poly(ethylene glycol) 2000 (MEPEG2K), 55 mm CaCl2 buffered with 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and equilibrating against the same precipitant. Single crystals grew to 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm in 5 days. The crystals were transferred directly into a solution containing 5% glycerol, 1 mm CoA, 25 mm NaCl, 65 mm CaCl2, 30% MEPEG2K, 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, and then stepwise into a cryoprotectant solution containing 5% glycerol, 1 mm coenzyme A (CoA), 300 mm NaCl, 70 mm CaCl2, 32% MEPEG2K, 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected from crystals of native and selenomethionine-substituted protein at SBC Beamline 19-BM (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The x-ray data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Crystallization of FgTRI101—Crystals of FgTRI101 in the apo form and complexed with CoA, T-2, and ethyl-CoA bound were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion in three different forms: apo crystals grew from a 1:1 mixture of enzyme at 13 mg/ml and a precipitant solution of 2.1 m sodium malonate, 100 mm MOPS, pH 6.9, at 25 °C. Single crystals grew to 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.01 mm in 30 days. These crystals were transferred into a synthetic mother liquor containing 2.4 m sodium malonate, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm T-2, and 100 mm MOPS, pH 6.9, at 25 °C. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of the complex of FgTRI101 with CoA and T-2 mycotoxin were grown from a 1:1 mixture of enzyme at 10.4 mg/ml and a precipitant solution of 2.1 m sodium malonate, 100 mm MOPS, pH 6.9, at 25 °C, containing 4.2 mm CoA and 1.6 mm T-2 toxin. Single crystals grew to dimensions of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.01 mm in 55 days. Crystals were flash frozen directly from the crystallization mixture. The complex between FgTRI101 and ethyl-CoA was crystallized by vapor diffusion from a 1:1 mixture of 12.5 mg/ml enzyme and a precipitant solution of 2.1 m sodium malonate, 100 mm MOPS, pH 6.9 at 25 °C, containing 4 mm ethyl-CoA. Single crystals grew to 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.01 mm in 55 days. Crystals were flash frozen directly from the crystallization mixture. Crystals of FgTR101 with DON and CoA bound in the active site were obtained by soaking crystals that were previously grown in the presence of T-2. These latter crystals were grown by mixing equal volumes of 8.7 mg/ml enzyme with a precipitant solution containing 4.2 mm CoA and 167 μm T-2. Single crystals grew to 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.01 mm in 25 days.

The refined FgTRI101 structure bound to CoA and T-2 was used to determine the structures for apo-FgTRI101, FgTRI101 complexed to ethyl-CoA, and FgTRI101 complexed with CoA and DON. The structures were refined as before (Table 1). Acetyltransferase Enzymatic Assay—The trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase reaction catalyzed by TRI101 was monitored by following the production of CoA in a 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) coupled continuous assay (ϵ = 14150 cm-1 m-1) (31Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were prepared at 25 °C by combining 50 μl of 1.5 mm acetyl-CoA (Sigma), 0.6 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma), 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8, with 50 μl of trichothecene toxin, 4.5% Me2SO, 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. For FsTRI101 the reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 82.5 ng/ml enzyme, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8. After mixing, 100 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 1-cm path length cuvette and the change in absorbance at 412 nm was followed. Reactions with FgTRI101 were as described above, using a stock protein concentration of 165 ng/ml. The rates of reaction were determined at various concentrations of isotrichodermol, T-2, NIV, and DON and then fit by non-linear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

https://openalex.org/W1987729647,"Background Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between the green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants CFP and YFP is widely used for the detection of protein-protein interactions. Nowadays, several monomeric red-shifted fluorescent proteins are available that potentially improve the efficiency of FRET. Methodology/Principal Findings To allow side-by-side comparison of several fluorescent protein combinations for detection of FRET, yellow or orange fluorescent proteins were directly fused to red fluorescent proteins. FRET from yellow fluorescent proteins to red fluorescent proteins was detected by both FLIM and donor dequenching upon acceptor photobleaching, showing that mCherry and mStrawberry were more efficient acceptors than mRFP1. Circular permutated yellow fluorescent protein variants revealed that in the tandem constructs the orientation of the transition dipole moment influences the FRET efficiency. In addition, it was demonstrated that the orange fluorescent proteins mKO and mOrange are both suitable as donor for FRET studies. The most favorable orange-red FRET pair was mKO-mCherry, which was used to detect homodimerization of the NF-κB subunit p65 in single living cells, with a threefold higher lifetime contrast and a twofold higher FRET efficiency than for CFP-YFP. Conclusions/Significance The observed high FRET efficiency of red-shifted couples is in accordance with increased Förster radii of up to 64 Å, being significantly higher than the Förster radius of the commonly used CFP-YFP pair. Thus, red-shifted FRET pairs are preferable for detecting protein-protein interactions by donor-based FRET methods in single living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2075197583,"Recently, single chain peptides have been designed that target the insulin receptor and mimic insulin action. The aim of this study is to explore if activation of the insulin receptor with such an optimized peptide (S597) leads to the same activation of signaling pathways and biological endpoints i.e. stimulation of glycogen synthesis and cell proliferation as stimulation with insulin. We find that surface activation of the insulin receptor A-isoform with S597 leads to activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and glycogen synthesis comparable to activation by insulin, even though the level of insulin receptor phosphorylation is lower. In contrast, both Src homology 2/α collagen-related (Shc) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 activation are virtually absent upon stimulation with S597. Cell proliferation is only stimulated slightly by S597, suggesting that it depends on signals from Shc and ERK. The differences in signaling response could explain both the earlier reported differences in gene expression, and the reported differences in cell proliferation and glycogen synthesis induced by insulin and S597. In conclusion, despite binding equipotency, insulin, and S597 initiate different signaling and biological responses through the same insulin receptor isoform.

The insulin receptor is a disulfide linked heterodimeric protein consisting of two 135-kDa extracellular α-subunits and two 95-kDa transmembrane spanning β-subunits, containing the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that is activated upon ligand binding (1Ebina Y.

IRS1 and IRS2 are the major insulin receptor substrates leading to glucose homeostasis and have distinct and overlapping roles in diverse organs. Furthermore alterations in both IRS1 and IRS2 have been shown to be strongly involved in the development of diabetes mellitus (4Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R.

The finding of specific functions of IRS1 and IRS2 in the murine pre-muscle cell line (L6 cells) are summarized by Thirone et al. (6Thirone A.C. Huang C. Klip A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 72-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) but the relative contributions of IRS1 and IRS2 to insulin signaling and to the development of insulin resistance is not yet conclusive. The majority of the published literature in this field suggests that IRS1 is the major substrate leading to stimulation of glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissues, whereas in liver IRS1 and IRS2 have complementary roles in insulin signaling and metabolism. In contrast Shc does not appear to be directly involved in metabolic signaling of insulin but plays a critical role in insulin-induced mitogenesis (6Thirone A.C. Huang C. Klip A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 72-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7Sasaoka T. Kobayashi M. Endocr. J. 2000; 47: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both IRS and Shc initiate the mitogen-activated pathway kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway, including activation of ERK1/2 itself leading to gene transcription and protein translation and cell growth. The other major signaling pathway activated by IRS proteins is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway that includes activation of PKB and leads to activation of glycogen synthase and other enzymes/proteins necessary for the acute metabolic effects of insulin (3White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S2-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides that bind to the insulin receptor have been identified by investigation of phage display libraries (ranging in size from 20-40 amino acids) (8Pillutla R.C. Hsiao K.C. Beasley J.R.

The two sites (1 and 2) seem to overlap with the two insulin binding sites on the insulin receptor, whereas the site 3 insulin receptor-binding peptides seem to bind somewhere near the site 2 peptides. Recently homodimers and heterodimers of the site 1 and 2 peptides have been generated. Many of these can activate the insulin receptor with high potency and specificity, possibly through a mechanism similar to the binding of insulin (9Schäffer L. Brissette R.E. Spetzler J.C.

Because of the smaller size and simpler structure of these insulin mimetic peptides, they are good candidates for drug development with potential use in the treatment of diabetes as a replacement for, or in combination with, insulin, and as templates for the design of novel peptidomimetics. In related work, we have studied such an optimized peptide (S597) in detail regarding its insulin receptor binding properties, 3M. Jensen, J. Brandt, P. De Meyts, and L. Schäffer, manuscript in preparation. 3M. Jensen, J. Brandt, P. De Meyts, and L. Schäffer, manuscript in preparation. gene expression profile and mitogenicity. 4M. Jensen, J. Palsgaard, R. Borup, P.

Schäffer, Activation of the Insulin Receptor (IR) by Insulin and a Synthetic Peptide Has Different Effects on Gene Expression and Cell Proliferation in IR-transfected L6 Myoblasts, submitted for publication. We found that S597 binds with a similar affinity as insulin but seems to interact with the insulin receptor in a dissimilar way with positive cooperativity between the two ligands, suggesting that they can coexist on the receptor (supplemental Fig. A). 3M. Jensen, J. Brandt, P. De Meyts, and L. Schäffer, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore we found significant differences between the gene expression patterns induced by these two ligands and a lower mitogenicity of S597. This suggests that S597 is able to induce a different response through the insulin receptor than insulin. In this study we have studied for the first time the downstream signaling pathways in cells expressing the insulin receptor when stimulated with S597 in comparison with insulin and found some very interesting differences helping to elucidate some of the activation mechanisms of signaling pathways utilized by the insulin receptor and explaining the previously obtained results with S597. Ligands—The insulin mimetic peptide, S597, with the sequence Ac-SLEEEWAQIECEVYGRGCPSESFYDWFERQL-amide, was synthesized by standard solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc chemistry and purified by RP-HPLC after formation of the disulfide bridge. Insulin was obtained from Novo Nordisk, Denmark and IGF-1 from GroPep, Adelaide, Australia. Antibodies—Anti-phosphotyrosine, 4G10 (UBS 05-321, diluted 1:500), anti-phospho-PKB T308 (Cell Signaling 9275, diluted 1:1000), anti-phospho-Shc (Tyr239/40) (Cell Signaling 2434, diluted 1:1000), anti-dual phospho MAPK 44/42 (Promega V667A, diluted 1:5000), anti-IRS-1 (UBI 06-248); anti-IRS-2 (UBI 06-506) both for immunoprecipitation, 5/200 μg cellular extract. Secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse HRP (Bio-Rad 170-6516), goat anti-rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad 170-6515), both diluted 1:3000. Cells—Cell line and culture conditions: The rat myoblast cell line stably transfected with the human insulin receptor (hIR) isoform A (L6-hIR) was kindly provided by Bo Falck Hansen, Novo Nordisk, Denmark. These cells express about 100,000 insulin receptors per cell. The L6-hIR cells and the L6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 21885-025 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Furthermore 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin was added to the L6-hIR medium (all from Invitrogen). The cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and passaged 2-3 times a week. Western Blots and Immunoprecipitations—Cells were stimulated as indicated, the media removed, and the cells immediately frozen by pouring liquid N2 in to the well. The cells were solubilized in lysis buffer by scraping of the cells at 4 °C, and the cellular lysate cleared by centrifugation. Phosphorylation of IR and IRS measured by Western blots after stimulation with insulin or S597 measured by analyzing the 95-kDa and 180-kDa band on a tyrosine phosphor Western blot. For immunoprecipitation cell lysates were incubated with antibody against IRS-1 or IRS-2 (5 μg) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Antigen antibody complexes were absorbed on protein-A-Sepharose for 1 h with agitation, and collected by centrifugation. Beads were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and the complexes solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Cellular lysates (equal amounts of protein) or immunoprecipitates (from equal amounts of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (6-12% gradient gels) followed by transfer to PVDF membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). The membrane was blocked in TBS with albumin (2%) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary detection antibody overnight. The membrane was washed three times 5 min at room temperature, incubated with polyclonal anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibody-labeled with HRP for 1 h, and again washed four times in TBS and incubated with HRP substrate and visualized on a Phosphorimager (Fujilas 3000). The intensity of the bands was quantified with the Phosphorimager software. Representative Western blots and immunoprecipitations are shown in supplemental figures. Internalization Assay using Acid Wash—Cells were grown in 24-well plates (150,000 cells/well) overnight, washed with Hepes binding buffer (HBB: 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm glucose, 15 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm Hepes and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6) and incubated with 20,000 cpm 125I-labeled insulin or S597 for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound tracer was removed by washing the cells with HBB and the cells incubated at 37 °C at different times, as indicated. After incubation, 1 ml of HBB pH 3.5 was added to half of each plate and incubated for additional 20 h at 4 °C (to remove surface-bound ligand), the other half was left without buffer. 500 μl of trypsin-EDTA were added to each well and the detached cells transferred to tubes and counted in a Packard gamma counter. There were four replicates for each condition, and the experiments were repeated three times. Decreasing the incubation time in buffer pH 3.5 to 8 min in the experiments with 125I-insulin gave the same results as incubation for 20 h at 4 °C but S597 was not removed by this treatment (data not shown). Furthermore trichloroacetic acid precipitation was performed on both the incubation buffer used in the 37 °C incubation step and 20 h of incubation at 4 °C at pH 3.5 to detect if the obtained results were due to extracellular degradation of the tracer. No degradation of the tracer could be detected in any of the experiments (data not shown). [6-3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—DNA synthesis was quantified as [6-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) incorporation into DNA according to an optimized method by C. Bonnesen and M. Oleksiewicz. 5C. Bonnesen and M. Oleksiewicz, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the cells were starved in medium containing 0.1% serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (starvation medium). The cells were harvested, seeded into 96-wells plates, and stimulated for 19 h with new starvation medium supplemented with insulin or S597 at indicated concentrations. The cells were finally incubated with 0.125 μCi [6-3H]thymidine per well for two additional hours. After harvesting the cells onto glass fiber filters with a cell harvester, radioactivity was detected in a Wallac beta counter. Glycogen Synthesis—The effect of the test compound on glucose incorporation into glycogen is determined by measuring incorporation of radiolabeled d-[U-14C]glucose into L6.hIR cells (10Olsen G.S. Hansen B.F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E965-E970Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the starved cells were incubated with and without compound in KRH-buffer (5 mm glucose, 20 mm mannitol) for 120 min and the last 60 min with tracer amounts of radiolabeled d-[U-14C]glucose. After the incubation, the cells were washed in buffer and solubilized by heating 30 min in 1 m NaOH at 90 °C. The glycogen was precipitated with 96% ethanol in the cold in the presence of carrier glycogen and dissolved in water, scintillation liquid was added, and radioactivity was counted. The results are the mean of three independent experiments, made in duplicates. In the present work, we investigated for the first time whether the activation of the insulin receptor by insulin or the peptide mimetic S597 results in activation of the same post-receptor signaling mechanisms. Furthermore we studied if S597 had the same biological properties as insulin with respect to stimulation of glycogen synthesis and cell proliferation. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the Insulin Receptor—The ability of S597 to tyrosine-phosphorylate the insulin receptor compared with insulin was examined by incubating L6 cells expressing the human insulin receptor (100,000 receptors/cells) with increasing amounts of insulin or S597 for various times. Compared with the basal level (set equal to 1) stimulation for 10 min with increasing concentrations of S597 lead to increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor but only up to ∼60% of the level induced by 100 nm insulin (Fig. 1A). Using 1 or 10 nm insulin or 100 nm S597 for various times shows that at all time points S597 gave only ∼50% insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation compared with 10 nm insulin and roughly twice of that induced by 1 nm insulin. The kinetics of insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by maximal S597 resembled that of the lower insulin concentration with the absence of a peak at 5 min seen with high insulin (Fig. 1B). Similar results were also obtained with other insulin peptide mimetics (data not shown). The difference in receptor phosphorylation by insulin and S597 could be due to S597 phosphorylating a lower number of insulin receptors than insulin, or S597 phosphorylating the same number of receptors but to a lower degree. To elucidate which one was the case, we stimulated cells and performed immunoprecipitations with antiphosphotyrosine antibody followed by Western blotting with insulin receptor antibody, thus only bringing down the activated receptors and giving a measure of how many receptors each ligand affects. Fig. 1C shows that 1 or 10 nm insulin and 10 or 100 nm S597 all lead to phosphorylation of the same number of insulin receptors. Fig. 1D shows the corresponding amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptors without immunoprecipitation. This means that the same number of insulin receptors were phosphorylated by S597 but to a lower degree. Downstream Signaling—Next we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins (the 180-kDa band on a Western blot detecting tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins) as well as activation of effectors ERK1/2 and PKB by using antibodies specific for their active forms. IRS was tyrosine-phosphorylated by 100 nm S597 up to 43% of maximum insulin levels at 10 min, with roughly similar kinetics (Fig. 2, A and B) and to a level similar to that induced by 1 nm insulin. ERK1 and ERK2 were only very weakly activated, to 27 and 18% of maximum insulin levels respectively, but with a flat kinetic profile compared with insulin where both 1 and 10 nm have a peak at 10 min, and to a much lower level than even 1 nm insulin (Fig. 2, C and D). In striking contrast, PKB shows nearly full activation, 94% compared with insulin, although the dose response curve is shifted to the right, and similar kinetics (Fig. 2, E and F). Interestingly, PKB shows maximal activation already at 1 nm insulin where the insulin receptor is only partially phosphorylated (29% of maximum). These results clearly show that S597 activates the insulin signaling cascade differently than insulin, with only half the receptor phosphorylation, full PKB stimulation but nearly no ERK1 and ERK2 stimulation. To further elucidate the phosphorylation of the proximal substrates of the insulin receptor we analyzed cells stimulated with either 10 nm insulin or 100 nm S597 for IRS1 and IRS2 phosphorylation, by immunoprecipitation of the two proteins, and Shc phosphorylation by antibodies specific for Shc phosphorylated on the tyrosine that regulates the activity of Shc. As can be seen in Fig. 3, IRS1 and IRS2 were phosphorylated to 59 and 41% of insulin levels, respectively, when analyzed specifically by immunoprecipitation, consistent with the results from the less specific method measuring both proteins presented above. In contrast, Shc was not activated, with specific phosphorylation of 5.5 or 0% at 10 and 20 min, respectively. So IRS1 and IRS2 followed the receptor phosphorylation pattern, whereas there was no phosphorylation of Shc by S597. Previously it was shown that S597 binds specifically and with a similar affinity as insulin to the insulin receptor. 3M. Jensen, J. Brandt, P. De Meyts, and L. Schäffer, manuscript in preparation. However, to control that the obtained effect of S597 is indeed through the insulin receptor we also performed experiments with untransfected L6 cells that predominantly express IGF-I receptors and very few insulin receptors. S597 had no effect on phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor, IRS, ERK1/2, or PKB in these cells (supplemental Fig. B) consistent with that the effect on signaling we observe in the L6 hIR is because of activation of the insulin receptor. Internalization—There is a clear link between receptor internalization and which signaling pathways there gets initiated, as for instance full activation of Shc but not PI3-kinase seem to be dependent on insulin receptor internalization (for review, see Refs. 11Foti M. Moukil M.A. Dudognon P. Carpentier J.L. Novartis Found Symp. 2004; 262: 125-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 12Leof E.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 343-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated whether S597 was internalized to a similar degree as insulin. When labeled ligand is bound at 4 °C, and the cells are then shifted to 37 °C the internalization of the ligand-receptor complex can be followed. The surface-bound ligand and the internalized ligand can be separated by washing off surface bound ligand with acidic buffer. These experiments shows that insulin is internalized within 20 min and almost no ligand is associated with the cells after 60 min, meaning it has been internalized and released (Fig. 4). S597 binding is more stable at acid pH3, and therefore not all surface S597 came off in the acidic wash. At time 0 where all the ligand is on the outside of the cell ∼80% was removable, and this picture was unchanged with nearly all the 125I-labeled S597 associated with the cells staying on for the 2 h the cells are followed, and ∼80% being removable by acidic wash. This method therefore suggests that S597 stays surface bound, and is associated with the cells for much longer than insulin. We also used trypsinization in the absence of EDTA, which does not release the cells but only removes extracellular proteins. With this procedure the pattern for insulin and S597 internalization looked similar to the one obtained with the acid wash experiment, most of the S597 was removable with trypsin for up to 90 min, meaning that it is surface bound for this time (data not shown). This demonstrates that the two ligands have very different sites of residence in the period where the signaling pathways have been analyzed. Glycogen Synthesis and Cellular Proliferation—We also analyzed some of the endpoints, known to be stimulated by insulin via the signaling pathways analyzed so far, namely glycogen synthesis and cell proliferation. Fig. 5A shows that glycogen synthesis is stimulated almost to the same level by insulin and S597 (72%), although with a lower potency (Table 1). Again there appears to be receptor spareness in the activation of glycogen synthesis compared with stimulation of insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, with maximal signal already at 1 nm insulin, as was the case for PKB. In sharp contrast, S597 was much less potent at stimulating cell proliferation/growth compared with insulin as seen in Fig. 5B, confirming our recent results. 4M. Jensen, J. Palsgaard, R. Borup, P. De Meyts, and L. Schäffer, Activation of the Insulin Receptor (IR) by Insulin and a Synthetic Peptide Has Different Effects on Gene Expression and Cell Proliferation in IR-transfected L6 Myoblasts, submitted for publication. The stimulation of cell growth was measured by [6-3H]thymidine incorporation assays where DNA synthesis was quantified as [6-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and used as a measurement for cell proliferation. At the highest ligand concentration, 100 μm, the effect of insulin was ∼3 times bigger than of S597. To further elucidate the effect of S597 we also performed assays where 10 nm insulin was incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of S597 and vice versa. These assays demonstrate that S597 is a partial agonist, and antagonizes the effect of insulin down to the effect of S597 alone. To verify that the effect on cell proliferation is through the insulin receptor the effect of insulin and S597 was also studied on the untransfected L6 cells with only few insulin receptors. S597 had no effect on cell proliferation in these cells (supplemental Fig. C) supporting that the weak mitogenic signal by S597 is mediated through the insulin receptor. The data from the experiments are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Summary of EC50 values and % activation obtained by S597AssayInsulin EC50S597 EC50% Maximal activationnmnmBinding2.12.5-IR tyrosine phosphorylation2.62.458IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation1.24.143ERK1 phosphorylation0.553.518PKB phosphorylation0.113.994Glycogen synthesis0.113.271Cell growth (WST-1)1.23.023 Open table in a new tab Insulin exerts a wide range of metabolic and mitogenic responses by binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor and phosphorylating tyrosines on several intracellular protein substrates. In this study we have stimulated L6-hIR myoblasts expressing the insulin receptor A-isoform with an optimized insulin mimetic peptide, S597, and investigated the activation of the insulin receptor, the post-receptor signaling mechanisms (IRS1/2, ERK1/2, Shc, and PKB) as well as the biological properties of S597 i.e. stimulation of glycogen synthesis and cell proliferation. The binding kinetics and gene expression profile of S597 have recently been studied in detail. 3M. Jensen, J. Brandt, P. De Meyts, and L. Schäffer, manuscript in preparation., 4M. Jensen, J.

In this study we have found striking differences in insulin receptor activation and downstream signaling pathways initiated by S597 and insulin. We have tested various other insulin mimetic peptides that show similar results (data not shown) supporting that the insulin receptor is activated in a different way by the peptides. The main findings of this study are summarized in Fig. 6 and Table 1. S597 phosphorylates the same number of insulin receptors as insulin but to a lower degree. This suggests that even though S597 is dissociating much more slowly than insulin it is not able to activate the insulin receptor to the same degree as insulin. This is in sharp contrast with studies of insulin analogues where prolonged residence time on the receptor was shown to have an enhanced mitogenic/metabolic potency ratio, seemingly through sustained Shc activation (13Hansen B.F. Danielsen G.M. Drejer K. Sørensen A.R. Wiberg F.C. Klein H.H. Lundemose A.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). As the duration of the phosphorylation is similar to insulin stimulation it seems that it is not the duration that is responsible for the differences in biological properties of S597 and insulin. The receptor intracellular β-subunit domain contains six phosphorylatable tyrosines, including three in the regulatory loop of the kinase (Tyr1146, Tyr1150, and Tyr1151); whose phosphorylation is required for amplification of the kinase activity (3White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S2-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). At present there is no clear evidence for specific roles of individual phosphorylation sites in divergent metabolic and mitogenic signaling pathways (14Wilden P.A. Siddle K. Haring E. Backer J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2049824934,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous, and particularly malignant childhood neoplasm in its higher stages, with a propensity to form metastasis in selected organs, in particular liver and bone marrow, and for which there is still no efficient treatment available beyond surgery. Recent evidence indicates that the CXCR4/CXCL12 chemokine/receptor axis may be involved in promoting NB invasion and metastasis. In this study, we explored the potential role of CXCR4 in the malignant behaviour of NB, using a combination of in vitro functional analyses and in vivo growth and metastasis assessment in an orthotopic NB mouse model. We show here that CXCR4 overexpression in non-metastatic CXCR4-negative NB cells IGR-NB8 and in moderately metastatic, CXCR4 expressing NB cells IGR-N91, strongly increased tumour growth of primary tumours and liver metastases, without altering the frequency or the pattern of metastasis. Moreover shRNA-mediated knock-down experiments confirmed our observations by showing that silencing CXCR4 in NB cells impairs in vitro and almost abrogates in vivo growth. High levels of CXCL12 were detected in the mouse adrenal gland (the primary tumour site), and in the liver suggesting a paracrine effect of host-derived CXCL12 on NB growth. In conclusion, this study reveals a yet unreported NB-specific predominant growth and survival-promoting role of CXCR4, which warrants a critical reconsideration of the role of CXCR4 in the malignant behaviour of NB and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1999466466,"Background The significance of behavioral neuroscience and the validity of its animal models of human pathology largely depend on the possibility to replicate a given finding across different laboratories. Under the present test and housing conditions, this axiom fails to resist the challenge of experimental validation. When several mouse strains are tested on highly standardized behavioral test batteries in different laboratories, significant strain×lab interactions are often detected. This limitation, predominantly due to elevated within-group variability observed in control subjects, increases the number of animals needed to address fine experimental questions. Laboratory rodents display abnormal stress and fear reactions to experimental testing, which might depend on the discrepancy between the stability of the neonatal environment and the challenging nature of the adult test and housing conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings Stimulating neonatal environments (e.g. brief maternal separations, increased foraging demands or maternal corticosterone supplementation) reduce stress and fear responses in adulthood. Here we tested whether reduced fearfulness associated with experimental testing would also reduce inter-individual variation. In line with our predictions, we show that a moderate elevation in neonatal corticosterone through maternal milk significantly reduces fear responses and inter-individual variability (average 44%) in adult mouse offspring. Conclusions/Significance We observed reduced variation in pain perception, novelty preference, hormonal stress response and resistance to pathogen infection. This suggests that the results of this study may apply to a relatively broad spectrum of neuro-behavioral domains. Present findings encourage a reconsideration of the basic principles of neonatal housing systems to improve the validity of experimental models and reduce the number of animals used."
https://openalex.org/W2015306991,"Prostate carcinomas are initially dependent on androgens, and castration or androgen antagonists inhibit their growth. After some time though, tumors become resistant and recur with a poor prognosis. The majority of resistant tumors still expresses a functional androgen receptor (AR), frequently amplified or mutated.To test the hypothesis that AR is not only expressed, but is still a key therapeutic target in advanced carcinomas, we injected siRNA targeting AR into mice bearing exponentially growing castration-resistant tumors. Quantification of siRNA into tumors and mouse tissues demonstrated their efficient uptake. This uptake silenced AR in the prostate, testes and tumors. AR silencing in tumors strongly inhibited their growth, and importantly, also markedly repressed the VEGF production and angiogenesis.Our results demonstrate that carcinomas resistant to hormonal manipulations still depend on the expression of the androgen receptor for their development in vivo. The siRNA-directed silencing of AR, which allows targeting overexpressed as well as mutated isoforms, triggers a strong antitumoral and antiangiogenic effect. siRNA-directed silencing of this key gene in advanced and resistant prostate tumors opens promising new therapeutic perspectives and tools."
https://openalex.org/W1978059116,"Background and Objectives Influenza virosomes represent an innovative human-compatible antigen delivery system that has already proven its suitability for subunit vaccine design. The aim of the study was to proof the concept that virosomes can also be used to elicit high titers of antibodies against synthetic peptides. The specific objective was to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of two virosome-formulated P. falciparum protein derived synthetic peptide antigens given in two different doses alone or in combination. Methodology/Principal Findings The design was a single blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose-escalating study involving 46 healthy Caucasian volunteers aged 18–45 years. Five groups of 8 subjects received virosomal formulations containing 10 µg or 50 µg of AMA 49-CPE, an apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) derived synthetic phospatidylethanolamine (PE)-peptide conjugate or 10 ug or 50 ug of UK39, a circumsporozoite protein (CSP) derived synthetic PE-peptide conjugate or 50 ug of both antigens each. A control group of 6 subjects received unmodified virosomes. Virosomal formulations of the antigens (designated PEV301 and PEV302 for the AMA-1 and the CSP virosomal vaccine, respectively) or unmodified virosomes were injected i. m. on days 0, 60 and 180. In terms of safety, no serious or severe adverse events (AEs) related to the vaccine were observed. 11/46 study participants reported 16 vaccine related local AEs. Of these 16 events, all being pain, 4 occurred after the 1st, 7 after the 2nd and 5 after the 3rd vaccination. 6 systemic AEs probably related to the study vaccine were reported after the 1st injection, 10 after the 2nd and 6 after the 3rd. Generally, no difference in the distribution of the systemic AEs between either the doses applied (10 respectively 50 µg) or the synthetic antigen vaccines (PEV301 and PEV302) used for immunization was found. In terms of immunogenicity, both PEV301 and PEV302 elicited already after two injections a synthetic peptide-specific antibody response in all volunteers immunized with the appropriate dose. In the case of PEV301 the 50 µg antigen dose was associated with a higher mean antibody titer and seroconversion rate than the 10 µg dose. In contrast, for PEV302 mean titer and seroconversion rate were higher with the lower dose. Combined delivery of PEV301 and PEV302 did not interfere with the development of an antibody response to either of the two antigens. No relevant antibody responses against the two malaria antigens were observed in the control group receiving unmodified virosomes. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that three immunizations with the virosomal malaria vaccine components PEV301 or/and PEV302 (containing 10 µg or 50 µg of antigen) are safe and well tolerated. At appropriate antigen doses seroconversion rates of 100% were achieved. Two injections may be sufficient for eliciting an appropriate immune response, at least in individuals with pre-existing anti-malarial immunity. These results justify further development of a final multi-stage virosomal vaccine formulation incorporating additional malaria antigens. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00400101"
https://openalex.org/W2082229472,"An experimental approach for improving vaccine efficacy involves targeting antigens to mannose receptors (MRs) on dendritic cells (DCs) and other professional antigen presenting cells. Previously, we demonstrated that mannosylated Pichia pastoris-derived recombinant proteins exhibited increased immunogenicity compared to proteins lacking mannosylation. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for this observation, the present study examined the cellular uptake of the mannosylated and deglycosylated recombinant proteins.Utilizing transfected cell lines, roles for the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR, CD206) and DC-SIGN (CD209) in the recognition of the mannosylated, but not deglycosylated, antigens were demonstrated. The uptake of mannosylated antigens into murine bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) was inhibited by yeast mannans (YMs), suggesting a mannose-specific C-type lectin receptor-dependent process, while the uptake of deglycosylated antigens remained unaffected. In particular, antigens with both N-linked and extensive O-linked mannosylation showed the highest binding and uptake by BMDCs. Finally, confocal microscopy studies revealed that both mannosylated and deglycosylated P. pastoris-derived recombinant proteins localized in MHC class II+ compartments within BMDCs.Taken together with our previous results, these data suggest that increased uptake by mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors is the major mechanism responsible for the enhanced antigenicity seen with mannosylated proteins. These findings have important implications for vaccine design and contribute to our understanding of how glycosylation affects the immune response to eukaryotic pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1974692753,"Cripto-1 (CR-1) has an indispensable role as a Nodal co-receptor for patterning of body axis in embryonic development. CR-1 is reported to have a paracrine activity as a Nodal co-receptor, although CR-1 is primarily produced as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein. Regulation of cis and trans function of CR-1 should be important to establish the precise body patterning. However, the mechanism by which GPI-anchored CR-1 can act in trans is not well known. Here we confirmed the paracrine activity of CR-1 by fluorescent cell-labeling and immunofluorescent staining. We generated COOH-terminal-truncated soluble forms of CR-1 based on the attachment site for the GPI moiety (ω-site), which we identified in the present study. GPI-anchored CR-1 has a significantly higher activity than COOH-terminal-truncated soluble forms to induce Nodal signal in trans as well as in cis. Moreover, transmembrane forms of CR-1 partially retained their ability to induce Nodal signaling only when type I receptor Activin-like kinase 4 was overexpressed. NTERA2/D1 cells, which express endogenous CR-1, lost the cell-surface expression of CR-1 after phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment and became refractory to stimulation of Nodal.

Establishment of the basic body plan of vertebrates is strictly regulated by a number of morphogens and signaling molecules such as Wnts, Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factors, and members of transforming growth factor β family ligands (1Tabata T. Takei Y. Development. 2004; 131: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2Marikawa Y. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Bottcher R.T.

Development. 2004; 131: 3501-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Among them, a transforming growth factor β family ligand, Nodal, is known to be indispensable for early embryonic development. Nodal acts as a morphogen to initiate gastrulation and to establish the anterior-posterior and the left-right body axis (5Shen M.M. Development. 2007; 134: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 6Chea H.K. Wright C.V. Swalla B.J. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nodal utilizes a shared signaling pathway with other transforming growth factor β family ligands such as Activin, which activates Smad2/3 through phosphorylation to interact with Smad4. This oligomeric complex then translocates into nucleus to regulate transcription of target genes through a transcriptional co-factor, FOXH-1 (Fast-1) (5Shen M.M.

To regulate precise formation of body axis, the spatiotemporal activity of these extracellular molecules should be strictly regulated. Expression and localization of Nodal itself are known to be regulated by several mechanisms (5Shen M.M. Development. 2007; 134: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). For example, Nodal gene expression is strictly regulated by node-specific enhancer and left-side-specific intronic enhancer (9Adachi H. Saijoh Y. Mochida K. Ohishi S. Hashiguchi H. Hirao A. Hamada H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Norris D.P. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, laminar leftward flow, which is generated by constant movement of cilia of embryonic cells, contributes to the left-side localization of Nodal ligand (11Okada Y. Takeda S. Tanaka Y.

Requirement for EGF-CFC proteins as co-receptors for Nodal suggests that the activity of Nodal signaling could also be regulated by the spatiotemporal localization and function of EGF-CFC proteins. EGF-CFC proteins contain several domains that include an NH2-terminal signal peptide, a variant EGF-like domain, a cysteine-rich CFC domain, and a hydrophobic membrane-associated domain at the COOH terminus. Most of EGF-CFC proteins including human/mouse Cripto-1 (CR-1/Cr-1) have been experimentally shown (13Minchiotti G. Parisi S. Liguori G. Signore M. Lania G. Adamson E.D. Lago C.T. Persico M.G. Mech.

However, the mechanism by which GPI-anchored forms of EGF-CFC proteins can act as soluble co-receptors for Nodal signaling is not known. In the current study we generated several variants of human CR-1 including soluble and transmembrane forms based on the identified ω-site of human CR-1 for GPI attachment. A comparative analysis of these variants revealed that the GPI-signal sequence of CR-1 is necessary to induce optimum Nodal signaling in trans as well as in cis. Cells—HEK293T (293T) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

All CR-1-related constructs were generated by PCR-based methods and cloned into pCI neo vector (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) or into pEF6/V5-His TOPO TA expression vector (Invitrogen). Experiments related to Fig. 8 were performed using pEF6/V5-His-based constructs, and all other experiments were performed with pCI neo-based constructs. A stop codon (TGA) was inserted just after Ser-161 or Ser-169 of the full-length CR-1 (amino acids 1-188) to obtain ΔC (Ser-161) or (Ser-169), respectively. The transmembrane portion of ErbB4 (amino acids 651-683) with a FLAG tag was inserted just after Ser-161 of WT CR-1 to obtain TM CR-1. To generate the TMpGS0-15 mutants, oligo DNAs coding 5-15 poly-GS spacers were introduced into the EcoRV restriction site which had been generated by point mutation just after Ser-161. Point mutations were inserted using QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers shown in Table 1.

For cell-labeling and co-culture assay, 293T cells stably transfected with wild-type CR-1 or NTERA2/D1 cells that express endogenous CR-1 were labeled with CellTracker green 5-chloromethylfluorescein (Invitrogen) before co-culture. After co-culturing overnight in the regular growth medium, cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and a 200 or 50 ng/ml final concentrations of Nodal or Activin, respectively, were added without changing the medium and stimulated for 1 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal goat serum, samples were incubated with 1:200 dilution of anti-total Smad2 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody was then labeled with Alexa Fluor 596-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, Invitrogen). For co-staining of CR-1 and Smad2, CR-1 staining was carried out for 1 h at room temperature with 5 μg/ml MAB2771 that had been labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 using Zenon tricolor mouse IgG1 labeling kit (Invitrogen). Counterstaining for nuclei was performed with DAPI. For quantification of nuclear Smad2-positive cells, images were taken with a fluorescent microscope equipped with a 40× objective lens, and only cells with clear nuclear staining of Smad2 were counted as nuclear Smad2-positive cells. Counting was performed in blinded manner. For each experiment total 177-249 cells/field were counted in two different fields, and three independent experiments were performed. For studies on the intracellular localization of CR-1 mutants, 293T cells were transiently transfected with each CR-1 mutant vector and the DsRed-Golgi expression vector. After 24 h of transfection, fixation and permeabilization were performed as described above, and CR-1 proteins were stained with 5 μg/ml MAB2771 and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was visualized with anti-calnexin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:250 dilution and Alexa Fluor 596-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, Invitrogen). Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Meta confocal system (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) with an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope equipped with a 63× NA 1.4 Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective lens. Images were collected with Zeiss AIM software using a multi-track configuration. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed using 16% (for detection of CR-1 protein) or 10% (for detection of phospho- and total Smad2) SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Depending on the experiments, 30-50 μg of total cell lysates or 40 μl of conditioned medium were loaded. CR-1 protein was detected with B3F6 mAb at a 1:5000 dilution and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000; Amersham Biosciences). All images of Western blot analysis in this work were visualized, processed, and quantified with an Image Analyzer equipped with LabWorks software (Ultra Violet and Laboratory Products, Upland, CA). Phase Separation—Phase separation by Triton X-114 was performed as previously described (23Furukawa Y. Tamura H. Ikezawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in TX-114 solution (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2% TX-114) for 1 h on ice. Phase separation was carried out by warming up to 37 °C and subsequent centrifugation at 3000 × g at 25 °C. The upper aqueous phase and the lower detergent phase were collected by micropipettes carefully. Before Western blotting, proteins were precipitated with chloroform-methanol (1:4) to remove the detergent. Preparation of Conditioned Medium—293T transfectants were incubated with Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen) for 24 h. Conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. Recombinant Nodal protein was then added at a final concentration of 200 ng/ml and immediately used for stimulation of cells. Dual Luciferase Assay—293T cells, which had been plated in 24-well culture plates, were transfected with an optimized amount of expression vectors ((n2)7-Luc, 50 ng/well; TK-renilla, 5 ng/well; mFast-1, 25 ng/well; mNodal-V5, 100 ng/well; ALK4-HA, 50 ng/well; each CR-1 mutant, 5-1000 ng/well). Depending on the experiments, recombinant Nodal or Activin B (R&D Systems) were used instead of mNodal-V5 expression vector. pCI neo or pEF6/V5-His empty vector was added to adjust for total amount of DNA. After 24 h of transfection or addition of ligands, dual luciferase assays were carried out using a kit provided by Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Co-immunoprecipitation of CR-1 mutants and ALK4 or Nodal was performed as described previously (16Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y.E.C. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 21Chen C. Shen M.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 618-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with CR-1-related expression vectors and ALK4-HA or Nodal-V5. Whole cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection using modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm NaF, 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA) with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA or anti-V5 antibody. For detection of the association with Nodal-V5 on the cell membrane, cross-linking with membrane-impermeable reversible cross-linker, 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP; 0.5 mm, Calbiochem) was carried out 1 h before preparation of cell lysates. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—293T transfectants or NTERA2/D1 cells were collected with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 4 mm EDTA). After washing with ice-cold FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 1.0×105 cells were incubated for 20 min with anti-human CR-1 phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibody (FAB2772P) at a dilution of 1:50. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold FACS buffer, and analyzed using a FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the quantitative results. Results with a p value <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Paracrine Activity of Wild-type CR-1—To confirm the paracrine function of human CR-1, we demonstrated the direct visualization of the trans activity of CR-1 in cell culture using immunofluorescence and fluorescent cell-labeling. Transient transfection of wild-type (WT) CR-1 into 293T cells that do not express CR-1 (16Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y.E.C. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) achieved up to 50-60% transfection efficiency resulting in the mixed population of CR-1 positive (transfected) and negative (untransfected) cells. We assessed the effect of Nodal and Activin on translocation of the Nodal/Activin intracellular mediator, Smad2, into nuclei by immunofluorescent staining. The localization of Smad2 in 293T cells that had been transfected with empty vector (EV) was mainly cytosolic (data not shown), and these cells did not respond to Nodal stimulation (Fig. 1A). 293T cells transfected with WT CR-1 also showed cytosolic localization of Smad2 without stimulation (Fig. 1B). In contrast to EV-transfected cells, stimulation of WT CR-1-transfected cells with Nodal induced Smad2 nuclear translocation in ∼70-80% of the total population (Fig. 1C). Smad2 nuclear localization was observed both in CR-1-staining-positive cells and in CR-1-staining-negative cells (Fig. 1C, arrowheads). Activin stimulated Smad2 nuclear translocation in almost 90-100% of the WT CR-1-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). This effect of Activin was also observed in EV-transfected or untransfected 293T cells (data not shown), demonstrating the CR-1-independent activity of Activin on Smad2 nuclear translocation. These data strongly indicate the paracrine activity of CR-1 in Nodal signaling. However, it was possible that WT CR-1-transfected cells, which did not show positive staining for CR-1, might express an undetectable but functional level of CR-1 protein. To exclude this possibility, we performed co-culture experiments of CR-1-stably transfected 293T cells and wild-type 293T cells (Fig. 1E) using a cell-labeling technique to segregate the CR-1-positive and negative cells (Fig. 1F). Consistent with the observation in transiently transfected 293T cells (Fig. 1A), a mixture of untransfected 293T cells and labeled stable transfectants of EV did not respond to Nodal (Fig. 1G). In contrast, Nodal stimulation of the mixture of untransfected 293T cells and labeled stable transfectants of WT CR-1 significantly induced Smad2 nuclear translocation not only in CR-1-positive cells but also in ∼16% of the CR-1-negative cells even though only 10% of the mixed population was the labeled, WT CR-1 stable transfectants (Fig. 1, H and J). Activin was more potent than Nodal in inducing Smad2 nuclear translocation both in labeled CR-1-positive and in unlabeled CR-1-negative cells (Fig. 1, I and J). To ascertain if this observation could be reproduced in cells that express endogenous CR-1 protein, we performed co-culture experiments using CR-1-deficient 293T cells and human embryonal carcinoma NTERA2/D1 cells from which CR-1 was isolated and cloned and which express a relatively high level of endogenous CR-1 (14Salomon D.S. Bianco C. Ebert A.D. Khan N.I. De Santis M. Normanno N. Wechselberger C. Seno M. Williams K. Sanicola M. Foley S. Gullick W.J. Persico G. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). CellTracker-labeled NTERA2/D1 cells responded to Nodal almost equally to Activin (Fig. 2, C-E). A significant population of unlabeled 293T cells responded to Nodal stimulation especially in the cells that were located proximally to NTERA2/D1 cells (Fig. 2, C, arrowheads, and E). From these results, we concluded that ectopically expressed or endogenously expressed wild-type CR-1 can act as a Nodal co-receptor in trans. Identification of a Functional ω-Site of CR-1—We have recently demonstrated that the GPI moiety is attached to Ser-161 of CR-1 in the COOH-terminal region by mass spectrometric analysis of “shed” CR-1 in the conditioned medium (22Watanabe K. Bianco C. Strizzi L. Hamada S. Mancino M. Bailly V. Mo W. Wen D. Miatkowski K. Gonzales M. Sanicola M. Seno M. Salomon D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31643-31655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To confirm that Ser-161 is a functional ω-site for GPI attachment, we performed a mutational analysis of the COOH-terminal sequence of CR-1. Because Ser-169 of human CR-1 had also previously been predicted as a possible ω-site for GPI-anchorage (14Salomon D.S. Bianco C. Ebert A.D. Khan N.I. De Santis M. Normanno N. Wechselberger C. Seno M. Williams K. Sanicola M. Foley S. Gullick W.J. Persico G. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (“big-Π predictor”), we introduced point mutations in these two possible ω-sites and also at the ω+1 and ω+2 sites. Because previous reports have described that the ω-site should be a small hydrophilic amino acid such as Ser, Asn, Ala, Asp, Gly, and Cys (23Furukawa Y. Tamura H. Ikezawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), possible ω, ω+1, or ω+2 sites were substituted by a hydrophobic amino acid, Leu (S161L, S161L/R162L, S161L/R162L/T163L, S169L, S169L/A170L, S169L/A170L/R171L) or a small hydrophilic amino acid, Asn (S161N). Western blot analysis of cell lysates revealed that the WT CR-1 protein was found primarily as the 26- and 24-kDa forms and to a lesser extent as a 18-kDa form, which may be due to different glycosylated forms (Fig. 3A) (14Salomon D.S. Bianco C. Ebert A.D. Khan N.I. De Santis M. Normanno N. Wechselberger C. Seno M. Williams K. Sanicola M. Foley S. Gullick W.J. Persico G. Endocr. Relat.

Chem. 2007; 282: 20133-20141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 26-kDa form of CR-1 was not present in S161L series (S161L, S161L/R162L, and S161L/R162L/T163L) mutants, whereas the S169L series (S169L, S169L/A170L, S169L/A170L/R171L) and S161N mutants contained the 26-kDa form and showed similar band patterns to WT CR-1 (Fig. 3A). In the conditioned medium of the S161L series mutants, secreted CR-1 proteins were not detectable (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, similar amounts of the CR-1 protein to WT CR-1 were detected in the conditioned medium of both the S169L series and S161N mutants (Fig. 3B). The size of the bands in the conditioned medium showed slight differences from the cell lysates (30- and 28-kDa forms, respectively). Higher amounts of the COOH-terminal-truncated mutant protein ΔC (Ser-161) were detected in the conditioned medium. Triton X-114 phase partitioning revealed that although the WT and the S161N mutant were mostly partitioned into the detergent phase, the S161L mutant protein was found to be enriched in the aqueous phase (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the S161L mutant protein is relatively hydrophilic and lacks a GPI anchor. A transmembrane (TM) form of CR-1 was found both in the detergent phase and in the aqueous phase (Fig. 3C). We then performed FACS analysis to evaluate cell-surface expression of each CR-1 mutant in transiently transfected 293T cells (Fig. 4A). The S169L series and S161N mutants showed strong cell-surface fluorescence of PE-conjugated anti-CR-1 antibody similar to WT CR-1. In contrast, cells expressing the S161L series mutants were not positively stained compared with EV-transfected cells as a negative control, confirming that Ser-161 is required for expression of CR-1 on cell surface. To evaluate the intracellular localization of each of the CR-1 mutants, we performed immunocytochemical analysis on transiently transfected 293T cells. A Golgi localization as well as plasma membrane localization was observed in the WT, S161N, and S169L mutants as assessed by co-transfection with a Golgi marker, DsRed-Golgi (Fig. 4, B, D, and E). In contrast, the S161L mutant was not found either in the Golgi or on the plasma membrane in most cases but exhibited aberrant punctate intracellular cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 4C). Other S161L series mutants showed a similar aberrant localization to the S161L mutant, whereas other S169L series mutants were similar to the S169L mutant in Golgi localization (data not shown). The ΔC (Ser-161) mutant, which had been generated by inserting a stop codon just after Ser-161, exhibited trans-Golgi network staining pattern without any staining of plasma membrane (Fig. 4F). The punctuate staining of S161L mutant protein co-localized with ER, which was labeled with the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 4G). These results are consistent with the previous reports which have demonstrated that uncleavable mutants of GPI-anchored proteins are retained in a post-ER compartment (23Furukawa Y. Tamura H. Ikezawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Moran P. Caras I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that substitution of ω-site with a hydrophobic amino acid may interfere the ER-to-Golgi translocation.FIGURE 4Subcellular localization and biological activity of CR-1 mutants in the COOH-terminal domain.

https://openalex.org/W2032359291,"The human monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ) protein is an essential transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that plays a primary role in the differentiation of erythroid and myeloid cells and is required to maintain hematopoietic stem cells. Chromosomal translocations involving the HAT-encoded region are also associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Here we present the x-ray crystal structure of the MOZ HAT domain and related biochemical studies. We find that the HAT domain contains a central region that is structurally and functionally conserved with the yeast MYST HAT protein Esa1, but contains more divergent N- and C-terminal regions harboring a TFIIIA-type zinc finger and helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs. Solution DNA-binding and acetyltransferase activity assays, in concert with mutagenesis, confirm that the MOZ HAT domain binds strongly to DNA through the zinc finger and helix-turn-helix motifs and that DNA binding and catalysis are not mutually exclusive. Consistent with the DNA-binding properties of MOZ, we also show that MOZ is able to acetylate nucleosomes and free histones equally well, whereas other HATs prefer free histones.

Our results reveal, for the first time, that enzymatic and DNA-targeting activities can be contained within the same chromatin regulatory domain. The eukaryotic genome is packaged into chromatin, the highly organized DNA·protein complex that not only serves as a structural element in preserving genetic information but also as a dynamic scaffold from which nuclear processes occur such as transcription, replication, DNA repair, mitosis, and apoptosis (1de la Cruz X. Lois S. Sanchez-Molina S. Martinez-Balbas M.A. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 164-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 2Ahn S.H. Cheung W.L. Hsu J.Y. Diat R.L. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2005; 120: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, consisting of 145-147 bp of DNA wrapped around an octameric histone core containing two molecules each of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. There are at least four types of protein domains that regulate DNA processes through chromatin modification. These include (a) enzymatic domains that either use ATP to translocate the DNA relative to the histone core proteins (3Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) or post-translationally modify the histone proteins (4Allfrey V.G. Faulkner R. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BioEssays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and (b) non-enzymatic domains that recognize chromatin, either through interactions with unmodified or modified N-terminal histone tails or the DNA, or histone chaperone proteins that deposit histones or replace variant histones into chromatin. Many chromatin regulatory proteins often contain both an enzymatic and chromatin recognition domain, although, to date, there have been no reports of a single domain harboring both activities.Chromatin recognition domains that target histones include bromodomains (6Owen D.J.

For example, members of the GCN5/PCAF family prefer lysine 14 of histone H3, and most members of the MYST family of HATs prefer lysine residues on histone H4.

Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004; 40: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These chromosomal translocation products contain the HAT-encoding region of MOZ, fused 5′ to the HAT-encoding region of either CREB-binding protein, p300, or a region of TIF2 that mediates the recruitment of the HAT domain of CREB-binding protein. It has been reported that MOZ-TIF2 translocations immortalize myeloid progenitors in vitro and induces AML in mice (33Deguchi K. Ayton P.M. Carapeti M. Kutok J.L. Snyder C.S. Williams I.R. Cross N.C. Glass C.K. Cleary M.L. Gilliland D.G. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 259-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The authors of this study also show that animals transplanted with MOZ-TIF2-transduced cells developed AML with 100% penetrance and that transformation is strictly dependent on the integrity of the zinc finger region of the MOZ HAT domain, but only partially dependant on the enzymatic activity of the HAT domain. These results suggest that an activity of the MOZ HAT domain, other than its enzymatic activity, is important for the etiology of AML. More recently, MOZ was shown to be essential for maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and to play a role in the differentiation of erythroid and myeloid cells (34Thomas T. Corcoran L.M. Gugasyan R. Dixon M.P. Brodnicki T. Nutt S.L. Metcalf D. Voss A.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 35Katsumoto T. Aikawa Y. Iwama A. Ueda S. Ichikawa H. Ochiya T. Kitabayashi I. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).To obtain structural and mechanistic insights into the MOZ HAT domain, the zinc finger region harbored within it, and possibly the underlying basis for its association with chromosomal translocations in AML, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of the MOZ HAT domain and carried out related biochemical studies. We found that the HAT domain structure of MOZ overlays well with the HAT domain of yeast Esa1, with the greatest degree of structural divergence mapping to an N-terminal zinc finger region and a C-terminal three helical bundle, helix-turn-helix motif, regions commonly found in DNA-binding proteins. Solution DNA binding assays in concert with protein mutagenesis confirmed that the MOZ HAT domain binds strongly to DNA through the zinc finger and helix-turn-helix motifs and that DNA binding and histone acetylation by MOZ are not mutually exclusive. We also show that the DNA-binding properties of MOZ are not conserved among several other members of the GCN5/PCAF and MYST family of HATs. Together, these results show that enzymatic and DNA-binding functions can be contained within the same chromatin regulatory domain and suggest that the DNA-binding properties of the MOZ HAT domain may be intimately association with MOZ-mediated transformation in AML.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation—The HAT domain of human MOZ was determined by sequence homology with the HAT domain of yeast Esa1 (residues 160-435) (30Yan Y. Barlev N.A. Haley R.H. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence encoding the HAT domain of MOZ (hMOZ, residues 501-784) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pRSET-A-based vector (Invitrogen) with an engineered tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable N-terminal His5 tag. The expression plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) LysS+ cells for overexpression of an N-terminal His5-tagged fusion protein (His-hMOZ), initially grown at 37 °C to exponential phase and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 15 °C overnight. Cells harboring hMOZ were disrupted by sonication in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protein was partially purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin with the His5 tag cleaved off essentially as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The protein was further purified to homogeneity using a combination of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) cation exchange and Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) gel-filtration chromatography, essentially as described (25Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Sterner D.E. Venkataramani R. Wang L. Zhou J. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8931-8936Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 36Yan Y. Harper S. Speicher D.W. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Purified protein was concentrated to ∼5.5 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra-15 concentrator, in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and flash frozen for storage at -70 °C.All MOZ HAT domain mutants were generated from the pRSET A-based expression vector template encoding the wild-type domain using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant MOZ HAT domain-containing plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) LysS+ cells for overexpression of an N-terminal His5-tagged fusion protein (His-hMOZ), as described above. The proteins were purified using nickel affinity, SP-Sepharose cation exchange, and Superdex 75 gel-filtration chromatography as described above, concentrated to 5-8 mg/ml, and flash frozen for storage at -70 °C until further use.HAT Assays—The histone acetyltransferase activity of the recombinant MYST domain of MOZ was determined using a 3H-based radioactive HAT assay as described elsewhere (37Lo W.S. Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Duggan L. Hsu J.Y. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) using as substrates H3p19 (5QTARKSTGGKAPRKQLASK23) and H4p19 (1SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHR19) and free core histones (Sigma, taken from calf thymus) essentially as described. The following reaction protocol was utilized for 30-μl reaction volumes: two concentrations of MOZ, representative of the linear range of the enzyme (50 or 100 nm), were incubated with either 100 μm histone peptide(s) or 10 μg of calf histones, and 0.25 μCi (3.9 Ci mmol-13H) of Ac-CoA in HAT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm sodium chloride, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg bovine serum albumin) for 25 min at 30 °C. Background control reactions did not include enzyme. Negative control experiments to check for self-acetylation and any false-positives due to the reaction conditions were also assayed (the core domain of p53 was used as a negative control). All reactions were performed in triplicate.The radioactive HAT assay in the absence or presence of saturating concentrations of cruciform DNA (2.0 μm) was carried out by incubating 80 nm of the MOZ HAT domain on ice for 45 min with increasing concentrations of H4p19 within the linear range of the enzyme (0-200 μm). All reactions were performed in duplicate.The HAT activity of the MOZ HAT domain with oligonucleosomes as substrate was compared with its activity with free histones as substrate using the 3H-based radioactive HAT assay (37Lo W.S. Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Duggan L. Hsu J.Y. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Histone and oligonucleosome substrates were purified from HeLa cells as previously described (38Utley R.T. Owen-Hughes T.A. Juan L.J. Cote J. Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 276-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Substrate concentrations were determined by the generation of a standardized BCA curve (BCA Protein Determination Kit purchased from Pierce). Acetylation assays were carried out as outlined above, using equimolar concentrations of either oligonucleosomes or free histones (3.0 μg per reaction, with the only difference being the presence of DNA in the oligonucleosomes) substituted into each reaction mixture as the substrate. The background was determined by measuring the acetylation rate with no enzyme present in the reaction mixture, and enzyme self-acetylation was determined to be negligible by measuring acetylation levels in reaction mixtures with no substrate present. The protein concentration used (500 nm) was within an experimentally determined linear-dependent range based on the substrate concentration (data not shown). All reactions were performed in triplicate.DNA Binding Assay—The DNA-binding activity of the MOZ HAT domain was investigated using fluorescence polarization. Four-way junction cruciform DNA and double-stranded DNA duplex samples were prepared as described by Bianchi et al. (39Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), and a sequence compatible with the formation of Z-form DNA (two strands of ZDNA-1, CGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCG) was used. 2-fold serial dilutions of the recombinant HAT domains were prepared from stock solutions in a protein dilution buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), and then incubated with 1 nm of fluorescein-labeled DNA substrate in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl in a total volume of 100 μl in borosilicate glass cuvettes. A negative control contained no protein. Each binding reaction was allowed to equilibrate for 30 min before fluorescence measurements were taken using a BEACON 2000 variable temperature fluorescence polarization system. Each experiment was performed at least in duplicate, and the average millipolarization value was plotted against a log scale of the protein concentration. The data were fit to a non-linear dose-response logistical transition, y = a0 + a1/(1 + (x/a2)a3), using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm within the SLIDEWRITE software package, where the a2 coefficient is the dissociation constant KD.The DNA-binding activity of the MOZ HAT domain was compared with other HAT domains and MOZ HAT domain mutants using the same protocol outlined above with only cruciform DNA. The other recombinant HAT domains used were from yeast Esa1 (residues 160-435), Drosophila MOF (residues 533-819), human PCAF (residues 493-658), and yeast GCN5 (residues 99-262).Nucleosome Displacement Assay—Recombinant Xenopus Laevis nucleosome core particles were purified essentially as described from recombinant full-length histones and 146-bp DNA (40Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), except that 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, instead of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was used during histone refolding and nucleosome assembly with DNA. Gel electrophoresis of mono-nucleosomes in the presence or absence of wild-type or mutant His5-tagged HAT domains of hMOZ, and wild-type yGcn5 were carried out essentially as described (38Utley R.T. Owen-Hughes T.A. Juan L.J. Cote J. Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 276-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, serial dilutions of respective HAT domain (ranging from 2.5 to 10 μm) was incubated with 50 nm of recombinant nucleosome core particle in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 7.5 pH, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol in a total volume of 10 μl. After equilibrating at room temperature for 20 min, 10 μl of 2× Native Gel Loading Buffer was added to the samples to 5% v/v sucrose and 0.15% SDS (to prevent smearing of nucleosome bands) and analyzed by electrophoresis on gels containing 5% acrylamide in 0.2× TBE (0.89 m Tris, 0.89 m boric acid, 0.02 m EDTA, Na2 salt) at 150 V for 150 min. Nucleosomes were detected by staining with Cyber Green (Cambrex). Nucleosome displacement assays using wild-type MOZ and Gcn5 and the MOZ H732D mutant were carried out in three independent experiments producing the same result.Structure Determination—For cocrystallization, the protein was premixed with Ac-CoA and peptide (H4p19 or H3p19) to a final ratio of 0.065 mm (protein): 0.145 mm (Ac-CoA): 0.23 mm peptide, and equilibrated for 30 min at room temperature to allow complex formation. Crystals were obtained at 22-23 °C using hanging-drop, vapor diffusion by equilibrating 2-4 μl of the premixed protein complex solution against 1 ml of reservoir solution containing 90 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 15%-20% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals grew to a maximum size of ∼0.2 mm × 0.15 mm × 0.15 mm over 2 weeks and formed in the space group I422 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystals were transferred to harvest solution containing 90 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 15% polyethylene glycol 3350, followed by a gradual transfer to harvest solution supplemented with 5, 10, 15, and 20% (v/v) glycerol before crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen-condensed propane. The structure was determined by multiple anomalous dispersion. Native and three-wavelength (peak, inflection, and remote) multiple anomalous dispersion data using the zinc ion as the anomalous scattering source were collected on beamline 19BM at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL) using an ADSC Quantum-4 charge-coupled device detector at 100 K, and data were processed with the HKL 2000 suite (HKL Research) with the relevant statistics summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics for the MOZ HAT domainCrystal parametersSpace groupI422Unit cella = b (Å)109.2c (Å)144.78Data collectionPeakEdgeRemoteNativeWavelength (Å)1.28291.28321.25610.9795Resolution (Å)50-3.250-3.250-3.150-3.0Total reflections284,344286,992302,505188,349Unique reflections13,75713,34414,7599039Completeness (%)99.996.499.999.1 (100)I/σ30.611.527.929.1 (7.2)Rsym (%)aRmerge = ∑|I - 〈I〉|/∑〈I〉.6.710.47.37.2 (30.4)Phasing (SOLVE)Figure of merit0.57Z-score8.9Refinement statisticsResolution range50-3.0Rworking (%)bRworking = ∑||Fo| - |Fc||/∑|Fo|.27.6Rfree (%)cRfree = ∑T||Fo| = |Fc||/∑T|Fo| (where T is the test data set of 10% of the total reflections randomly chosen and set aside, prior to refinement).28.4r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.009Bond angle (°)1.5Number of atomsBaverage (Å2)Protein2,09574.67Water1260.79Ac-CoA5455.35Zinc ions183.09Ramachandran plotResidues in most favored regions170Residues in additional allowed regions50Residues allowed in generously allowed region13Residues in disallowed regions2a Rmerge = ∑|I - 〈I〉|/∑〈I〉.b Rworking = ∑||Fo| - |Fc||/∑|Fo|.c Rfree = ∑T||Fo| = |Fc||/∑T|Fo| (where T is the test data set of 10% of the total reflections randomly chosen and set aside, prior to refinement). Open table in a new tab The structure of the MOZ HAT domain complex was determined by multiple anomalous dispersion. A single zinc site, Zn2+, was identified in the I422 crystal form using CNS (41Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) and confirmed with cross-difference Fourier maps. The site was further refined using CNS and SOLVE. The resulting, initial experimental electron density map was improved by solvent flattening density modification. The program O (43Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar) was used to build residues 507 to 779 of human MOZ (excluding residues 739-747) using the single zinc site and a partially generated backbone from the program RESOLVE (44Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1999; 55: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) as a guide and template. Model refinement was performed with simulated annealing and torsion angle dynamic refinement protocols in CNS with iterative manual adjustments of the model using O. Toward the later stages of refinement, individual atomic B-factors were adjusted, and Ac-CoA and solvent molecules were modeled into the electron density map. There was no electron density observed corresponding to the histone peptide that was included in the crystallization mix. A final round of refinement was done with Refimac5 (45Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar) utilizing TLS refinement. The final model was checked for errors with simulated annealing omit maps five residues at a time (example of a composite omit map detailing the N-terminal zinc finger region of MOZ is shown in supplemental Fig. S1), and the geometry of the model was evaluated using PRO-CHECK (46Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final model was refined to 3.0 Å with excellent crystallographic statistics and geometry with only two residues in loop regio"
https://openalex.org/W2018650627,"Nullomers are short DNA sequences that are absent from the genomes of humans and other species. Assuming that nullomers are the signatures of natural selection against deleterious sequences in humans, the use of nullomers in drug target identification, pesticide development, environmental monitoring, and forensic applications has been envisioned.Here, we show that the hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides, rather than the natural selection against the nullomer sequences, is likely the reason for the phenomenal event of short sequence motifs becoming nullomers. Furthermore, many reported human nullomers differ by only one nucleotide, which reinforces the role of mutation in the evolution of the constellation of nullomers in populations and species. The known nullomers in chimpanzee, cow, dog, and mouse genomes show patterns that are consistent with those seen in humans.The role of mutations, instead of selection, in generating nullomers cast doubt on the utility of nullomers in many envisioned applications, because of their dependence on the role of lethal selection on the origin of nullomers."
https://openalex.org/W2118579357,"Background. Organisms use a variety of mechanisms to protect themselves against perturbations. For example, repair mechanisms fix damage, feedback loops keep homeostatic systems at their setpoints, and biochemical filters distinguish signal from noise. Such buffering mechanisms are often discussed in terms of robustness, which may be measured by reduced sensitivity of performance to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings. I use a mathematical model to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of robustness in order to understand aspects of organismal design by natural selection. I focus on two characters: one character performs an adaptive task; the other character buffers the performance of the first character against perturbations. Increased perturbations favor enhanced buffering and robustness, which in turn decreases sensitivity and reduces the intensity of natural selection on the adaptive character. Reduced selective pressure on the adaptive character often leads to a less costly, lower performance trait. Conclusions/Significance. The paradox of robustness arises from evolutionary dynamics: enhanced robustness causes an evolutionary reduction in the adaptive performance of the target character, leading to a degree of maladaptation compared to what could be achieved by natural selection in the absence of robustness mechanisms. Over evolutionary time, buffering traits may become layered on top of each other, while the underlying adaptive traits become replaced by cheaper, lower performance components. The paradox of robustness has widespread implications for understanding organismal design."

This suggests that the modulation of endocytosis of PrPC through its N-terminal domain is important in a conserved physiological function of PrPC. Based on these observations, we evaluated the possibility of hemin being a physiological ligand of PrPC. Here we show that hemin promotes PrPC clustering, internalization, and degradation in cultured cells. In cell-free reactions, the binding of PrPC to hemin alters the aggregation state and inherent peroxidase activity of the latter. Preparation of Recombinant PrP (rPrPC)—Cell pellets of Escherichia coli expressing hamster PrP corresponding to residues 23–231 or 90–231 in the pET41 vector (EMD Biosciences) were lysed with BugBuster™ and lysonase (EMD Biosciences) in the presence of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Inclusion bodies were washed twice with 0.1× BugBuster™ in water and pelleted by centrifugation. The enriched rPrPC was further purified by minor modifications to the method of Zahn et al. (24Zahn R. von Schroetter C. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The protein was eluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.8), 500 mm imidazole, and 10 mm Tris. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate or PBS. The construct containing residues 23–106 was purified in the same manner except the protein was eluted from the nickel column using 10 mm sodium acetate at pH 3.5, and fractions that contain the protein were further purified on an SP-Sepharose column using a salt gradient in sodium acetate at pH 5.0. The protein concentration of rPrPC was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Purity of the final protein preparations was estimated at ≥99% when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (data not shown). Preparation of Solutions—Hemin (Mann Research Laboratories Inc.), biliverdin (Frontier Scientific), and bilirubin (Frontier Scientific) were dissolved in Me2SO at 10 mm. Further dilutions were carried out in PBS or serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Hemin stock solutions were also prepared in 0.5 m NaOH at 10 mm to investigate the effect of the μ-oxo-dimer of hemin, which is known to form at basic pH. UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—For spectroscopic analysis, rPrPC and hemin were mixed in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA prior to measurement of absorbance. Measurements were made on a SpectraMAX 190 plate reader (Molecular Devices). The spectra were acquired between 300 and 800 nm. Cell Culture—N2a5E4E is a mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cell line that overexpresses mouse PrPC as described previously (25Wong C. Xiong L.W. Horiuchi M. Raymond L. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). N2aGFP-GPI is an N2a cell line that was stably transfected with a GFP-GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored green fluorescent protein) expression vector (26Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K.

CF10 cells generated from PrPC null mice (27Takemura K. Wang P. Vorberg I. Surewicz W. Priola S.A. Kanthasamy A. Pottathil R. Chen S.G. Sreevatsan S. Exp. Biol. Med.

Human neuroblastoma cells (NB1) express endogenous levels of PrPC. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml, 100 μg/ml; Invitrogen). PrPC Binding to Hemin-Agarose—A confluent tissue culture flask (25 cm2) containing cells described above was rinsed three times with PBS and lysed with 600 μl of PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 2,700 × g for 5 min, and 600 μl of postnuclear supernatant was recovered. To the postnuclear supernatant, a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final concentration of NaCl was adjusted to 0.5 m. Additional Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate were added to final concentrations of 1%. Sarkosyl (1%) was also added to improve the dissolution of the cell membranes. The final volume was adjusted to 1200 μl after the addition of all reagents and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature to allow the dissolution of membranes. Hemin-agarose beads (Sigma) were washed three times with PBS prior to use. Washed beads containing the equivalent of 0.1 μmol of hemin were added to 200 μl of cell lysate and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After incubation, the unbound fraction was collected and precipitated with 800 μl of methanol. The beads were washed three times with the same buffer used for the binding step. The methanol precipitate and the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled, and 5 μl was subjected to SDS-PAGE with staining for proteins with GelCode Blue (Pierce) or to immunoblot analysis for PrPC using antibody D13 (InPro) for mouse and hamster PrPC and 3F4 for human PrPC. Immunodetection of Cell Surface PrPC—N2a5E4E cells were plated at low density in a 96-well plate and grown to confluence. At confluence, cells were washed once with serum-free Opti-MEM and treated with hemin, biliverdin, or bilirubin at 0, 1, 3, and 10 μm for 1 h at 37 °C. After treatment, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min followed by two washes with PBS. Then the cells were incubated with antibody D13 (InPro) diluted in PBS at 1:1000 for 1 h. After three washes of 5 min each, cells were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase diluted in PBS at 1:2000 for 1 h. Cells were washed three times and incubated with Attophos substrate (Promega) for 7–15 min until a yellow color was visible. Fluorescence intensity was measured in a SpectaMAX Gemini EM plate reader (Molecular Devices) using 450 nm excitation filter and 520 nm emission filter. The relative fluorescence intensity was calculated based on the signal obtained from untreated cells. Immunofluorescence—N2a5E4E cells were washed twice with serum-free Opti-MEM and treated with 3 μm hemin for 1 h. After treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min followed by two washes with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. To block nonspecific antibody binding, cells were incubated with 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (blocking solution) for 10 min. An antibody against PrPC, SAF-32 (Cayman Chemicals), was diluted in blocking solution (1:200) and added to the cells. After 1 h of incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 fluorescent dye (1:1000) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times and observed by confocal microscopy. All images were acquired with the same confocal parameters. Biotinylation and Isolation of Cell Surface Proteins—N2aGFP-GPI cells were plated in 24-well plates and cultured for 3 days. At confluence, cells were washed three times with serum-free Opti-MEM and treated with hemin at 0, 1, 3, and 10 μm for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1.2 mm MgSO4 (PBS Ca2+/Mg2+) on ice. Then 150 μl of 1 mg/ml NHS sulfo-LC biotin was added per well and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. NHS sulfo-LC biotin reacts predominantly with primary amino groups. After biotinylation, the cells were washed three times with PBS Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine. The cells were then lysed with 200 μl of PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) (lysis buffer). Cell lysates were incubated with 20 μl of streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature and then washed three times with the lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the designated antibody for PrPC (D13, InPro), GFP (monoclonal anti-GFP, Roche Applied Science), or NCAM (anti-NCAM, Chemicon). Biotinylated proteins in general were stained with Neutravidin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Pierce). To check the effect of hemin on PrPC turnover, biotinylation of N2a5E4E cells was performed as described above but prior to the hemin treatment. Detergent Insolubility Assay—All cells described were cultured and treated with hemin as described in the section above. The cells were then lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 2,700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and then Sarkosyl was added to a final concentration of 0.5–1% (29Nunziante M. Kehler C. Maas E. Kassack M.U. Groschup M. Schatzl H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4959-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After 10 min of incubation on ice or at 37 °C, the detergent-insoluble material was recovered by ultracentrifugation at 360,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant proteins were subjected to methanol precipitation. Pellets that were generated from ultracentrifugation or methanol precipitation were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analyses using antibodies described in the section above. Metabolic Labeling—Tissue culture flasks (25-cm2) were seeded with equal numbers of human neuroblastoma NB1 cells and grown until they were 80–90% confluent. The cells were preincubated for 1 h with 5 ml of 10 μm hemin in serum-free Opti-MEM followed by a 30-min incubation in 2 ml of methionine-free MEM containing hemin. Then 500 μCi of [35S]methionine was added to each flask and incubated for 30 min. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM containing hemin for the designated chase time. Peroxidase Activity—The peroxidase activity was measured by oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Pierce) or 2,2′-azinobis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]-diammonium salt (Pierce) by H2O2. Hemin (8 μm) was mixed with various concentrations of rPrPC, prior to the addition of substrate. After substrate addition the reaction was monitored for absorbance at 650 nm on a SpectraMAX 190 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Hemin-induced PrPC Clustering and Internalization—Several different inhibitors of PrPSc formation, e.g. pentosan polysulfate (21Shyng S.L. Lehmann S. Moulder K.L. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30221-30229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), copper (18Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), suramin (30Kiachopoulos S. Heske J. Tatzelt J. Winklhofer K.F. Traffic. 2004; 5: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (22Kocisko D.A. Vaillant A. Lee K.S. Arnold K.M. Bertholet N. Race R.E. Olsen E.A. Juteau J.M. Caughey B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 1034-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), affect the intracellular localization of PrPC. Because various synthetic cTPs inhibit PrPSc formation, we wondered if hemin, as a natural cTP and potential physiological ligand for PrPC, can also affect PrPC localization. This was tested initially by using an immunofluorescence assay for PrPC detection in fixed and permeabilized cells. To enhance PrPC detection, a neuroblastoma cell line that expresses a high level of PrPC, N2a5E4E, was used. Without hemin treatment, both cell surface and intracellular perinuclear staining was observed. Hemin (3 μm) treatment of N2a5E4E cells for 1 h decreased the immunofluorescence of PrPC on the cell surface and caused some residual surface staining to appear more punctate than in the control cells (Fig. 1). No staining was observed when the primary antibody SAF-32 was omitted from the staining protocol. Furthermore, SAF-32 did not stain CF10 cells generated from PrPC null mice (data not shown) confirming the specificity of the antibody against PrPC. Finally, similar results were obtained with antibody D13 (data not shown). These hemin effects on PrPC localization were not likely because of cytotoxicity because the treatment at ≤10 μm for at least 4 h did not induce any signs of toxicity as judged by morphology or a cytotoxicity assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (data not shown). Altogether, these results suggested that hemin induced both the aggregation and internalization of PrPC. Selective Effects of Hemin on PrPC Aggregation—The formation of PrPC aggregates was also evaluated using a detergent insolubility assay (29Nunziante M. Kehler C. Maas E. Kassack M.U. Groschup M. Schatzl H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4959-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Upon hemin treatment, PrPC solubility decreased in a dose-dependent manner in both mouse and human cell lines (Fig. 2, a, b, e, and f). To eliminate the possibility of PrPC aggregation being due to overexpression, the solubility of endogenous PrPC expressed in N2aGFP-GPI cells was also analyzed, and similar results were observed (supplemental Fig. 2). Because hemin can interact with many proteins, we investigated the selectivity of the effects of hemin on the aggregation of PrPC compared with other cell surface proteins such as NCAM (neural cell adhesion molecule), which interacts with PrPC (31Santuccione A. Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 32Schmitt-Ulms G. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Ball H.L. Bradon N. Bosque P.J. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1209-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and GFP-GPI protein, which follows default trafficking pathways of GPI anchored, lipid-raft-associated proteins (26Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). No hemin-induced alteration of NCAM or GFP-GPI solubility was observed, indicating a degree of specificity for the effects of hemin on PrPC solubility (Fig. 2c and supplemental Fig. 2). Quantifying Hemin-induced PrPC Internalization—To estimate the extent of internalization of PrPC after hemin treatments, relative amounts of cell surface PrPC were quantified using a fluorogenic immunoassay described under “Experimental Procedures.” To increase the PrPC detection in this assay, N2a5E4E cells were used. The PrPC specificity of the assay was indicated by the lack of fluorescence signal when the primary antibody (D13) was omitted and when the assay was applied to primary neuronal cells derived from PrPC null mice. The treatment of N2a5E4E cells with hemin for 1 h caused a dose-dependent reduction of cell surface PrPC (Fig. 3) reaching ∼10% of control levels at 10 μm hemin. It is known that basic solutions (e.g. NaOH) favor the formation of μ-oxo-dimers of hemin. NaOH-treated hemin was slightly more potent than Me2SO-solubilized hemin at causing PrPC internalization at 3 μm, but both solutions were effective overall. In contrast to hemin, its linear tetrapyrrole metabolites biliverdin and bilirubin did not significantly reduce cell surface PrPC (Fig. 3). Selectivity of Hemin Effects on PrPC Internalization—To further test the selectivity of hemin effects on PrPC internalization, N2aGFP-GPI cells that express endogenous levels of PrPC and a recombinant GFP-GPI were treated with hemin, and cell surface proteins were then biotinylated, captured with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were either immunoblotted for the detection of individual proteins or stained with a Neutravidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate to reveal the overall profile of biotinylated cell surface proteins. Consistent with previous assays, the cell surface PrPC signal decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, a and b), but the extent of internalization was lower than the previous assay using the N2a5E4E cells. This discrepancy could be related to different expression levels of PrPC in the two cell types because the N2aGFP-GPI cells express a lower, endogenous level of PrPC, whereas the N2a5E4E cells overexpress PrPC. In contrast, the banding patterns and intensity of many other cell surface proteins were not visibly altered with hemin treatment (Fig. 4a). We also examined hemin effects on NCAM and GFP-GPI. As shown in Fig. 4, a and b, no alteration of NCAM was observed, whereas GFP bands increased with hemin treatment. GFP-GPI is expressed under a cytomegalovirus promoter whose activity can be enhanced by histone acetylation or demethylation (33Choi K.H. Basma H. Singh J. Cheng P.W. Glycoconj. J. 2005; 22: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Given that hemin can regulate both histone acetylation and methylation (34Sun J. Brand M. Zenke Y. Tashiro S. Groudine M. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the increase of GFP-GPI on the cell surface could be due to increased expression, which was confirmed by a Western blot assay on total cell lysates (data not shown). Collectively, these data provide evidence that the effect of hemin on PrPC internalization was relatively selective. Hemin-induced Degradation of PrPC—In the immunofluorescence studies of PrPC using N2a5E4E cells, we observed that in some cells, intracellular fluorescence increased as the cell surface staining decreased. However, in other cells, the overall fluorescence intensity decreased (Fig. 1) suggesting that the internalized PrPC might have been degraded. To directly analyze whether degradation of PrPC is induced by hemin treatment, cell surface proteins of N2a5E4E cells were pulse-labeled with biotin for 5 min, incubated with or without hemin (10 μm) for 1 h to allow for turnover, and isolated on streptavidin beads for immunoblot analysis. With hemin treatment, the biotinylated PrPC bands decreased compared with those in untreated cells, whereas the overall banding patterns and intensity of other biotinylated proteins was not noticeably affected (Fig. 5, a and b). These results clarify that the decrease of PrPC signal in response to hemin treatment is not because of reduced expression but to enhanced degradation. Hemin effects on the biosynthesis and turnover of PrPC were also evaluated by pulse-chase [35S]methionine labeling and radioimmunoprecipitation of PrPC in human NB1 cells that express endogenous levels of PrPC. At time 0, immature glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of PrPC were seen as described previously (Fig. 5c, arrows) (35Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After a 1-h chase, mature glycosylated forms predominated (Fig. 5c, asterisk). In hemin (10 μm)-treated cells, these PrPC bands disappeared more rapidly with increasing chase periods, showing increased PrPC turnover relative to that seen in control cells. The quantification of all glycosylated and unglycosylated PrPC bands from two experiments revealed that the loss of pulse-labeled PrPC was accelerated in the presence of 10 μm hemin (Fig. 5d). Altogether, these data show that hemin selectively alters the subcellular localization and turnover of the PrPC. PrPC Binding to Hemin-Agarose—To evaluate whether hemin can directly interact with PrPC, hemin-agarose affinity chromatography was performed using N2a5E4E and NB1 cell lysates. Amounts of PrPC in bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. A single aliquot of hemin-agarose beads was able to fractionate ∼50% of PrPC from the total cell lysate (Fig. 6, a and b, lane 2). Additional PrPC (∼25%) could be extracted from the lysate with a fresh aliquot of hemin-agarose beads (data not shown). The absence of PrPC binding to agarose beads without hemin confirmed the specificity of the interaction between hemin and PrPC (Fig. 6, a and b, lane 4). To assess the selectivity of PrPC binding, the other proteins of each fraction were stained nonspecifically with GelCode Blue. A number of other proteins from the cell lysates also bound to hemin-agarose, as expected, but most proteins were much more abundant in the unbound fraction (Fig. 6, a and b, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the hemin-agarose showed some selectivity for binding PrPC. As an additional indication of specificity and to examine whether the octapeptide repeats in PrPC might be involved in hemin binding, we evaluated the hemin-agarose binding of hamster PrPC lacking the octapeptide repeats and flanking sequences (HaPrP Δ34–94). Although the binding of wild-type hamster PrPC was as efficient as the binding of the wild-type mouse and human PrPC, only ∼10% of HaPrP Δ34–94 bound to hemin-agarose (Fig. 6c). These results showed that hemin interacts directly or indirectly with PrPC of multiple species and that PrPC residues 34–94 strongly influence that interaction. UV-visible Spectroscopy—To obtain additional evidence of direct interactions between hemin and PrPC, we used UV-visible spectroscopy. Hemin is sparingly soluble in aqueous media and, when not bound to proteins, tends to form oligomers that absorb strong"
https://openalex.org/W2018677458,"A balance between proteolytic activity and protease inhibition is crucial to the appropriate function of many biological processes. There is mounting evidence for the presence of both papain-like cysteine proteases and serpins with a corresponding inhibitory activity in the nucleus. Well characterized examples of cofactors fine tuning serpin activity in the extracellular milieu are known, but such modulation has not been studied for protease-serpin interactions within the cell. Accordingly, we present an investigation into the effect of a DNA-rich environment on the interaction between model serpins (MENT and SCCA-1), cysteine proteases (human cathepsin V and human cathepsin L), and cystatin A. DNA was indeed found to accelerate the rate at which MENT inhibited cathepsin V, a human orthologue of mammalian cathepsin L, up to 50-fold, but unexpectedly this effect was primarily effected via the protease and secondarily by the recruitment of the DNA as a “template” onto which cathepsin V and MENT are bound. Notably, the protease-mediated effect was found to correspond both with an altered substrate turnover and a conformational change within the protease. Consistent with this, cystatin inhibition, which relies on occlusion of the active site rather than the substrate-like behavior of serpins, was unaltered by DNA. This represents the first example of modulation of serpin inhibition of cysteine proteases by a co-factor and reveals a mechanism for differential regulation of cathepsin proteolytic activity in a DNA-rich environment.

The papain-like cysteine protease, cathepsin L, has long been known as a degradative enzyme of endocytic organelles of mammalian cells, participating in the important role of protein turnover and antigen processing in these compartments (1Brix K.

Further, the observation that these cathepsins are unstable at neutral pH and hence that their proteolytic activity should be confined to acidic organelles of the cell has been shown to be an artifact of buffer choice in in vitro experiments (11Baici A.

It is clear that in conditions mimicking physiological pH and ionic strength, these enzymes retain activity for longer than previously thought (13Dehrmann F.M. Coetzer T.H. Pike R.N. Dennison C.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4487-4498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, human cathepsin L is also able to play an important role in tumor metastasis in the extracellular milieu, where overexpression of this protein leads to misdirected trafficking to the cell surface via the secretory pathway (for a review, see Ref. 17Mohamed M.M. Sloane B.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The means by which a protease is regulated is integral to its biological role. The presence of cathepsins in the nucleus almost certainly necessitates a corresponding inhibitor of nuclear cathepsin activity. We have shown that MENT (myeloid and erythrocyte nuclear termination stage-specific protein), a serpin predominantly localized to the nucleus of avian cells, is capable of inhibiting human cathepsins L and V in vitro (15Irving J.A. Shushanov S.S. Pike R.N. Popova E.Y. Bromme D. Coetzer T.H. Bottomley S.P. Boulynko I.A. Grigoryev S.A. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13192-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). MENT was originally identified as a chromatin remodeling protein in the nucleus of terminally differentiated avian granulocytes and erythrocytes (18Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it also has the ability to bind DNA (19McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Irving J.A. Ong P.C. Bashtannyk-Puhalovich T.A. Kan W.T. Henderson K.N. Bulynko Y.A. Popova E.Y. Smith A.I. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. Grigoryev S.A. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C.

Furthermore, the human cysteine protease-inhibiting serpin, SCCA-1 (squamous cell carcinoma antigen-1), has also been shown to localize to the nucleus of certain cell types (21Katagiri C. Nakanishi J. Kadoya K. Hibino T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The serpin inhibitory mechanism relies on conformational change, and several serpins, most notably the plasma serpins, antithrombin and heparin cofactor II (22Huntington J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 427-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), become more efficient protease inhibitors in the presence of a bound cofactor. Further, certain proteases also bind cofactors to mediate interactions with substrates and serpin-like inhibitors (22Huntington J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 427-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Hazes B. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, given the observation that both papain-like cysteine proteases and serpins can occur in the nucleus, we have investigated whether the interaction between serpins and the papain-like cysteine proteases are influenced by DNA. Our data reveal that, in the presence of DNA, cathepsin V is inhibited 10–50-fold more rapidly by serpins due to both a change in the enzyme and templating effects of longer DNA molecules with DNA-binding serpins. We show that this effect is most likely mediated via a structural change in the protease. Further, for serpins that interact with DNA, we show that a templating effect is also apparent. Together, our data suggest that nuclear cathepsins may be preferentially primed by DNA for inhibition by nuclear serpins. Inhibitors, Enzymes, Substrates, DNA, and Buffers—The MENT protein was expressed and purified as described previously (19McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Irving J.A. Ong P.C. Bashtannyk-Puhalovich T.A. Kan W.T. Henderson K.N. Bulynko Y.A. Popova E.Y. Smith A.I. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. Grigoryev S.A. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3144-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). MENT concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm with reference to the predicted extinction coefficient (0.805/mg ml-1). SCCA-1 expressed in Escherichia coli was a kind gift from Dr. Ruby Law (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University). Stefin A (cystatin A) was expressed in an E. coli system as described previously (24Jerala R. Zerovnik E. Lohner K. Turk V. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human cathepsins V and L were expressed in Pichia pastoris (system kindly donated by Dr. Dieter Bromme) and purified as described previously (25Bromme D. Li Z. Barnes M. Mehler E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All cathepsins were preactivated by incubation in cathepsin buffer (0.1 m acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Brij-35, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 10 mm cysteine, pH 5.5) for at least 20 min at room temperature before use. The active enzyme concentration was determined with trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)-butane (E-64) (Sigma) titration. The DNA probes (Gene Works Pty. Ltd.) used in the enzymatic reactions and in electrophoretic mobility shift assays are described in supplemental Table 1. Determination of the Association Rate Constant (ka) for Serpin-Cysteine Protease Interaction in the Presence and Absence of Cofactors—The discontinuous method of determining ka values between serpins and papain-like cysteine protease was undertaken in the pH 5.5 cathepsin buffer at 30 °C using the well mode in a Fluorostar Galaxy plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies) with excitation/emission wavelengths of 370/460 nm. Residual activity of cathepsin V in the presence of ds65mer DNA had to be measured within 20 s, since the inhibition by MENT in the presence of DNA was essentially complete within 1 min. For any given assay, the enzyme concentration was held constant at 0.1 nm, whereas the serpin concentration was at least 5-fold higher, with the concentration varying between 0.5 and 60 nm (maximum of 5 nm serpin in the presence of DNA). The DNA concentrations for the discontinuous assays were usually 10 nm, at least 2-fold in excess over the serpin concentration. Following the addition of serpin to the protease in the presence or absence of cofactor, the residual protease activity at various time points was determined in a final volume of 200 μl of 40 μm N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin substrate (Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec) 8The abbreviations used are:Z-Phe-Arg-NHMecN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin substrateSIstoichiometry of inhibitiondsDNAdouble-stranded DNAds24-mer and ds65-merdouble-stranded 24- and 65-mer, respectively. (Sigma) in cathepsin buffer. Substrate turnover was monitored at 1-s intervals over a short period of time. The natural logarithm of the initial velocity was then plotted against the elapsed time since serpin addition, and the resulting relationship was quantitated using linear least squares regression in PRISM (GraphPad Software). The gradient of this line represents the observed rate of inhibition for a given concentration of serpin (-kobs). The association rate constant (ka (m-1 s-1)) was then calculated from the slope of a plot of -kobs values against inhibitor concentration.

Determination of the Stoichiometry of Inhibition (SI) in the Absence and Presence of Cofactors—For each assay, 50 μl of 20 nm activated cathepsin was mixed with a constant concentration of the cofactors that were used in the discontinuous kinetic assays for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of serpin. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 20–45 min. The reactions were diluted 10-fold with cathepsin buffer, and 100 μl of 40 μm Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec substrate was added to each incubation mixture. The rate of increase in fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of residual protease activity, was immediately monitored, and this value was plotted against the molar ratio of serpin to cathepsin using PRISM (GraphPad Software). The stoichiometry of inhibition was determined as the x intercept value calculated from linear regression analysis as previously described (26Schick C. Pemberton P.A. Shi G.P. Kamachi Y. Cataltepe S. Bartuski A.J. Gornstein E.R. Bromme D. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Determination of Association Rate Constants for Cystatin A Inhibition of Cathepsin V—The ka value for cystatin A inhibition of cathepsin V was determined by continuously monitoring the rate of substrate cleavage by cathepsin V over a period of time in the presence of varying concentrations of cystatin A. Cathepsin V was preactivated at 37 °C for at least 15 min prior to performing the assay. In each assay, cathepsin V (0.05 nm), DNA (2 μm), and substrate (Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec) were kept constant. Cystatin concentrations were varied from 0 to 2 nm. Cystatin A was incubated with the substrate for 5 min at 30 °C before adding cathepsin V to the reaction mixture. Upon the addition of cathepsin V, the rate of substrate cleavage by cathepsin V was monitored continuously for 30 min. The data were collected and fitted using the equation described in Ref. 15Irving J.A. Shushanov S.S. Pike R.N. Popova E.Y. Bromme D. Coetzer T.H. Bottomley S.P. Boulynko I.A. Grigoryev S.A. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13192-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar. The ka value was determined by taking into account substrate competition. Determination of Kinetic Constants for Cleavage of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC Substrate—The final concentrations of cathepsin V and ds65mer DNA were 0.1 and 10 nm, respectively, whereas final substrate concentrations ranged from 5 to 200 μm in cathepsin V buffer. Initial velocities were determined from the linear portion of the release of fluorescence, detected with excitation/emission wavelengths of 370/460 nm at 37 °C. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Nonlinear regression of velocity against substrate concentration was performed with Graph Prism 3 according to the equation, v = Vmax[S]/Km + [S]. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay—DNA, at a final concentration of 0.5 μm, was used with serpin and cathepsin concentrations varied between 0 and 10 μm in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 40 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Brij-35, pH 7.0 and pH 5.5. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature before loading onto a 2% agarose I gel. Measurements of Change in Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence of Cathepsins—Potential cofactor-induced conformational change in cathepsin V was studied by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence changes of the enzymes in the presence and absence of cofactor. Cathepsin V (200 nm) was incubated with increasing amounts of the cofactor in cathepsin buffer in a final volume of 1 ml. An excitation wave-length of 295 nm was used, and the emission was scanned five times over the range of 300–400 nm at 100 nm/min, using excitation and emission slit widths of 8 nm. The emission spectrum of a buffer control (with or without DNA, as appropriate) was subtracted from the protein emission spectra. Fluorescence quenching experiments were performed in the presence and absence of 100 nm DNA (ds24mer) in cathepsin buffer using increasing concentrations of acrylamide (0–0.5 m). From the recorded titration spectra, the extent of quenching and the accessibility of tryptophan residues were calculated from Stern-Volmer plots as previously described by Lehrer (27Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). The absorbance of samples at excitation and emission wavelengths was monitored in all experiments and did not exceed 0.01. dsDNA Accelerates the Interaction between Cathepsin V and MENT—A key indicator of the ability of a serpin to inhibit a protease is the association rate constant (ka), which reflects the overall rate of inhibition. MENT inhibits human cathepsins V and L with a ka value on the order of 105-106 m-1 s-1 (15Irving J.A. Shushanov S.S. Pike R.N. Popova E.Y. Bromme D. Coetzer T.H. Bottomley S.P. Boulynko I.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13192-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), showing it to be a very effective inhibitor of these enzymes (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The SI value reflects negligible nonproductive inhibitor turnover, with 1.1 molecules of inhibitor required to inhibit one molecule of cathepsin V protease (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of MENT, SCCA-1, and cystatin A in the presence of various DNA constructs All assays were performed in triplicate, S.E. values for each value reported were less than 10% of the value.Cathepsin VCathepsin LkaSIkaSIm–1 s–1m–1 s–1MENT No DNA7.2 × 1051.12.6 × 1061.4 Single-stranded 18-mer7.8 × 1051.3NDaND, not determinedND ds24-mer7.8 × 1061.3NDND ds65-mer3.7 × 1071.12.4 × 1061.2SCCA-1 No DNA7.2 × 1061.25.3 × 1061.5 ds24-mer>108NDNDND ds65-mer>1081.55.8 × 1061.5Cystatin A No DNA1.4 × 106NDNDND ds65-mer1.3 × 106NDNDNDa ND, not determined Open table in a new tab We tested the effect of the presence of several types of DNA on the inhibitory interaction between these molecules (Table 1). The rate of association between MENT and cathepsin L, as well as the SI, has previously been found to be unaffected by DNA (19McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Irving J.A. Ong P.C. Bashtannyk-Puhalovich T.A. Kan W.T. Henderson K.N. Bulynko Y.A. Popova E.Y. Smith A.I. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. Grigoryev S.A. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3144-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Table 1). In contrast, the presence of double stranded 24- and 65-mer (ds24- and ds65-mer) DNA accelerated the inhibition of cathepsin V by MENT by 10- and 50-fold, respectively, without altering the SI (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This effect was also found to be specific to dsDNA, since it was not observed in the presence of single-stranded oligonucleotides (Table 1). DNA Accelerates the Interaction between SCCA-1 and Cathepsin V—Since cathepsins V and L are orthologues of cathepsin L molecules in other mammals and 80% identical in sequence (25Bromme D. Li Z. Barnes M. Mehler E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), it was surprising to find that DNA accelerated the interaction between MENT and human cathepsin V but did not affect the interaction with human cathepsin L. In order to determine whether the acceleration effect was mediated through the protease or the inhibitor, we examined the effect of DNA on the interaction between cathepsin V and the cysteine protease inhibiting serpin, SCCA-1. In contrast to MENT (28Grigoryev S.A. Solovieva V.O. Spirin K.S. Krasheninnikov I.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), SCCA-1 is an acidic molecule that does not interact with DNA (Fig. 2A). Any observed effect would therefore be mediated via interaction with cathepsin V. The kinetic experiments revealed that, although SCCA-1 is unable to bind DNA, the ka value for SCCA-1 and cathepsin V was accelerated by ∼10-fold in the presence of ds65-mer DNA. The SI of the interaction was unaffected (Table 1). As in the MENT experiments, the interaction between SCCA-1 and cathepsin L was unaltered in the presence of ds65-mer DNA (Table 1). Together, these data suggest strongly that, contrary to our initial expectations, the DNA is exerting a major effect through the cathepsin V enzyme. Further, this effect is specific to cathepsin V, since serpin/protease interactions with cathepsin L were unaffected. Cathepsin V, but Not Cathepsin L, Interacts with DNA—In order to evaluate the mechanism underlying the increase in ka in the presence of DNA, we evaluated the interaction between DNA and the two cathepsins. In a gel shift analysis, we noted that cathepsin L was unable to interact or even affect the electrophoretic migration of the ds65-mer within agarose (Fig. 2B). However, when cathepsin V was used in a similar experiment, smearing of the ds65-mer was noted when 4 μm protein was added (Fig. 2C). A further experiment with a greater excess of cathepsin V confirmed that it was capable of interacting with the DNA, albeit in an apparent nonspecific manner, since no discrete protein-DNA complexes were noted (Fig. 2C). Gel shifts using ds24-mer showed a similar pattern of cathepsin V-mediated interaction with DNA (Fig. 2D). The x-ray crystal structure of cathepsin V has been determined (29Somoza J.R. Zhan H. Bowman K.K. Yu L. Mortara K.D. Palmer J.T. Clark J.M. McGrath M.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12543-12551Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and using these data, we investigated whether any prominent positively charged patches, that may be able to interact with DNA, could be identified on the surface of the molecule (Fig. 3A). The structure reveals that the residues Lys-58, Arg-72, and Lys-78 contribute to a large positively charged patch and flank a region that defines one side of the active site cleft at the P1–P3 subsite positions. Analysis of the structure of cathepsin L revealed that this region of the molecule was negatively charged (Fig. 3B). DNA Promotes a Conformational Change in Cathepsin V—To further investigate DNA binding by cathepsin V and evaluate whether DNA induced any conformational rearrangement in cathepsin V, we examined the changes in the tryptophan fluorescence spectra of cathepsin V in the absence and presence of DNA. The tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra showed a marked difference in the presence and absence of dsDNA (ds24-mer and ds65-mer) with a 15 and 18% reduction, respectively, in the fluorescence emission at 333 nm recorded at the highest concentration of DNA used (Fig. 4A). To determine if these changes in fluorescence emission were indeed due to conformational change in the enzyme and not a result of the DNA shielding the tryptophan residues, fluorescence quenching titrations were performed using acrylamide. The Stern-Volmer plot for both cathepsin V in the absence and presence of DNA was nonlinear. Assuming collisional quenching, this nonlinearity could be explained by at least two populations of tryptophans, with differing levels of accessibility to the quencher (Fig. 4B). The presence of DNA caused an increase in the accessibility of the tryptophan residues of cathepsin V, with the Stern-Volmer plot showing increased quenching. These data indicate that the presence of DNA induces a conformational change in cathepsin V that results in the exposure of at least one tryptophan residue. The sequence and structure of cathepsin V reveals that the mature protein contains five tryptophan residues. One tryptophan residue, Trp-26, underlies the positively charged patch that we propose may be responsible for coordinating DNA, a region also observed to exhibit some mobility in papain (30Lindahl P. Alriksson E. Jornvall H. Bjork I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5074-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the number and distribution of tryptophan residues means it is not possible to ascertain the precise structural effects of DNA binding to cathepsin V through biophysical studies. DNA Has Effects on the Interaction between Cathepsin V and a Peptide Substrate—The increase in the rate of inhibition brought about by DNA indicated that it might be influencing active site residues or subsites of cathepsin V. We therefore investigated whether the interaction between cathepsin V and a commonly used substrate, Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec (31Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar), was altered in the presence of DNA. The presence of ds65-mer DNA caused a small, nonsignificant decrease in the Km value for the interaction between cathepsin V and the Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec substrate, from 33.1 ± 1.5 to 27.5 ± 0.2 μm. A larger, significant effect on the turnover (kcat) value was observed, with the presence of DNA reducing the value from 93.9 ± 1.5 to 37.7 ± 0.2 s-1. These data indicate that the binding of DNA changes the active site of cathepsin V such that the enzyme interacts with peptide substrates differently. Involvement of a Templating Mechanism in the Increase of Cathepsin V/MENT Association Rates—Since both cathepsin V and MENT bind DNA, we investigated whether a templating mechanism, brought about by binding of both proteins to one molecule of DNA, was operative in the acceleration of the interaction rate between cathepsin V and MENT. The effect of increasing DNA concentrations on the observed rate of interaction between the molecules was investigated. A clear bell-shaped curve was seen for the relationship between the kobs values and the concentration of ds65-mer DNA (Fig. 5A), indicating that a templating mechanism was indeed involved in the increased rate of interaction in the presence of DNA. This relationship was not seen for ds24-mer DNA (Fig. 5B), indicating that it might have been too short to achieve simultaneous binding to both inhibitor and enzyme (Fig. 5C). In addition, both species of DNA affected the rate of interaction between SCCA-1 and cathepsin V in a monophasic manner (Fig. 5, D and E), indicating that templating was not occurring. This meant that the rate enhancement seen with ds24-mer DNA in cathepsin V-MENT reactions and for both species of DNA in cathepsin V-SCCA-1 reactions could not be explained through a templating effect. The ds24-mer DNA would span just over two DNA helical turns (one DNA helical turn spans 10.5 bp/34 Å in length) and equates to ∼75 Å in length. In contrast, the ds65-mer is over 210 Å in length, spanning over six helical DNA turns. For a templating effect to occur between cathepsin V and MENT, it would be necessary for the DNA to be long enough to effectively reach from the DNA-binding domain of MENT at the bottom of the D-helix and M-loop to the top of the RCL and then beyond to interact with the cathepsin V (Fig. 5C). The length of the MENT molecule from the M-loop to the stumps of the RCL is in excess of 75 Å, indicating that in order to also interact with the cathepsin, the ds24-mer would most likely be insufficient in length to interact with both molecules (Fig. 5C). DNA Does Not Accelerate the Interaction between Cathepsin V and Cystatin A—We investigated whether the interaction between cathepsin V and other classes of inhibitor was influenced by DNA. Cathepsins are strongly inhibited by cystatins in cells and in extracellular fluids (32Turk B. Turk V. Turk D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 141-150PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether DNA influenced the reaction between cathepsin V and cystatin A (33Estrada S. Nycander M. Hill N.J. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Bjork I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7551-7560Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), since the mode of interaction between cathepsins and cystatins is entirely different from that seen with serpins. In particular, cystatins do not interact directly with the catalytic residues of cysteine proteases and instead occlude the active site, preventing access to substrates. Thus, for instance, cystatins are still able to bind the active site of cysteine proteases that have been previously covalently inhibited with molecules such as E-64 (34Katunuma N. Kominami E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was found that DNA did not affect the rate of association between cystatin A and cathepsin V (Table 1). These data suggest that the acceleration of inhibition is specific to the serpin mode of inhibition, where there is direct interaction between the inhibitor and the active site residues of the protease. Several recent studies have revealed that cathepsins localize to the nucleus, where they may play key roles, such as regulating DNA conformational changes that are necessary in processes such as transcription (8Goulet B.

Bird, personal communication. it is likely that one role for these serpins is the regulation of nuclear proteases (35Bulynko Y.A. Hsing L.C. Mason R.W. Tremethick D.J. Grigoryev S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4172-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The recent structure of the DNA-binding serpin, MENT, revealed that the RCL of this molecule was partially inserted into the A β-sheet, suggesting that, by analogy with antithrombin, a cofactor may modulate its inhibitory activity by inducing a conformational change. Modulation of plasma serpin activity against serine proteases is relatively common (39Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 40Pike R.N. Buckle A.M. le Bonniec B.F. Church F.C. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, in a previous study, dsDNA failed to mediate an effect on the rate of association between MENT and cathepsin L (19McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Irving J.A. Ong P.C. Bashtannyk-Puhalovich T.A. Kan W.T. Henderson K.N. Bulynko Y.A. Popova E.Y. Smith A.I. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. Grigoryev S.A. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3144-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This study provides evidence for cofactor-mediated modulation of an intracellular serpin/protease interaction; DNA renders cathepsin V susceptible to inhibition by serpins but in a manner independent of serpin conformational change. In particular, the close homologue of cathepsin V, human cathepsin L, is unable to bind DNA and demonstrates no acceleration effect. Thus, the enhanced rate of inhibition was found to be primarily effected through changes in the protease itself and secondarily due to sufficiently long DNA acting as a template for the “docking” inhibitor-enzyme complex. As a result, the DNA-binding serpin MENT and the non-DNA-binding serpin SCCA-1 both demonstrated a monophasic, 10-fold increase in the rate of inhibition with a short length of DNA. With a stretch of DNA capable of spanning the full “docking” complex, however, the inhibition by MENT was accelerated a further 5-fold in a biphasic manner. This templating effect brings about a rate enhancement due to facilitated diffusion of the molecules in solution (41Li W. Johnson D.J. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 42Olson S.T. Chuang Y.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that changes to the catalytic center of the enzyme are contributing to the effect of DNA on the interaction with serpins. 1) A change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and titration with a fluorescence quenching agent revealed that cathepsin V undergoes a slight conformational shift in the presence of DNA. 2) DNA failed to affect inhibition of cathepsin V by cystatins, whose mode of action is by occluding the active site and therefore independent of proteolysis. 3) DNA alters the kinetics of peptide substrate cleavage by cathepsin V. There is now strong evidence that cathepsin V is found in the nucleus and also that serpins that can interact with this enzyme are found in this compartment. Bulynko et al. (35Bulynko Y.A. Hsing L.C. Mason R.W. Tremethick D.J. Grigoryev S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4172-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) noted that cathepsin inhibition by high doses of a nuclear serpin (MENT or MNEI) may contribute to chromatin rearrangement in mature granulocytes, and it is plausible that other closely related intracellular serpins, such as SCCA-1, SQN-5, and Spi2A, may participate in controlling cathepsin-mediated chromatin regulation in other cell types. This work reveals that DNA should be taken into account when biochemically characterizing nuclear cysteine protease-serpin interactions. Most importantly, it highlights a mechanism by which cathepsin inhibition can be modulated, according to the cellular compartment in which it is localized.

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains are completely resistant to all β-lactams antibiotics. One of the main factors involved in methicillin resistance in S. aureus is the penicillin-binding protein, PBP2a. This protein is insensitive to inactivation by β-lactam antibiotics such as methicillin. Although other proteins are implicated in high and homogeneous levels of methicillin resistance, the functions of these other proteins remain elusive. Herein, we report for the first time on the putative function of one of these proteins, FmtA. This protein specifically interacts with β-lactam antibiotics forming covalently bound complexes. The serine residue present in the sequence motif Ser-X-X-Lys (which is conserved among penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactamases) is the active-site nucleophile during the formation of acyl-enzyme species. FmtA has a low binding affinity for β-lactams, and it experiences a slow acylation rate, suggesting that this protein is intrinsically resistant to β-lactam inactivation. We found that FmtA undergoes conformational changes in presence of β-lactams that may be essential to the β-lactam resistance mechanism. FmtA binds to peptidoglycan in vitro. Our findings suggest that FmtA is a penicillin-binding protein, and as such, it may compensate for suppressed peptidoglycan biosynthesis under β-lactam induced cell wall stress conditions.

A few of these additional factors, notably the proteins encoded by the fem genes, have been characterized functionally (17Berger-Bachi B. Strassle A. Gustafson J.E. Kayser F.H. Antimicrob.

Among the identified methicillin resistance factors, fmtA in particular has been reported to be part of the cell wall stimulon (32McCallum N. Spehar G. Bischoff M. Berger-Bachi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 1475-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Kuroda M. Kuroda H. Oshima T. Takeuchi F. Mori H. Hiramatsu K. Mol.

Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2719-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), which is a group of genes that is commonly induced upon treatment with cell wall-active antibiotics, such as β-lactams. Furthermore, inactivation of fmtA has been shown to affect peptidoglycan structure (24Komatsuzawa H. Ohta K. Labischinski H. Sugai M. Suginaka H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this gene is an active participant in peptidoglycan biosynthesis under antibiotic-induced cell wall stress conditions. Because β-lactams remain the primary therapeutics for treating bacterial infections, understanding the molecular mechanism of resistance to these antibiotics is essential. In this study we show for the first time that FmtA is a novel penicillin-binding protein with high resistance to inactivation by β-lactam antibiotics. We propose a mechanism explaining the resistance of FmtA to β-lactams and reveal the potential FmtA role in methicillin resistance and the S. aureus response to cell wall-active antibiotics. Materials and Chemical Reagents—Antibiotics and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise stated. Growth media were purchased from EMD Bioscience. Chromatography media and columns were from GE Healthcare. Escherichia coli NovaBlue and BL21 (DE3) strains pETBlue-1 and pET24a(+) were from Novagen. Bocillin was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. The enzymes used for cloning were purchased either from New England Biolabs or Stratagene. The genome of S. aureus strain Mu50 was obtained from ATCC. Cloning of the fmtAΔ27 Gene—The DNA sequence of fmtA was amplified from the genome of S. aureus strain Mu50 (ATCC) by PCR using Pfu Turbo™ polymerase and the oligonucleotide primers 5′-AGC CAT ATG CGA TTA CAG ACG AAG ACA CAT TCT A-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGC AAG CTT ATT ATT GAA CAA TAA CAC CCT TCG-3′ (reverse). Two restriction sites, NdeI and HindIII, were introduced on the forward and reverse primers (the italicized sequence), respectively, to facilitate cloning of fmtA. The fmtA amplicon produced using the above primers did not include the first 81 nucleotides of the gene. This sequence encodes for the signal peptide that was removed to facilitate cytoplasmic expression. We refer to this amplicon as fmtAΔ27. The fmtAΔ27gene was cloned into the EcoRV restriction site of the pETBlue-1 vector (Novagen), and a silent mutation was introduced in fmtAΔ27 to remove the NdeI restriction site normally found in fmtA and enable cloning of fmtAΔ27 into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET24a(+). The mutation was introduced by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using two mutagenic primers, 5′-CCT AAG AAA TAC AAA AAG CAC ATG TAT AAC GAT GGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCC ATC GTT ATA CAT GTG CTT TTT GTA TTT CTT AGG-3′ (reverse) (mutated bases are italicized). The pETBlue-1::fmtAΔ27 construct was digested with NdeI and HindIII to liberate the insert, which was subsequently ligated into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET24a(+). E. coli NovaBlue cells were transformed with pET24a(+)::fmtAΔ27, and successful cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing. An alanine residue (encoded by GCA) was inserted immediately after the N-terminal methionine by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers: Dir: 5′-GGA GAT ATA CAT ATG GCA CGA TTA CAG ACG AAG ACA C-3′ and Rev: 5′-GTG TCT TCG TCT GTA ATC GTG CCA TAT GTA TAT CTC C-3′ (the inserted nucleic acids are italicized in both primers). Successful insertion of alanine was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the final pET24a(+)::fmtAΔ27 construct was used to transform an E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Purification of FmtAΔ27—A single colony of E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pET24a(+)::fmtAΔ27 was used to inoculate 5 ml of Luria Bertani broth (LB) supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin A. The culture was allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C followed by a 200-fold dilution into fresh Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin A, 0.4 m d-sorbitol, and 2.5 mm β-betaine. The cell culture was grown at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 nm ∼ 0.6. The cell culture was then cooled down to 25 °C, and protein expression was initiated by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Subsequently, the cell culture was shaken at 25 °C for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,816 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and the cytoplasmic content was liberated by sonication. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 20,199 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The soluble protein fraction was loaded onto the SP-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). FmtAΔ27 was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1.0 m NaCl in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Fractions containing FmtAΔ27 were concentrated and loaded onto Hiprep™ butyl FF (16/10) column equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) supplemented with 1 m ammonium sulfate. FmtAΔ27 was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.0 to 0 m ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing FmtAΔ27 were concentrated and loaded to a Superdex™75 (10/300GL) column equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Gel filtration fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assess the purity of the isolated protein. FmtAΔ27 was concentrated to 4-5 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C until further use. All the above operations were carried out at 4 °C. The concentration of the purified FmtAΔ27 protein was determined by UV spectrophotometry using an extinction coefficient of ϵ280 = 56,160 m−1 cm−1 (Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer). A Superdex™ 75 (10/300GL) column was used to analyze the oligomerization state of FmtAΔ27 in solution. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and calibrated with a low molecular weight calibration kit (GE Healthcare). The concentration of the protein loaded was 100 μm. The N-terminal sequencing of the isolated protein was achieved by sequential Edman reaction carried out at the Advanced Protein Technology Center, Sick Kids' Hospital (Toronto, Canada).

The Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy prediction method was used to examine the presence of hydrophobic regions in FmtA (40Kyte J. Doolittle R. J. Mol.

Lebendiker, on-line report, The Wolfson Center for Applied Structure Biology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. was used to analyze the interaction of FmtAΔ27 with Bocillin Fl (Bocillin), a fluorescently labeled penicillin G derivative. Acidic conditions in nPAGE were employed due to the high pI of FmtA (∼9.3), and under these conditions FmtAΔ27 was well resolved. Under basic conditions (using a Tris-glycine buffer) the protein did not penetrate the gel. In concentration-dependent experiments, a typical reaction mixture (15 μl) consisted of 15 μm FmtAΔ27 and Bocillin at concentrations ranging from 0 to 120 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. In the time-dependent experiments, a typical reaction mixture (15 μl) consisted of 15 μm FmtAΔ27 and 120 μm Bocillin incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for different time intervals. Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature and quenched by the addition of the gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Gel imaging was performed using Fluorchem™ FC, and fluorescent bands were quantified using the AlphaEaseFC™ software. As a positive control in these experiments, we used the penicillin binding domain of the transmembrane signal-transducing protein BlaR, BlaRS (42Golemi-Kotra D. Cha J.Y. Meroueh S.O. Vakulenko S.B.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy Studies—Far-UV CD spectra (200 nm-260 nm) of FmtAΔ27 (14 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0)) were recorded on a Jasco J-810 instrument using a cuvette with 1.0-mm light path length. The experiments were carried out at 22 °C in the presence or absence of 150 μm penicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, oxacillin, cephalosporin C, cephalexin, or cephalothin. Each mixture of protein and β-lactam was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before the data acquisition. Typically, three scans were averaged and corrected for buffer and β-lactam background signals. Thermal Denaturation Studies—Thermal denaturation of FmtAΔ27 (14 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0)) in the presence or absence of 150 μm penicillin G was examined by monitoring the CD signal at 222 nm at different temperature points that varied from 10 to 100 °C (data were collected every 2 degrees over 30 s). Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching Studies—The intrinsic fluorescence emission of FmtAΔ27 (14 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0)) was monitored between 300 and 400 nm in the absence and presence of penicillin G (167 μm). The single tryptophan residue of FmtAΔ27, Trp-158, was excited at 295 nm. Spectra were collected at 22 °C in a RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer using a cuvette with a 0.4-cm light path length. Each data point was collected over 10 s, and 3 samples were prepared for each experiment. The collected spectra were corrected for the emission background of buffer and penicillin G. In another series of experiments we used acrylamide as a quenching reagent of Trp-158 emission. The emission of the protein (12 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0)) was recorded at 340 nm (excitation at 295 nm) in the presence of acrylamide at different concentrations (100-350 mm). Similar experiments were carried out with FmtAΔ27 incubated with penicillin G (150 μm, 1 h at 22 °C) before the addition of acrylamide. Three independent sets of experiments were carried out under these conditions. Data were analyzed using the Stern-Volmer equation, Fo/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, [Q] is the concentration of the quencher (acrylamide), and Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and the presence of acrylamide, respectively. The values of KSV were obtained from the linear regression analysis of the experimental data using Grafit 5.0. Analysis of the Putative Acyl-enzyme Species by Mass Spectrometry—Purified FmtAΔ27 (20 μm) was incubated with or without Bocillin (160 μm) in 50 mm phosphate supplemented with 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). Samples were desalted on a C4 reversed-phase HPLC column (Waters Symmetry 300 μm) using a water/CH3CN gradient in the presence of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. They were analyzed on a Micromass quadrupole-time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometer coupled to a Waters 1525μ HPLC system). To identify the reactive nucleophile, mixtures of FmtAΔ27 and Bocillin were digested with trypsin (ProteoExtract kit, Calbiochem). Digested protein samples were first desalted and concentrated using a Millipore Zip-Tip®. Peptides were eluted off the tip with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in 60% acetonitrile and 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid). The solution was spotted on a Perseptive Biosystems MALDI target plate. MS and MS/MS experiments were carried out using an AB/SCIEX QStar XL® hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The identity of the unmodified peptide of interest was confirmed by searching the MS and MS/MS spectra against the NCBI non-redundant data base using Matrix Science MASCOT® software. The identity of the modified peptide was also verified by means of MS/MS and submission of the resulting spectrum to MASCOT followed by manual inspection. Error tolerances for both automated and manual searches were 100 ppm for tryptic peptides and 0.2 Da for fragment masses. Several ions corresponding to y fragments with the modification still intact were identified manually. Binding of FmtAΔ27 to Peptidoglycan—These experiments were carried out following a published protocol with minor modifications (43Ursinus A. van den Ent F. Brechtel S. de Pedro M. Holtje J.V. Lowe J. Vollmer W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6728-6737Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptidoglycan from S. aureus RN6390 was isolated as described previously (44de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FmtAΔ27 (10, 30, and 60 μg) was incubated with 100 μg of peptidoglycan for 2 h at 4 °C. Two controls were prepared at the same time, 1) FmtAΔ27 (10 μg) incubated in the reaction buffer alone and 2) a mixture of chymotrypsinogen A (10 μg), albumin (10 μg), and ribonuclease A (10 μg) incubated with 100 μg of peptidoglycan. After incubation, all samples were spun down at 353,000 × g to recover peptidoglycan in the pellet. The supernatant containing the unbound proteins was put aside for further analysis. The pellet was washed twice, and the soluble fractions, herein referred to as wash fractions (W1 and W2), were put aside for further analysis. The final pellet, containing the peptidoglycan, was re-dissolved in 2% SDS. All the collected fractions were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Cloning and Purification of FmtAΔ27—We cloned and purified the untagged mature FmtA protein from the S. aureus strain Mu50. The recombinant protein lacked the first 27 amino acids, which were predicted by the SignalP 3.0 program (45Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 953-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar) to form a signal peptide sequence. In addition, an alanine residue was inserted into the sequence of FmtA immediately after the N-terminal methionine to increase the stability of the protein N terminus (N-end Rule in Ref. 46Novagen pET System Manual. Novagen, Madison, WI2006: 63-64Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in the cytoplasm in a soluble form and was purified to homogeneity in three steps (Fig. 1). Herein we refer to this protein as FmtAΔ27. The identity of the isolated FmtAΔ27 protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The apparent molecular mass, measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry-MS, was 43,031.0 Da, in agreement with the calculated mass (43,031.5 Da). Oligomerization State of FmtAΔ27—FmtAΔ27 appears as a mixture of monomer and dimer when analyzed by SDS-denaturing PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1A). FmtAΔ27 does not contain cysteine residues; thus, dimerization was not due to the formation of a disulfide bond. We investigated this phenomenon more closely and observed that the dimer:monomer ratio increased with boiling of the protein (data not shown). Dimerization was not observed by nPAGE (Fig. 1B). The apparent molecular mass of FmtAΔ27 calculated by gel filtration chromatography at pH 7.0 was 43,048 Da (Fig. 1C), indicating that FmtAΔ27 is monomeric under physiological conditions and that the dimerized species observed by the SDS-PAGE represents an artifact induced by boiling. Dimerization of FmtAΔ27, as observed by SDS-PAGE, could result from non-covalent interactions mediated by the exposure of hydrophobic patches upon boiling (47Shin I. Wachtel E. Roth E. Bon C. Silman I. Weiner L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2022-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We tested this possibility by excising the dimer band from the gel slab, electroeluting the protein, and re-analyzing it by SDS-PAGE. The resulting gel once again showed monomeric and dimeric FmtAΔ27 (data not shown), thus, strongly suggesting that formation of the dimer is indeed a non-covalent complex. Sequence Alignment and Homology Modeling—A search for a putative function of fmtA by aligning its sequence against sequenced bacterial genomes resulted in the classification of the protein as a β-lactamase. A closer look at the sequence alignments revealed that FmtA aligned against PBPs and putative class C β-lactamases from different organisms. Most of them have not been functionally characterized. Therefore, we restricted the sequence alignment to proteins with known three-dimensional structures. This approach revealed that FmtA has sequence homology to d-alanyl-d-alanine-carboxypeptidase from Streptomyces R61 (R61 DD-peptidase; E = 5e−12) and 908R β-lactamase, a class C β-lactamase from Enterococcus cloacae (E = 1e−6) (Fig. 2). The sequence alignments revealed the presence in FmtA of two of the three conserved motifs of serine active-site PBPs and β-lactamases: SXXK, Y(S)XN, and H(K/R)T(S)G, where X is any amino acid. In FmtA, the first of these motifs has the sequence Ser127-Ala-Gln-Lys (residues in italic represent the non-conserved residues) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the amino acid that precedes this sequence motif in FmtA is Gly, the same as in R61 DD-peptidase and 908R β-lactamase. The SXXK motif in PBPs and β-lactamases lies at the N terminus of an α-helix, and this could also be true in FmtA. The second sequence motif has the sequence Tyr211-Asn-Asp in FmtA. Even though this sequence displays an aspartate instead of the conserved asparagine, it consistently aligns against the Y(S)XN motif of R61 DD-peptidase, 908R β-lactamase, and other PBPs, or class C β-lactamases in the sequence alignment results. An interesting feature of FmtA, predicted by the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy method, is the presence of a hydrophobic-rich region (amino acids 350-370) at the C terminus (data not shown). This hydrophobic-rich region could mediate anchoring of the protein on the outer leaf of the cytoplasmic membrane, which is consistent with a previously reported result (24Komatsuzawa H. Ohta K. Labischinski H. Sugai M. Suginaka H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated a homology model of FmtA (spanning the amino acids 75-251) based on the crystal structure of R61 DD-peptidase (Protein Data Bank code 1mpl) to examine important predicted structural characteristics. The sequence identity between the two sequences is 28%, not very high but common among different classes of PBPs and β-lactamases. Despite the relatively low sequence identity, t"

W., Chen, Y.-L., Wang, D.-Z., Reiter, R. S., Lin, J. L.-C., Yang, B., Williamson, R. A., Chen, J. N., Lin, C.-I., and Lin, J. J.-C. (2007) Am. J. Physiol. 293, H2680-H2692). To understand the underlying mechanisms leading to such cardiac defects, the functional domains of mXinalpha and its interacting proteins were investigated. Interaction studies using co-immunoprecipitation, pull-down, and yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that mXinalpha directly interacts with beta-catenin. The beta-catenin-binding site on mXinalpha was mapped to amino acids 535-636, which overlaps with the known actin-binding domains composed of the Xin repeats. The overlapping nature of these domains provides insight into the molecular mechanism for mXinalpha localization and function. Purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase- or His-tagged mXinalpha proteins are capable of binding and bundling actin filaments, as determined by co-sedimentation and electron microscopic studies. The binding to actin was saturated at an approximate stoichiometry of nine actin monomers to one mXinalpha. A stronger interaction was observed between mXinalpha C-terminal deletion and actin as compared with the interaction between full-length mXinalpha and actin. Furthermore, force expression of green fluorescent protein fused to an mXinalpha C-terminal deletion in cultured cells showed greater stress fiber localization compared with force-expressed GFP-mXinalpha. These results suggest a model whereby the C terminus of mXinalpha may prevent the full-length molecule from binding to actin, until the beta-catenin-binding domain is occupied by beta-catenin. The binding of mXinalpha to beta-catenin at the adherens junction would then facilitate actin binding. In support of this model, we found that the actin binding and bundling activity of mXinalpha was enhanced in the presence of beta-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2051438073,"The interactions of elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with elongation factor 1Bα (eEF1Bα), guanine nucleotides, and aminoacyl-tRNA were studied kinetically by fluorescence stopped-flow. eEF1A has similar affinities for GDP and GTP, 0.4 and 1.1 μm, respectively. Dissociation of nucleotides from eEF1A in the absence of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor is slow (about 0.1 s–1) and is accelerated by eEF1Bα by 320-fold and 250-fold for GDP and GTP, respectively. The rate constant of eEF1Bα binding to eEF1A (107–108 m –1 s–1) is independent of guanine nucleotides. At the concentrations of nucleotides and factors prevailing in the cell, the overall exchange rate is expected to be in the range of 6 s–1, which is compatible with the rate of protein synthesis in the cell. eEF1A·GTP binds Phe-tRNAPhe with a Kd of 3 nm, whereas eEF1A·GDP shows no significant binding, indicating that eEF1A has similar tRNA binding properties as its prokaryotic homolog, EF-Tu.

The eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (eEF1) 3The abbreviations used are: eEF, eukaryotic elongation factor; EF-Tu, elongation factor Tu; EF-Ts, elongation factor Ts; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; aa-tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA; mant-GDP/GTP, (2′/3′-O-(N-methyl-anthraniloyl-GDP/GTP); Prf, proflavin. comprises eEF1A and eEF1B (1Merrick, W. C., and Nyborg, J. (2000) in Translational Control of Gene Expression (Sonenberg, N., Hershey, J. W. B., and Mathews, M. B., eds) pp. 89–126, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). eEF1A, a 50-kDa protein homologous to prokaryotic elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), delivers aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) to the A site of the ribosome. Similarly to EF-Tu, eEF1A is a member of the GTPase superfamily and can bind GTP and GDP. The dissociation of GDP from eEF1A is accelerated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), eEF1B, which is composed of two subunits, eEF1Bα and eEF1Bγ, in yeast, or three subunits, eEF1Bα, eEF1Bγ, and eEF1Bβ, in mammals. eEF1Bα contains the catalytic domain necessary for nucleotide exchange and is thus the functional equivalent to the bacterial GEF of EF-Tu, EF-Ts. Although eEF1Bα and EF-Ts have the same function, the two proteins do not exhibit any significant sequence homology. While the isolated structure of the C terminus of eEF1Bα was initially reported to be similar to one domains of EF-Ts (2Perez J.M. Siegal G. Kriek J. Hard K. Dijk J. Canters G.W. Moller W. Structure. 1999; 7: 217-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the two GEFs bind their G-proteins in fundamentally different ways. eEF1Bα interacts with domains 1 and 2 of eEF1A (3Andersen G.R.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), disrupting the switch 2 region of eEF1A, which forms part of the binding pocket for Mg2+ and the γ-phosphate of GTP, and inserting the highly conserved Lys205 of eEF1Bα into the Mg2+ and GDP/GTP binding sites of eEF1A. This prevents the binding of the β- and γ-phosphates to the P loop (4Andersen G.R. Valente L. Pedersen L. Kinzy T.G. Nyborg J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The structures of the sugar- and base-binding pockets of eEF1A are mostly unperturbed by eEF1Bα, which is not the case in the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex. EF-Ts, on the other hand, binds EF-Tu via domains I and III (5Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Wang Y. Jiang Y.X. Meyering-Voss M. Sprinzl M. Sigler P.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because eEF1Bα instead interacts with domains 1 and 2 of eEF1A, the latter of which is the binding site of aa-tRNA (3Andersen G.R. Pedersen L. Valente L. Chatterjee I. Kinzy T.G. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), binding of eEF1Bα and aa-tRNA to eEF1A may either be mutually exclusive or either contribute to forming a binding pocket for aa-tRNA. eEF1A from many different organisms was reported to have similar affinities for GTP and GDP, for example 0.7 μm and 1 μm for GTP and GDP, respectively, as measured for eEF1A from S. cerevisiae (7Saha S.K. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12599-12603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of active eEF1A·GTP is thermodynamically favored by the higher intracellular concentration of GTP over GDP. In addition, the high concentration of aa-tRNA in the cell is expected to further shift the equilibrium toward the GTP-bound state due to the formation of EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA, without affecting the kinetics of nucleotide exchange. However, the rate of spontaneous GDP release from eEF1A, about 0.17 s–1 (8Pittman Y.R. Valente L. Jeppesen M.G. Andersen G.R. Patel S. Kinzy T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19457-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) appears to be too slow to maintain the rate of protein synthesis, about 10 s–1 in yeast cells (9Boehlke K.W. Friesen J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 429-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bonven B. Gullov K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 170: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which explains the necessity for eEF1Bα. On the other hand, the rate of spontaneous GDP release from eEF1A is almost 100-fold faster than that from EF-Tu, 0.002 s–1 (11Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Wagner A. Simon I. Sprinzl M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12535-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which suggests why overexpression of eEF1A allows protein synthesis in the absence of eEF1Bα in vivo (13Kinzy T.G. Woolford Jr., J.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 481-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. when at any time sufficient amounts of eEF1A·GTP are available to bind aa-tRNA, despite the slow nucleotide exchange. By analogy to the prokaryotic EF-Tu·EF-Ts (11Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and in agreement with crystallographic studies on eEF1A·eEF1Bα complexes (4Andersen G.R. Valente L. Pedersen L. Kinzy T.G. Nyborg J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the exchange reaction is initiated by the binding of eEF1Bα to eEF1A·GDP to form the eEF1A·GDP·eEF1Bα complex, which dissociates into GDP and eEF1A·eEF1Bα. Next, GTP binds to the eEF1A·eEF1Bα complex to form the intermediary eEF1A·GTP·eEF1Bα complex, which dissociates into eEF1Bα and eEF1A·GTP, thereby completing the exchange reaction (Fig. 1). Nucleotide exchange in eEF1A in the presence of eEF1Bα was suggested to be the rate-controlling step of eukaryotic translation (14Janssen G.M. Möller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1773-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent rapid kinetics measurements indicated that the rate constant of eEF1B-catalyzed GDP dissociation from eEF1A is quite high, 100–200 s–1 at physiological Mg2+ concentrations (8Pittman Y.R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 19457-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); hence GDP release by itself does not seem to be rate-limiting for protein elongation. However, as the rate constants of all other steps are unknown, it cannot be excluded that some other step of nucleotide exchange, e.g. formation of the eEF1A·GDP·eEF1B complex or binding of GTP to the eEF1A·eEF1B complex, is rate-limiting. Like prokaryotic EF-Tu, yeast eEF1A is able to bind aa-tRNA in a GTP-dependent manner and promote its binding to the mRNA-programmed 80S ribosome (15Richter D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). While the ternary complex from bacteria is very well-characterized from a biochemical (11Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V.

Structure. 1999; 7: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) point of view, the available information about the corresponding eukaryotic eEF1A·GTP·aa-tRNA complex is more sparse and divergent. Notably, the existence of non-canonical mammalian eEF1A·GDP complexes with deacylated tRNA was suggested (21Petrushenko Z.M. Budkevich T.V. Shalak V.F. Negrutskii B.S. El'skaya A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4811-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of the latter complex was estimated to 20 nm (21Petrushenko Z.M. Budkevich T.V. Shalak V.F. Negrutskii B.S. El'skaya A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4811-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a value which is comparable to that of canonical EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA, and 1000 times lower than the Kd of the EF-Tu·GDP·aa-tRNA complex (16Dell V.A. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we report the rate and equilibrium affinity constants of interactions among eEF1A, eEF1Bα, GDP, or GTP, and aa-tRNA, as determined by stopped-flow kinetics. Nucleotide binding/dissociation was studied using fluorescent derivatives of GDP/GTP, mant-GDP/GTP, which were shown to closely mimic unmodified guanine nucleotides in their interactions with eEF1A (8Pittman Y.R.

The binding of eEF1A to eEF1Bα was monitored by fluorescence changes of intrinsic Trp residues. Binding of aa-tRNA to eEF1A was monitored using a fluorescence reporter group in Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17). The combination of these observables allowed us to solve the kinetic mechanism of nucleotide exchange in eEF1A and of aa-tRNA binding to the factor, and to estimate the effective rate of the reactions at the concentrations of components prevailing in the cell. Biochemical Methods—eEF1A was purified as described (22Pedersen L. Andersen G.R. Knudsen C.R. Kinzy T.G. Nyborg J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Protein concentrations were determined both colorimetrically (Bradford Assay, Bio-Rad) and by absorbance measurements at 205, 210, and 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient (280 nm) of 44,920 m–1 cm–1 for eEF1A and 20,970 m–1 cm–1 for eEF1Bα (23Gasteiger E.

Aminoacylation was carried out with tRNAPhe(Prf16/17) (4 μm), purified yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (3% v/v), [14C]phenylalanine (30 μm), ATP (3 mm) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) for 15 min at 37 °C. The extent of aminoacylation was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and filtration through GF/C filters.

Fluorescence stopped-flow measurements were performed on a SX-18MV spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) at 20 °C, if not stated otherwise. The interaction between eEF1A and eEF1Bα was monitored by changes in tryptophan fluorescence (11Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Jameson D.M. Gratton E. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). eEF1A contains eight tryptophan residues of which six are located in the G domain of eEF1A. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 280 nm and measured after passing KV335 filters (Schott). To prepare the complexes of eEF1A with the fluorescent nucleotides mant-GTP or mant-GDP, the protein was preincubated with a 5-fold excess of the respective nucleotide; purification of complexes from unbound nucleotides was not possible because of dissociation of unstable eEF1A·nucleotide complexes during purification. The fluorescence of mant-GDP/GTP bound to eEF1A was excited via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from tryptophan (excitation wavelength, 280 nm) and measured after passing KV408 filters (Schott). Proflavin fluorescence was excited at 470 nm and measured after passing KV500 filter (Schott). Stopped-flow experiments were performed by rapidly mixing equal volumes (60 μl each) of the reactants and monitoring the time course of fluorescence change. Time courses depicted in the figures were obtained by averaging 5–10 individual transients. Data were evaluated by fitting to a single exponential function with a characteristic time constant (kapp), amplitude (A), and another variable for the final signal (F∞) according to the equation F = F∞ + A·exp(–kapp · t) where F is the fluorescence at time t. Where necessary, two exponential terms were used with two characteristic time constants (kapp1, kapp2), amplitudes (A, B), and another variable for the final signal (F∞) according to the equation F = F∞ + A·exp(–kapp1 · t) + B·exp(–kapp2 · t). Calculations were performed using Table-Curve software (Jandel Scientific) or Prism (Graphpad Software). Standard deviations were calculated using the same software. Equilibrium Titrations—To determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the eEF1A·eEF1Bα complex, titrations were carried out by adding increasing amounts of eEF1Bα to a fixed amount of eEF1A (0.1 μm). The increase of the tryptophan fluorescence of eEF1A upon complex formation was measured in a PTI fluorimeter (excitation at 280 nm, emission at 333 nm). As eEF1Bα contains three tryptophan residues, a control titration was carried out in the absence of eEF1A and the resulting fluorescence signal subtracted from the signal obtained in the presence of eEF1A. The measured fluorescence was corrected for dilution. Fluorescence titrations were evaluated as described in detail in (30Rodnina M.V. Pape T. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 646-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The affinity of mant-GTP/mant-GDP to eEF1A was measured at constant nucleotide concentration (0.01 μm) and increasing concentrations of eEF1A. Fluorescence emission at 448 nm was measured upon excitation at 355 nm. To determine the Kd values of the eEF1A·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe complex, a fixed amount of Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17) (0.01 μm) aminoacylated in situ (see above) was mixed with increasing amounts of eEF1A in the presence of GTP (2 mm). Fluorescence emission at 510 nm was measured upon excitation at 470 nm, and the data were treated as described above. Interactions of eEF1A with GDP and GTP—Interactions of GDP and GTP with eEF1A were studied as described before (11Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Wagner A. Simon I. Sprinzl M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12535-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using FRET from tryptophan residues in eEF1A to the mant group of mant-GDP or mant-GTP. The intrinsic GTPase activity of eEF1A was very low, <0.14 h–1; hence no appreciable conversion of GTP to GDP occurred during the experiments. Upon binding of labeled nucleotide, a 60% increase of mant fluorescence was observed. To determine association rate constants, a fixed concentration of nucleotide-free eEF1A was mixed with varying concentrations of fluorescent guanine nucleotides. The time curves obtained were described best by two-exponential fitting, resulting in apparent rate constants kapp1 and kapp2. Both kapp1 and kapp2 values increased with nucleotide concentration (Fig. 2B). In both cases, the concentration dependence deviated from the linear behavior expected for a second-order binding reaction. Rather, the kapp values saturated at high nucleotide concentration, suggesting that the observed fluorescence changes reported steps following the bimolecular binding step. The observed concentration dependence would be consistent with a reaction scheme A+B⇔C⇔D⇔E, where the bimolecular reaction A+B⇔C is too fast to be measured or does not result in an appreciable fluorescence change, while the first-order reactions C⇔D and D⇔E yield kapp1 and kapp2, respectively. However, the observed concentration dependence of kapp values would be equally consistent with eEF1A being heterogeneous. In such a case, a fraction of the protein would bind nucleotides faster and yield kapp1, while another fraction would be less active and give the lower kapp2; for both fractions, the kapp would reflect a monomolecular transition in the reaction scheme A+B⇔C⇔D. Because the two reaction mechanisms cannot be distinguished, and information about the second-order step is not available, the complete set of rate constants could not be calculated. Furthermore, attempts to fit the concentration dependences depicted in Fig. 2B using the values of k–1 and k–5, as well as the equilibrium dissociation constants determined below yielded satisfactory fits for both mechanisms. The values of the rate constants varied significantly depending on the assumed mechanism, and, as the mechanisms cannot be distinguished, are not reported here. Nevertheless, two qualitative statements can be made: (i) eEF1A binds to GDP and GTP in a very similar way, and (ii) structural rearrangements, rather than bimolecular binding steps, result in FRET changes. Nucleotide dissociation rate constants were determined upon mixing eEF1A·mant-GDP or eEF1A·mant-GTP with an excess unlabeled nucleotide. The release of the labeled nucleotide from the elongation factor resulted in a fluorescence decrease, and the time courses were single-exponential. Given the complicated nucleotide binding mechanism, the observation of a single dissociation step suggests that this step is rate-limiting in nucleotide release; hence we assigned the respective values to the effective rate constants of nucleotide dissociation, k–1 and k–5. From single-exponential fitting of the time courses of Fig. 2C, the following rate constants were obtained: k–1 = 0.13 ± 0.01 s–1 (GDP), k–5 = 0.10 ± 0.01 s–1 (GTP). Nucleotide binding affinities of eEF1A were determined by titrating mant-GTP or mant-GDP with increasing concentrations of eEF1A (“Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2D). From the hyperbolic fits, the values Kd = 0.4 ± 0.1 μm (GDP) and Kd = 1.1 ± 0.2 μm (GTP) were obtained. Because the detailed kinetic mechanism of nucleotide binding could not be determined, we made estimations for the effective constants of nucleotide association with eEF1A, assuming a single binding step. The resulting association rate constants were 3.3·105 m–1 s–1 (GDP) and 0.9·105 m–1 s–1 (GTP), which were assigned to the rate constants k1 and k5, respectively. Note that these rate constants, and probably also k–1 and k5, reflect effective rate constants that characterize the overall binding reaction where the individual equilibrium steps are grouped into one. Binding of eEF1Bα to eEF1A in the Absence of Nucleotides—The association of eEF1Bα with eEF1A was monitored by the increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3A). Because there are eight tryptophan residues in eEF1A and three in eEF1Bα, and probably only part of them exhibits a fluorescence change upon complex formation, the amplitude of the signal change was small, but reproducible, particularly when up to 10 individual transients were averaged. To calculate the association rate constant k2, time courses were measured at a fixed concentration of eEF1A and varying eEF1Bα concentrations. Apparent rate constants were determined by exponential fitting and plotted against the eEF1Bα concentration (Fig. 3B); from the slope of the linear plot k2 = (12 ± 2)·106 m–1 s–1 was determined, from the Y-axis intercept k–2 = 1.0 ± 0.8 s–1. To obtain a more precise estimation for k–2, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constant of eEF1A binding to eEF1Bα, and calculated k–2 from k2 and Kd. To determine Kd, a fixed amount of nucleotide-free eEF1A was titrated with eEF1Bα and tryptophan fluorescence was measured at equilibrium (Fig. 3C). Hyperbolic fitting resulted in a value of Kd = 0.16 ± 0.02 μm. Using these values, k–2 = 1.9 ± 0.4 s–1 was obtained, in agreement with the value estimated from kinetic experiments. Interactions of eEF1A with eEF1Bα in the Presence of GDP—Dissociation of the eEF1A·mant-GDP complex after binding of eEF1Bα was monitored by the decrease of FRET from tryptophan to mant-GDP. An excess of unlabeled GDP was included with eEF1Bα to prevent rebinding of mant-GDP. Time courses of dissociation at non-saturating eEF1Bα concentrations showed two exponential phases, a faster, which reflected the dissociation of mant-GDP from the eEF1A·mant-GDP·eEF1Bα complex, and a slower, caused by the spontaneous dissociation of the eEF1A·mant-GDP complex (Fig. 4A). The apparent rate constant of mant-GDP release from the eEF1A·mant-GDP·eEF1Bα complex exhibited a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of eEF1Bα (Fig. 4B). At low concentrations of eEF1Bα, the apparent rate constant of the dissociation of eEF1A·mant-GDP·eEF1Bα increased linearly with the concentration eEF1Bα (Fig. 4B, inset), indicating the concentration range where the binding of eEF1Bα to eEF1A·mant-GDP is rate-limiting. As rebinding of mant-GDP is negligible, the initial slope (modified from equation on p. 124 of Ref. 31Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999Google Scholar) is equal to k3/(1 + k–3/k–4) = 20 ± 2 μm–1 s–1, and k3 can be calculated when k–3 and k–4 are known. At higher concentration of eEF1Bα, the dissociation of GDP from the ternary complex becomes rate-limiting, and the apparent rate constant measured at saturation with eEF1Bα yields k–4 = 42 ± 1 s–1 (Fig. 4B). To determine k–3, a constant concentration of eEF1A·eEF1Bα complex was titrated with increasing concentrations of GDP and the dissociation of the binary complex detected by the decrease of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 4C). Apparent rate constants were estimated by single exponential fitting. The concentration dependence of the apparent rate constants was hyperbolic (Fig. 4D). At saturation, the dissociation of eEF1Bα is rate-limiting, thus k–3 can be determined directly, with k–3 = 117 ± 8s–1. The initial slope was equal to k4/(1 + k–4/k–3) = 3.3 ± 0.5 μm–1 s–1, as the binding of GDP to the binary complex was rate-limiting at low GDP concentrations (Fig. 4D, inset). With the known values for k–3 and k–4 and the initial slopes for both hyperbolic curves known, the values for k3 and k4 can be calculated, k3 = 7.5·107 m–1 s–1 and k4 = 4.5·106 m–1 s–1. Interactions of eEF1A with eEF1Bα in the Presence of GTP—The interaction of eEF1A with eEF1Bα in the presence of GTP was studied essentially in the same way as for GDP, except that the GTP solutions were preincubated with phosphoenol pyruvate and pyruvate kinase to convert any GDP present into GTP. Similarly to eEF1A·mant-GDP, the addition of eEF1Bα to eEF1A·mant-GTP resulted in a biphasic FRET decrease, with the first phase reflecting the dissociation of mant-GTP from the eEF1A·mantGTP·eEF1Bα complex, and the second reflecting the spontaneous eEF1A·mant-GTP dissociation (Fig. 5A). The dependence of the apparent rate constant of mant-GTP release on eEF1Bα concentration was hyperbolic (Fig. 5B). The rate constant of mant-GTP dissociation from the eEF1A·mantGTP·eEF1Bα determined from kapp at saturation was k–7 = 25 ± 1s–1; the initial part of the plot yielded k6/(1 + k–6/k–7) = 15 ± 1 μm–1 s–1 (Fig. 5B, inset). The dissociation of the eEF1A· eEF1Bα complex upon addition of GTP (Fig. 5C) was monitored by tryptophan fluorescence at varying GTP concentrations (Fig. 5D). The apparent rate constant of eEF1Bα release from eEF1A·mantGTP·eEF1Bα, as calculated by hyperbolic fitting of the concentration dependence of Fig. 5D, was k–6 = 130 ± 9s–1, and the slope of the initial part of the plot was k7/(1 + k–7/k–6) = 0.8 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1. From these values, the rate constants k6 = 9.0·107 m–1 s–1 and k7 = 1.0·106 m–1 s–1 were calculated. Comparison of the GDP and GTP Cycles—To test the consistency of the kinetic model, we compared the thermodynamic cycles of GDP and GTP exchange. As the binding of eEF1A to eEF1Bα is a step that is common to both GDP and GTP cycles, the same K2 value should arise regardless of how the value was calculated, as K2 = K5·K6/K7 or K2 = K1·K3/K4, and should be close to the measured K2 value (Fig. 3). Using the values in Fig. 7, identical K2 values, 0.07 μm, were calculated from the GDP and GTP cycles, which is within the statistical significance identical to the value calculated from the rate constants, 0.08 μm, and is similar to the measured Kd (0.16 μm) . aa-tRNA Binding—Association of aa-tRNA with eEF1A was measured utilizing the fluorescence change of yeast Phe-tRNAPhe containing a fluorescent dye, proflavin, at positions 16 or 17 in the D loop. Upon addition of eEF1A·GTP to Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf17/16), a decrease in fluorescence was observed (Fig. 6A). The apparent rate constants of association were determined by single-exponential fitting. The concentration dependence of kapp was not linear (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the fluorescence change reflected a rearrangement step following an initial rapid-equilibrium binding step, which was not accompanied by a fluorescence change. From hyperbolic fitting of the concentration dependence of kapp, a Kd1 value for the first step of 0.9 ± 0.3 μm was determined, and the forward rate constant of the second step was 5.7 ± 0.3 s–1; the value for the backward rate constant of the second step was very close to 0 (Y-axis intercept) and could not be determined with precision. The amplitudes of fluorescence changes did not change with eEF1A concentration, suggesting that the affinity of binding was <0.2 μm (the first concentration point measured). The lower limit for the bimolecular rate constant of aa-tRNA binding to eEF1A was estimated from the initial slope of the concentration dependence, about 2·106 m–1 s–1. To determine the overall affinity of Phe-tRNAPhe to eEF1A·GTP, equilibrium fluorescence titrations were performed with constant amounts of Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17) and varying eEF1A concentration (Fig. 6C). The Kd value for the eEF1A·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe complex was 3 ± 1 nm. Taking into account that the overall affinity of the two-step binding equilibrium is the product of the Kd values of each step, i.e. Kd = Kd1·k–2/k2, the k–2 value can be calculated using the values of Kd1 and k2 determined above, k–2 = 0.02 ± 0.01 s–1. It has been reported that eukaryotic eEF1A·GDP, unlike bacterial EF-Tu·GDP, can promote the binding of aa-tRNA to the mRNA-programmed ribosome, though to a s"
https://openalex.org/W2066780005,"Retinol dehydrogenase 12 (RDH12) is an NADP+-dependent oxidoreductase that in vitro catalyzes the reduction of all-trans-retinaldehyde to all-trans-retinol or the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde depending on substrate and cofactor availability. Recent studies have linked the mutations in RDH12 to severe early-onset autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy. The biochemical basis of photoreceptor cell death caused by mutations in RDH12 is not clear because the physiological role of RDH12 is not yet fully understood. Here we demonstrate that, although bi-directional in vitro, in living cells, RDH12 acts exclusively as a retinaldehyde reductase, shifting the retinoid homeostasis toward the increased levels of retinol and decreased levels of bioactive retinoic acid. The retinaldehyde reductase activity of RDH12 protects the cells from retinaldehyde-induced cell death, especially at high retinaldehyde concentrations, and this protective effect correlates with the lower levels of retinoic acid in RDH12-expressing cells. Disease-associated mutants of RDH12, T49M and I51N, exhibit significant residual activity in vitro, but are unable to control retinoic acid levels in the cells because of their dramatically reduced affinity for NADPH and much lower protein expression levels. These results suggest that RDH12 acts as a regulator of retinoic acid biosynthesis and protects photoreceptors against overproduction of retinoic acid from all-trans-retinaldehyde, which diffuses into the inner segments of photoreceptors from illuminated rhodopsin. These results provide a novel insight into the mechanism of retinal degeneration associated with mutations in RDH12 and are consistent with the observation that RDH12-null mice are highly susceptible to light-induced retinal apoptosis in cone and rod photoreceptors.

Vitamin A derivatives serve two different physiological functions: detection of light in vision and regulation of gene transcription during differentiation and development of cells and tissues. The first function is carried out by 11-cis-retinaldehyde, which serves as a visual chromophore (1Saari J.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar). Upon absorption of light, 11-cis-retinaldehyde covalently bound to rod and cone opsins is isomerized to all-trans-retinaldehyde (1Saari J.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar). All-trans-retinaldehyde dissociates from the opsin and is reduced in photoreceptors to all-trans-retinol, which is translocated to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and esterified to all-trans-retinyl esters. The resulting retinyl esters are isomerized and hydrolyzed to produce 11-cis-retinol. 11-cis-retinol is oxidized in RPE to 11-cis-retinaldehyde, which is then returned to photoreceptor cells. This sequence of events is known as the retinoid visual cycle and allows for regeneration of 11-cis-retinaldehyde for the next round of visual signal transduction. The function of vitamin A in gene transcription is mediated by retinoic acid, the activating ligand of nuclear transcription factors, retinoic acid receptors (2Mangelsdorf, D., Umesono, K., and Evans, R.

Retinoic acid is synthesized from retinol in two consecutive steps: the oxidation of retinol followed by the oxidation of retinaldehyde (17Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The first step, the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde is rate-limiting and determines the overall rate of retinoic acid biosynthesis. The levels of retinoic acid in tissues are tightly regulated, but the mechanisms underlying this regulation are not yet fully understood. Recently, mutations in one of the retinoid-active enzymes, human retinol dehydrogenase 12 (RDH12), 2The abbreviations used are: RDH12, retinol dehydrogenase 12; RalR1, retinaldehyde reductase 1; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Endo H, endoglycosidase H. have been genetically linked to the severe early-onset autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy (arRD) (18Janecke A.R.

To better understand the contribution of RDH12 to photoreceptor physiology, we investigated the role of RDH12 in retinoid metabolism of living cells and examined the effect of disease-associated mutations on RDH12 retinoid activity. The results of this study provide a new insight into the general mechanisms that regulate retinoic acid biosynthesis in the cells and suggest an underlying biochemical cause for retinal degeneration in patients carrying loss-of-function mutations in RDH12. Preparation of Anti-RDH12 Polyclonal Antiserum—Polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits against bacterially expressed RDH12 that lacked the N-terminal hydrophobic segment (amino acids 1–23). The vector for expression of truncated RDH12 was prepared as follows. The RDH12 cDNA in pET28a vector (22Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CTCATATGATCAGGAAGTTCTTTGCTGGTG-3′ (NdeI restriction site underlined) and 5′-GCGGATCCCTACTCCCACCGGATCCTAGAAGCT-3′ (BamHI restriction site underlined). The PCR product was gel-purified, cleaved with restriction endonucleases NdeI and BamHI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET19b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting construct encoded truncated RDH12 (amino acids 24–116) fused to the N-terminal His10 tag. Truncated RDH12 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against purified RDH12 was raised by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). The antiserum was affinity purified using RDH12 immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. At a 1:1,000 dilution, the purified antiserum detected less than 10 ng of RDH12 using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Freshly isolated Macaca mulatta retina was homogenized on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing aprotinin (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin-A (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 mm), EDTA (0.1 mm), benzamidine (5 mm), and dithiothreitol (1 mm). Microsomes were isolated from the post-12,000 × g supernatant by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 90 mm KH2PO4, 40 mm KCl, pH 7.4, and 20% glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay. Protein samples were separated by electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with a solution of 5% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with affinity purified anti-RDH12 polyclonal antiserum at a 1:1,000 dilution. RDH12 was detected by chemiluminescence using goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (at a 1:10,000 dilution). Western blot analysis of RDH12 expressed in HEK293 cells was carried out as described above except whole cell lysates were used for analysis after centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The blots were re-stained for β-actin using anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 1:5,000 dilution to control for protein loading. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) Treatment—Fifty micrograms of monkey retina microsomal protein were resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.5% SDS and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol. Protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the final concentration of 1 mm. One-half of the mixture was treated with 3 μl (15 units) of Endo H (Roche Applied Sciences, Mannheim, Germany), and the other half received 3 μl of the buffer. Both samples were incubated overnight at room temperature, then denatured with SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5 min at 94 °C and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Microsomal preparation of FLAG-tagged 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) expressed in Sf9 cells served as a positive control for deglycosylation by Endo H as described previously (25Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Construction of Eukaryotic Expression Vectors—The vector for expression of RDH12 in HEK293 cells was prepared by PCR-amplifying the RDH12 cDNA in pET28a vector (22Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V.

The resulting construct encoded human RDH12 protein as a fusion to the C-terminal His6 tag. To prepare the expression constructs for RDH12 mutants, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on wild-type RDH12 cDNA in pET28a vector (22Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using an ExSite PCR-based kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers used for mutagenesis are summarized in Table 1. The mutagenized cDNAs were released from pET28a by digestion with XbaI and NotI endonucleases and cloned into the respective sites of modified pVL1393 vector (22Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V.

Recombinant baculoviruses were produced by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with the transfer vectors and the linearized Sapphire Baculovirus DNA (Orbigen Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.TABLE 1Primers for mutagenesisRDH12 mutantsForward primersReverse primersT49M5′-ATGGGCATTGGCAAGGAGACG-3′5′-TTGGCGCCAGTGATCACCAC-3′I51N5′-CACGGGCAATGGCAAGGAGAC-3′5′-TTGGCGCCAGTGATCACCAC-3′L99I5′-ACATATCCGACACCAAATCTATCC-3′5′-CCAATTTCCGCACCAGCAC-3′H151D5′-GCGACTTCCTCCTCACCTACCT-3′5′-CCAGGTGGTTGACTCCCAG-3′S175P5′-CCCCGGTGGCTCACCACATTGG-3′5′-ACACATTAACCACCCGTGCA-3′Y226C5′-CTGCGCAGTGCACCCAGGCGT-3′5′-GTGGTGACCCCGGTGCCT-3′ Open table in a new tab For expression in HEK293 cells, the mutagenized RDH12 cDNAs in pET28a were PCR-amplified using primers 5′-TTGGAATTCATGCTGGTCACCTTGGGACTGC-3′ (forward primer, EcoRI site underlined) and 5′-GCTGGATCCGCAGCCGGATCTCAGTGGTG-3′ (reverse primer, BamHI site underlined) to create the restriction sites matching those in pIRESneo vector. PCR products were digested with the corresponding restriction endonucleases, purified, and cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites in pIRESneo. Expression of RDH12 in HEK293 Cells and Enzyme Assays—HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% horse serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and transiently transfected with expression constructs for wild-type or mutant RDH12 in pIRESneo vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfecting the cells with an expression construct for β-galactosidase in pCMV vector and assaying β-galactosidase activity using o-nitrophenyl-d -galactopyranoside. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were incubated with either 5 μm all-trans-retinaldehyde or 10 μm all-trans-retinol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h or 24 h, respectively. Media and cells were collected separately under reduced light. Retinoids were extracted into hexane and separated by normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Waters Alliance Separation Module and 2996 Photodiode Array Detector. Peaks were identified by comparison to retention times of retinoid standards and evaluation of wavelength maxima and quantified as described previously (22Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purification and Characterization of Wild-type and Mutant RDH12—Expression and purification of His6-tagged RDH12 variants was carried out following the previously established protocol (22Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Specific activities of purified enzymes were determined using 6.5 μm all-trans-retinaldehyde and 1 mm NADPH. The apparent Km values for the reduction of all-trans-retinaldehyde were determined at 1 mm NADPH and six concentrations of all-trans-retinaldehyde (0.1–5 μm). The apparent Km values for cofactors were determined at a fixed saturating concentration of all-trans-retinaldehyde or all-trans-retinol and six concentrations of NADPH or NADP+ (1.25–1,000 μm). The amount of protein was varied between 0.035 μg and 0.175 μgso that the amount of the product did not exceed 10% of the substrate. Reaction rates were determined based on the percent substrate conversion as described previously (25Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Initial velocities (nmol/min of product formed per mg of protein) were obtained by non-linear regression analysis. Kinetic constants were calculated using GraFit (Erithacus Software Ltd., UK) and expressed as the means ± S.D. The results shown are representative of three to four experiments. MTT Assay—Cell viability was assessed using a modified MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (Sigma) assay (26Gerlier D. Thomasset N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 94: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells seeded in a 24-well plate were transfected with an empty pIRESneo vector or with RDH12/pIRESneo expression vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, fresh media (0.5 ml) containing various concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 30 μm) of all-trans-retinaldehyde (four-replicate wells for each concentration) was added. Cells were exposed to all-trans-retinaldehyde for 24 h. Medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT solution was added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The medium was decanted, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml dimethyl sulfoxide. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for several minutes, and 0.2 ml of the solubilized formazan solution was transferred to a 96-well plate. The absorbance was read at 595 nm using an ELISA plate reader. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the wild-type and mutant RDH12-transfected HEK293 cells using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc. Valencia, CA). RNA (8 μg of each sample) was subjected to 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-XL nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled RDH12 cDNA probe in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA bands were visualized by exposure to x-ray film at –80 °C with two intensifying screens for several hours. A cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cell Model for the Analysis of RDH12 Function in Retinoid Metabolism—In humans, RDH12 is expressed almost exclusively in the inner segments of photoreceptors (23Kurth I. Thompson D.A. Ruther K. Feathers K.L. Chrispell J.D. Schroth J. McHenry C.L. Schweizer M. Skosyrski S. Gal A. Hubner C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1370-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, there are no available immortalized photoreceptor cell lines. Thus, to investigate the role of RDH12 in retinoid metabolism, we created a cell model based on HEK293 cell line, which was shown to be an excellent choice for characterization of retinoid-active enzymes (27Chen Y. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 345-354PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the vector encoding RDH12 and the expression of RDH12 protein was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-RDH12 antiserum. Consistent with the previous reports (18Janecke A.R. Thompson D.A. Utermann G. Becker C. Hubner C.A. Schmid E. McHenry C.L. Nair A.R. Ruschendorf F. Heckenlively J. Wissinger B. Nurnberg P. Gal A.

Genet. 2005; 14: 3865-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), RDH12 was localized in the microsomal fraction. However, anti-RDH12 antibodies detected a single immunoreactive protein band of ∼35 kDa (data not shown). This was surprising, because RDH12 previously expressed in COS-7 cells exhibited three immunoreactive bands and appeared to be glycosylated on two endogenous N-glycosylation consensus motifs (172NVS, 297NKT) (18Janecke A.R. Thompson D.A. Utermann G. Becker C. Hubner C.A. Schmid E. McHenry C.L. Nair A.R. Ruschendorf F. Heckenlively J. Wissinger B. Nurnberg P. Gal A. Nat.

Genet. 2005; 14: 3865-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), implying that RDH12 localizes on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. To test whether RDH12 had the correct transmembrane orientation in our expression system, we examined the glycosylation state of the native RDH12. M. mulatta retina microsomes containing RDH12 protein were treated with Endo H and the electrophoretic mobility of RDH12 before and after the treatment was examined by Western blotting. As a positive control, we used recombinant 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which has three glycosylation consensus motifs and is known to be glycosylated (28Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the electrophoretic mobility of retina RDH12 did not change upon treatment with Endo H, consistent with the lack of glycosylation. The same result was obtained for Endo H treatment of recombinant human RDH12 expressed in HEK293 cells (data not shown). At the same time, 11β-HSD1 was efficiently deglycosylated (Fig. 1), as evidenced by the disappearance of the slower moving glycosylated forms of the protein. These results demonstrated that the lack of glycosylation of RDH12 expressed in HEK293 cells was not due to a deficiency in glycosylation capacity of the cells but, instead, accurately represented the state of the native protein. The lack of glycosylation suggested that RDH12 faces the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, like the closely related RalR1 (72% identity), which has two endogenous N-glycosylation consensus motifs (174NVS and 298NET) in positions similar to RDH12 and was shown not to be glycosylated (25Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicated that HEK293 cell model was appropriate for characterization of RDH12 activity. Role of RDH12 in Retinoid Metabolism—In vitro, RDH12 catalyzes the reduction of retinaldehyde to retinol or the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde depending on the substrate and cofactor availability. To determine whether the RDH12-catalyzed reaction is reversible in the cells, we incubated RDH12-transfected and mock-transfected cells with all-trans-retinaldehyde or all-trans-retinol. From all-trans-retinaldehyde, RDH12-transfected cells generated 2.2-fold less retinoic acid (p = 0.002) and 1.9-fold more retinol (p = 0.015) than mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). The amount of retinyl esters detected in RDH12-transfected cells was also greater than that in mock-transfected cells (720 ± 120 versus 500 ± 16 nmol/mg) (p < 0.05), consistent with the greater availability of retinol. These results indicated that RDH12 metabolized retinaldehyde to retinol, thereby decreasing the amount of retinaldehyde available for retinoic acid biosynthesis. The amount of retinoic acid produced from retinol was severalfold lower than that produced from retinaldehyde (Fig. 2B), consistent with the oxidation of retinol being the rate-limiting step in retinoic acid biosynthesis (17Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, the amount of retinoic acid was further decreased in the presence of RDH12 (2.1-fold, p = 0.0002), indicating that despite the excess of retinol, RDH12 again acted in the reductive direction and converted the retinaldehyde produced in the cells by endogenous retinol dehydrogenases back to retinol. The levels of retinyl esters in RDH12-transfected cells were 1.2-fold greater than in mock-transfected cells (p = 0.03) (Fig. 2B). Because ret"

However, this approach may conflict with state requirements concerning pretest counseling and informed consent for HIV testing. Our survey of state HIV testing laws demonstrates that the majority of states have HIV testing requirements that are inconsistent with the CDC's recommendations. Moreover, states that have recently amended their laws have not eased the requirements for pretest counseling and informed consent. The reasons for the persistence of these legal requirements must be understood to effect policy changes to increase HIV testing."
https://openalex.org/W2051452033,"Background Cell-cell communication is essential in tissue patterning. In early amphibian development, mesoderm is formed in the blastula-stage embryo through inductive interactions in which vegetal cells act on overlying equatorial cells. Members of the TGF-β family such as activin B, Vg1, derrière and Xenopus nodal-related proteins (Xnrs) are candidate mesoderm inducing factors, with further activity to induce endoderm of the vegetal region. TGF-β-like ligands, including BMP, are also responsible for patterning of germ layers. In addition, FGF signaling is essential for mesoderm formation whereas FGF signal inhibition has been implicated in endoderm induction. Clearly, several signaling pathways are coordinated to produce an appropriate developmental output; although intracellular crosstalk is known to integrate multiple pathways, relatively little is known about extracellular coordination. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show that Xenopus Tsukushi (X-TSK), a member of the secreted small leucine rich repeat proteoglycan (SLRP) family, is expressed in ectoderm, endoderm, and the organizer during early development. We have previously reported that X-TSK binds to and inhibits BMP signaling in cooperation with chordin. We now demonstrate two novel interactions: X-TSK binds to and inhibits signaling by FGF8b, in addition to binding to and enhancement of Xnr2 signaling. This signal integration by X-TSK at the extracellular level has an important role in germ layer formation and patterning. Vegetally localized X-TSK potentiates endoderm formation through coordination of BMP, FGF and Xnr2 signaling. In contrast, X-TSK inhibition of FGF-MAPK signaling blocks ventrolateral mesoderm formation, while BMP inhibition enhances organizer formation. These actions of X-TSK are reliant upon its expression in endoderm and dorsal mesoderm, with relative exclusion from ventrolateral mesoderm, in a pattern shaped by FGF signals. Conclusions/Significance Based on our observations, we propose a novel mechanism by which X-TSK refines the field of positional information by integration of multiple pathways in the extracellular space."

Developmentally, it is prominently expressed in fetal and neonatal hearts, but it is minimally expressed in normal adult heart. Conversely, we show in a rat model of myocardial infarction and in human dilated cardiomyopathy that pleiotrophin is markedly up-regulated. To elucidate the effects of pleiotrophin on cardiac contractile cells, we employed primary cultures of rat neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes. We show that pleiotrophin is released from cardiomyocytes in vitro in response to hypoxia and that the addition of recombinant pleiotrophin promotes caspase-mediated genomic DNA fragmentation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Functionally, it potentiates the apoptotic response of neonatal cardiomyocytes to hypoxic stress and to ultraviolet irradiation and of adult cardiomyocytes to hypoxia-reoxygenation. Moreover, UV-induced apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes can be partially inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous pleiotrophin. Mechanistically, pleiotrophin antagonizes IGF-1 associated Ser-473 phosphorylation of AKT/PKB, and it concomitantly decreases both BAD and GSK3β phosphorylation. Adenoviral expression of constitutively active AKT and lithium chloride-mediated inhibition of GSK3β reduce the potentiated programmed cell death elicited by pleiotrophin. These latter data indicate that pleiotrophin potentiates cardiomyocyte cell death, at least partially, through inhibition of AKT signaling. In conclusion, we have uncovered a novel function for pleiotrophin on heart cells following injury. It fosters cardiomyocyte programmed cell death in response to pro-apoptotic stress, which may be critical to myocardial injury repair.

Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2127-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts and epithelial and endothelial cells, PTN is mitogenic (3Tezuka K. Takeshita S. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M.

The pleiotropic functions of PTN are thought to be regulated primarily through autocrine/paracrine effects mediated through receptor-activated signaling (17Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T.

Binding to one of its five known receptors (receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ (RPTP β/ζ), anaplastic lymphoma kinase, syndecan-1, syndecan-3, and syndecan-4) has been shown to activate either the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling axes (16Bowden E.T.

Activation of the MAPK pathway by PTN inhibits programmed cell death in NIH3T3 cells, whereas activation of the PI3K pathway is generally believed to be protective. Both pathways may be required for or involved in the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells (16Bowden E.T. Stoica G.E. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35862-35868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In heart, the functions of PTN have not yet been elucidated. We previously showed that ptn is up-regulated early during the in vitro formation of cardiomyocytes (CMs) from pluripotent stem cells and that it is expressed in developing heart (23Anisimov S.V. Tarasov K.V. Riordon D. Wobus A.M. Boheler K.R. Mech. Dev. 2002; 202: 25-74Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In atrial natriuretic factor-null mice subjected to pressure overloaded, Wang et al. (24Wang D. Oparil S. Feng J.A. Li P. Perry G. Chen L.B. Dai M. John S.W. Chen Y.F. Hypertension. 2003; 42: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported that Ptn transcripts are significantly increased. Similarly, we showed that Ptn is increased and remains elevated in human hearts with left ventricle assist device despite a number of phenotypic shifts associated with left ventricle assist device support (25Margulies K.B. Matiwala S. Cornejo C. Olsen H. Craven W.A. Bednarik D. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that the accumulation of Ptn mRNAs is not directly regulated by hemodynamic overload. PTN does, however, seem to promote cardiac vascularization following ischemia (26Christman K.L. Fang Q. Yee M.S. Johnson K.R. Sievers R.E. Lee R.J. Biomaterials. 2005; 26: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and increase bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into mouse heart cells in vivo (27Chen H.W. Yu S.L. Chen W.J. Yang P.C.

These latter results led to the suggestion that injection of recombinant PTN might represent a potential therapeutic agent that could initiate new vessel formation in damaged myocardium, even though its effects on CMs have not been rigorously investigated. In this study, we have examined the role of PTN on contractile cells isolated from heart. Because PTN is believed to be a secreted growth factor with anti-apoptotic and proliferative activities, we tested the hypothesis that addition of PTN would promote CM growth (hypertrophy) and survival. We demonstrate, however, that PTN is released from CMs in response to cell stress and can potentiate CM apoptosis through inhibition of AKT signaling. Rodent and Human Tissue Samples—Hearts were obtained from rats at the ages indicated in the text according to an approved animal study protocol (019-KRB-RaMi) at the National Institute on Aging. Human ventricular myocardial samples were obtained from 18 male patients with severe heart failure secondary to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease and from 18 unused male donor hearts (25Margulies K.B. Matiwala S. Cornejo C. Olsen H. Craven W.A. Bednarik D. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28Boheler K.R. Volkova M. Morrell C. Garg R. Zhu Y. Margulies K. Seymour A.M. Lakatta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The average ages of the two groups were 50.2 ± 16.0 and 53.8 ± 19.1 years. Ten additional human samples, with an average age of 53.5 ± 11.2 years, were also obtained for ELISA from both male and female patients with heart failure. Rat Myocardial Infarction Model—Forty six male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Inc.), 8 weeks of age (body weight 257 ± 14.2 g), were housed and studied in accordance to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rats (Charles River Laboratories, Inc.) were divided into 2 groups, sham and myocardial infarction (MI). Surgical procedures were as described, and the average infarct size was consistent with our previous report (29Moon C. Krawczyk M. Ahn D. Ahmet I. Paik D. Lakatta E.G. Talan M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11612-11617Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Rat hearts were harvested 1 day, 1 week, and 4 weeks post-surgery (7–9 hearts/group/time point). Primary Cultures of Cardiomyocytes (CMs)—Neonatal ventricular cardiac myocytes (NNCMs) were cultivated as described (30Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) for 24 h, and switched to serum-free media for 18 h. Adult rat ventricular cardiac myocytes (ACMs) were plated (90–95% purity) and maintained in ACCT medium (32Communal C. Singh K. Pimentel D.R. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Neonatal rat heart fibroblasts were isolated after pre-plating and passaged 2 or 3 times prior to experimentation. Cells were exposed to human recombinant PTN (catalog number 450-15; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) as indicated. To induce apoptosis, NNCMs and ACMs were exposed to hypoxia for 24 and 2 h, respectively. ACMs were then re-exposed to ambient oxygen for 4.5 h. Cells were exposed to hypoxia in a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) by introduction of a mixed gas consisting of 95% N2 and 5% CO2. For irradiation, NNCMs were exposed to UV light after removal of the incubation medium. Cells were placed at a fixed distance under the UV lamps of a UV Stratalinker or similar device, and the exposure times were kept constant for each dose of 50–250 J/m2, depending on the experimental requirements. Media were then reapplied to the cells and incubated under standard cultivation conditions. For experiments involving PTN, hypoxia or irradiation was induced only after a 1-h pre-incubation with recombinant PTN or vehicle. Immunocytochemistry and Apoptosis—Myocyte and fibroblast cultures were examined by immunostaining (31Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against sarcomeric α-actinin (Sigma), cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), PTN (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and secondary antibodies conjugated with fluoro-350, -488, and -568 (Invitrogen) were employed. MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.) was used to determine cell surface area by two-dimensional planimetry (n = 4). Areas were normalized to the number of nuclei in sarcomeric α-actinin-positive cells. As a control for cardiac hypertrophy, cultured NNCMs were stimulated with 10 μm phenylephrine. Transverse sections of paraffin-embedded left ventricles from MI- and sham-operated animals were examined by immunostaining (see above). Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was employed using an in situ cell death detection kit with TMR Red (Roche Applied Science). TUNEL-positive nuclei and total nuclei were counted from peri-infarct and noninfarct regions. Data are expressed as a percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei to the total number of nuclei evaluated per section. Nuclear fragmentation was detected in live cells after addition of Hoechst 33342, whereas necrotic cells were excluded by co-staining with propidium iodide. For DNA laddering, genomic DNA was isolated, and laddering was detected following size fractionation on agarose gels. All measurements, in triplicate, were normalized to total cellular protein (31Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Real Time PCR, Western Blotting, and ELISA—Total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and PCRs were run in the presence of SYBR green (28Boheler K.R. Volkova M. Morrell C. Garg R. Zhu Y. Margulies K. Seymour A.M. Lakatta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The threshold cycle (Ct) of each sample was calculated, and normalized data are presented as a ΔCt (Ctreference gene - Ct) value, where Gapd was used as a reference. Primer sequences for real time quantitative PCR are shown in Table 1. Western blotting was performed with antibodies to PTN, phospho-AKT (Ser-473), phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9), and phospho-BAD (Ser-136) obtained from R & D Systems (PTN, Minneapolis, MN), Cell Signaling Technology (AKT and BAD, Beverly, MA), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (actin and GSK3). Protein signals were normalized to total protein loading following staining with Amido Black (Invitrogen), and phosphorylated proteins were also normalized to sarcomeric α-actin. The presence of PTN in the concentrated cell culture media (supernatants) was detected by Western blotting, following sample concentration using an Amicon Ultracel-5k centrifugal device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). For ELISA, tissue samples were incubated with capture antibody (catalog number AF-252-PB, R& D Systems., Minneapolis, MN). PTN was detected with a biotinylated pleiotrophin antibody (R & D Systems) and streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase (Invitrogen), followed by reaction with tetramethylbenzidine-H2O2 (Pierce). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm.TABLE 1Primers employed for real time quantitative PCRGeneForward primer (5′–3′)Reverse primer (5′–3′)Ptn (rat)gacctcaataccgccttgaaggcttggagatggtgacagtAtrial natriuretic factorgccagcttgagcatctggattctttctcctcgacgctggtaSyndecan-1aaagggaacccaactgctttgggtaagtgctatggcgtgtSyndecan-3accacggctgacataaggacgtgagggtactgctggggtaSyndecan-4ctgatcctgctgctggtgtatcatgcgtagaactcgttggAnaplastic lymphoma kinasectggccatgttggatcttctcgcggtggataaagtgatttRPTPttttccaggcaggtgttttctcagcttgcacattttctggGapd (rat)gccgagggcccactaaaccaggaaatgagcttcacaaagttPtn (human)cctccctgtcagggcgtaatgacggatgactcactggtctctttGapd (human)ccagcaagagcacaagaggaaatggtacatgacaaggtgcgg Open table in a new tab Adenovirus and Adenoviral Infection—A recombinant replication-defective adenovirus encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged constitutively activated AKT-1 and a control virus expressing no gene product (Ad/CMV/DEST-null) were constructed by recombination cloning from a plasmid encoding myr-AKT1-HA (gift of T. Francke, Columbia University) into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen) to generate pAd/CMV/DEST-myrAkt1-HA. The viruses were commercially amplified, purified, and titered (Vector Laboratories). CMs were infected with virus in serum-free media, and infectivity of pAd.CMV/DEST-myrAkt1-HA was determined by immunostaining with an antibody against the HA tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). RNA Interference of Ptn Expression—Post-transcriptional gene silencing was performed using chemically synthesized duplex RNA oligonucleotides against rat Ptn (catalog number LQ-092194-01, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Myocytes were placed in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) to which 100 nm siRNA was added along with the GeneSilencer reagent (GenLantis Corp., San Diego). Four hours later, cultivation media were added. Four siRNAs targeting Ptn transcripts were tested, but only two (siRNA2 and -4) were effective in pilot experiments. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. A Student's t test, Mann-Whitney test, or analysis of variance with repeated independent measurement was employed to determine statistical significance. p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. Correlation coefficients were determined using functions in Microsoft Excel. Pleiotrophin in Human and Rat Hearts—In heart, pleiotrophin gene (ptn) expression is dynamically and inversely regulated during development and in injury. During rodent development, pleiotrophin transcripts (Ptn) decrease by >36-fold (p < 0.05) between fetal (16–18 dpc) and adult stages (2–3 months of age) of development (Fig. 1A), and significant decreases in PTN proteins were observed in neonatal versus adult heart (ELISA, 0.89 ± 0.07 μg/g neonatal versus 0.33 ± 0.07 μg/g adult heart tissue; Fig. 1B). In nonfailing adult human myocardium, the low levels of Ptn decrease as a function of age; however, Ptn transcripts are significantly (p < 0.05) elevated by up to 70-fold in failing human myocardium relative to nonfailing controls. By ELISA, we furthermore determined that PTN proteins are present at 2.44 ± 0.70 μg/g in failing human hearts (Fig. 1B). This latter quantity is similar to that reported in human brain and gliomas, which have been reported to have some of the highest levels of PTN among adult human tissues (33Pufe T. Bartscher M. Petersen W. Tillmann B. Mentlein R. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In a rodent injury model of myocardial infarction (MI) induced by coronary ligation, ptn gene products were significantly elevated relative to controls (Fig. 1C). In these experiments, hearts had an average infarct size of 15–25%, but no significant change in left ventricle to body weight ratio could be demonstrated during the time frame examined (ratios: sham 2.56 ± 0.49 × 10−3 versus ligation 2.87 ± 0.31 × 10−3 for 1 week, n = 7; sham 2.25 ± 0.15 × 10−3 versus ligation 2.41 ± 0.16 × 10−3 for 4 weeks, n = 9). In sham-operated animals, PTN immunostaining was detectable in myocardium post-surgery, but following MI, robust PTN staining was observed in both infarcted and peri-infarct myocardium (Fig. 1D). Consistent with its known properties as a secreted cytokine, PTN immunostaining was observed primarily in pericellular regions; however, cellular staining was also detected. In infarcted myocardium, PTN immunostaining was generally limited to non-MHC-positive cells. In the peri-infarct myocardium, PTN signals were observed both in MHC-positive cells and in close proximity to TUNEL-positive cells. Neither TUNEL nor PTN immunostaining was readily observed in the adjacent viable myocardium (Fig. 1D). In the peri-infarct myocardium at 1 day post-MI, 35.6 ± 1.2% of the nuclei were TUNEL-positive, but at 1 and 4 weeks post-ligation, only 12.8 ± 4.9% (sham, 0.93 ± 0.76%) and 9.6 ± 3.6% (sham, 0.97 ± 0.86%) of the nuclei, respectively, were TUNEL-positive. Notably, only about 40% of the TUNEL-positive cells in this region were positive for PTN (Fig. 1D), and only a fraction (<30%) of these cells were cardiac MHC-positive. The majority of PTN-positive cells thus appear to be non-CMs. Although we cannot determine the primary source of PTN, which could be either resident cells or infiltrates of inflammatory cells present in damaged myocardium, its distribution demonstrates that PTN is elevated in the peri-infarct myocardium and is in close proximity to contractile cells. Recombinant PTN and Its Pro-apoptotic Effects on Cardiac Myocytes in Vitro—Similar to the results observed during development, isolated NNCMs contained significantly higher (>10-fold) levels of ptn gene products (RNA and protein) than ACMs (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, cardiac-derived fibroblasts (FBs) only contained <1 and ∼3% of the amount of PTN detected in NNCMs and ACMs, respectively. PTN immunostaining was also much stronger in freshly isolated NNCMs than in either ACMs or neonatal FBs (Fig. 2C). To ensure that the observed signals were specific for contractile cells, NNCM cultures were fixed and co-stained with both PTN and α-actinin, a sarcomeric protein specific for muscle cells (Fig. 2C, inset). In these experiments, contaminating FBs only comprised 4.8 ± 2% of the total number of cells in the primary NNCM cultures. Interestingly, PTN immunostaining was observed in NNCMs both in the cytoplasmic and nuclear regions of the cells (Fig. 2C), similar to reports showing co-localization of PTN with nuclear markers in neurons (34Taravini I.R. Ferrario J.E. Delbe J. Ginestet L. Debeir T. Courty J. Murer M.G. Gershanik O.S. Raisman-Vozari R. Brain Res. 2005; 1066: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Transcripts to all five known PTN receptors (RPTP β/ζ, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and syndecans -1, -3, and -4) were also present in hearts and in isolated CMs (Table 2), suggesting that PTN might be able to activate a signaling cascade in contractile cells.TABLE 2Presence of known PTN receptor transcripts in heart The transcript abundance of pleiotrophin and known PTN receptors were determined by real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (n = 3). ΔCt values are shown. Ct represents the amplification cycles where the growing fluorescence signal would reach the threshold setting. ΔCt is a normalized Ct value with respect to Gapd. Negative values in this table indicate that the transcripts were more prevalent (lower Ct value) than transcripts encoding Gapd. On average, a difference of 3–4 ΔCt units indicated a 10-fold difference in expression. Transcripts encoding RPTP were just detectable in heart, but those to syndecans 3 and 4 were relatively abundant in both whole heart and in NNCMs.Neonatal heartNeonatal cardiomyocytePtn–2.45 ± 0.044.34 ± 0.03Alk6.08 ± 0.237.67 ± 0.05RPTPβ/ζ6.77 ± 0.246.87 ± 0.05Syndecan-13.27 ± 0.032.84 ± 0.04Syndecan-3–1.02 ± 0.030.68 ± 0.04Syndecan-4–0.42 ± 0.23–1.11 ± 0.27 Open table in a new tab To determine whether exogenously added PTN could act as a growth factor to promote cellular hypertrophy or survival, recombinant PTN from 1 to 5 μg/ml was added to NNCM cultures, and cells were observed for 1 week. During this time frame, no change in cell morphology or spontaneous beating rate could be demonstrated at any dose, and no significant change in Anf transcript abundance was measured (-ΔCt, 6.41 ± 0.25 PTN-treated versus 6.61 ± 0.22 control). The cell surface area (%) of PTN-treated cells did not differ from that of vehicle-treated cells (98.9 ± 17.1% versus control, n = 4, p > 0.05), whereas phenylephrine led to a pronounced increase in cell size (Fig. 3A). However, we did observe an increase in the number of floating cells within 24 h of PTN addition, and some NNCMs began to display traits associated with cell death. In fact, the addition of PTN significantly increased the number of α-actinin-positive cells that contained condensed or fragmented nuclei (Fig. 3A). Apoptotic nuclei were observed in 8.1 ± 0.9 and 19.9 ± 2.0% of NNCMs at days 1 and 5, respectively, and in control experiments, a significantly smaller fraction of condensed or fragmented nuclei were observed (day 1, 2.94 ± 0.1%; day 5, 9.56 ± 2.1%, n = 4). DNA laddering with a pattern typical of caspase-mediated DNA fragmentation also increased as a function of time and PTN concentration (Fig. 3B). The minimum effective dose was 1 μg/ml at day 1, but even 50 ng/ml of PTN increased the amount of DNA laddering by day 5. This latter concentration is substantially less than that measured in vivo in both humans and rodent samples, and the effective dose was similar to the amount measured by ELISA in neonatal heart (∼0.94 μg/ml tissue volume). Importantly, the observed DNA laddering could be completely blocked by pretreatment with 40 μmol/liter benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (a pan-caspase inhibitor)"
https://openalex.org/W1980229289,"For plants dispersed by frugivores, spatial patterns of recruitment are primarily influenced by the spatial arrangement and characteristics of parent plants, the digestive characteristics, feeding behaviour and movement patterns of animal dispersers, and the structure of the habitat matrix. We used an individual-based, spatially-explicit framework to characterize seed dispersal and seedling fate in an endangered, insular plant-disperser system: the endemic shrub Daphne rodriguezii and its exclusive disperser, the endemic lizard Podarcis lilfordi. Plant recruitment kernels were chiefly determined by the disperser's patterns of space utilization (i.e. the lizard's displacement kernels), the position of the various plant individuals in relation to them, and habitat structure (vegetation cover vs. bare soil). In contrast to our expectations, seed gut-passage rate and its effects on germination, and lizard speed-of-movement, habitat choice and activity rhythm were of minor importance. Predicted plant recruitment kernels were strongly anisotropic and fine-grained, preventing their description using one-dimensional, frequency-distance curves. We found a general trade-off between recruitment probability and dispersal distance; however, optimal recruitment sites were not necessarily associated to sites of maximal adult-plant density. Conservation efforts aimed at enhancing the regeneration of endangered plant-disperser systems may gain in efficacy by manipulating the spatial distribution of dispersers (e.g. through the creation of refuges and feeding sites) to create areas favourable to plant recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2021773474,"Background Despite the rising interest in homeotic genes, little has been known about the course and pattern of evolution of homeotic traits across the mammalian radiation. An array of emerging and diversifying homeotic gradients revealed by this study appear to generate new body plans and drive evolution at a large scale. Methodology/Principal Findings This study identifies and evaluates a set of homeotic gradients across 250 extant and fossil mammalian species and their antecedents over a period of 220 million years. These traits are generally expressed as co-linear gradients along the body axis rather than as distinct segmental identities. Relative position or occurrence sequence vary independently and are subject to polarity reversal and mirroring. Five major gradient modification sets are identified: (1)–quantitative changes of primary segmental identity pattern that appeared at the origin of the tetrapods ; (2)–frame shift relation of costal and vertebral identity which diversifies from the time of amniote origins; (3)–duplication, mirroring, splitting and diversification of the neomorphic laminar process first commencing at the dawn of mammals; (4)–emergence of homologically variable lumbar lateral processes upon commencement of the radiation of therian mammals and ; (5)–inflexions and transpositions of the relative position of the horizontal septum of the body and the neuraxis at the emergence of various orders of therian mammals. Convergent functional changes under homeotic control include laminar articular engagement with septo-neural transposition and ventrally arrayed lumbar transverse process support systems. Conclusion/Significance Clusters of homeotic transformations mark the emergence point of mammals in the Triassic and the radiation of therians in the Cretaceous. A cluster of homeotic changes in the Miocene hominoid Morotopithecus that are still seen in humans supports establishment of a new “hominiform” clade and suggests a homeotic origin for the human upright body plan."
https://openalex.org/W2015957673,"The Cre/loxP-system has become the system of choice for the generation of conditional so-called knockout mouse strains, i.e. the tissue-specific disruption of expression of a certain target gene. We here report the loss of expression of Cre recombinase in a transgenic mouse strain with increasing number of generations. This eventually led to the complete abrogation of gene expression of the inserted Cre cDNA while still being detectable at the genomic level. Conversely, loss of Cre expression caused an incomplete or even complete lack of disruption for the protein under investigation. As Cre expression in the tissue of interest in most cases cannot be addressed in vivo during the course of a study, our findings implicate the possibility that individual tail-biopsy genotypes may not necessarily indicate the presence or absence of gene disruption. This indicates that sustained post hoc analyses in regards to efficacy of disruption for every single study group member may be required."
https://openalex.org/W2073285228,"In vertebrates, a key step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and steroid hormones is the conversion of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol. The enzyme that catalyzes this complex cyclization/rearrangement step via the protosteryl cation intermediate is lanosterol synthase ((S)-2,3-epoxysqualene mutase (cyclizing, lanosterol forming), EC 5.4.99.7). Because of the crucial role that lanosterol synthase plays in cholesterol biosynthesis, there is great interest in the identification of drugs that target this enzyme for anticholesteremic purposes. Although most studies on lanosterol synthase in the past have focused on the structural and biochemical functions of this enzyme, almost nothing is known concerning how the synthesis of lanosterol synthase is regulated. Here, we report that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) represses transcription from the lanosterol synthase promoter. Overexpression of HDAC3 decreases, whereas knockdown of HDAC3 by small interfering RNA increases, endogenous lanosterol synthase mRNA in cells. Similarly, in transient transfection assays, overexpression of HDAC3 decreases, whereas depletion of HDAC3 increases, expression of a reporter gene under the control of the lanosterol synthase promoter. Stable cell lines that overexpress HDAC3 show a decrease in lanosterol synthase mRNA and have lower cholesterol concentrations compared with parental cells. Extensive promoter analyses coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that the transcription factor YY1 binds to and recruits HDAC3 to the lanosterol synthase promoter. Together, our results demonstrate that HDAC3 represses the synthesis of a key regulatory enzyme and reveal a novel mechanism by which the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway can be regulated.

Cholesterol, cholesterol metabolites, and biosynthetic precursors of cholesterol play essential roles in cellular membrane physiology, dietary nutrient absorption, reproductive biology, stress responses, salt and water balance, and calcium metabolism (1Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although important for many normal cellular functions, cholesterol can have negative effects when it reaches excess concentrations, contributing to several diseases (2Simons K. Ehehalt R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), of which the most notable is atherosclerosis. Cellular cholesterol homeostasis is achieved by influx and efflux and intracellular transport as well as by regulation of cholesterol synthesis (3Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis is HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), 2The abbreviations used are: HMGR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatograph; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference. 2The abbreviations used are: HMGR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatograph; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference. and high cholesterol accelerates degradation of HMGR (4Ness G.C. Keller R.K. Pendleton L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14854-14857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another mechanism in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis involves the membrane-bound transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). The promoters of sterol-regulated genes contain a sterol response element. SREBPs are synthesized as transcriptionally inactive endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane proteins. At high cholesterol levels within the cell, SREBPs remain in the endoplasmic reticulum in association with two proteins, SCAP and Insig (5Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). A decrease in cholesterol levels causes a conformational change in the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP, leading to the dissociation of Insig and allowing SREBP-SCAP to reach the Golgi (6Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Two proteases in the Golgi release the active form of SREBP, which then translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of genes needed for lipid synthesis (7Osborne T.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 172-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hampton R.Y. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 298-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cholesterol molecule is synthesized from acetate in a series of ∼30 enzymatic reactions (for review, see Refs. 9Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 10Herman G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 75-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kelley R.I. Herman G.E. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2: 299-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The first sterol intermediate, lanosterol, is formed by the condensation of the 30-carbon isoprenoid squalene, and subsequent enzymatic reactions are designated as the post-squalene half of the pathway. Because lanosterol is the parental compound of all steroids in mammals, precise control of lanosterol synthesis has obvious biological and medical significance. Lanosterol synthase (EC 5.4.99.7; oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase; 2,3-epoxysqualene-lanosterol cyclase) catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol in the reaction that forms the sterol nucleus. The human lanosterol synthase gene encodes a 732-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 83 kDa (12Baker C.H. Matsuda S.P. Liu D.R. Corey E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The gene is located on chromosome 21q22.3 between marker D21S25 and 21qter (13Young M. Chen H. Lalioti M.D. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mutation in the lanosterol synthase gene causes cholesterol deficiency, which leads to cataractogenesis in Shumiya cataract rats (14Mori M. Li G. Abe I. Nakayama J. Guo Z. Sawashita J. Ugawa T. Nishizono S. Serikawa T. Higuchi K. Shumiya S. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two crystal structures of human lanosterol synthase have been reported (15Thoma R. Schulz-Gasch T. D'Arcy B. Benz J. Aebi J. Dehmlow H. Hennig M. Stihle M. Ruf A. Nature. 2004; 432: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of two (α/α) barrel domains that are connected by loops and three smaller β-structures. A large active-site cavity is located in the center of the molecule between the two domains. Because lanosterol synthase plays a central role in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other sterols, it is important to understand not only the structure and function of this enzyme but also its regulation. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl moieties from the ϵ-amino groups of conserved lysine residues in the N-terminal tail of histones. The removal of this modification strengthens histone-DNA interactions and may generate specific docking surfaces for proteins that regulate chromatin folding and/or transcription. Transcriptional repression of many eukaryotic genes can be attributed to histone deacetylation. Interestingly, results from numerous recent studies overwhelmingly support the prediction that HDACs not only play crucial roles in gene transcription but also most likely affect all eukaryotic biological processes that involve chromatin. In humans, HDACs are divided into three categories (for review, see Ref. 16Yang X.J. Seto E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); that is, the class I RPD3-like proteins (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8), the class II HDA1-like proteins (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9, and HDAC10), and the class III SIR2-like proteins (SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5, SIRT6, SIRT7). The class II enzymes can be further divided into two subclasses: IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9) and IIb (HDAC6 and HDAC10). HDAC11, the most recently discovered human HDAC, uniquely shares sequence homology with the catalytic domains of both class I and II HDAC enzymes. The class III proteins do not exhibit any sequence similarity to HDAC family members from class I or II and differ from other HDACs in that they require the cofactor NAD+ for activity. In this study using expression profiling to identify genes whose expression is potentially regulated by HDACs, we found that lanosterol synthase gene expression is activated by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A and repressed selectively by HDAC3. Furthermore, our data suggest that the transcription factor YY1 targets HDAC3 to the lanosterol synthase gene promoter and modifies the acetylation status of histones to repress lanosterol synthase expression. These findings confirm and extend the importance of HDACs in transcription regulation and present a potential novel mechanism by which lanosterol synthase and ultimately cholesterol synthesis can be regulated by HDAC3. Cell Cultures—HeLaS3 and HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. CHO cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. SRD-13A cells, kindly provided to us by Michael Brown, were cultured in the same media as described for CHO, supplemented with 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 50 μm sodium mevalonate, and 20 μm sodium oleate as described (17Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To establish stable cell lines, cells were cultured at 90% confluence in 6-well dishes and then transfected with 4 μgofa plasmid expressing FLAG-HDAC3 plus 200 ng of a plasmid that expresses Geneticin (G418) resistance. Control cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing FLAG-HDAC3 alone. One day later, cells were subcultured and grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After about 2 weeks, single G418-resistant colonies were obtained by serial dilution in 24-well dishes. Colonies then were maintained in a medium containing 200 μg/ml of G418 and analyzed individually for expression of FLAG-HDAC3. Microarray Analysis—Microarray analysis was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip instrument system following protocols established by Affymetrix, Inc. Total cellular RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA using an oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase recognition sequence, and the resulting double-stranded cDNA was transcribed into biotin-labeled cRNA using T7 RNA polymerase. Biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix human genome U133 Plus 2.0 array set, which contains ∼47,000 full-length human genes and EST clusters. Hybridized RNA was visualized by staining the biotinylated cRNA with streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin. Scanned chip images were analyzed using GeneChip algorithms. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 μg of the material was subjected to reverse transcription using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth of the cDNA generated was used as a template for each PCR reaction. Primers used were 5′-GGCAGACGTGGACCTACCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAAAGTGGGCCACCATAATC-3′ (antisense) for human lanosterol synthase and 5′-GCTCGTCGTCGACAACGGCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCT-3′ (antisense) for human β-actin. Signal intensities were obtained from ethidium bromide-stained gels and qualified using the ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). For mRNA analysis in CHO and SRD-13A cells, RNA was extracted using TriZol reagent (Qiagen), and cDNA was obtained with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Target mRNA was quantified using MyIQ single color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) and iQ SYBR green Supermix (BioRad). Lanosterol synthase primers (sense 5′-CCCTGAACTATGTGGCTCT-3′ and antisense 5′-ATAGGGTGTTGAGTCCTTCC-3′), HMG-CoA reductase primers (sense 5′-GACTGGATGAAGATGTGTCC-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGGAGACGTGATAGGATTT-3′), squalene epoxidase primers (sense 5′-TCCAGAGATGGAAGAAAGG-3′ and antisense 5′-TGTATATGATGGGCATTGAG-3′), mevalonate kinase primers (sense 5′-ATCGGTATTAAGCAGGTGTG-3′ and antisense 5′-GATTGCCAGGTACAGGTAGA-3′), and GAPDH primers (sense 5′-ATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTAC-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGATGCCTGCTTCACCAC-3′) were used for PCR amplification (cycling parameters: 95 °C for 3 min, 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s with 40 repetitions, 95 °C for 1 min). Single product amplification was confirmed by melting curve analysis, and primer efficiency was near 100% in all of the experiments performed. Quantification is expressed in arbitrary units, and target mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH expression using the method of Pfaffl (18Pfaffl, M. W. (2001) Nucleic Acids Res. (2001) 29, 2002–2007Google Scholar). Antibodies, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblottings—Anti-HDAC3 antibody has been described previously (19Wen Y.D. Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M. Krones A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Anti-YY1, anti-GAPDH, and anti-TFIIB were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-HMGR was purchased from Upstate/Millipore. Anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-hemagglutinin were purchased from Sigma. For immunoprecipitations, cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS and lysed with LBII (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). After 20 min of incubation at 4 °C with agitation, cell lysates were centrifuged 10 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatants were precleared with mouse IgG plus protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by overnight incubation with conjugated antibodies. Immunocomplexes were washed 4 times with LBII and once with LBIV (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 450 mm KCl, 2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), and immunoprecipitated proteins were removed by elution with excess FLAG peptide antigen. For immunoblotting, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with the appropriate antibodies, and proteins were visualized using the chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce). Plasmids—The 1.8-kilobase human lanosterol synthase promoter was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from HeLa cells with pfx (Invitrogen). The primers used for PCR were 5′-CCTAGCTTTGCCAGGTTCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCAGAGAGGCTCACCTCAAA-3′ (antisense). The PCR product (wild type promoter fragment) was subcloned into the pGL3Basic vector digested with SmaI to generate the plasmid pLS-Luc. All deletion mutants of the lanosterol synthase promoter were derived using pLS-Luc as a template, and the same antisense primer was used for cloning the wild type promoter. Mutant promoter fragments were subcloned into the pGL3Basic vector previously digested with SmaI. The sense primers used were the following: –468/+25′-CCAGCTGCCAGATGTCC-3′, –960/+25′-TCCTCTTCCCTCTGCTGCTA-3′, –1212/+25′-AGTTAGGCTGGGGGTAGGAA-3′, and –1545/+25′-AGTGCTTGGTGAGGCAGTTT-3′. The 444-bp human β-actin promoter was obtained by amplification with pfx (Invitrogen) from genomic DNA obtained from HeLa cells. The primers used for PCR were 5′-AGATCTCAGTGCCCAAGAGATGTCCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGCTTCAAAGGCGAGGCTCTGTGCT-3′ (antisense). The β-actin promoter then was subcloned into the pGL3Basic vector previously digested with BglII and HindIII to generate the pAct-Luc vector. Subsequently, different sections of the lanosterol synthase promoter were amplified using the pLS-Luc as a template and ligated into the pAct-Luc vector previously digested with SmaI. The primers used for this set of mutants were –468/+2 5′-CCAGCTGCCAGATGTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCAGAGAGGCTCACCTCAAA-3′ (antisense), –960/–468 5′-TCCTCTTCCCTCTGCTGCTGCTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AATTTGTGAGGAGGGTCCCAG-3′ (antisense), –1212/–912 5′-AGTTAGGCTGGGGGTAGGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCCCAGGAGAAATTAAAGG-3′ (antisense), –1545/–1195 5′-AGTGCTTGGTGAGGCAGTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCTACCCCCAGCCTAACTTC-3′ (antisense), –1800/–1307 5′-CCTAGCTTTGCCAGGTTCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCGGGGTTTTAGACAATCAA-3′ (antisense). pBS/U6-YY1 was constructed by inserting an oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 1095–1114 of YY1 cDNA (NM003403.3) (sense 5′-GGAGCAGAAGCAGGTGCAGAA-3′ and antisense 5′-AGCTTTCTGCACCTGCTTCTGCTCC-3′) into pBS/U6 vector. The second inverted sequence then was inserted into the intermediate plasmid to generate the final product. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression plasmids for class I and class II FLAG-HDACs (20Zhang X. Wharton W. Yuan Z. Tsai S.C. Olashaw N. Seto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5106-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), FLAG-HDAC3 deletions (21Yang W.M. Tsai S.C. Wen Y.D. Fejer G. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9447-9454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and FLAG-YY1 (22Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Seto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5979-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) were described previously. The plasmid that expresses siRNA for HDAC3 also has been described (20Zhang X. Wharton W. Yuan Z. Tsai S.C. Olashaw N. Seto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5106-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reporter assays, cells grown in 6-well dishes were harvested with 250 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Protein concentrations of all samples were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and the relative light unit values were measured in a luminometer using the luciferase kit from Promega. All assays were carried out in triplicate, and Western blots were performed to evaluate protein expressions. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays and Double-ChIP Assays—ChIP studies were performed as described (23Villagra A. Cruzat F. Carvallo L. Paredes R. Olate J. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Imbalzano A.N. Montecino M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22695-22706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with modifications. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cultures of HeLa, HD3.3, HepG2, and HD3.8 cells grown on 100-mm dishes were incubated for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) under gentle agitation. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 0.125 m glycine for 5 min. The cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS, scraped off in the same volume of PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 20 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The cell extract was collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors), and incubated for 10 min on ice. To reduce the length of the chromatin fragments to ∼500 bp (confirmed by electrophoretic analysis and PCR), the extract was sonicated using 20 10-s pulses at 5 watts with a 10-s rest between pulses. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at –80 °C. An aliquot was used for A260 measurements. Cross-linked extracts (6 units A260) were resuspended in a sonication buffer to a final volume of 500 μl. The samples were precleared by incubation with normal mouse IgG plus protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and immunoprecipitated with either an anti-FLAG agarose-conjugated (Sigma) or anti-HDAC3 antibody. The immunocomplexes (except from FLAG/agarose conjugates) were recovered with the addition of 30 μl of protein-A agarose beads and subsequent incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. The complexes were washed twice with sonication buffer, twice with sonication buffer plus 500 mm NaCl, twice with LiCl buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100), and twice with TE buffer (2 mm EDTA and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), with the solution incubated at each washing for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein-DNA complexes were eluted by incubation with 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3 and 1% SDS) for 15 min at 65 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and incubated with 10 μg of RNase A per ml for 1 h at 42 °C. NaCl was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 200 mm and incubated at 65 °C to reverse the cross-linking. The proteins were digested with 200 μg/ml of proteinase K for 2 h at 50 °C. The DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation using glycogen as a precipitation carrier. The primers used were the same used for cloning the segments of the lanosterol synthase promoter. For double-ChIP assays, the immunoprecipitated complexes obtained by the first ChIP were eluted by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in 25 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 20 times with sonication buffer and subjected to the ChIP procedure. Cellular Cholesterol Quantification—Cholesterol concentrations were determined using a previously published protocol (24Brown A. Dean R. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 320-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells were cultured up to 90% confluence in 100-mm dishes. Monolayers were washed with PBS, allowed to dry, then incubated in 200 μlof chloroform:methanol (2:1) solution containing 5 mm butyl hydroxytoluene and 10 mg/ml cholesteryl heptadecanoate and cholesteryl propyl ether as internal standards. Chloroform:methanol extracts were dried under nitrogen. Subsequently, free and total cholesterol were determined by high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) before and after saponification using methanolic KOH as previously described (24Brown A. Dean R. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 320-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dry extracts were reconstituted in 1.5 ml of acetonitrile by sonication (15 min) and filtered by Millipore 0.22-μm filters, and cholesterol and cholesteryl esters were separated using reverse phase HPLC at 35 °C on a C-18 column (Supelco) using an eluent of acetonitrile-isopropanol 30:70 (v/v) and 210-nm HPLC-diode array detection (Shimadzu SPD-M10Avp). The concentrations were calculated by integrating areas under the curve using proper sterol standards and corrected by internal standard area. Values are expressed as a ratio between the total cholesterol and total protein present in each sample. Detection of Metabolically Labeled Cholesterol—Thin-layer chromatographic detection of metabolically labeled lipids was performed as previously described (25Shenoy S.D. Spencer T.A. Mercer-Haines N.A. Abdolalipour M. Wurster W.L. Runge-Morris M. Kocarek T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1302-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with either a plasmid expressing HDAC3 or an empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated with 1 mm [2-14C]acetate for an additional 24 h and then harvested. Cell pellets were incubated with 2 ml of 40% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution and 2 ml of ethanol for 45 min at 80 °C and then brought to room temperature. After extraction with hexanes, the extracts were evaporated to dryness, resuspended in 100 μl of hexane-chloroform (70:30 v/v), and spotted onto a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate that was developed using petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:1). Authentic samples of cholesterol (10–100 μg) were spotted onto adjacent lanes, and migration positions were visualized by exposing the developed and dried plate to iodine vapor. The plate was then exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 6 days. Spots corresponding to cholesterol were scraped from plates into scintillation vials and quantified in a scintillation counter. Samples were normalized by protein concentrations from an aliquot saved before the organic extractions. Final values are expressed as pmol of [2-14C]cholesterol × h –1 × mg–1 of protein. For controls, fatty acid synthesis was measured as described (26Brown M. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, aqueous phases from first lipid extractions were acidified with HCl and then extracted three times with petroleum ether. Samples were evaporated, resuspended in chloroform, and then spotted onto a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate using heptane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (90/30/1) as solvent. Fatty acids (RF 0.30) were visualized by iodine vapor and quantified as described for [2-14C]cholesterol. HDAC3 Represses Lanosterol Synthase Expression—Initially, the goal of our study was to identify HDAC3-regulated genes that not only are repressed in response to overexpression of HDAC3 but also de-repressed in response to the knockdown of HDAC3 and activated by trichostatin A treatment (Fig. 1A). HDAC3 was overexpressed or knocked down by RNAi in HeLa cells, and expression profiles from these cells were obtained with microarray analyses. One of the genes repressed by HDAC3 encodes for lanosterol synthase (Fig. 1B; see the supplemental table, Affymetrix code 211018_at). As expected, treatment of cells with a general class I and class II HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A, resulted in the activation of lanosterol synthase. Similarly, knockdown of HDAC3 by siRNA resulted in an increase in lanosterol synthase expression. Interestingly, although HDAC3 can modulate expression of several different enzymes in the cholesterol synthetic pathway, it appeared that lanosterol synthase was uniquely down-regulated by HDAC3. In fact, with the exception of lanosterol synthase, all other genes encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol that we have examined were up-regulated by HDAC3 (Fig. 1C). To confirm that HDAC3 repressed expression of lanosterol synthase, reverse transcription-PCR was performed using mRNA derived from HeLa and HepG2 cells with either overexpression or knockdown of HDAC3. As shown in Fig. 1D, compared with mock-transfected control cells, lanosterol synthase mRNA decreased with HDAC3 overexpression and increased in the presence of RNAi for HDAC3. To study the mechanisms by which HDAC3 repressed lanosterol synthase, we isolated a human genomic DNA fragment containing 1.8 kilobases of the lanosterol synthase promoter. The cloned genomic DNA was inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter in pGL3Basic, and the resultant plasmid (pLS-Luc) was transfected into HeLa and HepG2 cells in the presence of expression plasmids for HDAC3. As shown in Fig. 2A, compared with mock-transfected control cells, overexpression of HDAC3 resul"

GCSs have been described in both Archaea and bacteria. They are generally assumed to bind O2 (and perhaps other gaseous ligands) and to transmit a conformational change signal through the transducer domain in response to fluctuating O2 levels. In this study, the heme-binding domain, AvGReg178, and the full protein, AvGReg of the Azotobacter vinelandii GCS, were cloned, expressed, and purified. After purification, the heme iron of AvGReg178 was found to bind O2. This form was stable over many hours. In contrast, the predominant presence of a bis-histidine coordinate heme in ferric AvGReg was revealed. Differences in the heme pocket structure were also observed for the deoxygenated ferrous state of these proteins. The spectra showed that the deoxygenated ferrous derivatives of AvGReg178 and AvGReg are characterized by a penta-coordinate and hexa-coordinate heme iron, respectively. O2 binding isotherms indicate that AvGReg178 and AvGReg show a high affinity for O2 with P50 values at 20 °C of 0.04 and 0.15 torr, respectively. Kinetics of CO binding indicate that AvGReg178 carbonylation conforms to a monophasic process, comparable with that of myoglobin, whereas AvGReg carbonylation conforms to a three-phasic reaction, as observed for several proteins with bis-histidine heme iron coordination. Besides sensing ligands, in vitro data suggest that AvGReg(178) may have a role in O2-mediated NO-detoxification, yielding metAvGReg(178) and nitrate.

Microorganisms often have at their disposal sensors that enable them to detect fluctuations in O2, CO, and NO levels and induce signal cascades as specific adaptive responses. Key regulators in this mechanism are the “heme-based sensors” (1Rodgers K.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Chan M.K. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Some well known examples of this class are the FixLJ system (8Rodgers K.R. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 963-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), EcDos (9Schmidt A.J. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), AxPDEA1 (10Chang A.L. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Volman G. Amikam D. Benziman M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3420-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), CooA (11Roberts G.P. Kerby R.L. Youn H. Conrad M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the HemATs (12Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A common feature of FixL, EcDos, and AxPDEA1 is the N-terminal heme-binding PAS (Per-ARNTSim) domain. In brief, the PAS folding consists of a set of α-helices (Cα, Dα, Eα, and Fα) and a network of five antiparallel β-strands (Aβ, Bβ, Gβ, Hβ, and Iβ) with the heme-linked proximal histidine (Fα 3 histidine) as the most conserved residue. PAS domains are characterized by a predominantly hydrophobic heme distal pocket (7Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). FixL, EcDos, and AxPDEA1 specifically sense changes in environmental O2 levels even though the response differs as a consequence of the different linked enzymatic domain(s). In FixL, a drop in O2 tension leads to activation of the kinase domain that catalyzes a phosphoryl transfer from ATP to FixJ. FixJ-P acts as a transcription factor that induces gene expression involved in nitrogen fixation (13Sousa E.H. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15359-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The signaling domains of AxPDEA1 and EcDos are very similar. This region includes two domains, the GGDEF (domain with the Gly-Gly-Asp-Glu-Phe motif) and the EAL domain (domain with a conserved Glu-Ala-Leu motif) (14Tal R. Wong H.C. Calhoon R. Gelfand D. Fear A.L. Volman G. Mayer R. Ross P. Amikam D. Weinhouse H. Cohen A. Sapir S. Ohana P. Benziman M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4416-4425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GGDEF domain catalyzes the formation of c-di-GMP 3The abbreviations used are: c-di-GMPcyclic diguanosine monophosphateGCS(s)globin-coupled sensor(s)HShigh spinLSlow spinMbmyoglobinNgbneuroglobinRRresonance RamanSVDsingular value decompositionAvGRegA. vinelandii GregAvGReg+open fast form of the full molecule AvGRegAvGReg#closed slow form of the full molecule AvGRegAvGReg178+open fast form of the heme-binding domain of AvGRegAvGReg178#closed slow form of the heme binding domain of AvGRegflavoHbflavohemoglobintrHbtruncated hemoglobinlegHbleghemoglobinDTTdithiothreitolTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycineCWcontinuous wave 3The abbreviations used are: c-di-GMPcyclic diguanosine monophosphateGCS(s)globin-coupled sensor(s)HShigh spinLSlow spinMbmyoglobinNgbneuroglobinRRresonance RamanSVDsingular value decompositionAvGRegA. vinelandii GregAvGReg+open fast form of the full molecule AvGRegAvGReg#closed slow form of the full molecule AvGRegAvGReg178+open fast form of the heme-binding domain of AvGRegAvGReg178#closed slow form of the heme binding domain of AvGRegflavoHbflavohemoglobintrHbtruncated hemoglobinlegHbleghemoglobinDTTdithiothreitolTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycineCWcontinuous wave from two molecules of GTP, whereas the EAL domain has phosphodiesterase activity and hydrolyzes c-di-GMP. In AxPDEA1, phosphodiesterase activity is observed under hypoxic conditions. Because of the degradation of c-di-GMP, which is an allosteric activator of cellulose synthase (15Amikam D. Benziman M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6649-6655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ross P. Mayer R. Benziman M. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 35-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cellulose is not produced. Recently, EcDos has also been found to function as a c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase (9Schmidt A.J. Ryjenkov D.A. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4774-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). A special heme-binding protein is CooA with its b-type heme. CooA is a CO-sensing transcription factor that governs the oxidation of CO to CO2 (11Roberts G.P. Kerby R.L. Youn H. Conrad M. J. Inorg.

As suggested by the name “GCS,” the sensor domain has a typical α-helical globin fold. Hou and co-workers (12Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W. Karatan E. Zimmer M. Ordal G.W. Alam M. Nature. 2000; 403: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) first reported that the sensor domain of the HemATs of Bacillus subtilis and Halobacterium salinarium shows myoglobin (Mb)-like absorption spectra and selectively binds O2. This selectivity is probably related to specific H-bonding between O2 and key amino acid residues (17Zhang W. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2801-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Yoshimura H. Yoshioka S. Kobayashi K. Ohta T. Uchida T. Kubo M. Kitagawa T. Aono S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8301-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The second domain consists of a methyl-accepting domain, which triggers the aerotactic response. In general, however, other functions are also hypothesized for the signaling domains of GCS. These domains may be involved in gene-regulating functions, in protein-protein interactions, or in yet unknown functions (19Freitas T.A. Hou S. Alam M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the characterization of the GCS of Azotobacter vinelandii (AvGReg). A. vinelandii is a free-living aerobic N2-fixing bacterium commonly found in soil, where CO and NO are typically found in trace amounts (20Conrad R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 609-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Soil is the most important biological sink for CO in nature. Although there is no evidence for metabolizing CO as a carbon source in A. vinelandii, Youn and co-workers (21Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1320-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) identified CooA homologues by searching the data base of diverse microorganisms. Additionally, NO is a naturally occurring soil component that is produced and consumed by diverse microorganisms. NO, which can diffuse out of the cell, is an intermediate of the denitrification cycle, converting nitrogen to dinitrogen and thereby completing the nitrogen cycle (22Ye R.W. Averill B.A. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AvGReg is a soluble heme-binding protein consisting of 472 amino acids. The globin domain contains 178 amino acids and is homologous to Mb (Fig. 1A, see also supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1). Based on sequence alignment, it has been proposed that the second domain of AvGReg is a GGDEF signaling domain of 170 amino acids (Fig. 1B, see also supplemental Table S2). As mentioned above, this GGDEF domain is predicted to be an enzyme in regulating second messenger levels (c-di-GMP formation) (14Tal R. Wong H.C. Calhoon R. Gelfand D. Fear A.L. Volman G. Mayer R.

Moreover, c-di-GMP not only regulates the expression of cellulose, as in AxPDEA1, but also stimulates the expression of adhesive curli and represses various modes of motility in Salmonella enterica (25Simm R. Morr M. Kader A. Nimtz M. Romling U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 26Romling U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1234-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of signal transduction of the AvGReg protein and its sensor domain (AvGReg178), both the spectroscopic and ligand (O2, CO, and NO) binding properties of these proteins have been investigated. Cloning and Expression of AvGReg178 and AvGReg—The A. vinelandii strain was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 12518). Genomic DNA was isolated using the GNOME DNA isolation kit (Qbiogene, Morgan Irvine, CA). The gene fragments of AvGReg178 (codons 1–178) and AvGReg (codons 1–472) were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector and then subcloned into pET3a. Expression of both proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS was performed as described previously (27Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Purification of AvGReg178—Harvesting of the cells and purification of AvGReg178 were mainly based on a procedure described previously (28Geuens E. Brouns I. Flamez D. Dewilde S. Timmermans J.P. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The expressed protein was purified from inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were boiled for 5 min in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 m guanidine-HCl, 72 mm DTT, centrifuged (10,700 × g, 20 min at 4 °C), refolded by adding a 1.4 m excess of hemin, and dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 4 °C. Final purification was performed by gel filtration using a Sephacryl S200 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA. The fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and concentrated. The samples were stored at–20 °C. Purification of AvGReg—E. coli cells were harvested as described (27Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were then exposed to three freeze-thaw steps and were sonicated until completely lysed. Inclusion bodies were washed two times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 2% sodium deoxycholate, washed once with pure water, and solubilized by incubation in 6 m guanidine-HCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 72 mm DTT at a concentration of 100 mg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation (10,700 × g, 20 min., 4 °C), AvGReg was refolded by adding a 1.4 m excess of hemin. After an incubation time of 10 min at room temperature, the solution was diluted into 4 volumes of refolding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m KCl, 0.4 m arginine, 5 mm DTT, 2% glycine) and dialyzed against the refolding buffer at 4 °C (29Wright E. Serpersu E.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Final purification was performed as described for AvGReg178 and checked by SDS-PAGE. UV-visible Spectroscopy—Optical measurements were done with a Varian Cary-5 UV-visible near-infrared spectrophotometer. All UV-visible spectra were measured in the range from 200 to 800 nm. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Resonance Raman (RR) measurements were carried out on a Dilor XY-800 Raman scattering spectrometer consisting of a triple 800-mm spectrograph, operating in low dispersion mode and a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector. The spectra were recorded at room temperature. The excitation source was a Kr+ ion laser (Spectra Physics 2020) at 413.1 nm. The protein solution was stirred at 600 rpm to avoid local heating and photochemical decomposition in the laser beam. Five to 10 spectra (120–300-s recording time each) were acquired to allow the removal of cosmic ray spikes. This was done by eliminating the lowest and highest data points for each frequency value and averaging the remaining values. Laser powers in the range of 1–40 milliwatts were used, as specified in the figure legends (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Low frequency (A) and high frequency (ν4 region) (B) RR spectra of the carbonylated form of AvGReg 178, laser power 0. 5 milliwatt (trace a), AvGReg178, laser power 1 milliwatt (trace b), AvGReg, laser power 1 milliwatt (trace c), and AvGReg, laser power, 20 milliwatts (trace d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EPR Spectroscopy—The X-band continuous wave (CW)-EPR experiments were performed on a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer (microwave frequency 9.45 GHz) equipped with a gas flow cryogenic system, allowing operation from room temperature down to 2.5 K. The magnetic field was measured with a Bruker ER035M NMR gaussmeter. The CW-EPR spectra were recorded at 10 K, a microwave power of 2 milliwatts, a modulation amplitude of 1 millitesla, and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. The CW-EPR simulations were done with the EasySpin program, a Matlab toolbox developed for EPR simulations (30Stoll S. Schweiger A. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 178: 42-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar). Carbonylation of AvGReg178 and AvGReg—Ferrous deoxygenated AvGReg and AvGReg178 (final concentration, 2.0 × 10–6 to 6.0 × 10–6 m; 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was obtained by reduction of the ferric derivative with a slight excess of sodium dithionite (31Antonini E. Brunori M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 310: 309-316Google Scholar). The concentrations of ferrous penta-coordinate AvGReg178 and of hexa-coordinate AvGReg were estimated using the extinction coefficients of sperm whale Mb (penta-coordinate globin) and human neuroglobin (Ngb; hexa-coordinate globin), respectively (27Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol.

Kinetics of CO binding to AvGReg178 and AvGReg were determined by rapidly mixing the hemoprotein solution (final concentration, ∼3.0 × 10–6 m) with the CO solution (final concentration from 1.3 × 10–5 to 4.2 × 10–4 m), at pH 7.0 (0.1 m phosphate buffer) and T = 20.0 °C. The CO solution was prepared by keeping in a closed vessel distilled water under CO at p = 760.0 torr, anaerobically (T = 20.0 °C). The solubility of CO in water is 1.03 × 10–3 m at p = 760.0 torr and T = 20.0 °C (31Antonini E. Brunori M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 310: 309-316Google Scholar). Then different aliquots of the CO stock solution were added to the phosphate buffer solution (final concentration, 0.1 m; pH 7.0) to obtain CO solutions containing different ligand concentrations (final concentration, 1.3 × 10–5 m to 4.2 × 10–4 m). Kinetic progress curves were monitored between 390 and 500 nm (wavelength interval = 3 nm) using the rapid mixing SX.18MV stopped-flow apparatus equipped with the PDA.1 photodiode array accessory (Applied Photophysics, Salisbury, UK). Absorbance spectra were recorded between 3 ms and 100 s on a logarithmic time base. For each CO concentration, binding kinetics were collected (at least) in triplicate and averaged. Deoxygenation Kinetics of AvGReg178-O2 and AvGReg-O2—Kinetics of O2 dissociation from oxygenated AvGReg and AvGReg178 were obtained by mixing the deoxygenated hemoprotein solutions (final concentration 3.0 × 10–6 m), in the presence of sodium dithionite (final concentration 10 mg/ml), with oxygenated pH 7 phosphate buffer solution (final concentration 0.1 m). The reaction was recorded between 3 ms and 50 s on a logarithmic time scale and monitored between 390 and 500 nm (wavelength interval = 3 nm). Thermodynamics of AvGReg178 and AvGReg Oxygenation—O2 equilibrium experiments were carried out with both tonometric and thin layer optical methods (28Geuens E. Brouns I. Flamez D. Dewilde S. Timmermans J.P. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Wright E. Serpersu E.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the tonometric method, ferrous oxygenated AvGReg and AvGReg178 (final concentration, 1–3 × 10–6 m; 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was prepared by reducing the heme-Fe atom with sodium dithionite. The excess of dithionite and by-products was removed by passing the protein solution through a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in air with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 20.0 °C (31Antonini E. Brunori M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 310: 309-316Google Scholar). The enzymatic Metreducing system (32Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) was added to the protein solutions in the amounts detailed previously (33Fago A. Hundahl C. Dewilde S. Gilany K. Moens L. Weber R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44417-44426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). O2-binding curves were recorded at 20.0 °C by monitoring absorbance changes between 390 and 450 nm. In the thin layer optical method, ferric AvGReg and AvGReg178 samples were reduced under anaerobic conditions by dialysis against CO-equilibrated 50 mm Hepes buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, containing 2.0 mg/ml sodium dithionite, and 1.0 mg/ml DTT (33Fago A. Hundahl C. Dewilde S. Gilany K. Moens L. Weber R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44417-44426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and stored at–80 °C as the CO derivative. Samples were thawed shortly before measurements and kept on ice until needed. Oxygen equilibrium curves of 3-μl samples were recorded at 20.0 °C by monitoring absorbance at 436 nm using a thin layer equilibration chamber fed by cascaded Wösthoff gas mixing pumps that deliver a constant flow of precise mixtures of humidified air or O2 and ultrapure N2 (>99.998%) (34Weber R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The samples were dissolved in 0.1 m Hepes buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA at a protein concentration of 0.3 mm heme and contained the enzymatic Met-reducing system (32Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) in the amounts specified previously (33Fago A. Hundahl C. Dewilde S. Gilany K. Moens L. Weber R.E. J. Biol.

Before determination of oxygen equilibria, CO was removed from heme by repeated cycles of N2/O2 equilibration of the sample within the equilibration chamber until the absorbance remained constant. Denitrosylation of AvGReg-NO and AvGReg178-NO—The AvGReg-NO (final concentration, 2.2 × 10–6 m) and AvGReg178-NO solutions (final concentration, 1.9 × 10–6 m) were prepared by reductive nitrosylation, i.e. by keeping overnight the buffered ferric AvGReg and AvGReg178 solutions (final concentration, 4.4 × 10–6 m and 3.8 × 10–6 m, respectively) (pH 8.3, 5.0 × 10–2 m Tricine buffer) under purified NO (p = 760.0 mm Hg), at 10.0 °C, under anaerobic conditions. Note that reductive nitrosylation of ferric hemeproteins is facilitated at alkaline pH values. The gaseous NO was then gently pumped off, and the AvGReg-NO and AvGReg178-NO solutions were stored without gaseous phase (35Ascenzi, P., and Visca, P.

NO was purchased from Aldrich and purified by flowing through an NaOH column to remove acidic nitrogen oxides. The NO solution was prepared by keeping in a closed vessel the 5.0 × 10–2 m Tricine buffer solution (pH 8.3) under NO at p = 760.0 mm Hg, anaerobically (T = 20.0 °C). The solubility of NO in the aqueous buffered solution is 2.05 × 10–3 m, at p = 760.0 mm Hg and 20.0 °C (31Antonini E. Brunori M. Biochim. Biophys.

All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without purification unless stated. Values of the first-order rate constant for NO dissociation from AvGReg-NO and of AvGReg178-NO were obtained by mixing the AvGReg-NO or AvGReg178-NO (final concentration 2.2 × 10–6 m and 1.9 × 10–6 m, respectively) solution with the CO-dithionite (final concentration, 1.0 × 10–4 m to 5.0 × 10–4 m and 1.0 × 10–2 m, respectively) solution under anaerobic conditions, at pH 8.3 (5.0 × 10–2 m Tricine buffer) and T = 20.0 °C. No gaseous phase was present. Kinetics was monitored spectrophotometrically between 360 and 460 nm (37Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol.

NO-mediated Oxidation of AvGReg-O2 and AvGReg178-O2—Values of the pseudo-first-order rate constant for NO-mediated oxidation of AvGReg-O2 and AvGReg178-O2 were obtained by rapidly mixing the AvGReg-O2 or AvGReg178-O2 (final concentration 4.8 × 10–7 m and 4.7 × 10–7 m, respectively) solution with the NO (final concentration, 2.0 × 10–6 m to 1.6 × 10–5 m) solution, at pH 8.3 (5.0 × 10–2 m Tricine buffer) and T = 20.0 °C. The dead time of the SFM-400 rapid-mixing stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SAS, Claix, France) was 1.4 ms. No gaseous phase was present. Kinetics was monitored between 360 and 460 nm (35Ascenzi, P., and Visca, P. (2008) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Data Analysis—Data were analyzed with the program Matlab 6.1 (MathWorks, Inc., South Natick, MA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis. Data were fitted to Schemes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 using the program GEPASI 3.30 (38Mendes P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar, 39Mendes P. Trends Biochem.

Values of konCO and koffCO were obtained according to Equation 2, kobsCO=konCO×[CO]+koffCO(Eq. 2) From the dependence of the total amplitude of carbonylation kinetics (proportional to the molar fraction of carbonylated AvGReg178; YCO) on [CO], the value of the equilibrium constant for CO binding to AvGReg178 (i.e. KCO = koffCO/konCO) was obtained according to Equation 3, YCO=[CO]/(KCO+[CO])(Eq. 3) The time courses for CO binding to AvGReg could not be fitted with a single exponential, as from Equation 1a; therefore, progress curves have been fitted with the following multiexponential Equation 3, Sobs=St=∞±∑i=1i=nΔSi×exp(+ikobs×t)(Eq. 4) where different symbols have the same meaning as in Equation 1a. The best fitting has been obtained with n = 3; therefore, we can describe the CO binding process to AvGReg by three consecutive reversible reactions according to the minimum reaction mechanism depicted in Scheme 2 (41Trent III, J.T.

Primary infection normally occurs within the first few years of life and is usually asymptomatic, but if infection is delayed until adolescence or later ages, then it may present as infectious mononucleosis. Long term carriage of EBV has been implicated in the development of a number of other more serious disease states including B cell lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma (for review, see Refs. 1Murray P.G.

EBV has also been linked as a potential etiologic agent in the development of a number of autoimmune conditions including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis (5Gross A.J. Hochberg D. Rand W.M. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 173: 6599-6607Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 6Costenbader K.H. Karlson E.W. Arthritis Res.

EBV predominantly infects two major cell types: B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Generally, more is known about the mechanism of entry of EBV into B lymphocytes than into epithelial cells. Preferential binding to B-lymphocytes is primarily mediated by the binding of the EBV viral envelope protein gp350 to complement receptor type 2 (CR2/CD21) on the surface of B cells (8Moore M.D. DiScipio R.G.

Additional viral ligands have also been implicated in the attachment and invasion of cells by EBV independent of the gp350/CR2 and gp42/human leukocyte antigen II pathways. EBV has been demonstrated in vitro to infect CR2(-) cells, and gp350 knock-out mutant forms of EBV have also been shown to infect primary B-lymphocytes, lymphoid cell lines, and epithelial cell lines that are susceptible to wild-type EBV infection, albeit with a significantly reduced efficiency of infection (20Janz A.

Tanner J. Matsuo T. Thorley-Lawson D. Kezdy F. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 665-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been identified as the dominant protein in the extracellular virus envelope (22Johannsen E. Luftig M. Chase M.R. Weicksel S.

The N-terminal 470 residues of gp350 have been shown to be essential for the binding interaction with CR2 (14Tanner J. Whang Y. Sample J. Sears A. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4452-4464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, monoclonal antibodies generated against gp350 have been shown to effectively inhibit infectivity of peripheral B lymphocytes with EBV (23Thorley-Lawson D.A. Geilinger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5307-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and some forms of this protein have been shown to act successfully as a vaccine against EBV-associated diseases in animal models (24Jackman W.T. Mann K.A. Hoffman H.J. Spaete R.R. Vaccine. 1999; 17: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Mackett M. Cox C. Pepper SdV. Lees J.F. Naylor B.A. Wedderburn N. Arrand J.R. J. Med. Virol. 1996; 50: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the CR2 receptor binding domain of gp350 has recently been determined by x-ray crystallography (26Szakonyi G. Klein M.G. Hannan J.P. Young K.A. Ma R.Z. Asokan R. Holers V.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Three distinct domains were identified, each comprising an anti-parallel β-barrel structure and adjoined by two long linker regions, each of 11 amino acids. The domains are tightly packed against each other, forming a distinctive L-shaped arrangement that is almost uniformly glycosylated. Site-directed mutagenesis targeting one of the few glycan-free areas of gp350 has identified the CR2 binding site to be located within a negatively charged region of this molecule, with mutant forms of gp350 exhibiting diminished or negligible ability to bind CR2 (26Szakonyi G. Klein M.G. Hannan J.P. Young K.A. Ma R.Z. Asokan R. Holers V.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Convincing evidence that this is indeed the correct receptor binding site is provided by the fact that the mutations targeting the CR2 binding site also disrupt the ability of gp350 to recognize its major neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 72A1 mAb (26Szakonyi G. Klein M.G. Hannan J.P. Young K.A. Ma R.Z. Asokan R. Holers V.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Hoffman G. Sondra G.L. Hayward S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The epitope for 72A1 mAb within gp350 has been identified as one of the key areas involved in EBV gp350 binding to host cells because 72A1 mAb can successfully inhibit EBV binding and invasion of B-lymphocytes, Raji cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and T-cells (14Tanner J.

Also, a recent peptide mapping study by Urquiza et al. (31Urquiza M. Lopez R. Patino H. Rosas J.E. Patarroyo M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35598-35605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) has identified three gp350 regions that are involved in EBV binding to B-lymphocytes, two of which directly overlap with the CR2 binding site identified in the crystal structure of EBV gp350. CR2 is a ∼145-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein expressed mainly on B-lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, and some T-cell subtypes. On B-cells CR2 either forms part of a CR2/CD81/CD19 complex or is otherwise associated with CR1 and plays an essential role in cell activation and the initiation of normal immune responses to pathogens (32Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 126-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 33Ahearn J.M. Fearon D.T. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 34Dempsey P.W.

Immunol. 1997; 9: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interaction of foreign antigen that is coated by covalently attached C3d with CR2 results in a cell-signaling event occurring through CD19. This significantly lowers the signaling threshold for B-cell activation via a signal transduction cascade. CR2 also plays a critical role in the development of humoral immune responses to T-dependent antigens. Thus, CR2 acts as a bridge between the adaptive and innate immune systems (36Fearon D.T. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). CR2 is a member of the structural family of C3/C4 receptor and regulatory proteins known as the regulators of complement activation (RCA family). Members of this family are characterized by the presence of short repeating domains of ∼70 amino acids, known as SCR or CCP modules. Each of these compact units contains a number of conserved residues including four cysteines and an invariant tryptophan residue. The conserved cysteines form a pattern of disulfide bridges that connect Cys-1—Cys-3 and Cys-2—Cys-4. The modular composition of CR2 is well known and consists of a 15- or 16-SCR extracellular domain, a 24-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a short 34-amino acid intracellular C-terminal tail. In addition to EBV gp350, high affinity ligands for CR2 include the proteolytic fragments of complement component C3, C3d, C3dg, and iC3b (37Weis J.J. Tedder T.F. Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our data revealed that in addition to the CR2-C3d interface observed in the co-crystal structure, which involved only SCR2 of CR2, a number of positively charged residues on the SCR1 domain were also essential for a significant CR2-C3dg interaction to occur. Several of these residues had not been implicated in CR2-ligand binding by previous experimental studies, although a recent study utilizing theoretical electrostatic potential and apparent pKa calculations observed that the association between CR2 and C3d was dependent not only on the apparent CR2 SCR2-C3d interface observed in the structural elucidation but also on the overall respective net charges of CR2 SCR1-2 and C3d (51Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The binding interactions between CR2 and C3d and between CR2 and gp350 have previously been indicated to occur at overlapping binding sites (43Lowell C.A. Klickstein L.B. Carter R.H. Mitchell J.A.

However, a number of intriguing differences between these binding sites or the nature of the binding interaction between CR2 and these ligands must occur. Murine CR2 SCR1-2 shares a ∼61% sequence identity with human CR2 SCR1-2, and although murine CR2 can bind human C3d and iC3b with an equal affinity to the human form, it cannot bind EBV (43Lowell C.A.

Data reported by Martin et al. 52 and Prota et al. 53 have proposed that two areas on CR2 are critical in the binding interaction with EBV gp350. Substitutions among residues 8-15 within the first inter-cysteine region of SCR1 have suggested this area is a structural determinant in gp350 binding; murine CR2 contains a N-linked glycosylation site at position 66 within the linker region connecting SCR1 and SCR2, and this has been proposed to sterically inhibit the interaction between CR2 and EBV gp350. To gain a better understanding of the binding interaction between CR2 and its ligand EBV gp350 we have utilized a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and epitope mapping to determine those residues on CR2 that are likely to play a role in the adsorption of EBV to B-lymphocytes. Cloning and Expression of EBV gp350—EBV genomic DNA was extracted from previously obtained cell supernatants of the marmoset HB95-8 leukocyte cell-line (American type Culture Collection) using a QIAamp UltraSens virus kit (Qiagen). DNA corresponding to residues 1-470 of EBV gp350/220 was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-GCG GCC CAG CCG GCC GAG GCA GCC TTG CTT G-3′ (incorporating an Sfi site) and 5′-G ATA GTT TAG CGG CCG CAT TCT TAT GGT GGA TAC AGT GGG-3′ (incorporating a NotI site). In addition, a fragment of the Escherichia coli biotin carboxyl carrier protein corresponding to residues 70-156 was also PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-CGG GGG GCC CCC CAT GGA AGC GCC AGC AGC-3′ and 5′-CTG GGG CCC CTA CTC GAT CGA GAC CAG C-3′ both of which incorporate a DraII site for cloning. PCR fragments were ligated into the pSecTag2/Hygro B eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen), which encodes an Myc epitope and a hexahistidine tag at the 3′-end of the inserted DNA. cDNA for the gp350-biotin construct was sequenced by the University of Colorado Cancer Center Sequencing Core (Denver, CO) to confirm the insert was inframe with the plasmid DNA and also that it contained the designated sequences for the gp350 and biotin carboxyl carrier protein proteins outlined above. Plasmid DNA was subsequently transfected into human embryonic kidney 293f free-style cells (Invitrogen) for soluble expression of recombinant EBV gp350 into the media. The recombinant EBV gp350 was concentrated and concurrently exchanged into a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Ni2+ charged HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). Bound protein was eluted with a 0.5 m imidazole gradient, concentrated, and subsequently purified by gel filtration on a Hiload 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). After purification the EBV gp350 was biotinylated (EBV gp350-biotin) using biotin ligase (Avidity) according the manufacturer's instructions and then conjugated to Phycoerythrin-NeutrAvidin (Molecular Probes), generating fluorochrome tagged-gp350 monomers for flow cytometric binding analysis. Expression of Wild-type and Mutant Forms of Full-length CR2 on K562 Cells—Wild-type or mutant full-length rCR2 was expressed on human K562 erythroleukemia cells with the eukaryotic expression vector pSFFV-neo, as previously described (44Carel J.-C. Myones B.L. Fraier B. Holers V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12293-12299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Hannan J.P. Young K.A. Guthridge J.M. Asokan R. Szakonyi G. Chen X.S. Holers V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, CR2-expressing transfectants were incubated in the presence of biotinylated anti-CR2 HB5 mAb and then sorted using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal) to establish stable populations of cells with CR2 protein expression. Point mutations within the first two SCR domains of CR2 were carried out utilizing a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutated full-length CR2 cDNA was sequenced by the University of Colorado Cancer Center Sequencing Core (Denver, CO) and transfected into K562 human erythroleukemia cells for binding analysis by flow cytometry. Mutations were generated targeting: 1) Arg-83, a residue that plays a prominent role in the ligation of C3d to SCR2 of CR2 (R83A and R83E), 2) the OKB7 mAb epitope on SCR1 of CR2 (Pro-8—Ser-15) contained within the first intercysteine region of SCR1, specifically Asn-11, Arg-13, and Ser-15 (N11A, R13A, R13E, and S15P); Tyr-16 and Ser-32, which are in close spatial proximity to this Pro-8—Ser-15 region of SCR1, were also selected as candidates for substitution (Y16A and S32A); 3) the eight-residue linker region connecting SCR1 to SCR2 (residues 63-70); Tyr-64, Lys-67, and Tyr-68 were chosen from this region for site-directed mutagenesis (Y64A, K67A, K67E and Y68A); 4) a patch of conserved positively charged residues within SCR1 located outside the OKB7 epitope. In this case residues Arg-28, Arg-36, Lys-41, Lys-50, and Lys-57 were chosen for substitution analysis (R28A, R28E, R36A, R36E, K41A, K41E, K50A, K50E, K57A, and K57E). Expression of Wild-type, N11A, R13A, S15P, R28A, R36A, K41A, K57A, K67A, and R83A CR2 SCR1-2 Recombinant Proteins in E. coli—DNA corresponding to residues 1-133 of wild-type CR2 (SCR1-2) was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-CCG GAA TTC CGG ATT TCT TGT GGC TCT CCT-3′ incorporating an EcoRI site and 5′-CCC AAG CCT GGG TCA TCA CTC GAG AGG GAA AAC ACT-3′ incorporating two stop sequences and a HindIII site after the codon corresponding to residue 133. Resulting PCR fragments were ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pMAL-p2x (New England Biolabs) as previously described (26Szakonyi G. Klein M.G. Hannan J.P. Young K.A. Ma R.Z. Asokan R. Holers V.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which encodes a maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag at the 5′-end of the inserted DNA. This plasmid includes the malE gene with its signal sequence allowing the export of fusion proteins to the bacterial periplasm, facilitating folding and disulfide bond formation to take place. Plasmid DNA was subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21 cells, and wild-type recombinant MBP-CR2 SCR1-2 was produced as follows. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were used to start overnight cultures that were expanded to 1-3 liters and grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.3 was obtained. Cultures were induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 30 °C for 4 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Harvested pellets were resuspended in a column buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and then applied to an amylose resin column. Bound MBP-CR2 SCR1-2 was eluted from the column using column buffer containing 10 mm maltose. Finally, the MBP-CR2 SCR1-2 was purified by size exclusion chromatography using the protocol described above for EBV gp350. Recombinant N11A, R13A, S15P, R28A, R36A, K41A, K57A, K67A, and R83A CR2 SCR1-2 DNA was produced from wild-type MBP-CR2 SCR1-2 DNA utilizing a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA containing the mutant CR2 SCR1-2 insert was then transformed into E. coli BL21, and recombinant mutant CR2 SCR1-2 proteins were expressed and purified as per the protocol laid out for wild-type MBP-CR2 SCR1-2 above. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometric experiments were carried out using K562 erythroleukemia cells transfected with full-length wild-type or mutant human CR2. Binding analyses were carried out using gp350-biotin. For each condition, 5 × 105 human CR2-transfected K562 cells were first incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CR2 HB5 mAb at 1 μg/ml on ice for 1 h. The primary epitope for HB5 has been identified within the N-terminal SCR3-4 extracellular domains of CR2 and, accordingly, does not interfere with ligand binding. During this incubation 100 μl of gp350-biotin monomers in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide were prepared for each condition by adding the appropriate amount of recombinant gp350-biotin and 0.4 μg of PE-conjugated NeutrAvidin (Molecular Probes) and incubating at room temperature for 30 min. gp350-biotin concentrations used were 0.5g, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, and 0.03125 μg. After washing of the FITC-stained K562 cells, 100 μl of monomeric PE-conjugated gp350-biotin were added to each sample of cells and incubated for 30 min on ice. After washing, the cells were fixed and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry in the University of Colorado Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility (Denver, CO). Cells were divided into high, medium, and low CR2 expression using 101 as the lower limit and gating on the intermediate 18% of CR2 expressing cells (FITC-positive). Monomeric gp350-biotin binding was determined by PE mean channel fluorescence. A minimum of four separate experiments was carried out for each mutation. The whole cell populations and/or the normalized gp350-biotin binding data for each of the intermediate wild-type and mutant populations are given. Anti-CR2 mAb Inhibition of EBV gp350 Binding to Full-length CR2—Wild-type CR2-expressing cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-CR2 HB5 mAb at a concentration of 1 μg/ml on ice for 1 h. After this initial incubation, cells were washed, and 100 μl of PBS solution containing one of the anti-CR2 monoclonal antibodies, 171, 1048, or 629 mAb, was added to the cell mix at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml and allowed to stand on ice f"
https://openalex.org/W2093765865,"Hypomethylated CpG oligonucleotides (CpG) are not only potent adjuvants for enhancing adaptive immune responses but may also play a critical role in the development of autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Here we provide evidence that, in addition to dendritic cells, murine B lymphocytes also exhibit a type I IFN response to CpG-B. Unlike dendritic cells, B cell-mediated type I IFN induction depended on the transcription factor IRF3, but similar to dendritic cells this pathway was independent of the IRF3 kinase TBK1. Utilizing type I IFN receptor-deficient mice, we were able to demonstrate that this IFN pathway enhanced Syndecan-1 expression and IgM production and was required for IgG2a production following CpG-B stimulation. Overall, our findings identify a unique IFN pathway in B cells that may play a central role in mediating B cell biology in response to CpG, potentially implicating this pathway in autoantibody production and the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases."

H2O2 Treatment—H2O2 treatment was carried out 24 h after seeding by incubating cells in the culture medium containing H2O2 (0-200 μm) at 37 °C for 2 h. Protein Extraction—For whole cell lysates, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping. The cell pellets were lysed in cold precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% of Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, sodium deoxycholate) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The samples were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 rpm in 4 °C for 30 min). The cell supernatants were 100-fold concentrated with Amicon Ultra (30,000 NMWL; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein concentrations of each sample were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Western Analysis—Western analysis was performed as described previously (26Funasaka T. Hu H. Yanagawa T. Hogan V. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4236-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of the proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a 0.2-μm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Osmonics Inc., Minnetonka, MN) at 15 V, 30 mA overnight at 4 °C. Then the membrane was blocked with 0.1% casein solution in 0.2× phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The blocked membrane was incubated with primary antibody, and then secondary antibodies were conjugated with fluorophore (IRDye 800 antibodies (Rockland Immunochemical, Gilbertsville, PA) or Alexa-Fluor 680 antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)). The blots were visualized by using the LI-COR Bioscience Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Assay—The SA β-Gal activity was monitored using a senescence detection kit (Calbiochem), and cells were observed under an Olympus fluorescence microscope. MTT Assay—MTT assay was used to determine cell proliferation and viability. Briefly, 1 × 103 cells/well were plated in 96-well plates and cultured for different time periods indicated. At the end of the assay time period, 10 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After removing the medium completely, solubilizing solution (acidic isopropanol) was added at 100 μl/well. The plates were read at 570 nm on a spectrophotometric plate reader with a reference wavelength at 650 nm. Detection of ROS Production—Cells seeded on glass culture slides (Nalge Nunc International Co., Naperville, IL) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and loaded with 1 μm CM-H2DCFDA in phosphate-buffered saline for determining the intracellular ROS level, for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. Dichlorofluorescein-dependent fluorescence was analyzed in an Olympus fluorescence microscope using a X400 lens. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. or S.E. Comparisons between the groups was determined using unpaired t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PGI/AMF Knockdown Induces Cellular Senescence—To study the possible role of PGI/AMF in cellular senescence, we partially knocked down PGI/AMF in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells by gene silencing using siRNA duplexes derived from the human PGI/AMF sequence (Fig. 1A; complete silencing of PGI/AMF protein expression results in loss of viability). Transfection of anti-PGI/AMF siRNA markedly reduced the protein level of PGI/AMF in HT1080 cells (>50%), whereas the control siRNA did not affect the PGI/AMF protein level of expression (Fig. 1A). Cellular senescence is a cell-triggered program in response to a variety of stresses including oxidative stress such as exposure to H2O2, which induces premature cellular senescence (2Serrano M. Blasco M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 3Campisi J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 4Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar, 28Chen Q. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4130-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). To assess the knockdown effect of PGI/AMF on senescence, the cell transfectants were exposed to H2O2, and the senescence biomarker, SA β-gal activity, was measured. The SA β-gal activity was increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to treatment with H2O2, and HT1080 cells transfected with anti-PGI/AMF siRNA exhibited a higher rate of SA β-gal activity as compared with the control cells (Fig. 1B). siPGI/AMF cells showed about a 2-fold higher SA β-gal-positive cell formation than the control. Time course experiments revealed that SA β-gal-positive cell formation was detected in HT1080 cells within 4 days after exposure to 150 μm H2O2 and was highly increased in siPGI/AMF cells at all of the time points (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D shows an example of SA β-gal assay of 150 μm H2O2-induced senescent cells at day 8. Furthermore, the cellular response to H2O2 as measured by cell proliferation revealed that such a treatment lead to a dose-dependent retardation of cell growth, and the siPGI/AMF cells showed significantly lower growth rate and greater sensitivity to H2O2 than the controls (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with another clone of PGI/AMF knockdown cells (siPGI/AMF-2; supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Next, we examined whether the above results were limited to HT1080 cells or are a general phenomenon. Thus, we analyzed the breast cancer progression cell model that provides a unique tool for the investigation of molecular changes associated with progression of human breast cancer as it depicts early and late stages of human breast cancer, i.e. MCF10A cell (nontumorigenic), MCF10AT1 cell (tumorigenic), and DCIS.com cell (tumorigenic; locally invasive) (29Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dawson P.J. Wolman S.R. Tait L. Heppner G.H. Miller F.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 313-319PubMed Google Scholar, 31Miller F.R. Santner S.J. Tait L. Dawson P.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1185-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, we have detected a significantly lower expression of secreted PGI/AMF from MCF10A cells than from MCF10AT1 and/or DCIS.com cells (Fig. 3A) and found that the MCF10A cells were ∼2.5-fold more sensitive to oxidative stress that the counterpart cells (Fig. 3B). Next, using the PGI/AMF-siRNA technique, we found that both endogenous and exogenous expressions were suppressed in DCIS.com cells (Fig. 3C) associated with a 2-fold increase in SA β-gal-positive cells formation than the control, not only under oxidative stress condition but also under normal conditions (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, we checked the effect of PGI/AMF knockdown for cellular senescence in MCF10A cells (Fig. 3, E and F). In PGI/AMF knockdown MCF10A cells, a similar pattern was observed for oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence, but the differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that PGI/AMF involvement in the cellular senescence process is not cell type-specific, and exogenous PGI/AMF is required for regulating cellular senescence. The effect of PGI/AMF knockdown on cell cycle proteins expression under oxidative stress. Cellular senescence is the state of stable cell cycle arrest induced by oxidative stress, DNA damage, and oncogene activation and is thought to be a tumor suppressor mechanism (2Serrano M. Blasco M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 3Campisi J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 4Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular senescence in PGI/AMF knockdown tumor cells, we studied the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins and antioxidant proteins. As compared with the HT1080 control cells, p53 expression was significantly elevated in siPGI/AMF cells followed by induction of a target of p53, e.g. p21 (Fig. 4A). It is now well accepted that the enhanced activities of antioxidative enzymes, such as SOD, play an essential role in preventing the development of cancer (32Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1988; 84: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Safford S.E. Oberley T.D. Urano M. St Clair D.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4261-4265PubMed Google Scholar, 34Plymate S.R. Haugk K.H. Sprenger C.C. Nelson P.S. Tennant M.K. Zhang Y. Oberley L.W. Zhong W. Drivdahl R. Oberley T.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1024-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined their level in response to PGI/AMF down-regulation in HT1080 cells. The levels of both of CuZnSOD and MnSOD enzyme were increased about ∼2-fold in these cells as compared with the control cells (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the increased level of SODs, siPGI/AMF tumor cells exhibited a marked decrease of ROS generation (Fig. 4C), a factor known to stimulate cell proliferation and induce genetic instability, are elevated in cancer cells, and are eliminated from the cells by SOD (35Benhar M. Engelberg D. Levitzki A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Akt protein is involved in several regulatory pathways controlling cell proliferation and survival and is thought to play an important role during cancer progression (36Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5100) Google Scholar); thus, we have analyzed its expression. Although expression level was not changed in the siPGI/AMF cells as compared with control cells, its phosphorylation level was almost completely abolished (Fig. 4D). These results give credence to the prior results showing that overexpression of PGI/AMF in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts leads to accumulation of cellular phosphorylated Akt protein (24Tsutsumi S. Hogan V. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we tested the effect of down-regulation of PGI/AMF expression on the expression level of MDM2 protein, which is phosphorylated by Akt, inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53, and induces p53 degradation as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (36Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5100) Google Scholar, 37Gottlieb T.M. Leal J.F. Seger R. Taya Y. Oren M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, MDM2 protein was not decreased, but rather increased in siPGI/AMF cells (Fig. 4E), suggesting that up-regulated p53 by PGI/AMF knockdown may stimulate the expression of MDM2 (p53-MDM2 feedback loop; Ref. 37Gottlieb T.M. Leal J.F. Seger R. Taya Y. Oren M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To verify our proposed signaling pathway, PGI/AMF knockdown cells were transfected with siRNA specific to the SODs, which is the most upstream factor in our proposed pathway. Western blot analysis revealed that knockdown of SODs by siRNA down-regulated p53 and p21 protein expressions and up-regulated ROS and phosphorylated Akt levels, although SOD knockdown did not affect PGI/AMF and MDM2 expressions (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, suppression of MnSOD, not CuZnSOD, in PGI/AMF knockdown cells showed a significantly lower rate of cellular senescence as compared with the control siPGI/AMF cells (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that SOD is upstream factor of p21, and SOD expression, especially MnSOD expression, has an important role in oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence. We proceeded to explore the expression of p21 protein, a critical mediator of cellular senescence, and its expression level was markedly increased following treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 6). In addition, CuZnSOD and MnSOD protein levels were clearly induced by H2O2 treatment in both control and PGI/AMF knockdown cells (Fig. 6). The level of MnSOD was highly elevated by H2O2 treatment in siPGI/AMF cells, whereas CuZnSOD showed a slight increase in the H2O2-treated siPGI/AMF cells, and the same level of CuZnSOD expression was seen in both treatment groups (Fig. 6). Because the level of p21 expression was correlated with that of MnSOD level, we suggest that PGI/AMF knockdown increases sensitivity to oxidative stress. Effect of PGI/AMF Inhibitor on Cellular Senescence—Because PGI/AMF can be neutralized by specific inhibitor carbohydrate phosphates that inhibit both enzymatic and cytokine activities (10Watanabe H. Takehana K. Date M. Shinozaki T. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2960-2963PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tanaka N. Haga A. Uemura H. Akiyama H. Funasaka T. Nagase H. Raz A. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we examined whether carbohydrate phosphates could induce cellular senescence in HT1080 cells. In the presence of the carbohydrate phosphate erythrose 4-phosphate, an increase in the number of SA β-gal-positive cells was observed following exposure to the H2O2 oxidative stress (Fig. 7A). Moreover, MnSOD and p21 expression levels were up-regulated by erythrose 4-phosphate treatment with H2O2 exposure (Fig. 7B). These results also support the notion that PGI/AMF expression/activity is involved in cellular senescence response to oxidative stress, and MnSOD is a downstream factor of PGI/AMF in oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence. PGI/AMF has been reported to regulate proliferation and survival of cells and prevent stress-induced apoptosis in tumor cells (24Tsutsumi S. Hogan V. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar, 26Funasaka T. Hu H. Yanagawa T. Hogan V. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4236-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Haga A. Funasaka T. Niinaka Y. Raz A. Nagase H. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here, we report that PGI/AMF knockdown induces cellular senescence in tumor cells in response to oxidative stress by investigating SA β-gal expression, a well known marker of cellular senescence. This is also supported by the observation that PGI/AMF inhibitor induces senescence in tumor cells under oxidative stress conditions. To study this phenomenon, we have used the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, which harbors wild-type p53 protein (39Tarunina M. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3165-3173PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type p53 is a tumor suppressor protein, is a transcription factor that activates the transcription of downstream effectors genes and affects cell cycle arrest at the G1 and G2 checkpoints in response to DNA damage. Among the p53-inducible genes, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is thought to be a critical mediator of cellular senescence (4Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar, 6Roninson I.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2705-2715PubMed Google Scholar, 40Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that down-regulation of PGI/AMF induces p21 expression in tumor cells and is markedly enhanced under oxidative stress conditions, suggesting that PGI/AMF is an important regulator in the senescence program through the p21 pathway. What signaling molecules are upstream of p21? The data indicate that SOD expression, especially that of MnSOD, is up-regulated by oxidative stress under conditions of insufficient expression of PGI/AMF, and therefore the generation of ROS is decreased because of the increase of its scavenger (35Benhar M. Engelberg D. Levitzki A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Reduction of ROS leads to a decrease in Akt activation (41Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 42Leonard S.S. Harris G.K. Shi X. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1921-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), resulting in up-regulation of p21 expression (36Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5100) Google Scholar, 43Zhou B.P. Hung M.C. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 62-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which promotes cellular senescence. In addition, it may be suggested that p53 initiates senescent growth arrest at least in part by inducing p21, and elevated p53 may induce MDM2 expression, which in turn binds p53 and promotes p53 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (36Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5100) Google Scholar, 37Gottlieb T.M. Leal J.F. Seger R. Taya Y. Oren M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, no simple mechanism regulates cellular senescence, and based on our data we suggest the pathway in Fig. 8. Many tumors exhibit strong suppressing function(s) on cellular antioxidant defense systems such as SOD, catalase, glutathione, etc., and one of the most effective intracellular enzymatic antioxidants is SOD. SOD exists in several isoforms in humans, and cytosolic CuZnSOD and mitochondrial MnSOD are two well known subtypes (44Landis G.N. Tower J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The activity of total SOD (CuZnSOD and MnSOD) has also been found to be reduced for certain tumor cells (32Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1988; 84: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cancers from a variety of cell types have been reported to exhibit decreased MnSOD activity (32Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1988; 84: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), overexpression of MnSOD leads to tumor growth retardation (45Behrend L. Henderson G. Zwacka R.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and elevated MnSOD activity is correlated with a loss of metastatic abilities of tumor cells (33Safford S.E. Oberley T.D. Urano M. St Clair D.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4261-4265PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is clear that MnSOD has tumor-suppressing activity, the mechanism of action is still unclear. At least one mechanism that MnSOD decreases tumor growth is by causing a delay at G0/G1 in the cell cycle (46Oberley L.W. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We show here that SOD expression could be induced under oxidative stress condition and was controlled by PGI/AMF. In addition the data show that ROS production was followed by Akt stimulation, and Akt-p21 signaling axis could be under the control of PGI/AMF, signifying that SOD-ROS-Akt-p21 pathway is an important tumor suppressor mechanism through cellular senescence, and PGI/AMF could be involved in the protection of tumor cells from the onset of senescence via SOD pathway. The development of cancer is initiated by a multiplicity of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Moreover, tumor cells need to escape normal cell barriers that limit proliferation. One of these barriers is cellular senescence considered to function as a powerful tumor suppressive mechanism, limiting the proliferative capacity of cells (3Campisi J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 4Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that signal mediators in the cellular senescence programs might or should be a novel target for cancer therapy/prevention. The data presented here strongly suggest that PGI/AMF could be one of such therapeutic targets. Previously we reported that overexpression of PGI/AMF in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts leads to a gain of tumorigenicity, whereas down-regulation of PGI/AMF in mesenchymal tumor cells leads to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition as reflected by lower proliferating and loss of tumorigenic properties in vitro and in vivo (24Tsutsumi S. Hogan V. Nabi I.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar, 26Funasaka T. Hu H. Yanagawa T. Hogan V. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4236-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the data signify that PGI/AMF plays a regulatory role in the control of cellular senescence and suggest that cellular senescence by oxidative stress is induced, in part, via the PGI/AMF pathway, and that the function of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor during senescence is PGI/AMF-dependent. The data presented here provide a novel insight not previously described on the understanding of cellular senescence, suggest a novel therapeutic target, and underscore the role of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis enzymes in the pathobiology of the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2114144721,"The positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb is a pivotal regulator of gene expression in higher cells. Originally identified in Drosophila, attention was drawn to human P-TEFb by the discovery of its role as an essential cofactor for HIV-1 transcription. It is recruited to HIV transcription complexes by the viral transactivator Tat, and to cellular transcription complexes by a plethora of transcription factors. P-TEFb activity is negatively regulated by sequestration in a complex with the HEXIM proteins and 7SK RNA. The mechanism of P-TEFb release from the inhibitory complex is not known. We report that P-TEFb-dependent transcription from the HIV promoter can be stimulated by the mRNA encoding HIC, the human I-mfa domain-containing protein. The 3'-untranslated region of HIC mRNA is necessary and sufficient for this action. It forms complexes with P-TEFb and displaces 7SK RNA from the inhibitory complex in cells and cell extracts. A 314-nucleotide sequence near the 3' end of HIC mRNA has full activity and contains a predicted structure resembling the 3'-terminal hairpin of 7SK that is critical for P-TEFb binding. This represents the first example of a cellular mRNA that can regulate transcription via P-TEFb. Our findings offer a rationale for 7SK being an RNA transcriptional regulator and suggest a practical means for enhancing gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1981481372,"Background Some cancers are mediated by an interplay between tissue damage, pathogens and localised innate immune responses, but the mechanisms that underlie these linkages are only beginning to be unravelled. Methods and Principal Findings Here we identify a strong signature of adaptive evolution on the DNA sequence of the mammalian stress response gene SEP53, a member of the epidermal differentiation complex fused-gene family known for its role in suppressing cancers. The SEP53 gene appears to have been subject to adaptive evolution of a type that is commonly (though not exclusively) associated with coevolutionary arms races. A similar pattern of molecular evolution was not evident in the p53 cancer-suppressing gene. Conclusions Our data thus raises the possibility that SEP53 is a component of the mucosal/epithelial innate immune response engaged in an ongoing interaction with a pathogen. Although the pathogenic stress mediating adaptive evolution of SEP53 is not known, there are a number of well-known candidates, in particular viruses with established links to carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2016494088,"Intranuclear inclusion bodies (IBs) are the histopathologic markers of multiple protein folding diseases. IB formation has been extensively studied using fluorescent fusion products of pathogenic polyglutamine (polyQ) expressing proteins. These studies have been informative in determining the cellular targets of expanded polyQ protein as well as the methods by which cells rid themselves of IBs. The experimental thrust has been to intervene in the process of polyQ aggregation in an attempt to alleviate cytotoxicity. However new data argues against the notion that polyQ aggregation and cytotoxicity are inextricably linked processes. We reasoned that changing the protein context of a disease causing polyQ protein could accelerate its precipitation as an IB, potentially reducing its cytotoxicity. Our experimental strategy simply exploited the fact that conjoined proteins influence each others folding and aggregation properties. We fused a full-length pathogenic ataxin-1 construct to fluorescent tags (GFP and DsRed1-E5) that exist at different oligomeric states. The spectral properties of the DsRed1-E5-ataxin-1 transfectants had the additional advantage of allowing us to correlate fluorochrome maturation with cytotoxicity. Each fusion protein expressed a distinct cytotoxicity and IB morphology. Flow cytometric analyses of transfectants expressing the greatest fluorescent signals revealed that the DsRed1-E5-ataxin-1 fusion was more toxic than GFP fused ataxin-1 (31.8+/-4.5% cell death versus 12.85+/-3%), although co-transfection with the GFP fusion inhibited maturation of the DsRed1-E5 fluorochrome and diminished the toxicity of the DsRed1-E5-ataxin-1 fusion. These data show that polyQ driven aggregation can be influenced by fusion partners to generate species with different toxic properties and provide new opportunities to study IB aggregation, maturation and lethality."
