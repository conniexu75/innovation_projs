We extended these observations by defining fumarate as an inhibitor of pyroptotic cell death. We found that dimethyl fumarate (DMF) delivered to cells or endogenous fumarate reacts with gasdermin D (GSDMD) at critical cysteine residues to form S-(2-succinyl)-cysteine. GSDMD succination prevents its interaction with caspases, limiting its processing, oligomerization, and capacity to induce cell death. In mice, the administration of DMF protects against lipopolysaccharide shock and alleviates familial Mediterranean fever and experimental autoimmune encephalitis by targeting GSDMD. Collectively, these findings identify GSDMD as a target of fumarate and reveal a mechanism of action for fumarate-based therapeutics that include DMF, for the treatment of multiple sclerosis."

Here we report the identification of MSA-2, an orally available non-nucleotide human STING agonist. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, subcutaneous and oral MSA-2 regimens were well tolerated and stimulated interferon-β secretion in tumors, induced tumor regression with durable antitumor immunity, and synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy. Experimental and theoretical analyses showed that MSA-2 exists as interconverting monomers and dimers in solution, but only dimers bind and activate STING. This model was validated by using synthetic covalent MSA-2 dimers, which were potent agonists. Cellular potency of MSA-2 increased upon extracellular acidification, which mimics the tumor microenvironment. These properties appear to underpin the favorable activity and tolerability profiles of effective systemic administration of MSA-2."

The context specificity of AHR target genes has so far impeded systematic investigation of AHR activity and its upstream enzymes across human cancers. A pan-tissue AHR signature, derived by natural language processing, revealed that across 32 tumor entities, interleukin-4-induced-1 (IL4I1) associates more frequently with AHR activity than IDO1 or TDO2, hitherto recognized as the main Trp-catabolic enzymes. IL4I1 activates the AHR through the generation of indole metabolites and kynurenic acid. It associates with reduced survival in glioma patients, promotes cancer cell motility, and suppresses adaptive immunity, thereby enhancing the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in mice. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) induces IDO1 and IL4I1. As IDO1 inhibitors do not block IL4I1, IL4I1 may explain the failure of clinical studies combining ICB with IDO1 inhibition. Taken together, IL4I1 blockade opens new avenues for cancer therapy.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that enables cells to adapt to changing conditions by sensing compounds from the environment, diet, microbiome, and cellular metabolism (Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019Rothhammer V.

Barroso A. et al.Control of tumor-associated macrophages and T cells in glioblastoma via AHR and CD39.Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Trp-catabolic enzymes (TCEs) thus represents a promising strategy to target both cancer cell malignancy and tumor-derived immunosuppression (Lemos et al., 2019Lemos H. Huang L.

Tryptophan metabolism as a common therapeutic target in cancer, neurodegeneration and beyond.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18: 379-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Small molecule inhibitors of IDO1 have entered clinical trials as an adjunct to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to concomitantly target these two immunosuppressive mechanisms (Lemos et al., 2019Lemos H. Huang L. Prendergast G.C. Mellor A.L. Immune control by amino acid catabolism during tumorigenesis and therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; Platten et al., 2019Platten M. Nollen E.A.A. Röhrig U.F. Fallarino F. Opitz C.A. Tryptophan metabolism as a common therapeutic target in cancer, neurodegeneration and beyond.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18: 379-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the first phase III clinical trial failed (Long et al., 2019Long G.V. Dummer R. Hamid O. Gajewski T.F. Caglevic C. Dalle S. Arance A. Carlino M.S. Grob J.J. Kim T.M. et al.Epacadostat plus pembrolizumab versus placebo plus pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma (ECHO-301/KEYNOTE-252): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind study.Lancet Oncol. 2019; 20: 1083-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). While this failure may in part be attributable to the lack of patient stratification based on IDO1 expression, it challenged our knowledge of Trp catabolism in cancer (Muller et al., 2019Muller A.J. Manfredi M.G. Zakharia Y. Prendergast G.C. Inhibiting IDO pathways to treat cancer: lessons from the ECHO-301 trial and beyond.Semin.

Drug Discov. 2019; 18: 379-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A molecular understanding of this disappointing result might reveal new opportunities for immunotherapy. We hypothesized that other pathways that activate AHR could constitute a resistance mechanism against IDO1 inhibitors. To identify new mediators of AHR activation in human tumors, a straightforward approach would be to assess the association of metabolic enzymes beyond IDO1 and TDO2 with the expression of AHR target genes. However, the context specificity of AHR target gene expression (Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019Rothhammer V. Quintana F.J. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor: an environmental sensor integrating immune responses in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which varies greatly across different tissues and ligands, impedes pan-cancer analysis of AHR activity. To meet this challenge, we developed an AHR signature that enables detection of AHR activity, irrespective of cell type or ligand. Toward the development of a pan-tissue AHR signature, we employed a combination of gene expression analysis and natural language processing (NLP) (Figure 1A). Building on studies investigating AHR-mediated transcription, we compiled gene expression data generated upon exposure of multiple cell types to AHR agonists or inhibitors (Table S1). Additionally, we included genes with AHR promotor binding sites (Plaisier et al., 2016Plaisier C.L. O’Brien S. Bernard B. Reynolds S. Simon Z. Toledo C.M. Ding Y. Reiss D.J. Paddison P.J. Baliga N.S. Causal Mechanistic Regulatory Network for Glioblastoma Deciphered Using Systems Genetics Network Analysis.Cell Syst. 2016; 3: 172-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In a complementary approach we used NLP to extract genes that are connected by a regulation event term with AHR from the biomedical literature. The intersection between the gene expression datasets and the NLP results yielded 166 genes (Table S2) regulated by AHR across diverse cell types and by different ligands. We refer to this gene set as the pan-tissue AHR signature. In support of our approach, the gene ontology groups enriched in the pan-tissue AHR signature represent the main functions modulated by AHR, including drug metabolism, motility, and immune modulation (Figure S1A; Table S3). We validated the AHR signature in datasets (Table S1) that had not been employed to generate the signature. These were comprised of different cell types (Figure 1B) treated with TCDD (Figures 1C and S1B–S1D; Table S4), the AHR inhibitors SR1 (Figures 1D and S1E; Table S4), or CH223191 (Figure S1F; Table S4), and the endogenous AHR agonists FICZ (Figures S1G and S1H; Table S4) or Kyn (Figure 1E; Table S4). We also analyzed select signature genes by qRT-PCR in U-87MG glioblastoma (GBM) cells upon AHR activation with TCDD, FICZ, or Kyn as well as ligand activation combined with AHR knockdown (Figures S1I–S1K). We found that the AHR signature detects AHR activity in response to multiple AHR ligands and across distinct cell types. Using the pan-tissue AHR signature, we next assessed whether the expression of IDO1 or TDO2 associated with AHR activity. Median separation of the 32 TCGA tumor types based on IDO1 or TDO2 expression showed that in most tumor entities, the AHR signature was enhanced in the group with high expression of either enzyme (Figure S2A). As the distributions of IDO1 and TDO2 overlapped, it was not possible to assess their relative contribution to the induction of the AHR signature. We therefore performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008Langfelder P. Horvath S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (5338) Google Scholar) across the 32 TCGA tumor entities to investigate if expression of IDO1 or TDO2 associates with AHR activity. WGCNA groups genes with similar co-expression patterns into modules. IDO1 and TDO2 were present in modules positively associated with AHR activity (AHR-associated modules, AAMs) in 23 of the 32 tumor types (Figure S2B). The absence of IDO1 and TDO2 from AAMs of 9 cancer types suggested that other enzymes activate AHR (Figure S2B). We therefore repeated the analysis including all 7 TCEs (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000Kanehisa M. Goto S. KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assess their relationship with AHR activity (Figures 1F and S3). The L-amino acid oxidase IL4I1 exhibited the highest incidence in AAMs. Thus, AHR activity in human tumors associates more strongly with IL4I1 than with any other TCE, including the two bona fide AHR activators IDO1 and TDO2. This was surprising, because IL4I1 is mainly recognized for catalyzing the oxidative deamination of phenylalanine (Phe) to phenylpyruvic acid (PP), while producing H2O2 and NH3 (Boulland et al., 2007Boulland M.L. Marquet J. Molinier-Frenkel V. Möller P. Guiter C. Lasoudris F. Copie-Bergman C. Baia M. Gaulard P. Leroy K. Castellano F.

IL4I1 protein was expressed in human GBM tissue (Figure 2A), suggesting GBM cells as a suitable model to investigate IL4I1. We used AHR-proficient (U-87MG) and AHR-deficient (U-251MG) GBM cells (Figure S4A) with low endogenous IL4I1 levels for ectopic expression of IL4I1 (Figures S4B–S4D) or downregulated it in cells with high endogenous IL4I1 (Figures S4E–S4G). Ectopic expression of IL4I1 enhanced its enzymatic activity (Figure S4D). In the AHR-proficient cells, IL4I1 induced the AHR signature (Figure 2B, top; Table S4), which was reversed by AHR knockdown (Figures 2B, bottom, and S4H; Table S4) and confirmed for select AHR targets by qRT-PCR (Figure 2C). To test whether IL4I1-derived metabolites activate the AHR, we treated GBM cells with supernatants of cells with ectopic IL4I1, which increased nuclear AHR localization (Figure 2D) and target gene transcription (Figure 2E). Conversely, IL4I1 downregulation (Figures S4E–S4G) decreased AHR activity (Figures 2F and S4I; Table S4) and qRT-PCR analysis confirmed downregulation of AHR target genes including AHR, IDO1, and TDO2 (Figures 2G and S4J).Figure S4IL4I1 Induces AHR Activity and AHR-Mediated Outcomes, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) AHR protein expression in Ctrl and ectopic IL4I1-expressing U-87MG and U-251MG cells, cultured for 120 h (n = 3).

Although many such pathological vessels often naturally regress and spare sight-threatening complications, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we used orthogonal approaches in human patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and a mouse model of ischemic retinopathies to identify an unconventional role for neutrophils in vascular remodeling during late-stage sterile inflammation. Senescent vasculature released a secretome that attracted neutrophils and triggered the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs ultimately cleared diseased endothelial cells and remodeled unhealthy vessels. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of NETosis prevented the regression of senescent vessels and prolonged disease. Thus, clearance of senescent retinal blood vessels leads to reparative vascular remodeling."

Without a vaccine, behavior change is the most effective means of reducing disease transmission. Identifying psychological factors that may encourage engagement in preventative health behaviors is crucial. The behavioral immune system (BIS) represents a set of psychological processes thought to promote health by encouraging disease avoidance behaviors. This study examined whether individual differences in BIS reactivity (germ aversion, pathogen disgust sensitivity) were associated with concern about COVID-19 and engagement in recommended preventative health behaviors (social distancing, handwashing, cleaning/disinfecting, avoiding touching face, wearing facemasks). From March 20 to 23, 2020, a US national sample (N = 1019) completed an online survey. Germ aversion and pathogen disgust sensitivity were the two variables most consistently associated with COVID-19 concern and preventative health behaviors, while accounting for demographic, health, and psychosocial covariates. Findings have implications for the development of interventions intended to increase preventative health behaviors."

Despite an apparently low energy density—30 to 40% of the theoretical limit versus 90% for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)—lead–acid batteries are made from abundant low-cost materials and nonflammable water-based electrolyte, while manufacturing practices that operate at 99% recycling rates substantially minimize environmental impact (1). Nevertheless, forecasts of the demise of lead–acid batteries (2) have focused on the health effects of lead and the rise of LIBs (2).

https://openalex.org/W3057391939,"Background It is now well recognised that the risk of severe COVID-19 increases with some long-term conditions (LTCs). However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity (≥2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors. Methods and findings We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37–73; recruited 2006–2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age/sex/ethnicity/socioeconomic status/smoking/physical activity/BMI/systolic blood pressure/renal function). 4,498 (1.05%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96–1.30)), whereas those with ≥2 LTCs had 48% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28–1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and ≥2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12–1.46) and 1.77 (1.46–2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response higher risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI ≥40 kg/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09–3.78); 2.79 (2.00–3.90); 2.66 (1.88–3.76); 2.13 (1.46–3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population. Conclusions Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19."

The complex world of WNT receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Because of its critical roles in development, Wnt has been widely used as an essential cell growth factor in organoids, a rapidly developing model system for tissue development (Clevers, 2016Clevers H. Modeling development and disease with organoids.Cell. 2016; 165: 1586-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar; Drost and Clevers, 2018Drost J. Clevers H.

Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3314) Google Scholar). Currently, Wnt3a or the small molecule glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) inhibitor CHIR is commonly used as Wnt source. Recombinant Wnt3a is water insoluble and could not stably serve as a medium supplement (Janda and Garcia, 2015Janda C.Y. Garcia K.C. Wnt acylation and its functional implication in Wnt signalling regulation.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2015; 43: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar; Janda et al., 2012Janda C.Y. Waghray D. Levin A.M. Thomas C. Garcia K.C. Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled.Science. 2012; 337: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar); thus, serum-stabilized Wnt3a conditioned media (CM) is a common substitute. However, the components of Wnt3a CM are not fully defined, introducing uncontrollable experimental variables. For example, the presence of serum in Wnt3a CM was reported to prevent long-term maintenance of human pancreatic organoids (Seino et al., 2018Seino T. Kawasaki S. Shimokawa M. Tamagawa H. Toshimitsu K. Fujii M. Ohta Y. Matano M. Nanki K. Kawasaki K. et al.Human pancreatic tumor organoids reveal loss of stem cell niche factor dependence during disease progression.Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22: 454-467.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CHIR-targeted GSK3 regulates diverse cellular pathways other than Wnt signaling pathway (Jope and Johnson, 2004Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. The glamour and gloom of glycogen synthase kinase-3.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), leading to undesired off-target effects. Another unsolved problem for Wnt signaling is the functional dissection of individual Fzd receptors. Despite the extensive literature characterizing the overall Wnt-Fzd signaling (Clevers, 2006Clevers H. Wnt/β-catenin signaling in development and disease.Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar; Nusse and Clevers, 2017Nusse R. Clevers H. Wnt/β-catenin signaling, disease, and emerging therapeutic modalities.Cell. 2017; 169: 985-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), the linkage between specific Fzd receptors and their downstream responses remains elusive. Individual Wnt and Fzd have been shown to exhibit a high degree of subtype cross-reactivity, rendering it technically challenging to isolate the effects of individual Fzd subtypes using natural Wnt molecules (Dijksterhuis et al., 2015Dijksterhuis J.P. Baljinnyam B. Stanger K. Sercan H.O. Ji Y. Andres O. Rubin J.S. Hannoush R.N. Schulte G. Systematic mapping of WNT-FZD protein interactions reveals functional selectivity by distinct WNT-FZD pairs.J.

Moreover, recombinant Wnts are not water soluble and are thus difficult for in vitro mechanistic studies (Janda and Garcia, 2015Janda C.Y. Garcia K.C. Wnt acylation and its functional implication in Wnt signalling regulation.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2015; 43: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar; Janda et al., 2012Janda C.Y. Waghray D.

Wnt proteins are lipid-modified and can act as stem cell growth factors.Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Considering the critical roles of Wnt in organoid culture and cell development, it is important to engineer water-soluble and Fzd-specific surrogate Wnt agonist. Here, we report the development of Fzd subtype-specific NGS Wnts. Previously we reported the bi-specific molecule scFv-DKK1c that dimerizes Fzd and Lrp and activates canonical Wnt signaling (Janda et al., 2017Janda C.Y. Dang L.T. You C. Chang J. de Lau W. Zhong Z.A. Yan K.S. Marecic O. Siepe D. Li X. et al.Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling.Nature. 2017; 545: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These proof-of-concept molecules were only weakly potent and lacked Fzd selectivity. Recently, two “tetrameric” antibody-based Wnt agonists were reported, confirming the ability of a Fzd/Lrp6 clustering agent to activate canonical Wnt signaling (Chen et al., 2020Chen H. Lu C. Ouyang B. Zhang H. Huang Z. Bhatia D. Lee S.-J. Shah D. Sura A. Yeh W.-C. et al.Development of potent, selective surrogate WNT molecules and their application in defining Frizzled requirements.Cell Chem. Biol. 2020; 27: 598-609.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar; Tao et al., 2019Tao Y. Mis M. Blazer L. Ustav Jnr, M. Steinhart Z. Chidiac R. Kubarakos E. O’Brien S. Wang X. Jarvik N. et al.Tailored tetravalent antibodies potently and specifically activate Wnt/Frizzled pathways in cells, organoids and mice.eLife. 2019; 8: 16Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to claims that tetrameric ligands are required for Wnt signal initiation, our previous bi-specific 1:1 surrogate Wnt scFv-DKK1c also displayed activity (Janda et al., 2017Janda C.Y. Dang L.T. You C. Chang J. de Lau W. Zhong Z.A. Yan K.S. Marecic O. Siepe D. Li X. et al.Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling.Nature. 2017; 545: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This discrepancy requires clarification in order to make progress in generating therapeutic Wnt agonists. In the present study, we have incorporated recently designed Fzd subtype-specific binders into a simple bi-specific format that results in extremely potent and selective agonism. Furthermore, their ease of production opens up access to the wider community as Wnt3a CM replacements. NGS Wnt potently supports different types of organoid growth, including colon, pancreas, ovarian, breast, and hepatocyte. Notably, compared with Wnt3a CM, NGS Wnt supports better organoid proliferation, long-term organoid maintenance, and better single cell-derived organoid outgrowth. Overall, NGS Wnt has the potential to be universally adopted as a Wnt source for organoid expansion and maintenance. We also show that NGS Wnts are systemically active in vivo and exhibit tissue selectivity in accord with their Fzd subtype specificity, allowing functional investigation of Fzd-specific agonism in regenerative medicine. To design Fzd subtype-specific surrogate Wnts, we hypothesized that a bi-specific protein binding to Fzd receptor cystine-rich domain (CRD) and Lrp5/6 receptors simultaneously should mimic endogenous Wnt function, as previously shown for our first-generation surrogate Wnt scFv-DKK1c (Janda et al., 2017Janda C.Y.

Li X. et al.Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling.Nature. 2017; 545: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We chose Designed Repeat Protein Binder Fz7/8 (DRPB_Fz7/8) (Dang et al., 2019Dang L.T. Miao Y. Ha A. Yuki K. Park K. Janda C.Y. Jude K.M. Mohan K. Ha N. Vallon M. et al.Receptor subtype discrimination using extensive shape complementary designed interfaces.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as the Fzd binding module, because of its high affinity and broad binding spectrum for Fzd receptors, and fused with high-affinity Lrp5/6 receptor binder DKK1c (Cheng et al., 2011Cheng Z. Biechele T. Wei Z. Morrone S. Moon R.T. Wang L. Xu W. Crystal structures of the extracellular domain of LRP6 and its complex with DKK1.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We purified this protein to homogeneity and denoted it as Fzd7/8 subtype NGS Wnt (activating Fzd 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8) (Figure 1B). We compared Fzd7/8 subtype NGS Wnt with the previously reported scFv-DKK1c using Wnt reporter assays in HEK293STF cells (Janda et al., 2017Janda C.Y. Dang L.T. You C. Chang J. de Lau W. Zhong Z.A.

NGS Wnt induced stronger Wnt signaling at 5 nM concentration than 250 nM scFv-DKK1c (Figure 1C). In addition, NGS Wnt showed synergy with R-spondin (Rspo), a Wnt potentiator, and also exhibited higher Wnt response than scFv-DKK1c in the presence of Rspo (Figure 1C) (de Lau et al., 2011de Lau W.

To further measure Fzd7/8 subtype NGS Wnt-induced Fzd-Lrp5/6 receptor clustering on live cell membranes, we probed the dynamics of Fzd8 and Lrp6 using dual-color single-molecule fluorescence imaging (Figure 1D) (Janda et al., 2017Janda C.Y.

Upon addition of 0.1 and 1 nM NGS Wnt, we detected co-locomotion (i.e., synchronous diffusion) of Fzd8 and Lrp6 (Figures 1E and S1). In contrast, co-locomotion was detected at only 100 nM using scFv-DKK1c (Janda et al., 2017Janda C.Y. Dang L.T. You C. Chang J. de Lau W. Zhong Z.A. Yan K.S. Marecic O. Siepe D. Li X. et al.Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling.Nature. 2017; 545: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Further quantification of Fzd8/Lrp6 stoichiometry on live cell membrane using 1 nM NGS Wnt showed a principal cluster of 1:1 heterodimer, with higher order species of dimers and trimers also observed (Figure 1F). This result strongly suggests that tetrameric ligands are not the minimal multimerization unit necessary to activate Wnt signaling (Chen et al., 2020Chen H. Lu C. Ouyang B. Zhang H. Huang Z. Bhatia D. Lee S.-J. Shah D. Sura A. Yeh W.-C. et al.Development of potent, selective surrogate WNT molecules and their application in defining Frizzled requirements.Cell Chem.

Wang X. Jarvik N. et al.Tailored tetravalent antibodies potently and specifically activate Wnt/Frizzled pathways in cells, organoids and mice.eLife. 2019; 8: 16Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our previous scFv-DKK1c studies (Janda et al., 2017Janda C.Y. Dang L.T. You C. Chang J. de Lau W. Zhong Z.A. Yan K.S. Marecic O. Siepe D. Li X. et al.Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling.Nature. 2017; 545: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, multimeric ligands could certainly potentiate signaling through enhanced clustering. An additional consideration to understand the apparent discrepancy between our 1:1 NGS Wnt and the tetrameric ligands is that the structural epitope on Fzd-CRD, where the surrogate ligand binds, is a very important determinant of signaling. Unfavorable binding epitopes in the context of a 1:1 ligand could likely be overcome by presentation of a 2:2 ligand. In the case of NGS Wnt, the DRBP binding epitope seems to be highly favorable (Dang et al., 2019Dang L.T. Miao Y. Ha A. Yuki K. Park K. Janda C.Y. Jude K.M. Mohan K. Ha N. Vallon M. et al.Receptor subtype discrimination using extensive shape complementary designed interfaces.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), far superior to the original scFv-DKK1c in signaling potency, despite both being linked to DKK1c and similar affinity of scFv and DRPB to Fzd-CRDs (Dang et al., 2019Dang L.T. Miao Y. Ha A. Yuki K. Park K. Janda C.Y. Jude K.M. Mohan K. Ha N. Vallon M. et al.Receptor subtype discrimination using extensive shape complementary designed interfaces.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Li X. et al.Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling.Nature. 2017; 545: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Next, we sought to design NGS Wnts that are specific to each of the three major Fzd subtypes. Using DRPBs specific to Fzd subtypes (Dang et al., 2019Dang L.T. Miao Y. Ha A. Yuki K. Park K. Janda C.Y. Jude K.M. Mohan K. Ha N. Vallon M. et al.Receptor subtype discrimination using extensive shape complementary designed interfaces.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we developed three additional NGS Wnts, namely, Fzd4 subtype NGS Wnt (activating Fzd4 receptor), Fzd7 subtype NGS Wnt (activating Fzd1, 2, and 7 receptors), and Fzd8 subtype NGS Wnt (activating Fzd5 and 8 receptors). To test their selectivity to individual Fzd, we generated Fzd-specific cell lines by expressing individual Fzd receptor in a “pan-Fzd receptor-knockout” HEK293T cell line (Voloshanenko et al., 2017Voloshanenko O. Gmach P. Winter J. Kranz D. Boutros M. Mapping of Wnt-Frizzled interactions by multiplex CRISPR targeting of receptor gene families.FASEB J. 2017; 31: 4832-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We subsequently treated these cell lines with Fzd subtype NGS Wnts. As expected, Fzd subtype NGS Wnts induced β-catenin signaling in a Fzd receptor subtype-dependent way. For example, in cells expressing Fzd4 receptor, only Fzd4 subtype NGS Wnt induced β-catenin signaling, while none of the other NGS Wnts showed any signaling. In Fzd2 subtype specific cells, only Fzd7 subtype NGS Wnt and Fzd7/8 subtype NGS Wnt demonstrated activation of Wnt signaling (Figures 1G and S2). Wnt signaling plays pivotal roles in cardiomyocyte expansion during development to ensure growth of myocardial mass (Buikema et al., 2013Buikema J.W. Mady A.S. Mittal N.V. Atmanli A. Caron L. Doevendans P.A. Sluijter J.P.G. Domian I.J.

We applied broad-spectrum Fzd7/8 subtype NGS Wnt to hiPSC-CMs and monitored their expansion (Figure 2A). Fzd7/8 subtype NGS Wnt alone resulted in a 3.1-fold increase (normalized to media control) in hiPSC-CM expansion, shown by troponin T-positive cell number (Figures 2B and 2C). Moreover, treatment with NGS Wnt and Rspo together exhibited synergistic effects on hiPSC-CM expansion, whereas Rspo treatment alone showed no increase in hiPSC-CM number (Figure 2C). These data demonstrate that NGS Wnt recapitulates natural Wnt in expansion of hiPSC-CMs. Wnt is an essential factor for the growth and maintenance of organoids. To test the feasibility of NGS Wnt in organoid expansion, we substituted Wnt3a CM with Fzd7/8 subtype NGS Wnt, which signals through a broader spectrum of Fzd receptors, in mouse colon organoid media. Indeed, Fzd7/8 subtype NGS Wnt supports colon organoid growth even at 0.1–0.5 nM concentration, while previous scFv-DKK1c supports colon organoids at 180 nM (Figures S1G and S1H). We further reasoned that Fc conjugation could improve NGS Wnt stability in 37°C culturing condition and also increase the potency through avidity. We compared NGS Wnt and NGS Wnt-Fc with Wnt3a, Wnt3a CM, and scFv-DKK1c using Wnt reporter assays (Figures S3A–S3C). Fc-tagged NGS Wnt showed slightly better Wnt response (Emax) (Figure S3B) but demonstrated significantly improved half maximal effective concentration (EC50) (Figure S3C). Therefore, Fc-tagged Fzd7/8 subtype NGS Wnt is used for all subsequent organoid experiments and simply denoted as NGS Wnt. To further compare NGS Wnt with recombinant Wnt3a, we noted improved efficacy of NGS Wnt in cultured P26N human colon organoids (Figures S3D–S3F), highlighting the superiority of NGS Wnt. We further tested NGS Wnt in human colon organoids from both cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (Dekkers et al., 2013Dekkers J.F. Wiegerinck C.L. de Jonge H.R. Bronsveld I. Janssens H.M. de Winter-de Groot K.M. Brandsma A.M. de Jong N.W.M. Bijvelds M.J.C. Scholte B.J. et al.A functional CFTR assay using primary cystic fibrosis intestinal organoids.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D) and healthy donors (Figures 2G and S3G) and compared its efficacy with currently used Wnt3a CM. Both NGS Wnt and Wnt3a CM supported long-term expansion of CF and healthy colon organoids after multiple passages. Remarkably, NGS Wnt showed improved better expansion rates and in vitro growth than Wnt3a CM at both the first passage (Figures 2E and S3H) and late passages from P9 to P13 (Figures 2F and S3I). NGS Wnt also retained potency after long-term storage (Figures S4A–S4D). Moreover, colon organoids expanded with traditional Wnt3a CM showed signs of differentiation (small, dark, and compact organoids). In contrast, NGS Wnt-supported colon organoids are more proliferative (cystic organoids with thin walls) (Figure 2G). Subsequently, we compared NGS Wnt with Wnt3a CM/Wnt3a in multiple types of organoid models. We applied NGS Wnt to ovarian, breast, and hepatocyte organoids (Hu et al., 2018Hu H. Gehart H. Artegiani B. LÖpez-Iglesias C. Dekkers F. Basak O. van Es J. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Begthel H.

NGS Wnt is sufficient to expand all these organoid models at 0.5 nM for multiple passages (Figures 2H–2J). To confirm that NGS Wnt can be used universally, we also successfully cultured human colon organoids from different donors and at different laboratories (Figure S4E). In addition, NGS Wnt-supported colon organoids retained proper cell polarity and can be redirected to a differentiated state by withdrawal of growth factors (Figures S4F–S4I). Next, we examined whether NGS Wnt could prolong organoid lifespan. Using previously established culture protocol, human kidney tubular epithelial organoids (tubuloids) can only can be rapidly expanded for up to approximately ten passages, after which they significantly slow down in growth rate (Schutgens et al., 2019Schutgens F. Rookmaaker M.B. Margaritis T. Rios A. Ammerlaan C. Jansen J. Gijzen L. Vormann M. Vonk A. Viveen M. et al.Tubuloids derived from human adult kidney and urine for personalized disease modeling.Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Addition of NGS Wnt to the culture medium did not significantly change tubuloid expansion up to about passage 10. Remarkably, tubuloids grown with NGS Wnt could still be passaged beyond passage 10 at similar frequency and ratios (Figures 3A and S4J). Furthermore, histological characterization did not reveal any phenotypic difference between tubuloids cultured with or without NGS Wnt (Figure S4K). In summary, these data suggest that NGS Wnt supports a wide variety of organoid models and outperforms previously described Wnt3a CM. The success of NGS Wnt in multiple organoids prompted us to test whether it is capable of supporting single cell-derived organoid outgrowth. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome engineering of healthy organoids to recapitulate tumor progression requires single cell-derived organoid outgrowth (Cong et al., 2013Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S.

We therefore chose pancreas, stomach, and colon organoids and compared NGS Wnt with Wnt3a CM (Bartfeld et al., 2015Bartfeld S. Bayram T. van de Wetering M. Huch M. Begthel H. Kujala P. Vries R.

Notably, Wnt3a CM failed to support stomach organoid outgrowth from single cell, while NGS Wnt demonstrated tremendous improvement (Figures 3B–3D). We also detected significantly improved organoid expansion by NGS Wnt in colon and pancreas organoids (Figures 3B–3D). Overall, compared with Wnt3a CM, NGS Wnt augmented single cell-derived organoid outgrowth in all three chosen organoid types and potentially other untested organoid models. Such improvements in organoid expansion protocol could be extremely useful for high-throughput experiments, such as establishing a patient organoid biobank (van de Wetering et al., 2015van de Wetering M.

https://openalex.org/W3066929737,"Gamma delta (γδ) T cells infiltrate most human tumors, but current immunotherapies fail to exploit their in situ major histocompatibility complex–independent tumoricidal potential. Activation of γδ T cells can be elicited by butyrophilin and butyrophilin-like molecules that are structurally similar to the immunosuppressive B7 family members, yet how they regulate and coordinate αβ and γδ T cell responses remains unknown. Here, we report that the butyrophilin BTN3A1 inhibits tumor-reactive αβ T cell receptor activation by preventing segregation of N-glycosylated CD45 from the immune synapse. Notably, CD277-specific antibodies elicit coordinated restoration of αβ T cell effector activity and BTN2A1-dependent γδ lymphocyte cytotoxicity against BTN3A1 + cancer cells, abrogating malignant progression. Targeting BTN3A1 therefore orchestrates cooperative killing of established tumors by αβ and γδ T cells and may present a treatment strategy for tumors resistant to existing immunotherapies."

We develop model “banana-shaped” colloidal particles with tunable dimensions and curvature, whose structure and dynamics are accessible at the particle level. By heating initially straight rods made of SU-8 photoresist, we induce a controllable shape deformation that causes the rods to buckle into banana-shaped particles. We elucidate the phase behavior of differently curved colloidal bananas using confocal microscopy. Although highly curved bananas only form isotropic phases, less curved bananas exhibit very rich phase behavior, including biaxial nematic phases, polar and antipolar smectic-like phases, and even the long-predicted, elusive splay-bend nematic phase."
https://openalex.org/W3081306231,"Notch signaling is a cellular pathway regulating cell-fate determination and adult tissue homeostasis. Little is known about how canonical Notch ligands or Fringe enzymes differentially affect NOTCH1 and NOTCH2. Using cell-based Notch signaling and ligand-binding assays, we evaluated differences in NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 responses to Delta-like (DLL) and Jagged (JAG) family members and the extent to which Fringe enzymes modulate their activity. In the absence of Fringes, DLL4-NOTCH1 activation was more than twice that of DLL4-NOTCH2, whereas all other ligands activated NOTCH2 similarly or slightly more than NOTCH1. However, NOTCH2 showed less sensitivity to the Fringes. Lunatic fringe (LFNG) enhanced NOTCH2 activation by DLL1 and -4, and Manic fringe (MFNG) inhibited NOTCH2 activation by JAG1 and -2. Mass spectral analysis showed that O-fucose occurred at high stoichiometry at most consensus sequences of NOTCH2 and that the Fringe enzymes modified more O-fucose sites of NOTCH2 compared with NOTCH1. Mutagenesis studies showed that LFNG modification of O-fucose on EGF8 and -12 of NOTCH2 was responsible for enhancement of DLL1-NOTCH2 activation, similar to previous reports for NOTCH1. In contrast to NOTCH1, a single O-fucose site mutant that substantially blocked the ability of MFNG to inhibit NOTCH2 activation by JAG1 could not be identified. Interestingly, elimination of the O-fucose site on EGF12 allowed LFNG to inhibit JAG1-NOTCH2 activation, and O-fucosylation on EGF9 was important for trafficking of both NOTCH1 and NOTCH2. Together, these studies provide new insights into the differential regulation of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 by Notch ligands and Fringe enzymes."

This research aimed to describe commercial and non-commercial funders' data-sharing policies and to assess the compliance of funded RCTs with the existing data-sharing policies. Methods and findings Funders of clinical research having funded at least one RCT in the years 2016 to 2018 were surveyed. All 78 eligible non-commercial funders retrieved from the Sherpa/Juliet Initiative website and a random sample of 100 commercial funders selected from pharmaceutical association member lists (LEEM, IFPMA, EFPIA) and the top 100 pharmaceutical companies in terms of drug sales were included. Thirty (out of 78; 38%) non-commercial funders had a data-sharing policy with eighteen (out of 30, 60%) making data-sharing mandatory and twelve (40%) encouraging data-sharing. Forty-one (out of 100; 41%) of commercial funders had a data-sharing policy. Among funders with a data-sharing policy, a survey of two random samples of 100 RCTs registered on Clinicaltrial.gov, data-sharing statements were present for seventy-seven (77%, 95% IC [67%-84%]) and eighty-one (81% [72% - 88%]) of RCTs funded by non-commercial and commercial funders respectively. Intention to share data was expressed in 12% [7%-20%] and 59% [49%– 69%] of RCTs funded by non-commercial and commercial funders respectively. Conclusions This survey identified suboptimal performances of funders in setting up data-sharing policies. For those with a data-sharing policy, the implementation of the policy in study registration was limited for commercial funders and of concern for non-commercial funders. The limitations of the present study include its cross-sectional nature, since data-sharing policies are continuously changing. We call for a standardization of policies with a strong evaluation component to make sure that, when in place, these policies are effective."

https://openalex.org/W3080735686,"Background Pes planus (flatfoot) is a common deformity characterized by the midfoot arch collapses during walking. As the midfoot is responsible for shock absorption, persons with flatfoot experience increased risk of injuries such as thumb valgus, tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, metatarsal pain, knee pain, lower-back pain with prolonged uphill, downhill, and level walking, depriving them of the physical and mental health benefits of walking as an exercise. Methods Fifteen female college students with flatfoot were recruited. A wireless plantar-pressure system was used to measure the stance time, cadence, plantar pressure, and contact area. Parameters were compared between wearing flat and arch-support insoles using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with on an incline, decline, and level surface, respectively. The significance level α was set to 0.05. The effect size (ES) was calculated as a measure of the practical relevance of the significance using Cohen’s d. Results On the level surface, the stance time in the arch-support insole was significantly shorter than in the flat insole (p<0.05; ES = 0.48). The peak pressure of the big toe in the arch-support insole was significantly greater than in the flat insole on the uphill (p<0.05; ES = 0.53) and level surfaces (p<0.05; ES = 0.71). The peak pressure of the metatarsals 2–4 and the contact area of the midfoot in the arch-support insole were significantly greater than in the flat insole on all surfaces (all p< 0.05). Conclusions These results imply that wearing an arch-support insole provides benefits in the shortened stance time and generation of propulsion force to the big toe while walking on uphill and level surfaces and to the metatarsals 2–4 while walking on the level surface. More evenly distributed contact areas across the midfoot may help absorb shock during uphill, downhill and level walking."
https://openalex.org/W3080981401,"The minimum infectious dose required to induce CWD infection in cervids remains unknown, as does whether peripherally shed prions and/or multiple low dose exposures are important factors in CWD transmission. With the goal of better understand CWD infection in nature, we studied oral exposures of deer to very low doses of CWD prions and also examined whether the frequency of exposure or prion source may influence infection and pathogenesis. We orally inoculated white-tailed deer with either single or multiple divided doses of prions of brain or saliva origin and monitored infection by serial longitudinal tissue biopsies spanning over two years. We report that oral exposure to as little as 300 nanograms (ng) of CWD-positive brain or to saliva containing seeding activity equivalent to 300 ng of CWD-positive brain, were sufficient to transmit CWD disease. This was true whether the inoculum was administered as a single bolus or divided as three weekly 100 ng exposures. However, when the 300 ng total dose was apportioned as 10, 30 ng doses delivered over 12 weeks, no infection occurred. While low-dose exposures to prions of brain or saliva origin prolonged the time from inoculation to first detection of infection, once infection was established, we observed no differences in disease pathogenesis. These studies suggest that the CWD minimum infectious dose approximates 100 to 300 ng CWD-positive brain (or saliva equivalent), and that CWD infection appears to conform more with a threshold than a cumulative dose dynamic."
https://openalex.org/W3081051229,"Concerns exist that the positive association of physical activity with better lung function, which has been suggested in previous longitudinal studies in smokers, is due to reverse causation. To investigate this, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM), an exploratory approach, and marginal structural modeling (MSM), an approach from the causal inference framework that corrects for reverse causation and time-dependent confounding and estimates causal effects, on data from participants in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS, a multicentre European cohort study initiated in 1991–1993 with ECRHS I, and with two follow-ups: ECRHS II in 1999–2003, and ECRHS III in 2010–2014). 753 subjects who reported current smoking at ECRHS II, with repeated data on lung function at ECRHS I, II and III, physical activity at ECRHS II and III, and potential confounders at ECRHS I and II, were included in the analyses. SEM showed positive associations between physical activity and lung function in both directions. MSM suggested a protective causal effect of physical activity on lung function (overall difference in mean β (95% CI), comparing active versus non-active individuals: 58 mL (21–95) for forced expiratory volume in one second and 83 mL (36–130) for forced vital capacity).

https://openalex.org/W3080226627,"Financing municipal solid waste (MSW) services is one of the key challenges faced by cities in developing countries. This study used plastic waste, a constituent of MSW, to explore the possibility of generating revenue for financing MSW management in the municipalities of Nepal. The results of this study suggest that plastic material recovery could generate revenue, which is equivalent to 1.38 times of the plastic-waste-related management cost when collection efficiency reaches 66.7%. An increase in 1% of recovery rate and collection efficiency could cover an additional 4.64% and 2.06% of the costs of managing plastic waste, respectively. In addition, an increase in tax on imported plastic materials could also motivate recovery of plastic waste for recycle and reuse. An additional 1% tax on plastic imports would be sufficient to cover plastic-related waste management when plastic waste recovery and collection efficiency rates are low. This plastic recovery- revenue exercise could be expanded to other materials such as paper and metal to fully understand the possibility of sustainable financing of MSW management and reducing environmental harm in developing countries like Nepal."

Our analysis has identified six risk factors-maternal short stature, large household size, closely spaced births, prevalence of hypertension among women, household poverty, open defecation, and extreme temperature-and four protective factors-female education, access to improved drinking water, dietary diversity among children, and iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation during pregnancy.The study highlights the need for investing in pre-conception care, addressing both demand- and supply-side barriers to increase the coverage of nutrition-specific interventions, implementing programmes to promote the intake of healthy foods from an early age, providing contraceptive counselling and services to unmarried and married adolescents and young women and men, and universalizing quality primary and secondary education that is inclusive and equitable to avert the burden of childhood stunting in India."
https://openalex.org/W3060316749,"Background Older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at heightened risk for polypharmacy. We examined potentially inappropriate prescribing in this population and whether introducing pharmacists into the ambulatory kidney care model was associated with improved prescribing practices. Methods Retrospective cohort study using linked administrative databases. We included patients with an eGFR ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≥66 years of age followed in multidisciplinary kidney clinics in Ontario, Canada (n = 25,016 from 28 centres). The primary outcome was the absence of a statin prescription or the receipt of a potentially inappropriate prescription defined by the American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria® and a modified Delphi panel that identified key drugs of concern in CKD. We calculated the crude cumulative incidence and incidence rate for the primary outcome and used change-point regression to determine if a change occurred following pharmacist introduction. Results There were 6,007 (24%) and 16,497 patients (66%) not prescribed a statin and with ≥1 potentially inappropriate prescription, respectively. The rate of potentially inappropriate prescribing was 125.6 per 100 person-years and was higher in more recent years. The change-point regression analysis included 2,275 patients from two centres. No immediate change was detected at pharmacist introduction, but potentially inappropriate prescribing was increasing pre-pharmacist introduction, and this rising trend was reversed post-pharmacist introduction. The incidence of potentially inappropriate prescribing still remained high post-pharmacist introduction. Conclusions Potentially inappropriate prescribing practices were common. Incorporating pharmacists into the kidney care model may improve prescribing practices. The role of pharmacists in the ambulatory kidney care team warrants further investigation in a randomized controlled trial."
https://openalex.org/W3080094032,"Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) is a standard of HIV management to suppress viral load and delay progression to AIDS. However, questions have been raised about the use of antiretroviral therapy and how it affects quality of life (QoL) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The study hence aimed to assess the QoL of PLWHA who were taking HAART at Mizan-Tepi University Teaching Hospital (MTUTH) and identify factors associated with QoL.A cross sectional study was conducted among PLWHA receiving HAART at MTUTH from March 04-April 1, 2018. Patients were recruited consecutively and interviewed with structured questionnaire. A data abstraction tool was used to extract data from patient medical records. Quality of life was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV- BREF (WHOQOL-HIV-BREF) standard tool. Data was entered to Epi-Info version 3.5.3 and analyzed using SPSS version 22 for windows. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify factors associated with QoL. A statistical significance was established at a p value <0.05.A total of 240 participants with the mean age of 35.11 (SD = 9.08) years were included in the study. This study found that 57.1% of the patients had high global score of QoL. Patients with normal current health (AOR = 3.38, 95% CI = 1.56-7.31)) and having family support (AOR = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.51-6.46) were positively associated with high global score of QoL, while patients with low HAART adherence (AOR = 0.40, 95%, CI = 0.19-0.86) were negatively associated with high global score of QoL.The study revealed that more than half of the participants had high global score of QoL. Normal current health and family support were associated with better global score of QoL, while low HAART adherence was found to be associated with the lower global score of QoL."
https://openalex.org/W3080390545,"Powered by the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis, protease-containing ABC transporters (PCATs) export amphipathic and hydrophilic bacteriocin and quorum-sensing proteins across the membrane hydrophobic barrier. The cargo proteins have N-terminal leader peptides that are cleaved off by the cysteine protease domain, referred to as the C39 domain, or referred to as the peptidase (PEP) domain. The sequence and structural determinants of the interaction between PCATs and cargo proteins are poorly understood, yet this interaction is a central aspect of the transport mechanism. Here, we demonstrate the ATP-dependent, equilibrium binding of the cargo protein to the transmembrane domain (TMD) of a PCAT subsequent to the removal of the leader peptide by the PEP domain. Binding of the cargo protein to PCAT1 variants devoid of the PEP domain is detected through changes in the spectroscopic properties of fluorescent or spin label. Moreover, we find similar energetics of binding regardless of the presence of the leader peptide, suggesting that although the PEP domain serves for recognition and orientation, interaction with the TMD is the main contributor to the affinity. These findings are in direct contradiction with a recent study claiming that the TMD does not interact with the cargo protein; rather acting as a ""Teflon-like"" conduit across the bilayer (Kieuvongngam, V., Olinares, P. D. B., Palillo, A., Oldham, M. L., Chait, B. T., and Chen, J. (2020) Structural basis of substrate recognition by a polypeptide processing and secretion transporter. eLife 9, e51492). A distinctive feature of the transport model emerging from our data invokes a stable complex between PCATs and their cargo proteins following processing of the leader peptide and prior to ATP-dependent alternating access that translocates the cargo protein to the extracellular side."
https://openalex.org/W3081430459,"Fisheries bycatch has been identified as the greatest threat to marine mammals worldwide. Characterizing the impacts of bycatch on marine mammals is challenging because it is difficult to both observe and quantify, particularly in small-scale fisheries where data on fishing effort and marine mammal abundance and distribution are often limited. The lack of risk frameworks that can integrate and visualize existing data have hindered the ability to describe and quantify bycatch risk. Here, we describe the design of a new geographic information systems tool built specifically for the analysis of bycatch in small-scale fisheries, called Bycatch Risk Assessment (ByRA). Using marine mammals in Malaysia and Vietnam as a test case, we applied ByRA to assess the risks posed to Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) and dugongs (Dugong dugon) by five small-scale fishing gear types (hook and line, nets, longlines, pots and traps, and trawls). ByRA leverages existing data on animal distributions, fisheries effort, and estimates of interaction rates by combining expert knowledge and spatial analyses of existing data to visualize and characterize bycatch risk. By identifying areas of bycatch concern while accounting for uncertainty using graphics, maps and summary tables, we demonstrate the importance of integrating available geospatial data in an accessible format that taps into local knowledge and can be corroborated by and communicated to stakeholders of data-limited fisheries. Our methodological approach aims to meet a critical need of fisheries managers: to identify emergent interaction patterns between fishing gears and marine mammals and support the development of management actions that can lead to sustainable fisheries and mitigate bycatch risk for species of conservation concern."
https://openalex.org/W3081066662,"Homelessness is poorly captured in most administrative data sets making it difficult to understand how, when, and where this population can be better served. This study sought to develop and validate a classification model of homelessness. Our sample included 5,050,639 individuals aged 11 years and older who were included in a linked dataset of administrative records from multiple state-maintained databases in Massachusetts for the period from 2011–2015. We used logistic regression to develop a classification model with 94 predictors and subsequently tested its performance. The model had high specificity (95.4%), moderate sensitivity (77.8%) for predicting known cases of homelessness, and excellent classification properties (area under the receiver operating curve 0.94; balanced accuracy 86.4%). To demonstrate the potential opportunity that exists for using such a modeling approach to target interventions to mitigate the risk of an adverse health outcome, we also estimated the association between model predicted homeless status and fatal opioid overdoses, finding that model predicted homeless status was associated with a nearly 23-fold increase in the risk of fatal opioid overdose. This study provides a novel approach for identifying homelessness using integrated administrative data. The strong performance of our model underscores the potential value of linking data from multiple service systems to improve the identification of housing instability and to assist government in developing programs that seek to improve health and other outcomes for homeless individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3081334319,"Dust masks are widely used to prevent the inhalation of particulate matter into the human respiratory organs in polluted air environments. The filter of a dust mask inherently obstructs the natural respiratory air flows, and this flow resistance is mainly responsible for the discomfort experienced when wearing a dust mask. In atmospheric conditions seriously contaminated with fine dust, it is recommended that common citizens wear a dust mask in their everyday lives, yet many people are reluctant to wear a dust mask owing to the discomfort experienced when wearing it for a long time. Understanding of physical reasons for the discomfort is thus crucial in designing a dust mask, but remains far from clear. This study presents a technique to quantify the wearing comfort of dust masks. By developing a respiration simulator to measure the pressure loss across a dust mask, we assessed the energy costs to overcome flow resistance when breathing through various types of dust masks. The energy cost for a single inhalation varies with the mask type in a range between 0 and 10 mJ. We compared the results with the survey results of 40 people about the wearing comfort of the dust masks, which revealed that the wearing comfort crucially depends on the energy cost required for air inhalation though the dust mask. Using the measured energy cost during inhalation as a parameter to quantify the wearing comfort, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of dust masks in terms of not only the filtering performance but also the wearing comfort. Our study suggests some design principles for dust mask filters, auxiliary electric fans, and check valves."
https://openalex.org/W3080080871,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of infectious diseases such as pneumonia and sepsis. Its colonization is thought to be the first step in the development of invasive pneumococcal diseases. This study aimed to investigate pneumococcal colonization patterns in early childhood. A longitudinal birth cohort study was conducted for investigating nasopharyngeal colonized pneumococci at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age, particularly focusing on the serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) effect on nasopharyngeal colonization was also assessed. During 2013–2017, 855 infants were enrolled and a total of 107 isolates were recovered from 95 infants during the first three years of life. In this period, the prevalence of pneumococcal colonization increased, with values ranging from 0.2% (2/834) at 1 month of age to 5.9% (19/323) at 36 months of age. The investigation of serotype revealed that 81.1% (73/90) belonged to the non-PCV13 serotypes–23A, 15A, 15C, and 15B. Moreover, PCV13 serotypes significantly decreased during 2014–2015, when routine PCV13 vaccination was initiated in Taiwan. PCV13 introduction may lead to the reduction in the rates of pneumococcal isolates resistant (R) to penicillin. Under conditional PCV13 vaccination, pneumococcal isolates primarily belonged to non-PCV13 serotypes. This non-PCV13 serotype replacement exhibited lower rates of penicillin R isolates, suggesting that PCV13 administration may reduce the antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal disease burden and antibiotic use."
https://openalex.org/W3080141263,"General control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5, also known as Kat2a) and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF, also known as Kat2b) are two homologous acetyltransferases. Both proteins share similar domain architecture consisting of a PCAF N-terminal (PCAF_N) domain, acetyltransferase domain, and a bromodomain. PCAF also acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase whose activity is attributable to the PCAF_N domain, but its structural aspects are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that GCN5 exhibited ubiquitination activity in a similar manner to PCAF and its activity was supported by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5. Moreover, we determined the crystal structure of the PCAF_N domain at 1.8 Å resolution and found that PCAF_N domain folds into a helical structure with a characteristic binuclear zinc region, which was not predicted from sequence analyses. The zinc region is distinct from known E3 ligase structures, suggesting this region may form a new class of E3 ligase. Our biochemical and structural study provides new insight into not only the functional significance of GCN5 but also into ubiquitin biology."
https://openalex.org/W3080494092,"Primary cilia are generated through the extension of the microtubule-based axoneme. Centrosomal protein 104 (CEP104) localizes to the tip of the elongating axoneme, and CEP104 mutations are linked to a ciliopathy, Joubert syndrome. Thus, CEP104 has been implicated in ciliogenesis. However, the mechanism by which CEP104 regulates ciliogenesis remains elusive. We report here that CEP104 is critical for cilium elongation but not for initiating ciliogenesis. We also demonstrated that the tumor-overexpressed gene (TOG) domain of CEP104 exhibits microtubule-polymerizing activity and that this activity is essential for the cilium-elongating activity of CEP104. Knockdown/rescue experiments showed that the N-terminal jelly-roll (JR) fold partially contributes to cilium-elongating activity of CEP104, but neither the zinc-finger region nor the SXIP motif is required for this activity. CEP104 binds to a centriole-capping protein, CP110, through the zinc-finger region and to a microtubule plus-end-binding protein, EB1, through the SXIP motif, indicating that the binding of CP110 and EB1 is dispensable for the cilium-elongating activity of CEP104. Moreover, CEP104 depletion does not affect CP110 removal from the mother centriole, which suggests that CEP104 functions after the removal of CP110. Last, we also showed that CEP104 is required for the ciliary entry of Smoothened and export of GPR161 upon Hedgehog signal activation and that the TOG domain plays a critical role in this activity. Our results define the roles of the individual domains of CEP104 in its functions in cilium elongation and Hedgehog signaling and should enhance our understanding of the mechanism underlying CEP104 mutation-associated ciliopathies."

They transfer electrons gained by breaking down hydrogen sulfide to oxygen-rich sediments and electron acceptors close to the mud surface or to plant roots. These microbes and nanowire bacteria, which conduct electrons through nanometers-long protein wires, are proving ubiquitous. Together, they are forcing researchers to rewrite textbooks; rethink the role that mud bacteria play in recycling key elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous; and reconsider how they influence aquatic ecosystems and climate change. Scientists are also pursuing practical applications, exploring the potential of cable and nanowire bacteria to battle pollution and power electronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W3080909759,"A higher levodopa dose is a strong risk factor for levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, levodopa dose can change during long-term medication. We explored the relationship between levodopa dose and time to onset of LID using longitudinal multicenter data. Medical records of 150 patients who were diagnosed with de novo PD and treated with levodopa until onset of LID were collected. Levodopa dose were assessed as the dose at 6 months from levodopa initiation and rate of dose increase between 6 months and onset of LID. The groups with earlier LID onset had higher levodopa and levodopa-equivalent dose at the first 6 months of treatment and rapid increase in both levodopa and levodopa-equivalent dose. Multivariable linear regression models revealed that female sex, severe motor symptom at levodopa initiation, and higher rate of increase in both levodopa and levodopa-equivalent dose were significantly associated with early onset of LID. The present results demonstrated that rapid increase in levodopa dose or levodopa-equivalent dose is associated with early onset of LID."
https://openalex.org/W3080872639,"The Beery-Buktenica Test of Visual-Motor Integration (Beery VMI) is a commonly used standardized test of visual-motor integration. Performance on the test is related to academic achievement, but the effect of reduced visual acuity on test results is unknown. This study determined the visual acuity demand and the spacing of the test forms for the Beery VMI and its supplemental tests and investigated the effect of induced optical blur on test results in both adults and children.The overall size and critical detail size of each form and the distance between the center of each form and its adjacent crowding source were measured. The visual acuity demand and angular separation of forms were calculated. Two groups of participants (adults aged ≥18 years [n = 19] and children aged 7-12 years [n = 20]) completed four sessions in which they performed the Beery VMI and the supplemental tests under different blur conditions (habitual near correction, monocular spherical blur, binocular spherical blur and binocular astigmatic blur) in a randomized order.Stroke width, overall form size and box size remained constant throughout the Beery VMI, whereas these reduced with increasing difficulty for the supplemental tests. Reduced near visual acuity from simulated blur resulted in reduced mean scores for the Beery VMI and its supplemental tests, compared with habitual near vision in both adults and children. Binocular spherical blur had the most detrimental effect (p<0.001), followed by binocular astigmatic blur (p<0.001) then monocular spherical blur (p = 0.022).In individuals with uncorrected spherical or astigmatic ametropia, reduced scores on the Beery VMI and its supplemental tests may be due to impaired near visual acuity and not reflect reduced visual-motor abilities. This highlights the importance of excluding reduced near visual acuity as a cause of reduced performance before diagnosing impairment and initiating treatment strategies for visual-motor integration."
https://openalex.org/W3081261611,"Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are prototypical dual function proteins that function as coupled glutamate/Na+/H+/K+ transporters and as anion-selective channels. Both transport functions are intimately intertwined at the structural level: Secondary active glutamate transport is based on elevator-like movements of the mobile transport domain across the membrane, and the lateral movement of this domain results in anion channel opening. This particular anion channel gating mechanism predicts the existence of mutant transporters with changed anion channel properties, but without alteration in glutamate transport. We here report that the L46P mutation in the human EAAT2 transporter fulfills this prediction. L46 is a pore-forming residue of the EAAT2 anion channels at the cytoplasmic entrance into the ion conduction pathway. In whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we observed larger macroscopic anion current amplitudes for L46P than for WT EAAT2. Rapid l-glutamate application under forward transport conditions demonstrated that L46P does not reduce the transport rate of individual transporters. In contrast, changes in selectivity made gluconate permeant in L46P EAAT2, and nonstationary noise analysis revealed slightly increased unitary current amplitudes in mutant EAAT2 anion channels. We used unitary current amplitudes and individual transport rates to quantify absolute open probabilities of EAAT2 anion channels from ratios of anion currents by glutamate uptake currents. This analysis revealed up to 7-fold increased absolute open probability of L46P EAAT2 anion channels. Our results reveal an important determinant of the diameter of EAAT2 anion pore and demonstrate the existence of anion channel gating processes outside the EAAT uptake cycle."

Bhutan is home to two species of bears: Sloth Bear and Himalayan Black Bear. Human conflicts with bears are reported from all over the country. This study describes the profile of the victims and the pattern of injury resulting from bear attacks and circumstances around human conflicts with bears in Bhutan between 2015 and 2019. This was a cross-sectional study with a review of hospital records of patients treated at the National Referral Hospital from 01 January 2015 till 31 December 2019. Data were extracted into a structured pro forma and entered into EpiData Entry 3.1 and analysed in STATA 13.1. There were thirty-four patients who were provided care for bear maul injuries, with an average annual caseload of 6.8 cases per year. The injury prevalence was 100% and the kill prevalence was 0%. Bear attacks were reported from fourteen of twenty districts of the country. The mean age of the victims was 49 (±13) years. Males (26, 76%) and farmers (26, 76%) were the common victims; the risk of bear attacks was 0.16 per 100,000 farmers per year. The commonest region of the body attacked was the face (29, 85%) and victims were provided emergency and rehabilitative care within and outside the country. Thirty-three victims (97%) were provided post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies. All victims received antibiotics despite the lack of national guidelines on the choice of antibiotics post-bear maul. Human-bear conflict is multi-faceted, puts a considerable strain on bear-conservation efforts and requires multi-disciplinary efforts in the prevention of human injury and socioeconomic losses."
https://openalex.org/W3080942406,"BuGZ is a kinetochore component that binds to and stabilizes Bub3, a key player in mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. Bub3 is required for kinetochore recruitment of Bub1 and BubR1, two proteins that have essential and distinct roles in the checkpoint. Both Bub1 and BubR1 localize to kinetochores through interactions with Bub3, which are mediated through conserved GLEBS domains in both Bub1 and BubR1. BuGZ also has a GLEBS domain, which is required for its kinetochore localization as well, presumably mediated through Bub3 binding. Although much is understood about the requirements for Bub1 and BubR1 interaction with Bub3 and kinetochores, much less is known regarding BuGZ's requirements. Here, we used a series of mutants to demonstrate that BuGZ kinetochore localization requires only its core GLEBS domain, which is distinct from the requirements for both Bub1 and BubR1. Furthermore, we found that the kinetics of Bub1, BubR1, and BuGZ loading to kinetochores differ, with BuGZ localizing prior to BubR1 and Bub1. To better understand how complexes containing Bub3 and its binding partners are loaded to kinetochores, we carried out size-exclusion chromatography and analyzed Bub3-containing complexes from cells under different spindle assembly checkpoint signaling conditions. We found that prior to kinetochore formation, Bub3 is complexed with BuGZ but not Bub1 or BubR1. Our results point to a model in which BuGZ stabilizes Bub3 and promotes Bub3 loading onto kinetochores in early mitosis, which, in turn, facilitates Bub1 and BubR1 kinetochore recruitment and spindle assembly checkpoint signaling."

The original streams, they argued, are now buried beneath millions of tons of legacy sediment that was released by colonial-era farming and logging, and then trapped behind countless dams built to power flour, timber, and textile mills. The work challenged conventional wisdom and challenged restoration practices.

https://openalex.org/W3080345728,"Humans are reshaping the world9s mud supply, altering where—and how fast—it piles up. Thousands of years ago, our ancestors caused erosion rates to surge by starting to clear forests and plant crops, muddying lakes and rivers. Today, deforestation and urbanization are causing some rivers to carry more sediment, even as dams and efforts to curb erosion choke off sediment supplies to other waterways. Such changes, together with precipitation shifts driven by climate change, are leading to sometimes dramatic transformations in river deltas, coastal mud flats, and the amount of mud that ultimately collects at the bottom of the sea. Graphs, charts, and maps help tell this story."
https://openalex.org/W3081328654,"Calmodulin (CaM) regulation of voltage-gated calcium (CaV1-2) channels is a powerful Ca2+-feedback mechanism to adjust channel activity in response to Ca2+ influx. Despite progress in resolving mechanisms of CaM-CaV feedback, the stoichiometry of CaM interaction with CaV channels remains ambiguous. Functional studies that tethered CaM to CaV1.2 suggested that a single CaM sufficed for Ca2+ feedback, yet biochemical, FRET, and structural studies showed that multiple CaM molecules interact with distinct interfaces within channel cytosolic segments, suggesting that functional Ca2+ regulation may be more nuanced. Resolving this ambiguity is critical as CaM is enriched in subcellular domains where CaV channels reside, such as the cardiac dyad. We here localized multiple CaMs to the CaV nanodomain by tethering either WT or mutant CaM that lack Ca2+-binding capacity to the pore-forming α-subunit of CaV1.2, CaV1.3, and CaV2.1 and/or the auxiliary β2A subunit. We observed that a single CaM tethered to either the α or β2A subunit tunes Ca2+ regulation of CaV channels. However, when multiple CaMs are localized concurrently, CaV channels preferentially respond to signaling from the α-subunit-tethered CaM. Mechanistically, the introduction of a second IQ domain to the CaV1.3 carboxyl tail switched the apparent functional stoichiometry, permitting two CaMs to mediate functional regulation. In all, Ca2+ feedback of CaV channels depends exquisitely on a single CaM preassociated with the α-subunit carboxyl tail. Additional CaMs that colocalize with the channel complex are unable to trigger Ca2+-dependent feedback of channel gating but may support alternate regulatory functions."
https://openalex.org/W3081346895,"An important context in which metabolism influences tumorigenesis is the genetic cancer syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC), a disease in which mutation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) causes hyperaccumulation of fumarate. This electrophilic oncometabolite can alter gene activity at the level of transcription, via reversible inhibition of epigenetic dioxygenases, as well as posttranslationally, via covalent modification of cysteine residues. To better understand the potential for metabolites to influence posttranslational modifications important to tumorigenesis and cancer cell growth, here we report a chemoproteomic analysis of a kidney-derived HLRCC cell line. Using a general reactivity probe, we generated a data set of proteomic cysteine residues sensitive to the reduction in fumarate levels caused by genetic reintroduction of active FH into HLRCC cell lines. This revealed a broad up-regulation of cysteine reactivity upon FH rescue, which evidence suggests is caused by an approximately equal proportion of transcriptional and posttranslational modification–mediated regulation. Gene ontology analysis highlighted several new targets and pathways potentially modulated by FH mutation. Comparison of the new data set with prior studies highlights considerable heterogeneity in the adaptive response of cysteine-containing proteins in different models of HLRCC. This is consistent with emerging studies indicating the existence of cell- and tissue-specific cysteine-omes, further emphasizing the need for characterization of diverse models. Our analysis provides a resource for understanding the proteomic adaptation to fumarate accumulation and a foundation for future efforts to exploit this knowledge for cancer therapy."

The SRR adhesin from Streptococcus sanguinis strain SK1 has tandem sialoglycan-binding domains and has previously been shown to bind sialoglycans with high affinity. However, both domains contain substitutions within the canonical YTRY motif, making it unclear how they interact with host receptors. To identify how the S. sanguinis strain SK1 SRR adhesin affects interactions with sialylated glycans and glycoproteins, we determined high-resolution crystal structures of the binding domains alone and with purified trisaccharides. These structural studies determined that the ligands still bind at the noncanonical binding motif, but with fewer hydrogen-bonding interactions to the protein than is observed in structures of other Siglec-like adhesins. Complementary biochemical studies identified that each of the two binding domains has a different selectivity profile. Interestingly, the binding of SK1 to platelets and plasma glycoproteins identified that the interaction to some host targets is dominated by the contribution of one binding domain, whereas the binding to other host receptors is mediated by both binding domains. These results provide insight into outstanding questions concerning the roles of tandem domains in targeting host receptors and suggest mechanisms for how pathogens can adapt to the availability of a range of related but nonidentical host receptors.

The serine-rich repeat (SRR) adhesins are a family of bacterial cell-surface glycoproteins containing two sequence motifs where serine constitutes ∼50% of the sequence (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1).

A survey of NCBI GenBankTM identified over a thousand sequences that may belong to this family. Indeed, all sequenced strains of Streptococcus gordonii and S. sanguinis encode serine-rich repeat adhesins (3Zheng W. Tan M.F. Old L.A. Paterson I.C. Jakubovics N.S. Choo S.W.

One known functional role of these SRR adhesins is to mediate attachment to protein or glycoprotein receptors, which allows for adherence to host tissues.

Despite the conserved functional organization (Fig. 1), the ligand-binding regions are highly diverse with species-specific trends in the binding region type.

Interaction of the S. gordonii and S. sanguinis SRR adhesins with host sialoglycan structures relies upon a domain within the binding region related in fold to mammalian sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs); indeed both are organized around a V-set Ig fold (6Bensing B.A. Khedri Z.

Termed the Unique domain, this C-terminal region has no counterpart in mammalian Siglecs, and its function remains unknown. Despite the conserved fold in the Siglec domain, the binding location for sialoglycans differs between the bacterial Siglec-like adhesins and mammalian Siglecs. The streptococcal Siglec-like adhesins hydrogen-bond with sialic acid via a semiconserved YTRY sequence motif on the F strand of the V-set Ig fold (Fig. 2) (6Bensing B.A. Khedri Z. Deng L. Yu H.

Of these, the first Tyr residue contributes only backbone interactions to the ligand. Here, the aromatic side chain faces away from the binding site and is involved in packing interactions that likely contribute to the correct presentation of central Thr-Arg. Thr-Arg makes multiple key side-chain hydrogen-bonding contacts to the sialic acid of host sialoglycans, and therefore the sequence of these central residues appears to be the most important for binding (16Pyburn T.M.

Moreover, isogenic strains of streptococci containing mutations in the YTRY motif exhibit reduced virulence in an animal model (21Bensing B.A. Li L. Yakovenko O. Wong M. Barnard K.N. Iverson T.M.

The final Tyr of the motif contributes a single hydrogen bond to the subterminal galactose of α2,3-sialoglycans and is therefore not involved in sialic acid recognition but may contribute to overall binding affinity of sialoglycans (16Pyburn T.M. Bensing B.A. Xiong Y.Q. Melancon B.J. Tomasiak T.M. Ward N.J. Yankovskaya V. Oliver K.M. Cecchini G. Sulikowski G.A. Tyska M.J. Sullam P.M. Iverson T.M.

Recent structural and engineering studies revealed that sialoglycan binding and selectivity are also affected by three adjacent loops of high sequence diversity (18Bensing B.A. Loukachevitch L.V.

Using nomenclature from the V-set Ig fold identified them as the CD loop, the EF loop, and the FG loop (16Pyburn T.M. Bensing B.A. Xiong Y.Q. Melancon B.J. Tomasiak T.M. Ward N.J. Yankovskaya V.

As a result, they have been termed “selectivity loops” (18Bensing B.A. Loukachevitch L.V. Agarwal R. Yamakawa I. Luong K. Hadadianpour A. Yu H. Fialkowski K.P. Castro M.A. Wawrzak Z. Chen X.

The only structurally characterized Siglec-like binding region that differs somewhat in the topology of its binding pocket is found in SrpA from S. sanguinis strain SK36. In SrpABR, the YTRY sequence is a noncanonical FTRT but retains the central Thr-Arg important for ligand binding (17Loukachevitch L.V. Bensing B.A. Yu H. Zeng J. Chen X. Sullam P.M. Iverson T.M. Structures of the Streptococcus sanguinis SrpA binding region with human sialoglycans suggest features of the physiological ligand.Biochemistry. 2016; 55 (27685666): 5927-593710.1021/acs.biochem.6b00704Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Bensing B.A. Loukachevitch L.V.

Notably, SrpABR contains a second Arg residue outside of the canonical binding sequence motif (Fig. 2) that cooperates with the noncanonical FTRT sequence to promote sialoglycan binding (17Loukachevitch L.V. Bensing B.A. Yu H. Zeng J. Chen X. Sullam P.M. Iverson T.M. Structures of the Streptococcus sanguinis SrpA binding region with human sialoglycans suggest features of the physiological ligand.Biochemistry. 2016; 55 (27685666): 5927-593710.1021/acs.biochem.6b00704Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Bensing B.A. Loukachevitch L.V.

This residue is not highly conserved in the Siglec-like binding regions (Fig. 2) and is located too far from the FTRT motif to interact with a bound trisaccharide. However, structures of SrpABR show that the binding pocket is contiguous with this distal arginine both because of the presence of a Thr versus Tyr in the fourth position of the YTRY motif and because of the absence of the FG loop. These alterations extend the glycan-binding site, which may allow the accommodation of either two oriented trisaccharides or larger, branched sialoglycans. Indeed, a disialylated hexasaccharide has been modeled into this site with the distal arginine binding to the second sialic acid of this significantly larger and disialylated ligand (17Loukachevitch L.V. Bensing B.A. Yu H. Zeng J. Chen X. Sullam P.M. Iverson T.M. Structures of the Streptococcus sanguinis SrpA binding region with human sialoglycans suggest features of the physiological ligand.Biochemistry. 2016; 55 (27685666): 5927-593710.1021/acs.biochem.6b00704Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The binding region from S. sanguinis strain SK1 (residues 252–660 and termed SK1BR) differs from structurally characterized Siglec-containing binding regions in two ways (6Bensing B.A. Khedri Z. Deng L. Yu H. Prakobphol A. Fisher S.J. Chen X. Iverson T.M. Varki A. Sullam P.M. Novel aspects of sialoglycan recognition by the Siglec-like domains of streptococcal SRR glycoproteins.Glycobiology. 2016; 26 (27037304): 1222-123410.1093/glycob/cww042PubMed Google Scholar). First, it contains two copies of the Siglec and Unique domains in tandem (SK1Siglec1-SK1Unique1-SK1Siglec2-SK1Unique2) (Fig. S1) with sequence identity/similarity of 39%/56% between the two Siglec domains and 44%/50% between the two Unique domains. Tandem domains are rarely observed in sequences of the Siglec-like adhesins. Only eight other tandem domain Siglec-like binding regions are identifiable in GenBankTM. Seven of the eight SRR adhesins have ≥94% identity and ≥96% similarity to SK1BR; these adhesins are from various strains of S. sanguinis and one from Streptococcus cristatus (Fig. S1). The other adhesin containing a tandem domain is FapC from S. oralis subsp. dentisani strain F0392 (Fig. S1) (4Ronis A. Brockman K. Singh A.K. Gaytán M.O. Wong A. McGrath S. Owen C.D. Magrini V. Wilson R.K. van der Linden M. King S.J. Streptococcus oralis subsp. dentisani produces monolateral serine-rich repeat protein fibrils, one of which contributes to saliva binding via sialic acid.Infect. Immun. 2019; 87 (31308084): e00406-e0041910.1128/IAI.00406-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), in which the FapCBR-binding region exhibits 25% identity and 39% similarity to SK1BR. This evolutionary relatedness is consistent with evidence that FapCBR may bind sialoglycans and may be important for oral colonization (4Ronis A. Brockman K. Singh A.K. Gaytán M.O. Wong A. McGrath S. Owen C.D. Magrini V. Wilson R.K. van der Linden M. King S.J.

The second way that SK1BR differs from other structurally characterized Siglec-like binding regions is that each of the putative Siglec domains of SK1BR contains a noncanonical YTRY sialic acid–binding sequence motif that lacks the central Thr-Arg deemed to be critical for binding in other Siglec-like adhesins (6Bensing B.A. Khedri Z. Deng L. Yu H. Prakobphol A. Fisher S.J. Chen X. Iverson T.M. Varki A. Sullam P.M. Novel aspects of sialoglycan recognition by the Siglec-like domains of streptococcal SRR glycoproteins.Glycobiology. 2016; 26 (27037304): 1222-123410.1093/glycob/cww042PubMed Google Scholar). This motif in SK1Siglec1 is YTKY, and the motif in SK1Siglec2 is YTFK (6Bensing B.A. Khedri Z. Deng L. Yu H. Prakobphol A. Fisher S.J. Chen X. Iverson T.M. Varki A. Sullam P.M. Novel aspects of sialoglycan recognition by the Siglec-like domains of streptococcal SRR glycoproteins.Glycobiology. 2016; 26 (27037304): 1222-123410.1093/glycob/cww042PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that SK1BR binds sialoglycans (6Bensing B.A. Khedri Z. Deng L. Yu H. Prakobphol A. Fisher S.J. Chen X. Iverson T.M. Varki A. Sullam P.M. Novel aspects of sialoglycan recognition by the Siglec-like domains of streptococcal SRR glycoproteins.Glycobiology. 2016; 26 (27037304): 1222-123410.1093/glycob/cww042PubMed Google Scholar), it was unknown whether both Siglec domains could bind sialoglycans. If so, what is the relative contribution of each to binding? How do the noncanonical YTRY sequence motifs, particularly in SK1Siglec2, maintain the interaction with host receptors? Here, we present crystal structures of unliganded and sialoglycan-bound SK1BR, which show that both SK1Siglec1 and SK1Siglec2 adopt V-set Ig folds and that both domains interact with sialoglycan ligands at the noncanonical YTRY motifs. We validate these interactions using binding studies of isolated SK1Siglec1+Unique1 and SK1Siglec2+Unique2 and demonstrate that each domain has a distinct selectivity profile for synthetic sialoglycans and glycoprotein ligands. The tandem domains allow increased binding to a host salivary glycoprotein, MUC7, via an avidity effect, possibly by binding simultaneously to two oriented, large glycans. In contrast, platelet binding mainly occurs via SK1Siglec2, and binding to the plasma glycoprotein PRG4 (also called lubricin) mainly occurs via SK1Siglec1. Taken together, these findings support a mechanism of host interaction in which the tandem domains of the S. sanguinis strain SK1 adhesin interact most strongly with a patch of oriented large glycans and indicate that each individual domain differently impacts binding to sialoglycoprotein targets. This adhesin architecture therefore allows for increased flexibility and breadth in the host receptors that are recognized. To develop hypotheses for how SK1BR binds to sialoglycans, we began by determining its X-ray crystal structure using molecular replacement methods (Table 1, Table 2). The tandem repeats of unliganded SK1BR fold independently, and slight angles between the domains yield an elongated and overall arc shape (Fig. 3). The limits of the domains can be clearly distinguished as"

Virus is cleared by day 9, and between days 8 and 9 there is an abrupt change in CD8 T cell motility behavior transitioning from low velocity and high confinement on day 8, to high velocity with continued high confinement on day 9. We hypothesized that loss of virus and/or antigen signals in the context of high chemokine levels drives the T cells into a rapid surveillance mode. Virus infection induces chemokine production, which may change when the virus is cleared. We therefore sought to examine this period of rapid changes to the T cell environment in the tissue and seek evidence on the roles of peptide-MHC and chemokine receptor interactions. Experiments were performed to block G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling with Pertussis toxin (Ptx). Ptx treatment generally reduced cell velocities and mildly increased confinement suggesting chemokine mediated arrest (velocity <2 μm/min) (Friedman RS, 2005), except on day 8 when velocity increased and confinement was relieved. Blocking specific peptide-MHC with monoclonal antibody unexpectedly decreased velocities on days 7 through 9, suggesting TCR/peptide-MHC interactions promote cell mobility in the tissue. Together, these results suggest the T cells are engaged with antigen bearing and chemokine producing cells that affect motility in ways that vary with the day after infection. The increase in velocities on day 9 were reversed by addition of specific peptide, consistent with the idea that antigen signals become limiting on day 9 compared to earlier time points. Thus, antigen and chemokine signals act to alternately promote and restrict CD8 T cell motility until the point of virus clearance, suggesting the switch in motility behavior on day 9 may be due to a combination of limiting antigen in the presence of high chemokine signals as the virus is cleared."

https://openalex.org/W3080260196,"The discoverers of electric microbes have been quick to think about how these bacteria can be put to work. One potential use is to detect and control pollutants. Cable microbes seem to thrive in the presence of organic compounds, such as petroleum, so their presence may reveal undetected pollution. They might also aid cleanup, not just of organic compounds, but also nuclear waste. Electric bacteria are also giving rise to new technologies. Some have been genetically modified with the goal of making sensitive, wearable sensors. And fashioned into a film, nanowires also generate electricity from the moisture in the air. Now that researchers have coaxed a common lab and industrial bacterium, it should be easier for researchers to mass produce the structures and explore these and other practical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3080358943,"To assess the impact of two different respiratory rates in hemodynamic, perfusion and ventilation parameters in a pediatric animal model of cardiac arrest (CA).An experimental randomized controlled trial was carried out in 50 piglets under asphyxial CA. After ROSC, they were randomized into two groups: 20 and 30 respirations per minute (rpm). Hemodynamic, perfusion and ventilation parameters were measured 10 minutes after asphyxia, just before ROSC and at 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after ROSC. Independent medians test, Kruskal-Wallis test and χ2 test, were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Spearman's Rho was used to assess correlation between continuous variables. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.Arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) was significantly lower in the 30 rpm group after 15 minutes (41 vs. 54.5 mmHg, p <0.01), 30 minutes (39.5 vs. 51 mmHg, p < 0.01) and 60 minutes (36.5 vs. 48 mmHg, p = 0.02) of ROSC. The percentage of normoventilated subjects (PaCO2 30-50 mmHg) was significantly higher in the 30 rpm group throughout the experiment. pH normalization occurred faster in the 30 rpm group with significant differences at 60 minutes (7.40 vs. 7.34, p = 0.02). Lactic acid levels were high immediately after ROSC in both groups, but were significantly lower in the 20 rpm group at 30 (3.7 vs. 4.7 p = 0.04) and 60 minutes (2.6 vs. 3.6 p = 0.03).This animal model of asphyxial CA shows that a respiratory rate of 30 rpm is more effective to reach normoventilation than 20 rpm in piglets after ROSC. This ventilation strategy seems to be safe, as it does not cause hyperventilation and does not affect hemodynamics or cerebral tissue perfusion."
