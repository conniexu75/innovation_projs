We have identified a fasting-induced protein hormone that modulates hepatic glucose release. It is the C-terminal cleavage product of profibrillin, and we name it Asprosin. Asprosin is secreted by white adipose, circulates at nanomolar levels, and is recruited to the liver, where it activates the G protein-cAMP-PKA pathway, resulting in rapid glucose release into the circulation. Humans and mice with insulin resistance show pathologically elevated plasma asprosin, and its loss of function via immunologic or genetic means has a profound glucose- and insulin-lowering effect secondary to reduced hepatic glucose release. Asprosin represents a glucogenic protein hormone, and therapeutically targeting it may be beneficial in type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

Asprosin represents a glucogenic protein hormone, and therapeutically targeting it may be beneficial in type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Hormones, their receptors, and the associated signaling pathways make compelling drug targets because of their wide-ranging biological significance (Behrens and Bromer, 1958Behrens O.K. Bromer W.W. Biochemistry of the protein hormones.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1958; 27: 57-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Protein hormones, as a subclass, have defining characteristics. They usually (but not always) result from cleavage of a larger proprotein and, upon secretion, traffic via the circulation to a target organ. There they bind a target cell using a cell-surface receptor, displaying high affinity, saturability, and ability to be competed off. They stimulate rapid signal transduction using a second-messenger system, followed by a measurable physiological consequence. Given the brain’s strict dependence on glucose as a fuel, plasma glucose levels are precisely regulated by an array of hormones (Aronoff et al., 2004Aronoff S.L. Berkowitz K. Shreiner B. Glucose metabolism and regulation: beyond insulin and glucagon.Diabetes Spectr. 2004; 17: 183-190Crossref Google Scholar). Some are secreted in response to nutritional cues, while others respond to glucose itself, producing highly coordinated and precise regulation of circulating glucose levels. Perturbations in this system can cause pathological alteration in glucose levels, often with severe consequences. We have discovered a protein hormone that regulates glucose homeostasis. It is the C-terminal cleavage product of profibrillin (encoded by FBN1). Its absence in humans results in a unique pattern of metabolic dysregulation that includes partial lipodystrophy, accompanied by reduced plasma insulin, while maintaining euglycemia. We name it Asprosin, after the Greek word for white (ασπροσ), because of the reduction in subcutaneous white adipose tissue that is displayed by asprosin-deficient patients and because white adipose tissue appears to be a source of plasma asprosin. Neonatal progeroid syndrome (NPS) was first described in 1977 (OMIM: 264090) and is characterized by congenital, partial lipodystrophy, predominantly affecting the face and extremities (O’Neill et al., 2007O’Neill B. Simha V. Kotha V. Garg A. Body fat distribution and metabolic variables in patients with neonatal progeroid syndrome.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2007; 143A: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although NPS patients appear progeroid because of facial dysmorphic features and reduced subcutaneous fat, the term is a misnomer as the patients do not display accelerated aging. We identified two unrelated individuals with NPS. We examined their glucose and insulin homeostasis status, since both partial and generalized lipodystrophic disorders are frequently associated with insulin resistance (Bindlish et al., 2015Bindlish S. Presswala L.S. Schwartz F. Lipodystrophy: syndrome of severe insulin resistance.Postgrad. Med. 2015; 127: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Contrary to this notion, overnight-fasted plasma insulin levels from our NPS patients were 2-fold lower than unaffected subjects, while maintaining euglycemia (Figure 1A). Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing identified de novo, heterozygous 3′ truncating mutations in FBN1 in both patients (Figures 1B and 1C). Upon reaching the genetic diagnosis, we searched the literature for similar cases and discovered five single-patient case reports of NPS associated with FBN1 3′ truncating mutations (Goldblatt et al., 2011Goldblatt J.

A. 2013; 161A: 3057-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All seven subjects, including the two reported herein, were diagnosed with NPS, and all have truncating mutations within a 71-bp segment at the 3′ end of the FBN1 coding region, displaying tight genotype-phenotype correlation (Figure 1D). All seven mutations occur 3′ to the last 50 nt of the penultimate exon and are therefore predicted to escape mRNA nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), leading to expression of a mutant, truncated profibrillin protein (Figure 1E). Profibrillin is translated as a 2,871-amino-acid long proprotein, which is cleaved at the C terminus by the protease furin (Lönnqvist et al., 1998Lönnqvist L. Reinhardt D. Sakai L. Peltonen L.

A mutation in FBN1 disrupts profibrillin processing and results in isolated skeletal features of the Marfan syndrome.J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2373-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This generates a 140-amino-acid long C-terminal cleavage product, in addition to mature fibrillin-1 (an extracellular matrix component). All seven NPS mutations are clustered around the cleavage site, resulting in heterozygous ablation of the C-terminal cleavage product (asprosin) (Figure 1E), whose fate and function were unknown. Asprosin is encoded by the ultimate two exons of FBN1. Exon 65 encodes 11 amino acids, while exon 66 encodes 129 amino acids. Together, those two exons display a somewhat higher vertebrate evolutionary conservation score compared with the rest of the profibrillin coding sequence (Figures S1A and S1B). We developed an asprosin-specific monoclonal antibody and validated its specificity for asprosin using Fbn1 wild-type (WT) and null cells (Figure S1C). Immunoblotting human plasma with the anti-asprosin antibody shows a single protein running on SDS-PAGE at ∼30 kDa, while bacterially expressed recombinant asprosin runs at ∼17 kDa (Figure 2A). Asprosin is predicted to have three N-linked glycosylation sites and potentially other post-translational modifications that are lacking in bacteria (Figures S1D and S1E). This likely explains the difference in molecular weight between mammalian and bacterially expressed asprosin. Indeed, using mammalian cells for expression of asprosin produced a protein that was secreted into the media and ran on SDS-PAGE at the same molecular weight (∼30 kDa) (Lönnqvist et al., 1998Lönnqvist L. Reinhardt D. Sakai L. Peltonen L. Evidence for furin-type activity-mediated C-terminal processing of profibrillin-1 and interference in the processing by certain mutations.Hum. Mol.

Adipogenesis was confirmed by visualization of lipid droplets (not shown) and expression of the adipogenic master gene – PPARg2 (Figure 2J). To measure circulating asprosin levels, we developed a sandwich ELISA (Figure S3A). We constructed a standard curve using recombinant asprosin and used it to calculate plasma and media levels (Figure 2B). As expected, the asprosin sandwich ELISA displayed high specificity using media from WT and Fbn1−/− cells (Figure S3C). Asprosin was found to be present in plasma at consistent nanomolar levels in humans, mice, and rats (Figure 2C). Interestingly, NPS patients displayed a greater reduction in circulating asprosin level than predicted from their heterozygous genotype, compared not only with WT control subjects but also when compared with patients that have heterozygous truncations of profibrillin sufficiently N-terminal so as to undergo mRNA nonsense-mediated decay (Figure 2D). This suggests that the mutant profibrillin that is predicted to be expressed in NPS cells (due to escape from mRNA NMD) exerts a dominant-negative effect on secretion of asprosin from the WT allele. We tested this concept by overexpressing the truncated, mutant version of profibrillin in WT cells and found that this interfered with the ability of those cells to secrete asprosin into the media, compared with overexpression of an irrelevant protein, such as GFP (Figures S3E and S3F). To assess daily fluctuations in circulating asprosin concentrations, mice were kept in a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle for 7 days to establish entrainment and were subsequently kept in constant darkness. Plasma was then isolated from these mice at 4-hr intervals and subjected to asprosin ELISA analysis. We found that plasma asprosin displays circadian oscillation with an acute drop in levels coinciding with the onset of feeding (Figure 2E). In the opposite direction, overnight fasting in humans, mice, and rats resulted in increased circulating asprosin (Figure 2F). We examined the FBN1 mRNA profile across all human tissues using the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTex) RNaseq dataset and found that adipose tissue demonstrated the highest FBN1 mRNA expression across all tissues (Figure 2G). To confirm this in mice, we assessed the Fbn1 expression profile across various metabolically important organs. Consistent with the human profile, we found that white adipose tissue displayed the highest Fbn1 mRNA expression (Figure 2H). Given that white adipose tissue is a well-known endocrine organ (Trayhurn et al., 2006Trayhurn P. Bing C. Wood I.S. Adipose tissue and adipokines--energy regulation from the human perspective.J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 1935S-1939SPubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether it could serve as a source of circulating asprosin. We assessed plasma levels of asprosin in mice that had been subjected to genetic ablation of adipose tissue. We used Bscl2−/− mice for this purpose. BSCL2 deficiency results in Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy in humans (knockout mice mimic this phenotype) with a 60%–70% reduction in adipose tissue (Cui et al., 2011Cui X. Wang Y. Tang Y. Liu Y. Zhao L. Deng J. Xu G. Peng X. Ju S. Liu G. Yang H. Seipin ablation in mice results in severe generalized lipodystrophy.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20: 3022-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In such mice we detected a ∼2-fold reduction in plasma asprosin (Figure 2I). The next experimental strategy we employed was to assess whether adipocytes in culture were capable of generating and secreting asprosin. For this, we differentiated two distinct adipogenic cell lines, 3T3-L1 and a mesenchymal stem cell line (C3H10T1/2), into mature adipocytes (Figures 2J and 2K) and subjected the cell culture media to asprosin protein analysis. We found robust accumulation of asprosin in serum-free culture media from mature adipocytes, but not from preadipocytes (Figures 2J and 2K), suggesting that adipocytes are capable of generating and secreting asprosin. We employed ectopic overexpression of full-length FBN1 using an adenovirus in the hope that the transduced organ (in this case, the liver, which normally shows low endogenous FBN1 expression [Figures 2G and 2H] and is the primary target of adenoviral infection) would process the resultant profibrillin and secrete asprosin into the circulation. This strategy showed robust overexpression of profibrillin protein in the liver and a 2-fold elevation in plasma asprosin (Figures 3A and 3B ). The second strategy involved daily subcutaneous injection of bacterially expressed asprosin (validated to result in a 50 nM peak level 20 min after injection; Figure 5D) or recombinant GFP as a control. 10 days of exposure to increased plasma asprosin in either a continuous (adenoviral overexpression) or pulsatile fashion (daily recombinant asprosin injection) resulted in elevated glucose and insulin levels in 2-hr fasted mice using both experimental strategies (Figures 3C and 3D). This result demonstrated that bacterially expressed recombinant asprosin retains the biological activity displayed by its endogenously expressed counterpart and that elevation of circulating asprosin is sufficient to increase blood glucose and insulin levels. In order to understand acute responses, we injected a single dose of recombinant asprosin subcutaneously in mice that had been subjected to a preceding 2-hr fast, and measured plasma glucose at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min post-injection. Mice were denied access to food through the length of the experiment. A single asprosin dose resulted in an immediate spike in blood glucose levels (Figure 3E). This resulted in compensatory hyperinsulinemia (measured at the 15-min time point) (Figure 3F), which normalized blood glucose levels by 60 min post-injection (Figure 3E). Similar results were obtained in mice that were subjected to a preceding overnight fast, although the rate of the resultant blood glucose spike was somewhat slower, likely due to fasting-induced depletion of glucogenic substrates (Figures 3G and 3H). These results implicated the liver as the target organ for asprosin due to its role as the primary site for stored glucose (as glycogen), which is rapidly released into the circulation during fasting. Interestingly, asprosin treatment had no effect on plasma levels of catabolic hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, and glucocorticoids), known to induce hepatic glucose release (Figure 3I). Glucose and insulin tolerance tests in mice exposed to a single dose of recombinant asprosin showed little evidence of altered glucose uptake (in response to insulin) in peripheral organs, such as muscle or fat (unchanged slope of glucose disposal), but showed altered peak glucose levels, again implicating the liver (Figures 4A and 4B ). To confirm the liver as the site of asprosin action, we performed the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. This test unequivocally showed that elevated plasma asprosin results in increased hepatic glucose production (Figure 4C), but has no impact on the ability of peripheral organs to take up glucose in response to insulin (Figure 4D). To test whether the effect of asprosin on the liver is cell autonomous, we exposed isolated primary mouse hepatocytes to increasing concentrations of recombinant asprosin or GFP for 2 hr. Media from cells exposed to asprosin showed an increase in glucose concentration in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating a direct effect of asprosin on hepatocytes (Figure 4E). We labeled recombinant asprosin with iodine-125 (I125) and injected it intravenously in mice, followed by single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scans to identify sites of accumulation. An equivalent amount of free I125 or I125-Asprosin that was boiled for 5 min (to induce loss of the asprosin tertiary structure) was used as a control. In contrast to the accumulation patterns for free I125 and boiled I125-Asprosin, SPECT scans in coronal and axial planes (Figure 5A), and mean liver photon intensity (Figure 5B), both showed that I125-Asprosin trafficked primarily to the liver and that asprosin’s tertiary structure was essential for its liver recruitment. In accord with liver trafficking, gamma counting of blood and viscera showed that recombinant blood asprosin levels decrease in concert with the increased liver levels (Figure 5C). To measure plasma half-life, we used a sandwich ELISA system targeting the N-terminal His-tag on the recombinant asprosin protein at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min following subcutaneous injection. Consistent with our results using IV infusion of I125-Asprosin, plasma His-tagged asprosin showed a half-life of approximately 20 min and a peak level of 50 nM that was achieved 20 min post-injection (Figure 5D). To examine specific binding of asprosin by hepatocytes, we incubated mouse primary hepatocytes with an increasing amount of an asprosin-biotin conjugate, washed with PBS, and measured the relative level of biotin at the hepatocyte surface. Asprosin bound the hepatocyte surface in a dose-responsive and saturable manner (Figure 5E). Repeating the same procedure in the presence of 100-fold excess unconjugated asprosin abolished the effect, suggesting competition for potential receptor binding sites (Figure 5E). Exposing mice to a single 30-μg dose of recombinant asprosin for 20 min (validated to result in a 50-nM peak level) was sufficient to increase liver cyclic AMP (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) activity (Figures 6A–6C). Identical results were obtained upon incubating mouse primary hepatocytes with recombinant asprosin for 10 min (Figures 6D and 6E). Hepatocyte PKA activity increased in a dose-responsive manner upon addition of recombinant asprosin (Figure 6F), similar to what we observed with hepatocyte glucose release (Figure 4E). The effects of asprosin on both hepatocyte glucose release and PKA activation were blocked by suramin, a general heterotrimeric G protein inhibitor (Figures 6G and 6H). In addition, asprosin-mediated hepatocyte glucose release could be blocked by using cAMPS-Rp, a competitive antagonist of cAMP binding to PKA (Figure 6I). These results demonstrate that asprosin increases hepatocyte glucose release by employing the G protein-cAMP-PKA axis in vivo and in vitro. Because glucagon and catecholamines also employ the same intracellular signaling axis, we tested the impact of inhibiting the glucagon receptor or the β-adrenergic receptor on the ability of asprosin to enhance hepatocyte glucose release. While the respective inhibitors completely blocked the effects of glucagon or epinephrine, they had no impact on the ability of asprosin to influence hepatocyte glucose release (Figures 6J and 6K). This suggests that asprosin uses a cell-surface receptor system that is distinct from those used by glucagon and catecholamines. Since insulin is known to induce a reduction in intracellular cAMP (via activation of the Gai pathway), we tested whether insulin would oppose asprosin’s effect on hepatocyte PKA activation and glucose release, which is demonstrated to be due to an increase in intracellular cAMP. Indeed, we found that insulin suppressed asprosin-mediated hepatocyte PKA activation (Figure 6L) and glucose release (Figure 6M). We found that plasma asprosin levels are pathologically elevated in human subjects with insulin resistance (Figure 7A). Similar elevations were seen in two independent mouse models of insulin resistance (diet-induced obesity and Ob mutation) (Figure 7B). Intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of an asprosin-specific monoclonal antibody was sufficient to acutely drop plasma asprosin levels at 3 and 6 hr post-injection, with recovery to normal levels at 24 hr (Figure 7C). Both ad-libitum-fed (following a 2-hr fast for synchronization) models of mouse insulin resistance showed an acute reduction in plasma insulin levels (while maintaining euglycemia), concurrent with plasma asprosin depletion (Figures 7D–7G). To directly test the effect of loss of asprosin on hepatocyte glucose production without the potential insulin compensatory effect, we treated mouse primary hepatocytes with the asprosin-specific antibody prior to incubating them with asprosin. As expected, the asprosin-specific antibody blocked asprosin-mediated hepatocyte glucose release, while a non-specific control antibody had no effect (Figure S3D). To validate immunologic sequestration as a legitimate loss-of-function strategy, we tested FBN1 hypomorphic mice (homozygous MgR mice), which express only ∼20% of the WT FBN1 transcript (Pereira et al., 1999Pereira L. Lee S.Y. Gayraud B. Andrikopoulos K. Shapiro S.D. Bunton T. Biery N.J. Dietz H.C. Sakai L.Y. Ramirez F. Pathogenetic sequence for aneurysm revealed in mice underexpressing fibrillin-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 3819-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). MgR mice displayed a 70% decrease in circulating asprosin (Figure 7H). Upon 2 hr of fasting, MgR mice displayed a 2-fold deficit in plasma insulin, while maintaining euglycemia (similar to what we observed with immunologic sequestration of asprosin in ad-libitum-fed mice) (Figures 7I and 7J). However, upon 24 hr of fasting, a physiologic situation that eliminates insulin from the circulation of mice (Figure 7J), MgR mice displayed fasting hypoglycemia (Figure 7I), suggesting that insulin’s buffering effect needs to be eliminated (via a long fast) to unmask the reduction in plasma glucose induced by asprosin loss of function. To confirm this, we performed a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study on MgR mice that had been fasted for ∼18 hr (basal). Under such conditions, we found an acute deficit in hepatic glucose production (HGP) in MgR mice compared with WT mice (Figure 7K). This result is consistent with clamp results showing an increase in HGP upon asprosin gain of function (Figures 4C and 4D). Expectedly, neither clamp study demonstrated a change in whole-body glucose disposal (insulin sensitivity) (Figures 4D and 7L), suggesting that asprosin’s effect on glucose homeostasis is limited to serving as a stimulator of HGP (Figure S4), and any change in plasma insulin levels is indirect and downstream of the change in HGP. Finally, a single subcutaneous administration of asprosin in overnight-fasted MgR mice was sufficient to completely rescue the insulin deficiency displayed by these mice (Figure 7M). This result demonstrates that the insulin deficiency displayed by MgR mice is entirely due to a deficiency in circulating asprosin, and not to some indirect effect of their decreased expression of functional fibrillin protein.

We mine the evolutionary sequence record to derive precise information about the function and structure of RNAs and RNA-protein complexes. As in protein structure prediction, we use maximum entropy global probability models of sequence co-variation to infer evolutionarily constrained nucleotide-nucleotide interactions within RNA molecules and nucleotide-amino acid interactions in RNA-protein complexes. The predicted contacts allow all-atom blinded 3D structure prediction at good accuracy for several known RNA structures and RNA-protein complexes. For unknown structures, we predict contacts in 160 non-coding RNA families. Beyond 3D structure prediction, evolutionary couplings help identify important functional interactions-e.g., at switch points in riboswitches and at a complex nucleation site in HIV. Aided by increasing sequence accumulation, evolutionary coupling analysis can accelerate the discovery of functional interactions and 3D structures involving RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2338022509,"Myeloid cells promote the development of distant metastases, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Here we have begun to uncover the effects of myeloid cells on cancer cells in a mouse model of liver metastasis. Monocytes/macrophages, but not granulocytes, isolated from experimental liver metastases stimulated migration and invasion of MC38 colon and Lewis lung carcinoma cells. In response to conditioned media from tumor-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages, cancer cells upregulated S100a8 and S100a9 messenger RNA expression through an extracellular signal-related kinase-dependent mechanism. Suppression of S100A8 and S100A9 in cancer cells using short hairpin RNA significantly diminished migration and invasion in culture. Downregulation of S100A8 and S100A9 had no effect on subcutaneous tumor growth. However, colony size was greatly reduced in liver metastases with decreased invasion into adjacent tissue. In tissue culture and in the liver colonies derived from cancer cells with knockdown of S100A8 and S100A9, MMP2 and MMP9 expression was decreased, consistent with the reduction in migration and invasion. Our findings demonstrate that monocytes/macrophages in the metastatic liver microenvironment induce S100A8 and S100A9 in cancer cells, and that these proteins are essential for tumor cell migration and invasion. S100A8 and S100A9, however, are not responsible for stimulation of proliferation.

Here, by detailed necropsy studies, we show that the virus can rapidly disseminate following mucosal SIV infection of rhesus monkeys and trigger components of the inflammasome, both at the site of inoculation and at early sites of distal virus spread. By 24 hr following inoculation, a proinflammatory signature that lacked antiviral restriction factors was observed in viral RNA-positive tissues. The early innate response included expression of NLRX1, which inhibits antiviral responses, and activation of the TGF-β pathway, which negatively regulates adaptive immune responses. These data suggest a model in which the virus triggers specific host mechanisms that suppress the generation of antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses in the first few days of infection, thus facilitating its own replication. These findings have important implications for the development of vaccines and other strategies to prevent infection."
https://openalex.org/W2342319815,"Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that may result from recent transmission or from an infection acquired many years in the past; there is no diagnostic test to distinguish the two causes. Cases resulting from recent transmission are particularly concerning from a public health standpoint. To describe recent tuberculosis transmission in the United States, we used a field-validated plausible source-case method to estimate cases likely resulting from recent transmission during January 2011–September 2014. We classified cases as resulting from either limited or extensive recent transmission based on transmission cluster size. We used logistic regression to analyze patient characteristics associated with recent transmission. Of 26,586 genotyped cases, 14% were attributable to recent transmission, 39% of which were attributable to extensive recent transmission. The burden of cases attributed to recent transmission was geographically heterogeneous and poorly predicted by tuberculosis incidence. Extensive recent transmission was positively associated with American Indian/Alaska Native (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 3.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9–4.4), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (aPR = 3.2, 95% CI 2.3–4.5), and black (aPR = 3.0, 95% CI 2.6–3.5) race, and homelessness (aPR = 2.3, 95% CI 2.0–2.5). Extensive recent transmission was negatively associated with foreign birth (aPR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.2–0.2). Tuberculosis control efforts should prioritize reducing transmission among higher-risk populations."
https://openalex.org/W2341698020,"Cis-regulatory elements such as transcription factor (TF) binding sites can be identified genome-wide, but it remains far more challenging to pinpoint genetic variants affecting TF binding. Here, we introduce a pooling-based approach to mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular-level traits. Applying this to five TFs and a histone modification, we mapped thousands of cis-acting QTLs, with over 25-fold lower cost compared to standard QTL mapping. We found that single genetic variants frequently affect binding of multiple TFs, and CTCF can recruit all five TFs to its binding sites. These QTLs often affect local chromatin and transcription but can also influence long-range chromosomal contacts, demonstrating a role for natural genetic variation in chromosomal architecture. Thousands of these QTLs have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, providing candidate molecular mechanisms for many disease risk loci and suggesting that TF binding variation may underlie a large fraction of human phenotypic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2340659766,"Background Cardiac hypertrophy associated with various cardiovascular diseases results in heart failure and sudden death. A clear understanding of the mechanisms of hypertrophy will benefit the development of novel therapies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play essential roles in many biological process, however, whether lncRNA-ROR plays functional roles in the reprogramming of cardiomyocyte remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that lncRNA-ROR plays important roles in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. In hypertrophic heart and cardiomyocytes, the expression of lncRNA-ROR is dramatically increased, downregulation of which attenuates the hypertrophic responses. Furthermore, the expression of lncRNA-ROR negatively correlates with miR-133, whose expression is increased when lncRNA-ROR is knocked down. In line with this, overexpression of miR-133 prevents the elevation of lncRNA-ROR and re-expression of ANP and BNP in cardiomyocytes subject to phenylephrine treatment. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our study demonstrates that lncRNA-ROR promotes cardiac hypertrophy via interacting with miR-133, indicating that lncRNA-ROR could be targeted for developing novel antihypertrophic therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2339624027,"Purpose To evaluate the association of social support status, health insurance and clinical factors with the quality of life of Chinese women with breast cancer. Methods Information on demographics, clinical characteristics, and social support status was collected from 1,160 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer in Shanghai, China. The Perceived Social Support Scale was used to assess different sources of social support for breast cancer patients. The quality of life was evaluated using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer that consisted of five domains: breast cancer-specific, emotional, functional, physical, and social & family well-being. Multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the associations of demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and social support status with the quality of life measures. Results Adequate social support from family members, friends and neighbors, and higher scores of Perceived Social Support Scale were associated with significantly improved quality of life of breast cancer patients. Higher household income, medical insurance plans with low copayment, and treatment with traditional Chinese medicine for breast cancer all were associated with higher (better) scores of quality of life measures whereas patients receiving chemotherapy had significantly lower scores of quality of life. Conclusion Social support and financial aids may significantly improve the quality of life of breast cancer survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2336173751,"Background There is increasing interest in elucidating the association of different childhood adversities with psychosis-spectrum symptoms as well as the mechanistic processes involved. This study used experience sampling methodology to examine (i) associations of a range of childhood adversities with psychosis symptom domains in daily life; (ii) whether associations of abuse and neglect with symptoms are consistent across self-report and interview methods of trauma assessment; and (iii) the role of different adversities in moderating affective, psychotic-like, and paranoid reactivity to situational and social stressors. Method A total of 206 nonclinical young adults were administered self-report and interview measures to assess childhood abuse, neglect, bullying, losses, and general traumatic events. Participants received personal digital assistants that signaled them randomly eight times daily for one week to complete questionnaires about current experiences, including symptoms, affect, and stress. Results Self-reported and interview-based abuse and neglect were associated with psychotic-like and paranoid symptoms, whereas only self-reported neglect was associated with negative-like symptoms. Bullying was associated with psychotic-like symptoms. Losses and general traumatic events were not directly associated with any of the symptom domains. All the childhood adversities were associated with stress reactivity in daily life. Interpersonal adversities (abuse, neglect, bullying, and losses) moderated psychotic-like and/or paranoid reactivity to situational and social stressors, whereas general traumatic events moderated psychotic-like reactivity to situational stress. Also, different interpersonal adversities exacerbated psychotic-like and/or paranoid symptoms in response to distinct social stressors. Discussion The present study provides a unique examination of how childhood adversities impact the expression of spectrum symptoms in the real world and lends support to the notion that stress reactivity is a mechanism implicated in the experience of reality distortion in individuals exposed to childhood trauma. Investigating the interplay between childhood experience and current context is relevant for uncovering potential pathways to the extended psychosis phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2340350163,"Based on the central role of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in the degradation of cellular proteins, proteasome inhibition has been considered an attractive approach for anticancer therapy. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) remove ubiquitin conjugates from diverse substrates; therefore, they are essential regulators of the UPS. DUB inhibitors, especially the inhibitors of proteasomal DUBs are becoming a research hotspot in targeted cancer therapy. Previous studies have shown that metal complexes, such as copper and zinc complexes, can induce cancer cell apoptosis through inhibiting UPS function. Moreover, we have found that copper pyrithione inhibits both 19S proteasome-associated DUBs and 20S proteasome activity with a mechanism distinct from that of the classical 20S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. In the present study, we reveal that (i) nickel pyrithione complex (NiPT) potently inhibits the UPS via targeting the 19S proteasome-associated DUBs (UCHL5 and USP14), without effecting on the 20S proteasome; (ii) NiPT selectively induces proteasome inhibition and apoptosis in cultured tumor cells and cancer cells from acute myeloid leukemia human patients; and (iii) NiPT inhibits proteasome function and tumor growth in nude mice. This study, for the first time, uncovers a nickel complex as an effective inhibitor of the 19S proteasomal DUBs and suggests a potentially new strategy for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2336288341,"Physical activity is an important component of health. Recommendations based on sensor measurements are sparse in older people. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of objectively measured walking and sedentary duration on four-year mortality in community-dwelling older people.Between March 2009 and April 2010, physical activity of 1271 participants (≥65 years, 56.4% men) from Southern Germany was measured over one week using a thigh-worn uni-axial accelerometer (activPAL; PAL Technologies, Glasgow, Scotland). Mortality was assessed during a four-year follow-up. Cox-proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the associations between walking (including low to high intensity) and sedentary duration with mortality. Models were adjusted for age and sex, additional epidemiological variables, and selected biomarkers.An inverse relationship between walking duration and mortality with a minimum risk for the 3rd quartile (102.2 to128.4 minutes walking daily) was found even after multivariate adjustment with HRs for quartiles 2 to 4 compared to quartile 1 of 0.45 (95%-CI: 0.26; 0.76), 0.18 (95%-CI: 0.08; 0.41), 0.39 (95%-CI: 0.19; 0.78), respectively. For sedentary duration an age- and sex-adjusted increased mortality risk was observed for the 4th quartile (daily sedentary duration ≥1137.2 min.) (HR 2.05, 95%-CI: 1.13; 3.73), which diminished, however, after full adjustment (HR 1.63, 95%-CI: 0.88; 3.02). Furthermore, our results suggest effect modification between walking and sedentary duration, such that in people with low walking duration a high sedentary duration was noted as an independent factor for increased mortality.In summary, walking duration was clearly associated with four-year overall mortality in community-dwelling older people."
https://openalex.org/W2340806687,"The critical role played by copepods in ocean ecology and biogeochemistry warrants an understanding of how these animals may respond to ocean acidification (OA). Whilst an appreciation of the potential direct effects of OA, due to elevated pCO2, on copepods is improving, little is known about the indirect impacts acting via bottom-up (food quality) effects. We assessed, for the first time, the chronic effects of direct and/or indirect exposures to elevated pCO2 on the behaviour, vital rates, chemical and biochemical stoichiometry of the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa. Bottom-up effects of elevated pCO2 caused species-specific biochemical changes to the phytoplanktonic feed, which adversely affected copepod population structure and decreased recruitment by 30%. The direct impact of elevated pCO2 caused gender-specific respiratory responses in A.tonsa adults, stimulating an enhanced respiration rate in males (> 2-fold), and a suppressed respiratory response in females when coupled with indirect elevated pCO2 exposures. Under the combined indirect+direct exposure, carbon trophic transfer efficiency from phytoplankton-to-zooplankton declined to < 50% of control populations, with a commensurate decrease in recruitment. For the first time an explicit role was demonstrated for biochemical stoichiometry in shaping copepod trophic dynamics. The altered biochemical composition of the CO2-exposed prey affected the biochemical stoichiometry of the copepods, which could have ramifications for production of higher tropic levels, notably fisheries. Our work indicates that the control of phytoplankton and the support of higher trophic levels involving copepods have clear potential to be adversely affected under future OA scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2337652751,"In the context of polypharmacology, an emerging concept in drug discovery, promiscuity is rationalized as the ability of compounds to specifically interact with multiple targets. Promiscuity of drugs and bioactive compounds has thus far been analyzed computationally on the basis of activity annotations, without taking assay frequencies or inactivity records into account. Most recent estimates have indicated that bioactive compounds interact on average with only one to two targets, whereas drugs interact with six or more. In this study, we have further extended promiscuity analysis by identifying the most extensively assayed public domain compounds and systematically determining their promiscuity. These compounds were tested in hundreds of assays against hundreds of targets. In our analysis, assay promiscuity was distinguished from target promiscuity and separately analyzed for primary and confirmatory assays. Differences between the degree of assay and target promiscuity were surprisingly small and average and median degrees of target promiscuity of 2.6 to 3.4 and 2.0 were determined, respectively. Thus, target promiscuity remained at a low level even for most extensively tested active compounds. These findings provide further evidence that bioactive compounds are less promiscuous than drugs and have implications for pharmaceutical research. In addition to a possible explanation that drugs are more extensively tested for additional targets, the results would also support a ""promiscuity enrichment model"" according to which promiscuous compounds might be preferentially selected for therapeutic efficacy during clinical evaluation to ultimately become drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2337651009,"OTSSP167 was recently characterized as a potent inhibitor for maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) and is currently tested in Phase I clinical trials for solid tumors that have not responded to other treatment. Here we report that OTSSP167 abrogates the mitotic checkpoint at concentrations used to inhibit MELK. The abrogation is not recapitulated by RNAi mediated silencing of MELK in cells. Although OTSSP167 indeed inhibits MELK, it exhibits off-target activity against Aurora B kinase in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, OTSSP167 inhibits BUB1 and Haspin kinases, reducing phosphorylation at histones H2AT120 and H3T3 and causing mislocalization of Aurora B and associated chromosomal passenger complex from the centromere/kinetochore. The results suggest that OTSSP167 may have additional mechanisms of action for cancer cell killing and caution the use of OTSSP167 as a MELK specific kinase inhibitor in biochemical and cellular assays."
https://openalex.org/W2338727825,"Bivalve mitochondrial genomes show many uncommon features, like additional genes, high rates of gene rearrangement, high A-T content. Moreover, Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI) is a distinctive inheritance mechanism allowing some bivalves to maintain and transmit two separate sex-linked mitochondrial genomes. Many bivalve mitochondrial features, such as gene extensions or additional ORFs, have been proposed to be related to DUI but, up to now, this topic is far from being understood. Several species are known to show this unusual organelle inheritance but, being widespread only among Unionidae and Mytilidae, DUI distribution is unclear. We sequenced and characterized the complete female- (F) and male-transmitted (M) mitochondrial genomes of Meretrix lamarckii, which, in fact, is the second species of the family Veneridae where DUI has been demonstrated so far. The two mitochondrial genomes are comparable in length and show roughly the same gene content and order, except for three additional tRNAs found in the M one. The two sex-linked genomes show an average nucleotide divergence of 16%. A 100-aminoacid insertion in M. lamarckii M-cox2 gene was found; moreover, additional ORFs have been found in both F and M Long Unassigned Regions of M. lamarckii. Even if no direct involvement in DUI process has been demonstrated so far, the finding of cox2 insertions and supernumerary ORFs in M. lamarckii both strengthens this hypothesis and widens the taxonomical distribution of such unusual features. Finally, the analysis of inter-sex genetic variability shows that DUI species form two separate clusters, namely Unionidae and Mytilidae+Veneridae; this dichotomy is probably due to different DUI regimes acting on separate taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2339616299,"Although monitoring the intracellular concentration of immunosuppressive agents may be a promising approach to individualizing the therapy after organ transplantation, additional studies on this issue are needed prior to its clinical approval. We investigated the relationship between intracellular and whole blood concentrations of tacrolimus (IC-TAC and WB-TAC, respectively), the factors affecting this relationship, and the risk of rejection based upon IC-TAC in stable kidney recipients. Both IC-TAC and WB-TAC were measured simultaneously in 213 kidney recipients with stable graft function using LC-MS/MS. The tacrolimus ratio was defined as IC-TAC per WB-TAC. The genetic polymorphism of ABCB1 gene and flow cytometric analyses were conducted to probe the correlation between tacrolimus concentrations and the immunoreactivity status as a potential risk of rejection, respectively. The correlation between IC-TAC and WB-TAC was relatively linear (r = 0.67; P<0.001). The factors affecting the tacrolimus ratio were sex, hematocrit, and the transplant duration, as follows: a high tacrolimus ratio was noted in female patients, patients with a low hematocrit, and patients with a short transplant period. However, the tacrolimus ratio did not reflect the prior clinical outcomes (e.g., rejection) or the genetic polymorphism of ABCB1. After stimulation with phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, the proportion of T cells producing interferon-gamma or interleukin-2 was higher in the low-IC-TAC group than in the high-IC-TAC group. Further studies are required to evaluate the value of the intracellular tacrolimus concentrations in several clinical settings, such as rejection, infection, and drug toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2336947314,"The development and maturation of maize kernel involves meticulous and fine gene regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and miRNAs play important roles during this process. Although a number of miRNAs have been identified in maize seed, the ones involved in the early development of grains and in different lines of maize have not been well studied. Here, we profiled four small RNA libraries, each constructed from groups of immature grains of Zea mays inbred line Chang 7-2 collected 4-6, 7-9, 12-14, and 18-23 days after pollination (DAP). A total of 40 known (containing 111 unique miRNAs) and 162 novel (containing 196 unique miRNA candidates) miRNA families were identified. For conserved and novel miRNAs with over 100 total reads, 44% had higher accumulation before the 9th DAP, especially miR166 family members. 42% of miRNAs had highest accumulation during 12-14 DAP (which is the transition stage from embryogenesis to nutrient storage). Only 14% of miRNAs had higher expression 18-23 DAP. Prediction of potential targets of all miRNAs showed that 165 miRNA families had 377 target genes. For miR164 and miR166, we showed that the transcriptional levels of their target genes were significantly decreased when co-expressed with their cognate miRNA precursors in vivo. Further analysis shows miR159, miR164, miR166, miR171, miR390, miR399, and miR529 families have putative roles in the embryogenesis of maize grain development by participating in transcriptional regulation and morphogenesis, while miR167 and miR528 families participate in metabolism process and stress response during nutrient storage. Our study is the first to present an integrated dynamic expression pattern of miRNAs during maize kernel formation and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2339243810,"Objective In this work, we aim at comparing formally three different interaction modes for image manipulation that are usable in a surgery setting: 1) A gesture-controlled approach using Kinect ®; 2) oral instructions to a third part dedicated to manipulate the images; and 3) direct manipulation using a mouse. Materials and Methods Each participant used the radiology image viewer Weasis with the three interaction modes. In a crossover randomized controlled trial participants were attributed block wise to six experimental groups. For each group, the order for testing the three modes was randomly assigned. Nine standardized scenarios were used. Results 30 physicians and senior medical students participated in the experiment. Efficiency, measured as time used to pass the scenario, was best when using the mouse (M = 109.10s, SD = 25.96), followed by gesture-controlled (M = 214.97s, SD = 46.29) and oral instructions (M = 246.33s, SD = 76.50). Satisfaction, measured by a questionnaire, was rated highest in the condition mouse (M = 6.63, SD = 0.56), followed by gesture-controlled (M = 5.77, SD = 0.93) and oral instructions (M = 4.40, SD = 1.71). Differences in efficiency and satisfaction rating were significant. No significant difference in effectiveness, measured with error rates, was found. Discussion The study shows with formal evaluation that the use of gestures is advantageous over instructions to a third person. In particular, the use of gestures is more efficient than verbalizing instructions. The given gestures could be learned easily and reliability of the tested gesture-control system is good. Conclusion Under the premise that mouse cannot be used directly during surgery, gesture-controlled approaches demonstrate to be superior to oral instructions for image manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2341608101,"White birch (Betula papyrifera) is a dominant tree species of the Boreal Forest. Recent studies have shown that it is fairly resistant to heavy metal contamination, specifically to nickel. Knowledge of regulation of genes associated with metal resistance in higher plants is very sketchy. Availability and annotation of the dwarf birch (B. nana) enables the use of high throughout sequencing approaches to understanding responses to environmental challenges in other Betula species such as B. papyrifera. The main objectives of this study are to 1) develop and characterize the B. papyrifera transcriptome, 2) assess gene expression dynamics of B. papyrifera in response to nickel stress, and 3) describe gene function based on ontology. Nickel resistant and susceptible genotypes were selected and used for transcriptome analysis. A total of 208,058 trinity genes were identified and were assembled to 275,545 total trinity transcripts. The transcripts were mapped to protein sequences and based on best match; we annotated the B. papyrifera genes and assigned gene ontology. In total, 215,700 transcripts were annotated and were compared to the published B. nana genome. Overall, a genomic match for 61% transcripts with the reference genome was found. Expression profiles were generated and 62,587 genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed among the nickel resistant, susceptible, and untreated libraries. The main nickel resistance mechanism in B. papyrifera is a downregulation of genes associated with translation (in ribosome), binding, and transporter activities. Five candidate genes associated to nickel resistance were identified. They include Glutathione S-transferase, thioredoxin family protein, putative transmembrane protein and two Nramp transporters. These genes could be useful for genetic engineering of birch trees."
https://openalex.org/W2341680026,"Acute brain injuries such as ischemic stroke or traumatic brain injury often cause massive neural death and irreversible brain damage with grave consequences. Previous studies have established that a key participant in the events leading to neural death is the excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Protecting neuronal cells by activating their endogenous defense mechanisms is an attractive treatment strategy for acute brain injuries. In this work, we investigate how the precise timing of the Raf/ERK and the AKT pathway activation affects their protective effects against oxidative stress. For this purpose, we employed optogenetic systems that use light to precisely and reversibly activate either the Raf/ERK or the AKT pathway. We find that preconditioning activation of the Raf/ERK or the AKT pathway immediately before oxidant exposure provides significant protection to cells. Notably, a 15-minute transient activation of the Raf/ERK pathway is able to protect PC12 cells against oxidant strike that is applied 12 hours later, while the transient activation of the AKT pathway fails to protect PC12 cells in such a scenario. On the other hand, if the pathways are activated after the oxidative insult, i.e. postconditioning, the AKT pathway conveys greater protective effect than the Raf/ERK pathway. We find that postconditioning AKT activation has an optimal delay period of 2 hours. When the AKT pathway is activated 30min after the oxidative insult, it exhibits very little protective effect. Therefore, the precise timing of the pathway activation is crucial in determining its protective effect against oxidative injury. The optogenetic platform, with its precise temporal control and its ability to activate specific pathways, is ideal for the mechanistic dissection of intracellular pathways in protection against oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2337696333,"Serum metabolite profiling in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) may enable discovery of valuable molecular markers for disease progression and treatment response. Serum samples from 51 DMD patients from a natural history study and 22 age-matched healthy volunteers were profiled using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for discovery of novel circulating serum metabolites associated with DMD. Fourteen metabolites were found significantly altered (1% false discovery rate) in their levels between DMD patients and healthy controls while adjusting for age and study site and allowing for an interaction between disease status and age. Increased metabolites included arginine, creatine and unknown compounds at m/z of 357 and 312 while decreased metabolites included creatinine, androgen derivatives and other unknown yet to be identified compounds. Furthermore, the creatine to creatinine ratio is significantly associated with disease progression in DMD patients. This ratio sharply increased with age in DMD patients while it decreased with age in healthy controls. Overall, this study yielded promising metabolic signatures that could prove useful to monitor DMD disease progression and response to therapies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2338314645,"Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) is characterized by lower incidence, poorer prognosis and worse survival than other types of leukemia and results from collaboration of malignant proliferation and erythroid differentiation blockage. The expression, function and therapeutic significance of noncoding RNAs in AEL have not been well studied. Here, we show that one miRNA cluster, including miR-23a, -27a and -24, is dramatically downregulated in AEL patients. Restoration of miR-23a, -27a and -24 expression induces apoptosis and erythropoiesis, inhibits adverse growth and partly relieves the leukemic symptoms of AEL patients. At the whole-genome scale, we identify that miR-23a, -27a and -24 synergistically target multiple members of the oncogenic gp130-JAK1-Stat3 pathway, and thus reinforce their inhibition on the cascade to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Importantly, Ruxolitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, could rescue the phenotypic changes induced by miR-23a, -27a and -24 inhibitors. Furthermore, miR-23a cluster-mediated-inactivation of the JAK1-Stat3 pathway promotes the expression and activity of GATA1 via inhibiting PU.1, thereby improving erythroid differentiation. Collectively, we reveal an important regulatory circuit comprising GATA1, the miR-23a cluster and gp130-JAK1-Stat3 pathway, that synergistically facilitates apoptosis and erythropoiesis and restrains adverse proliferation, indicating the therapeutic significance of miR-23a, -27a and -24 for AEL treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2338526656,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDIs) are promising anticancer therapies and have been clinically used for the treatment of hematological malignancy. However, their efficacy in solid tumors is marginal and drug resistance hampers their further clinical utility. To develop novel strategies for the HDI-based anticancer therapeutics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying resistance to HDI treatment in NSCLC cells. We show the STAT3-mediated IGF2/IGF-1R signaling cascade as a key modulator for both acquired and primary HDI resistance. The treatment with HDI upregulated IGF2 transcription in NSCLC cells carrying intrinsic or acquired drug resistance via direct binding of STAT3 in IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters. Acetylated STAT3 emerged upon HDAC inhibition was protected from the proteasome-mediated degradation of STAT3 and functioned as a direct transcription factor for IGF2 expression. Genomic or pharmacological strategies targeting STAT3 diminished the HDI-induced IGF2 mRNA expression and overcame the resistance to HDI treatment in HDI-resistant NSCLC- or patient-derived tumor xenograft models. These findings provide new insights into the role of acetylated STAT3-mediated activation of IGF2 transcription in HDI resistance, suggesting IGF2 or STAT3 as novel targets to overcome HDI resistance in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2337420145,"Meeting the world’s growing energy demand through bioenergy production involves extensive land-use change which could have severe environmental and social impacts. Second generation bioenergy feedstocks offer a possible solution to this problem. They have the potential to reduce land-use conflicts between food and bioenergy production as they can be grown on low quality land not suitable for food production. However, a comprehensive impact assessment that considers multiple ecosystem services (ESS) and biodiversity is needed to identify the environmentally best feedstock option, as trade-offs are inherent. In this study, we simulate the spatial distribution of short rotation coppices (SRCs) in the landscape of the Mulde watershed in Central Germany by modeling profit-maximizing farmers under different economic and policy-driven scenarios using a spatially explicit economic simulation model. This allows to derive general insights and a mechanistic understanding of regional-scale impacts on multiple ESS in the absence of large-scale implementation. The modeled distribution of SRCs, required to meet the regional demand of combined heat and power (CHP) plants for solid biomass, had little or no effect on the provided ESS. In the policy-driven scenario, placing SRCs on low or high quality soils to provide ecological focus areas, as required within the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, had little effect on ESS. Only a substantial increase in the SRC production area, beyond the regional demand of CHP plants, had a relevant effect, namely a negative impact on food production as well as a positive impact on biodiversity and regulating ESS. Beneficial impacts occurred for single ESS. However, the number of sites with balanced ESS supply hardly increased due to larger shares of SRCs in the landscape. Regression analyses showed that the occurrence of sites with balanced ESS supply was more strongly driven by biophysical factors than by the SRC share in the landscape. This indicates that SRCs negligibly affect trade-offs between individual ESS. Coupling spatially explicit economic simulation models with environmental and ESS assessment models can contribute to a comprehensive impact assessment of bioenergy feedstocks that have not yet been planted."
https://openalex.org/W2338897273,"Cellular phenotypes underpinned by regulatory networks need to respond to evolutionary pressures to allow adaptation, but at the same time be robust to perturbations. This creates a conflict in which mutations affecting regulatory networks must both generate variance but also be tolerated at the phenotype level. Here, we perform mathematical analyses and simulations of regulatory networks to better understand the potential trade-off between robustness and evolvability. Examining the phenotypic effects of mutations, we find an inverse correlation between robustness and evolvability that breaks only with nonlinearity in the network dynamics, through the creation of regions presenting sudden changes in phenotype with small changes in genotype. For genotypes embedding low levels of nonlinearity, robustness and evolvability correlate negatively and almost perfectly. By contrast, genotypes embedding nonlinear dynamics allow expression levels to be robust to small perturbations, while generating high diversity (evolvability) under larger perturbations. Thus, nonlinearity breaks the robustness-evolvability trade-off in gene expression levels by allowing disparate responses to different mutations. Using analytical derivations of robustness and system sensitivity, we show that these findings extend to a large class of gene regulatory network architectures and also hold for experimentally observed parameter regimes. Further, the effect of nonlinearity on the robustness-evolvability trade-off is ensured as long as key parameters of the system display specific relations irrespective of their absolute values. We find that within this parameter regime genotypes display low and noisy expression levels. Examining the phenotypic effects of mutations, we find an inverse correlation between robustness and evolvability that breaks only with nonlinearity in the network dynamics. Our results provide a possible solution to the robustness-evolvability trade-off, suggest an explanation for the ubiquity of nonlinear dynamics in gene expression networks, and generate useful guidelines for the design of synthetic gene circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2341574804,"Muscle injury is common among athletes and amateur practitioners of sports. Following an injury, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurs, which can harm healthy muscle fibers (secondary damage) and delay the repair process. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) administered prior to or following an injury has demonstrated positive and protective effects on muscle repair, but the combination of both administration times together has not been clarified.To evaluate the effect of LLLT (660 nm and 780 nm, 10 J/cm², 40 mW, 3.2 J) prior to injury with or without the administration after injury on oxidative stress during the muscle repair process.Wistar rats were divided into following groups: control; muscle injury alone; LLLT 660 nm + injury; LLLT 780 nm + injury; LLLT 660 nm before and after injury; and LLLT 780 nm before and after injury. The rats were euthanized on days 1, 3 and 7 following cryoinjury of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, which was then removed for analysis.Lipid peroxidation decreased in the 660+injury group after one day. Moreover, red and infrared LLLT employed at both administration times induced a decrease in lipid peroxidation after seven days. CAT activity was altered by LLLT in all periods evaluated, with a decrease after one day in the 780+injury+780 group and after seven days in the 780+injury group as well as an increase in the 780+injury and 780+injury+780 groups after three days. Furthermore, increases in GPx and SOD activity were found after seven days in the 780+injury+780 group.The administration of red and infrared laser therapy at different times positively modulates the activity of antioxidant enzymes and reduces stress markers during the muscle repair process."
https://openalex.org/W4254450405,"A prospective study was conducted in client-owned geriatric dogs to evaluate the short-term effects of a test food on serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and creatinine (Cr) concentrations. Test food contained functional lipids (fish oil), antioxidants (lipoic acid, vitamins C and E), L-carnitine, botanicals (fruits and vegetables), controlled sodium concentration, and high quality protein sources (high bioavailability and an ideal amino acid composition). Dogs (n = 210) were fed either test food or owner's-choice foods (non-nutritionally controlled cohort). Dogs were included based on age and body weight: small (6.8 to 11.4 kg) and medium dogs (11.5 to 22.7 kg) were ≥ 9 years, whereas dogs >22.7 kg were ≥ 7 years at baseline. At baseline, all dogs had to have serum Cr concentrations within the reference interval and be free of chronic disease. Renal function biomarkers and urinalysis results at baseline, and after consuming test food or owner's-choice foods for 3 and 6 months, were evaluated. Only dogs consuming test food showed significant decreases in serum SDMA and Cr concentrations (both P ≤ 0.05) across time. At baseline or during the 6-month feeding trial, 18 dogs (8.6%) had increased serum SDMA, but normal serum Cr, consistent with IRIS Stage 1 chronic kidney disease. This included 9 dogs fed test food and 9 dogs fed owner's-choice foods. Compared with baseline, after feeding 9 dogs test food for 6 months, serum SDMA decreased in 8 dogs and increased in 1 dog. After feeding 9 dogs owner's-choice foods for 6 months, serum SDMA decreased in 4 dogs and increased in 4 dogs (remained stable in 1 dog). The decreases in serum SDMA and Cr concentrations were significant (both P = 0.03) only for dogs fed test food. These results suggest that nonazotemic dogs with elevated serum SDMA (early renal insufficiency) when fed a test food designed to promote healthy aging are more likely to demonstrate improved renal function compared with dogs fed owner's-choice foods."
https://openalex.org/W2339282390,"Nedd4 (Nedd4-1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that belongs to the HECT family and comprises a C2-WW(n)-HECT domain architecture. Although it has been reported to regulate growth factor receptors and cellular signaling, its role in cancer development has been controversial, with some studies proposing that it promotes cancer while others suggest it inhibits tumor growth. Here, we tested the effect of Nedd4 on intestinal tumor formation and growth using Nedd4-knockout mice (Nedd4 floxed (fl) mice crossed to villin-Cre mice). Although we find that knockout of Nedd4 on its own does not cause tumor growth, its knockout in the context of Apc+/min-derived colorectal tumors leads to augmentation of tumor growth, suggesting that Nedd4 normally suppresses intestinal WNT signaling and growth of colonic tumors. WNT signaling microarray, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry analyses of tumors derived from the Villin-Cre;Nedd4fl/fl;Apc+/min colons demonstrated elevated expression of the WNT upstream effectors LEF1 (full length) and YY1 in these tumors relative to control (Apc+/min alone) tumors. Together, these results suggest that Nedd4 suppresses colonic WNT signaling and tumor growth, at least in part, by suppressing the transcription factors LEF1 and YY1."
https://openalex.org/W2336786664,"High-level amplification of the protein phosphatase PPM1D (WIP1) is present in a subset of medulloblastomas (MBs) that have an expression profile consistent with active Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling. We found that WIP1 overexpression increased expression of Shh target genes and cell proliferation in response to Shh stimulation in NIH3T3 and cerebellar granule neuron precursor cells in a p53-independent manner. Thus, we developed a mouse in which WIP1 is expressed in the developing brain under control of the Neurod2 promoter (ND2:WIP1). The external granule layer (EGL) in early postnatal ND2:WIP1 mice exhibited increased proliferation and expression of Shh downstream targets. MB incidence increased and survival decreased when ND2:WIP1 mice were crossed with an Shh-activated MB mouse model. Conversely, Wip1 knockout significantly suppressed MB formation in two independent mouse models of Shh-activated MB. Furthermore, Wip1 knockdown or treatment with a WIP1 inhibitor suppressed the effects of Shh stimulation and potentiated the growth inhibitory effects of SHH pathway-inhibiting drugs in Shh-activated MB cells in vitro. This suggests an important cross-talk between SHH and WIP1 pathways that accelerates tumorigenesis and supports WIP1 inhibition as a potential treatment strategy for MB."
https://openalex.org/W2337534709,"There is a growing literature indicating that genetic variants modify many of the associations between environmental exposures and clinical outcomes, potentially by increasing susceptibility to these exposures. However, genome-scale investigations of these interactions have been rarely performed particularly in the case of air pollution exposures. We performed race-stratified genome-wide gene-environment interaction association studies on European-American (EA, N = 1623) and African-American (AA, N = 554) cohorts to investigate the joint influence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and residential exposure to traffic (""traffic exposure"")-a recognized vascular disease risk factor-on peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Traffic exposure was estimated via the distance from the primary residence to the nearest major roadway, defined as the nearest limited access highways or major arterial. The rs755249-traffic exposure interaction was associated with PAD at a genome-wide significant level (P = 2.29x10-8) in European-Americans. Rs755249 is located in the 3' untranslated region of BMP8A, a member of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) gene family. Further investigation revealed several variants in BMP genes associated with PAD via an interaction with traffic exposure in both the EA and AA cohorts; this included interactions with non-synonymous variants in BMP2, which is regulated by air pollution exposure. The BMP family of genes is linked to vascular growth and calcification and is a novel gene family for the study of PAD pathophysiology. Further investigation of BMP8A using the Genotype Tissue Expression Database revealed multiple variants with nominally significant (P < 0.05) interaction P-values in our EA cohort were significant BMP8A eQTLs in tissue types highlight relevant for PAD such as rs755249 (tibial nerve, eQTL P = 3.6x10-6) and rs1180341 (tibial artery, eQTL P = 5.3x10-6). Together these results reveal a novel gene, and possibly gene family, associated with PAD via an interaction with traffic air pollution exposure. These results also highlight the potential for interactions studies, particularly at the genome scale, to reveal novel biology linking environmental exposures to clinical outcomes."

Test food contained functional lipids (fish oil), antioxidants (vitamins C and E), L-carnitine, botanicals (vegetables), highly bioavailable protein, and amino acid supplements. Cats (n = 80) were fed either test food or owner’s-choice foods (non-nutritionally controlled cohort). Cats were included based on age (≥ 9 years), indoor only, neutered, and free of chronic disease. At baseline, all cats had serum Cr concentrations within the reference interval. Renal function biomarkers and urinalysis results at baseline and after consuming test food or owner’s-choice foods for 3 and 6 months were evaluated. Cats consuming test food showed significant decreases in serum Cr and BUN concentrations across time. Overall, cats consuming owner’s-choice foods showed significant increases in serum SDMA concentrations at 3 and 6 months compared with baseline (P ≤ 0.05), whereas in cats consuming test food serum SDMA concentrations did not change. At baseline or during the 6-month feeding trial, 23 (28.8%) cats had increased serum SDMA, but normal serum Cr consistent with IRIS Stage 1 chronic kidney disease. This included 6 cats fed test food and 17 cats fed owner’s-choice foods. In the 6 cats fed test food, serum SDMA decreased in 3 cats and remained stable in 1 cat, whereas in the 17 cats fed owner’s-choice foods, serum SDMA increased in 13 cats and decreased or remained stable in 4 cats. The increase in serum SDMA concentration was significant (P = 0.02) only for cats fed owner’s-choice foods. These results suggest that nonazotemic cats with elevated serum SDMA (early renal insufficiency) when fed a food designed to promote healthy aging are more likely to demonstrate stable renal function compared with cats fed owner’s-choice foods. Cats fed owner’s-choice foods were more likely to demonstrate progressive renal insufficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2339745526,"Purpose Much information on parental perspectives on the return of individual research results (IRR) in pediatric genomic research is based on hypothetical rather than actual IRR. Our aim was to understand how the expected utility to parents who received IRR on their child from a genetic research study compared to the actual utility of the IRR received. Methods We conducted individual telephone interviews with parents who received IRR on their child through participation in the Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research Gene Discovery Core (GDC) at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH). Results Five themes emerged around the utility that parents expected and actually received from IRR: predictability, management, family planning, finding answers, and helping science and/or families. Parents expressing negative or mixed emotions after IRR return were those who did not receive the utility they expected from the IRR. Conversely, parents who expressed positive emotions were those who received as much or greater utility than expected. Conclusions Discrepancies between expected and actual utility of IRR affect the experiences of parents and families enrolled in genetic research studies. An informed consent process that fosters realistic expectations between researchers and participants may help to minimize any negative impact on parents and families."
https://openalex.org/W2340391804,"Background Autism is a disease of complex nature with a significant genetic component. The importance of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) elements in cognition and behavior besides the interaction of angiotensin II (Ang II), the main product of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), with neurotransmitters in CNS, especially dopamine, proposes the involvement of RAS in autism. Since the genetic architecture of autism has remained elusive, here we postulated that genetic variations in RAS are associated with autism. Methods Considering the relation between the three polymorphisms of ACE (I/D, rs4343 and rs4291) with the level of ACE activity, we have investigated this association with autism, in a case-control study. Genotype and allele frequencies of polymorphisms were determined in DNAs extracted from venous blood of 120 autistic patients and their age and sex-matched healthy controls, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) methods. Results There were strong associations between both DD genotype of ACE I/D and the D allele, with autism (P = 0.006, OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.64–5.13 and P = 0.006, OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.37–3.48 respectively). Furthermore, a significant association between the G allele of rs4343 and autism was observed (P = 0.006, OR = 1.84, 95%CI = 1.26–2.67). Moreover, haplotype analysis revealed an association between DTG haplotype and autism (P = 0.008). Conclusion Our data suggests the involvement of RAS genetic diversity in increasing the risk of autism."
https://openalex.org/W2340967712,"The present study was a cross-sectional study conducted to reveal the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components and describe the features of such prevalence among Japanese workers by clustered business category using big data. The data of approximately 120,000 workers were obtained from a national representative insurance organization, and the study analyzed the health checkup and questionnaire results according to the field of business of each subject. Abnormalities found during the checkups such as excessive waist circumference, hypertension or glucose intolerance, and metabolic syndrome, were recorded. All subjects were classified by business field into 18 categories based on The North American Industry Classification System. Based on the criteria of the Japanese Committee for the Diagnostic Criteria of Metabolic Syndrome, the standardized prevalence ratio (SPR) of metabolic syndrome and its components by business category was calculated, and the 95% confidence interval of the SPR was computed. Hierarchical cluster analysis was then performed based on the SPR of metabolic syndrome components, and the 18 business categories were classified into three clusters for both males and females. The following business categories were at significantly high risk of metabolic syndrome: among males, Construction, Transportation, Professional Services, and Cooperative Association; and among females, Health Care and Cooperative Association. The results of the cluster analysis indicated one cluster for each gender with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome components; among males, a cluster consisting of Manufacturing, Transportation, Finance, and Cooperative Association, and among females, a cluster consisting of Mining, Transportation, Finance, Accommodation, and Cooperative Association. These findings reveal that, when providing health guidance and support regarding metabolic syndrome, consideration must be given to its components and the variety of its prevalence rates by business category and gender."
https://openalex.org/W2337815984,"Bacteria with high nucleic acid (HNA) and low nucleic acid (LNA) content are commonly observed in aquatic environments. To date, limited knowledge is available on their temporal and spatial variations in freshwater environments. Here an investigation of HNA and LNA bacterial abundance and their flow cytometric characteristics was conducted in an exorheic river (Haihe River, Northern China) over a one year period covering September (autumn) 2011, December (winter) 2011, April (spring) 2012, and July (summer) 2012. The results showed that LNA and HNA bacteria contributed similarly to the total bacterial abundance on both the spatial and temporal scale. The variability of HNA on abundance, fluorescence intensity (FL1) and side scatter (SSC) were more sensitive to environmental factors than that of LNA bacteria. Meanwhile, the relative distance of SSC between HNA and LNA was more variable than that of FL1. Multivariate analysis further demonstrated that the influence of geographical distance (reflected by the salinity gradient along river to ocean) and temporal changes (as temperature variation due to seasonal succession) on the patterns of LNA and HNA were stronger than the effects of nutrient conditions. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the distribution of LNA and HNA bacteria, including the abundance, FL1 and SSC, was controlled by different variables. The results suggested that LNA and HNA bacteria might play different ecological roles in the exorheic river."
https://openalex.org/W2340477922,"Adults read at high speed, but estimates of their reading rate vary greatly, i.e., from 100 to 1500 words per minute (wpm). This discrepancy is likely due to different recording methods and to the different perceptual and cognitive processes involved in specific test conditions. The present study investigated the origins of these notable differences in RSVP reading rate (RR). In six experiments we investigated the role of many different perceptual and cognitive variables. The presence of a mask caused a steep decline in reading rate, with an estimated masking cost of about 200 wpm. When the decoding process was isolated, RR approached values of 1200 wpm. When the number of stimuli exceeded the short-term memory span, RR decreased to 800 wpm. The semantic context contributed to reading speed only by a factor of 1.4. Finally, eye movements imposed an upper limit on RR (around 300 wpm). Overall, data indicate a speed limit of 300 wpm, which corresponds to the time needed for eye movement execution, i.e., the most time consuming mechanism. Results reconcile differences in reading rates reported by different laboratories and thus provide suggestions for targeting different components of reading rate."
https://openalex.org/W2335947763,"The emergence and rapid spread of multiresistant bacteria has lead to an urgent need for novel antimicrobials. Based on single-point substitutions, we generated a series of mutants of micasin, a dermatophytic defensin, with enhanced activities against multiple clinical isolates of Staphylococcus species, including 4 antibiotic-resistant strains. We first mapped the functional surface of micasin by alanine-scanning mutational analysis of its highly exposed residues, through which we found that substitution of site 8 (acidic Glu) dramatically enhanced bacterial killing of this peptide. Structural analysis indicates that this single point mutation could result in a functional local amphipathic architecture. Four different types of side chains (hydrophobic, cationic polar, neutral polar, and acidic polar) were introduced at site 8 to clarify the role of this local architecture in micasin function. The results show that all mutants displayed increased antibacterial activity with the exception of the acidic replacement. These mutants with enhanced activity exhibited low hemolysis and cytotoxicity and showed high serum stability, indicating their therapeutic potential. Our work represents the first example of structural fine-tuning to largely improve the antibacterial potency of a dermatophytic defensin.-Wu, J., Gao, B., Zhu, S. Single-point mutation-mediated local amphipathic adjustment dramatically enhances antibacterial activity of a fungal defensin."
https://openalex.org/W2338105231,"The Ras-related (R-Ras) isoforms TC21, R-Ras and M-Ras are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. R-Ras family proteins are frequently overexpressed in human cancers, and expression of activated mutants of these GTPases is sufficient to induce cell transformation. Unlike Ras, few activating mutations of R-Ras proteins have been reported in human cancer, and very little is known about the regulation of their activity. In this study, we report that TC21 and R-Ras are phosphorylated on a conserved serine, Ser186 and Ser201, respectively, in intact cells. This residue is located in the C-terminal hypervariable region of the proteins and is not conserved in M-Ras. We show that the MAP kinases ERK1/2 phosphorylate TC21 and R-Ras on this C-terminal serine residue both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation of R-Ras proteins does not affect their subcellular localization or stability but rather stimulates their activation. Phosphorylation-defective mutants of R-Ras and TC21 are compromised in their ability to promote cancer cell adhesion and migration/invasion, respectively. Importantly, we show that phosphorylation of TC21 and R-Ras potentiates their tumorigenic activity in immunodeficient mice. Our results identify a novel regulatory mechanism of the small GTPases TC21 and R-Ras that controls their oncogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2341199416,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation of phytoecdysteroids (PEDS) extracted from Cyanotis arachnoidea on rumen fermentation, enzymes activity and microbial efficiency in a dual flow continuous-culture system. A single-factor experimental design was used with twelve fermenters in 4 groups with 3 replicates each. Fermenters were incubated for a total of 7 days that included first 4 days for adaptation and last 3 days for sampling. PEDS was added at levels of zero (as control), 5, 10, and 15 mg/g of the substrate (DM). The results showed that increasing supplementation levels of PEDS resulted in incremental digestibility of dry matter (DMD) (quadratic, P = 0.001) and organic matter (OMD) (quadratic, P = 0.031), but unchanged digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDFD), crude protein (CPD) and acid detergent acid (ADFD). As supplementation levels of PEDS increased, there were decreased response in the concentration of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) (linear, P = 0.015) and increased response in molar proportions of butyrate (linear, P = 0.004), but unchanged response in total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) and the molar proportion of acetate and propionate, respectively. Increasing PEDS supplementation levels decreased the ratio of acetate to propionate (linear, P = 0.038), suggesting an alteration of rumen fermentation pattern occurring due to PEDS supplementation in the diet. Supplementation of PEDS significantly increased activities of glutamate dehydrogenase (quadratic, P = 0.001), alanine dehydrogenase (quadratic, P = 0.004), glutamate synthase (linear, P = 0.038), glutamine synthetase (quadratic, P = 0.011), respectively. There were no discernible differences in the activity of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCase), xylanase and protease regardless of the treatments. The daily production of microbial nitrogen (linear, P = 0.002) and microbial efficiency (MOEEF) (linear, P = 0.001) increased linearly as supplementation levels of PEDS increased. The decreased response of fluid NH3-N and the increased response of MN indicated that PEDS positively increased the synthesis of microbial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2340796147,"Polymerization of a ring-like cytoskeletal structure, the Z-ring, at midcell is a highly conserved feature in virtually all bacteria. The Z-ring is composed of short protofilaments of the tubulin homolog FtsZ, randomly arranged and held together through lateral interactions. In vitro, lateral associations between FtsZ protofilaments are stabilized by crowding agents, high concentrations of divalent cations, or in some cases, low pH. In vivo, the last 4-10 amino acid residues at the C-terminus of FtsZ (the C-terminal variable region, CTV) have been implicated in mediating lateral associations between FtsZ protofilaments through charge shielding. Multiple Z-ring associated proteins (Zaps), also promote lateral interactions between FtsZ protofilaments to stabilize the FtsZ ring in vivo. Here we characterize the complementary role/s of the CTV of E. coli FtsZ and the FtsZ-ring stabilizing protein ZapD, in FtsZ assembly. We show that the net charge of the FtsZ CTV not only affects FtsZ protofilament bundling, confirming earlier observations, but likely also the length of the FtsZ protofilaments in vitro. The CTV residues also have important consequences for Z-ring assembly and interaction with ZapD in the cell. ZapD requires the FtsZ CTV region for interaction with FtsZ in vitro and for localization to midcell in vivo. Our data suggest a mechanism in which the CTV residues, particularly K380, facilitate a conformation for the conserved carboxy-terminal residues in FtsZ, that lie immediately N-terminal to the CTV, to enable optimal contact with ZapD. Further, phylogenetic analyses suggest a correlation between the nature of FtsZ CTV residues and the presence of ZapD in the β- γ-proteobacterial species."

Genotyping is an important tool for epidemiological tracking of C. trachomatis infections, including the revelation of transmission pathways and association with tissue tropism and pathogenicity. Moreover, genotyping can be useful for clinicians to establish the correct treatment when LGV strains are detected. Recently a microarray assay was described that offers several advantages, such as rapidity, ease of standardization and detection of mixed infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the DNA microarray-based assay for C. trachomatis genotyping of clinical samples already typed by PCR-RFLP from South America. The agreement between both typing techniques was 90.05% and the overall genotype distribution obtained with both techniques was similar. Detection of mixed-genotype infections was significantly higher using the microarray assay (8.4% of cases) compared to PCR-RFLP (0.5%). Among 178 samples, the microarray assay identified 10 ompA genotypes, i.e. D, Da, E, F, G, H, I, J, K and L2. The most predominant type was genotype E, followed by D and F."
https://openalex.org/W2339413795,"Introduction Asthma remains poorly studied in homeless children. We sought to estimate the prevalence of asthma-like symptoms (ALS) and to identify the factors associated with ALS and healthcare service utilisation. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional survey of a random sample of sheltered homeless families was conducted by interviewing 801 parents of children (0–12 years) in 17 languages. ALS were defined as wheezing or night cough without fever during the previous year. Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used to compute prevalence ratios (PR) for factors associated with ALS and healthcare service utilisation for ALS. Results The prevalence of ALS among the children was 19.9%. Poor housing sanitation was significantly associated with ALS, as being born in the European Union. Most of the children with ALS had used healthcare services (85.4%). The main barriers to accessing such services were having lived in France for less than 49 months, having difficulties in French and living in poor housing conditions. Conclusion ALS prevalence seemed lower than in the general child population, possibly because of the children's origins. Environmental factors associated with ALS point to the need to improve the indoor environment of family shelters. The relatively high rate of healthcare service utilisation should not overshadow existing barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2340012832,"Improper neuroimmune responses following chronic stress exposure have been reported to cause neuronal dysfunctions leading to memory impairment, anxiety and depression like behaviours. Though several factors affecting microglial activation and consequent alteration in neuro-inflammatory responses have been well studied, role of NO and its association with microglia in stress induced depression model is yet to be explored. In the present study, we validated combination of chronic hypobaric hypoxia and crowding (CHC) as a stress model for depression and investigated the role of chronic stress induced elevated nitric oxide (NO) level in microglia activation and its effect on neuro-inflammatory responses in brain. Further, we evaluated the ameliorative effect of L-NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) to reverse the stress induced depressive mood state. Four groups of male Sprague Dawley rat were taken and divided into control and CHC stress exposed group with and without treatment of L-NAME. Depression like behaviour and anhedonia in rats were assessed by Forced Swim Test (FST) and Sucrose Preference Test (SPT). Microglial activation was evaluated using Iba-1 immunohistochemistry and proinflammatory cytokines were assessed in the hippocampal region. Our result showed that exposure to CHC stress increased the number of active microglia with corresponding increase in inflammatory cytokines and altered behavioural responses. The inhibition of NO synthesis by L-NAME during CHC exposure decreased the number of active microglia in hippocampus as evident from decreased Iba-1 positive cells. Further, L-NAME administration decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus and improved behaviour of rats. Our study demonstrate that stress induced elevation of NO plays pivotal role in altered microglial activation and consequent neurodegenerative processes leading to depression like behaviour in rat."
https://openalex.org/W2337918777,"Identification of factors regulating renal development is important to understand the pathogenesis of congenital kidney diseases. Little is known about the molecular mechanism of renal development and functions triggered by the angiogenic hormone prokineticin-2 and its receptor, PKR1. Utilizing the Gata5 (G5)-Cre and Wilms tumor 1 (Wt1)GFPcre transgenic lines, we generated mutant mice with targeted PKR1 gene disruptions in nephron progenitors. These mutant mice exhibited partial embryonic and postnatal lethality. Kidney developmental defects in PKRG5-/- mice are manifested in the adult stage as renal atrophy with glomerular defects, nephropathy, and uremia. PKR1Wf1-/- embryos exhibit hypoplastic kidneys with premature glomeruli and necrotic nephrons as a result of impaired proliferation and increased apoptosis in Wt1+ renal mesenchymal cells. PKR1 regulates renal mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) that is involved in formation of renal progenitors, regulating glomerulogenesis toward forming nephrons during kidney development. In the isolated embryonic Wt1+ renal cells, overexpression or activation of PKR1 promotes MET defined by the transition from elongated cell to octagonal cell morphology, and alteration of the expression of MET markers via activating NFATc3 signaling. Together, these results establish PKR1 via NFATc3 as a crucial modifier of MET processing to the development of nephron.

Based on more than two decades (1992–2012) of centralized nationwide genotyping of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture-positive TB patients in Denmark, we compared M. tuberculosis genotypes from all cases notified as presumed occupational (N = 130) with M. tuberculosis genotypes from all TB cases present in the country (N = 7,127). From 1992 through 2006, the IS6110 Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) method was used for genotyping, whereas from 2005 to present, the 24-locus-based Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit-Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (MIRU-VNTR) was used. An occupational TB case was classified as clustered if the genotype was 100% identical to at least one other genotype. Subsequently, based on genotype, time period, smear positivity, geography, susceptibility pattern, and any reported epidemiological links between the occupational cases and any potential source cases, the occupational case was categorized as confirmed, likely, possible or unlikely occupationally infected. Among the 130 notified presumed occupational cases, 12 (9.2%) could be classified as confirmed and 46 (35.4%) as unlikely, accounting for nearly half of all cases (44.6%). The remaining 72 cases (55.4%) were categorized as possible. Within this group, 15 cases (11.5%) were assessed to be likely occupational. Our study shows that genotyping can serve as an important tool for disentangle occupational TB in high-income low incidence settings, but still needs to be combined with good epidemiological linkage information."

The study was divided into two periods, before and after the introduction of EBUS at our facility. The diagnostic yield of cTBNA was compared between the study periods. Rapid on-site cytological examination was not available.A total of 1,050 patients (61.6% men; mean age 45.6 years) underwent cTBNA during the study period (849 before EBUS; 201 after EBUS). Sarcoidosis (n = 527) followed by bronchogenic carcinoma (n = 222) formed the most common indications for performing cTBNA. There was a significant increase in both the success of obtaining a representative sample (from 71% to 85%), and the diagnostic yield (from 33% to 49.5%) of cTBNA, after the introduction of EBUS. The increase in the diagnostic yield of cTBNA after introduction of EBUS remained significant even after adjusting for years of performing cTBNA and the type of anesthesia (topical vs. sedation and topical) on a multivariate analysis.The diagnostic yield of cTBNA at our facility increased after the introduction of EBUS-TBNA.

Therefore, we investigated 30-day all-cause mortality in patients with and without DM.Population-based medical databases were used to conduct a cohort study of all adult patients with community-acquired SAB in Northern Denmark, 2000-2011. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we computed hazard ratios as estimates of 30-day mortality rate ratios (MRRs) among patients with and without DM. We further investigated whether the prognostic impact of DM differed among patients with and without recent preadmission healthcare contacts (within 30 days of the current hospitalization) and by age, sex, marital status, level of comorbidity, and DM-related characteristics (e.g., duration of DM and presence of DM complications).Among 2638 SAB patients, 713 (27.0%) had DM. Thirty-day cumulative mortality was 25.8% in patients with DM and 24.3% in patients without DM, for an adjusted MRR (aMRR) of 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.84-1.20). In analyses with and without recent healthcare contacts, the corresponding aMRRs were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.62-1.14) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.91-1.41), respectively. Compared to patients without DM, the aMRR was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.74-1.20) for male patients with DM and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.87-1.47) for female patients with DM. The prognostic influence of DM on mortality did not differ notably with age, level of comorbidity, or characteristics of patients with DM.Patients with DM and community-acquired SAB did not experience higher 30-day mortality than patients without DM."
https://openalex.org/W2339775866,"Natural selective processes have been known to drive phenotypic plasticity, which is the emergence of different phenotypes from one genome following environmental stimulation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been observed to modulate transcriptional and epigenetic states of genes in human cells. We surmised that lncRNAs are governors of phenotypic plasticity and drive natural selective processes through epigenetic modulation of gene expression. Using heat shocked human cells as a model we find several differentially expressed transcripts with the top candidates being lncRNAs derived from retro-elements. One particular retro-element derived transcripts, Retro-EIF2S2, was found to be abundantly over-expressed in heat shocked cells. Over-expression of Retro-EIF2S2 significantly enhanced cell viability and modulated a predisposition for an adherent cellular phenotype upon heat shock. Mechanistically, we find that this retro-element derived transcript interacts directly with a network of proteins including 40S ribosomal protein S30 (FAU), Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A), and Ubiquitin-60S ribosomal protein L40 (UBA52) to affect protein modulated cell adhesion pathways. We find one motif in Retro-EIF2S2 that exhibits binding to FAU and modulates phenotypic cell transitions from adherent to suspension states. The observations presented here suggest that retroviral derived transcripts actively modulate phenotypic plasticity in human cells in response to environmental selective pressures and suggest that natural selection may play out through the action of retro-elements in human cells."

However, this action increased the residue of short-fragment DNA and its effect on vaccine potency was still elusive. In this study, we found residual sf-DNA in an inactivated EV71 vaccine could enhance humoral immune response in mice. Ag stimulation in vitro and vaccine injection in vivo revealed that TLR9 transcription level was elevated, indicating that sf-DNA could activate TLR9. These new findings will help us to understand the molecular mechanism induced by vero-cell culture-derived vaccines."
