https://openalex.org/W1988259427,"53BP1 (also called TP53BP1) is a chromatin-associated factor that promotes immunoglobulin class switching and DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end joining. To accomplish its function in DNA repair, 53BP1 accumulates at DSB sites downstream of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. How ubiquitin recruits 53BP1 to break sites remains unknown as its relocalization involves recognition of histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) methylation by its Tudor domain. Here we elucidate how vertebrate 53BP1 is recruited to the chromatin that flanks DSB sites. We show that 53BP1 recognizes mononucleosomes containing dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitinated on Lys 15 (H2AK15ub), the latter being a product of RNF168 action on chromatin. 53BP1 binds to nucleosomes minimally as a dimer using its previously characterized methyl-lysine-binding Tudor domain and a carboxy-terminal extension, termed the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif, which interacts with the epitope formed by H2AK15ub and its surrounding residues on the H2A tail. 53BP1 is therefore a bivalent histone modification reader that recognizes a histone 'code' produced by DSB signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2004736225,"The amount of ice present in mixed-phase clouds, which contain both supercooled liquid water droplets and ice particles, affects cloud extent, lifetime, particle size and radiative properties. The freezing of cloud droplets can be catalysed by the presence of aerosol particles known as ice nuclei. One of the most important ice nuclei is thought to be mineral dust aerosol from arid regions. It is generally assumed that clay minerals, which contribute approximately two-thirds of the dust mass, dominate ice nucleation by mineral dust, and many experimental studies have therefore focused on these materials. Here we use an established droplet-freezing technique to show that feldspar minerals dominate ice nucleation by mineral dusts under mixed-phase cloud conditions, despite feldspar being a minor component of dust emitted from arid regions. We also find that clay minerals are relatively unimportant ice nuclei. Our results from a global aerosol model study suggest that feldspar ice nuclei are globally distributed and that feldspar particles may account for a large proportion of the ice nuclei in Earth's atmosphere that contribute to freezing at temperatures below about -15 °C."
https://openalex.org/W2003010041,"A reference genome from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi is presented, along with sequences from 13 additional isolates, revealing a pan genome comprising core genes and genes variably distributed between strains: E. huxleyi is found to harbour extensive genetic variability under different metabolic repertoires, explaining its ability to thrive under a diverse range of environmental conditions. This paper presents a reference genome from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP1516. Coccolithophores are a major component of marine phytoplankton and can account for 20% of total carbon fixation in some systems, so have an important influence on global climate. Comparison of the reference genome to sequences from 13 other strains reveals a pan genome composed of core genes and genes variably distributed between strains. The findings indicate extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoires, explaining in part how E. huxleyi can thrive and form large-scale episodic blooms under a wide variety of environments. Coccolithophores have influenced the global climate for over 200 million years1. These marine phytoplankton can account for 20 per cent of total carbon fixation in some systems2. They form blooms that can occupy hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and are distinguished by their elegantly sculpted calcium carbonate exoskeletons (coccoliths), rendering them visible from space3. Although coccolithophores export carbon in the form of organic matter and calcite to the sea floor, they also release CO2 in the calcification process. Hence, they have a complex influence on the carbon cycle, driving either CO2 production or uptake, sequestration and export to the deep ocean4. Here we report the first haptophyte reference genome, from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP1516, and sequences from 13 additional isolates. Our analyses reveal a pan genome (core genes plus genes distributed variably between strains) probably supported by an atypical complement of repetitive sequence in the genome. Comparisons across strains demonstrate that E. huxleyi, which has long been considered a single species, harbours extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoires. Genome variability within this species complex seems to underpin its capacity both to thrive in habitats ranging from the equator to the subarctic and to form large-scale episodic blooms under a wide variety of environmental conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1996472996,"Histopathological samples are a treasure-trove of DNA for clinical research. However, the quality of DNA can vary depending on the source or extraction method applied. Thus a standardized and cost-effective workflow for the qualification of DNA preparations is essential to guarantee interlaboratory reproducible results. The qualification process consists of the quantification of double strand DNA (dsDNA) and the assessment of its suitability for downstream applications, such as high-throughput next-generation sequencing. We tested the two most frequently used instrumentations to define their role in this process: NanoDrop, based on UV spectroscopy, and Qubit 2.0, which uses fluorochromes specifically binding dsDNA. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used as the reference technique as it simultaneously assesses DNA concentration and suitability for PCR amplification. We used 17 genomic DNAs from 6 fresh-frozen (FF) tissues, 6 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, 3 cell lines, and 2 commercial preparations. Intra- and inter-operator variability was negligible, and intra-methodology variability was minimal, while consistent inter-methodology divergences were observed. In fact, NanoDrop measured DNA concentrations higher than Qubit and its consistency with dsDNA quantification by qPCR was limited to high molecular weight DNA from FF samples and cell lines, where total DNA and dsDNA quantity virtually coincide. In partially degraded DNA from FFPE samples, only Qubit proved highly reproducible and consistent with qPCR measurements. Multiplex PCR amplifying 191 regions of 46 cancer-related genes was designated the downstream application, using 40 ng dsDNA from FFPE samples calculated by Qubit. All but one sample produced amplicon libraries suitable for next-generation sequencing. NanoDrop UV-spectrum verified contamination of the unsuccessful sample. In conclusion, as qPCR has high costs and is labor intensive, an alternative effective standard workflow for qualification of DNA preparations should include the sequential combination of NanoDrop and Qubit to assess the purity and quantity of dsDNA, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2086039962,"The tips of mammalian digits can regenerate after amputation, like those of amphibians. It is unknown why this capacity is limited to the area associated with the nail. Here we show that nail stem cells (NSCs) reside in the proximal nail matrix and that the mechanisms governing NSC differentiation are coupled directly with their ability to orchestrate digit regeneration. Early nail progenitors undergo Wnt-dependent differentiation into the nail. After amputation, this Wnt activation is required for nail regeneration and also for attracting nerves that promote mesenchymal blastema growth, leading to the regeneration of the digit. Amputations proximal to the Wnt-active nail progenitors result in failure to regenerate the nail or digit. Nevertheless, β-catenin stabilization in the NSC region induced their regeneration. These results establish a link between NSC differentiation and digit regeneration, and suggest that NSCs may have the potential to contribute to the development of novel treatments for amputees."
https://openalex.org/W2108995360,"Many prokaryotes utilize small RNA transcribed from clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) to protect themselves from foreign genetic elements, such as phage and plasmids. In Escherichia coli, this small RNA is packaged into a surveillance complex (Cascade) that uses the RNA sequence to direct binding to invasive DNA. Once bound, Cascade recruits the Cas3 nuclease-helicase, which then proceeds to progressively degrade the invading DNA. Here, using individually purified Cascade and Cas3 from E. coli, we reconstitute CRISPR-mediated plasmid degradation in vitro. Analysis of this reconstituted assay suggests that Cascade recruits Cas3 to a single-stranded region of the DNA target exposed by Cascade binding. Cas3 then nicks the exposed DNA. Recruitment and nicking is stimulated by the presence, but not hydrolysis, of ATP. Following nicking and powered by ATP hydrolysis, the concerted actions of the helicase and nuclease domains of Cas3 proceed to unwind and degrade the entire DNA target in a unidirectional manner."
https://openalex.org/W2121153131,"In the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), the expression of the aromatase gene during gonad development is strictly limited to the female-producing temperature. The underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we identified the upstream 5'-flanking region of the aromatase gene, gonad-specific promoter, and the temperature-dependent DNA methylation signatures during gonad development in the red-eared slider turtle. The 5'-flanking region of the slider aromatase exhibited sequence similarities to the aromatase genes of the American alligator, chicken, quail, and zebra finch. A putative TATA box was located 31 bp upstream of the gonad-specific transcription start site. DNA methylation at the CpG sites between the putative binding sites of the fork head domain factor (FOX) and vertebrate steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) and adjacent TATA box in the promoter region were significantly lower in embryonic gonads at the female-producing temperature compared the male-producing temperature. A shift from male- to female-, but not from female- to male-, producing temperature changed the level of DNA methylation in gonads. Taken together these results indicate that the temperature, particularly female-producing temperature, allows demethylation at the specific CpG sites of the promoter region which leads the temperature-specific expression of aromatase during gonad development."
https://openalex.org/W2093791847,"Skin wound healing is an important lifesaving issue for massive lesions. A novel porous scaffold with collagen, hyaluronic acid and gelatin was developed for skin wound repair. The swelling ratio of this developed scaffold was assayed by water absorption capacity and showed a value of over 20 g water/g dried scaffold. The scaffold was then degraded in time- and dose-dependent manners by three enzymes: lysozyme, hyaluronidase and collagenase I. The average pore diameter of the scaffold was 132.5±8.4 µm measured from SEM images. With human skin cells growing for 7 days, the SEM images showed surface fractures on the scaffold due to enzymatic digestion, indicating the biodegradable properties of this scaffold. To simulate skin distribution, the human epidermal keratinocytes, melanocytes and dermal fibroblasts were seeded on the porous scaffold and the cross-section immunofluorescent staining demonstrated normal human skin layer distributions. The collagen amount was also quantified after skin cells seeding and presented an amount 50% higher than those seeded on culture wells. The in vivo histological results showed that the scaffold ameliorated wound healing, including decreasing neutrophil infiltrates and thickening newly generated skin compared to the group without treatments."

We have studied the S1R chaperone domain (residues 112–223; S1R(cd)) reconstituted into detergent micelles by solution NMR. S1R(cd) solubilized in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) adopts a conformation competent to bind BiP in a calcium-dependent manner. Analysis of the structure and dynamics indicates that S1R(cd) contains five helices and at least two short extended regions. Three of the helices in the C-terminal membrane-associated domain correspond closely to regions previously implicated in cholesterol and drug interactions. An ACA-free gene construct (GeneArt) containing a (His)6-tag, a factor Xa cleavage site, and residues 112–223 of human S1R was subcloned into the pCOLD-I vector (Takara) and confirmed by sequencing. The N-terminal sequence preceding residues 112–223 of S1R was MNHKVHHHHHHIEGRHM. The S1R(cd) plasmid and a pMazF plasmid containing the gene for the RNA interferase MazF (Takara) were transformed into C43(DE3) cells. Transformed cells were grown to an OD of 0.8–0.9, cold shocked on ice, and incubated for 45 min at 15 °C. Cells were pelleted and washed with M9 salt solution, spun again, and resuspended into isotopically labeled medium with a 10-fold condensation. Cells were then incubated for a further 45–60 min at 15 °C before induction with 2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Expression proceeded for 16 h at 15 °C. Both membranes and inclusion bodies were collected with a 40,000 rpm spin and incubated overnight in a solution containing 6 m guanidine, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. S1R(cd) was separated by nickel affinity chromatography and dialyzed against water to remove guanidine. The precipitated protein was resolubilized in hexafluoro-2-propanol and purified by HPLC on a C3 reverse phase column over a gradient from buffer A (95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to buffer B (57% 2-propanol, 38% acetonitrile, 5% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Fractions containing S1R(cd) were pooled and lyophilized. Yields of pure S1R(cd) from triple-labeled medium were between 8 and 10 mg per liter of labeled medium. Polyhistidine-tagged human BiP (residues 26–654; “full length”), the isolated nucleotide binding domain (NBD; residues 26–410), and the isolated substrate binding domain (SBD; residues 418–638) of BiP (Herwig Schüler, Karolinska Institutet) were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells at 18 °C according to a previously published protocol (18.Wisniewska M. Karlberg T. Lehtiö L. Johansson I. Kotenyova T. Moche M. Schüler H.

An ammonium sulfate precipitation was introduced as an initial purification step. The proteins were further purified by nickel chromatography, anion exchange chromatography using a Q-Sepharose column, and gel filtration using a Superdex200 column. S1R(cd) was reconstituted with detergent micelles for NMR measurements from thin films of protein and DPC that were solubilized in hexafluoro-2-propanol and dried down under a nitrogen stream (19.Call M.E.

The film was resolubilized in urea and reconstituted by dialysis against NMR buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.5. Based on integration of peaks in 1H one-dimensional spectra calibrated against samples with known detergent concentrations, the final amount of DPC in S1R(cd) NMR samples was ∼30 mm. Where indicated, certain samples of S1R(cd) were run over gel filtration rather than dialyzed to reduce the DPC concentration to 5 mm. Final protein concentrations for all NMR samples were ∼250 μm. All NMR experiments were collected at 37 °C at field strengths of 500, 600, 750, or 950 MHz (1H). The 750 and 950 MHz spectrometers were equipped with room temperature probes (home-built), and the 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers were equipped with cryogen-cooled probes (Bruker). NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (20.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView or CARA. Backbone 1HN, 15N, and 13Cα, and side chain 13Cβ assignments were obtained from triple resonance HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, and HNCO spectra on 15N, 13C, and 2H-labeled S1R(cd). Assignments were confirmed and extended to sidechain protons with 15N-edited NOESY (90- or 180-ms mixing times at 950 or 600 MHz, respectively) and 15N-edited TOCSY spectra (40-ms mixing time; 600 MHz). 15N R1, R2, and 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments were collected on a 0.27 mm 15N-labeled S1R(cd) sample at 600 MHz using the following relaxation delays: 4, 350, and 480 ms (T1) and 0, 40, and 60 ms (T2). Mn2+EDDA2− was prepared as described (21.Lau T.L. Partridge A.W. Ginsberg M.H. Ulmer T.S. Structure of the integrin β3 transmembrane segment in phospholipid bicelles and detergent micelles.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4008-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). 1H,15N HSQCs were recorded before and after addition of 1 mm Mn2+EDDA2−. The accessibility to water was taken to be inversely proportional to the ratio of cross-peak intensity in the absence (I) and presence (Io) of Mn2+EDDA2−. BiP titrations were carried out by preparing concentrated stocks of BiP constructs in 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm DPC, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.5. Isotope-labeled samples of S1R(cd) in identical conditions were titrated with BiP, and 1H,15N SOFAST-HMQC spectra (22.Schanda P. Kupce E. Brutscher B. SOFAST-HMQC experiments for recording two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation spectra of proteins within a few seconds.J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 33: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) were collected to monitor changes in cross-peak intensities and chemical shifts. CD spectra were collected on a Jasco J-815 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter by collecting spectra from 190–250 nm with 10 accumulations (far UV) or 250–350 nm with 10 accumulations. Samples for CD contained 17.5 μm (far UV) and 240 μm (near UV) S1R(cd) in 5 mm DPC and 20 mm potassium phosphate at pH 6.5. An S1R construct (S1R(cd)) containing the residues following the second putative transmembrane domain of S1R was produced with an N-terminal (His)6 tag using the single protein production approach (23.Suzuki M. Mao L. Inouye M. Single protein production (SPP) system in Escherichia coli.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2). Attempts to reconstitute S1R(cd) into aqueous solution in the absence of lipids or detergent resulted in protein aggregation. Therefore, S1R(cd) was reconstituted in the presence of DPC micelles. The resulting sample yielded homogenous NMR spectra permitting acquisition of high resolution data (Fig. 3).FIGURE 31H,15N HSQC spectrum (600 MHz, 1H) of S1R(cd) in 5 mm DPC at 37 °C. Backbone amide resonance assignments are indicated. The positions of the cross-peaks corresponding to residues Arg-114 and Gly-118, which are weak, are indicated with dashed line circles. The five cross-peak pairs expected from asparagine and glutamine H2N(ϵ2) groups of the S1R(cd) construct are indicated with horizontal lines. Inset, the four tryptophan HN(ϵ1) cross-peaks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The overall secondary and tertiary structure of S1R(cd) was probed with CD. Far UV CD of S1R(cd) in 5 mm DPC exhibited minima at 208 nm and ∼220 nm (Fig. 4A). A lack of a well defined minimum at 222 nm suggested the presence also of a small amount of β-strand structure. Tertiary structure was assessed by CD at near UV wavelengths (Fig. 4B). A negative peak at 280 nm and a positive peak at ∼290 nm indicated the presence of tertiary structure. To test whether the tertiary structure could be disrupted at high temperature, a second spectrum was collected at 95 °C. At 95 °C, the 290-nm peak disappears and the 280-nm peak is decreased, indicating unfolding at high temperature. Conventional amide proton-based NMR experiments enabled backbone resonance assignment of 104 of the 107 nonproline residues of S1R(cd) (Fig. 3). Many of the amide proton NOESY strips for residues ∼140 to 160 contained cross-peaks at the water proton chemical shift indicating chemical exchange, and few medium range NOEs (i.e. dαN(i + 3)) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, NOE strips for residues ∼120–140 and ∼160–220 exhibited extensive short and medium range NOEs. Secondary chemical shift analysis was used to facilitate determination of S1R(cd) secondary structure (Fig. 5B). Chemical shift indexing of individual nuclei and TALOS+ analysis predicted helices at residues ∼121–137, ∼167–175, ∼180–189, and ∼193–219. Although chemical shifts predicted a continuous helix from residues ∼193–219, a large increase in the measured rate of exchange of the amide protons of residues 211–213 with water indicated disruption of the helical hydrogen bonding network and a break in this helix (see below). In addition, secondary chemical shifts predicted a φ/ψ angle for Ile-128 that corresponded to an extended conformation, suggesting that helix 1 may also be disrupted. However, there were no corresponding increases in the amide exchange rate or dynamics for this residue (see below). Regions of extended structure could be determined with less confidence than helical regions, although an extended conformation is likely for residues ∼145–147 and ∼153–155. Chemical shift indices analysis and intense daN(i + 1) NOEs suggested the possibility of a third β-strand in residues ∼160–162, but the RCI indicated a high degree of flexibility in these residues. Backbone amide dynamics of S1R(cd) were probed by measuring 15N transverse (R2) and longitudinal (R1) relaxation rates and 1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs (Fig. 6). Small 15N R2 values and negative or small heteronuclear NOEs were found throughout the region of residues 142–163, consistent with the low amount of structure in this region, although increased heteronuclear NOEs in residues 145–147 correlated with the chemical shift-based prediction that these residues are in a stable extended conformation. In addition, the relaxation properties of some of the interhelical regions at the C terminus exhibited decreased heteronuclear NOEs and 15N R2 relaxation rates, indicating increased flexibility, particularly in Ile-178 between helices 2 and 3, Val-190 between helices 3 and 4, and Arg-211 between helices 4 and 5. R2/R1 ratios correlate with the effective rotational correlation time (24.Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Backbone dynamics of proteins as studied by 15N inverse detected heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy: application to staphylococcal nuclease.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) and are plotted in Fig. 6D for S1R(cd). The average R2/R1 value for helical residues was 14.0 ± 2.2, which corresponds to a rotational correlation time (τc) of ∼11.6ns. This τc is nearly twice that expected for a 14.7-kDa protein at 37 °C (∼6.1 ns), suggesting that the protein is tightly associated with a detergent micelle. Although residues in helices 1, 2, 3, and 5 exhibited similar mean τc values (10.9–11.5 ns), residues in helix 4 had a mean τc value of 12.4 ns. Although effects from rotational anisotropy or contributions to the R2 from conformational exchange could not be ruled out, the higher τc value for helix 4 was consistent with this helix anchoring S1R(cd) to the detergent micelle (see below). Based on observation of cross-peaks at the water proton resonance frequency in the NOESY, a large number of backbone amides within the region of residues 140–160 had apparent amide proton chemical exchange with water. Therefore, the rates of backbone amide exchange with water were measured using CLEANEX experiments (Fig. 7A) (25.Hwang T.L. van Zijl P.C. Mori S. Accurate quantitation of water-amide proton exchange rates using the phase-modulated CLEAN chemical EXchange (CLEANEX-PM) approach with a Fast-HSQC (FHSQC) detection scheme.J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In the region between helices 1 and 2, residues 137, 139–144, 149–151, and ∼155–161 had the largest exchange rates. Exchange rates in the predicted extended regions (residues 145–147 and 153–155) were low, suggesting the presence of β-sheet structure. Increases in exchange were also observed in the interhelical regions in the C-terminal half of S1R(cd) and helped to assign breaks in the helices. Low amide proton exchange rates may be due to hydrogen bonding and/or inaccessibility to bulk water. Therefore, we measured line-broadening effects from the water-soluble paramagnetic agent Mn2+EDDA2−. Broadening of many resonances corresponding to the N-terminal half of S1R(cd) was observed, indicating few continuous regions of protection from water. In contrast, the two segments of residues ∼174–184 and ∼197–206 showed relatively high levels of protection (I/Io > ∼0.5), indicating interactions with the detergent micelle and/or other regions of the protein. Regions of interactions of S1R(cd) with the detergent micelle were assessed from an 15N-edited NOESY (90 ms) recorded on an 15N-labeled and partially deuterated sample at high field (950 MHz) to resolve cross-peak overlaps and reduce spin diffusion (Fig. 5A). The largest clusters of residues with NOEs to detergent occurred in residues 183–189 in helix 3 and residues 197–204 in helix 4. Helix 4 was also strongly protected from the water-soluble paramagnetic agent. The region ∼198–206 forms an amphipathic helix, with residues Leu-199, Phe-200, Leu-203, and Tyr-206 forming the hydrophobic face (26.Gautier R. Douguet D. Antonny B. Drin G. HELIQUEST: a web server to screen sequences with specific α-helical properties.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2101-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Previous work by Hayashi et al. (1.Hayashi T. Su T.P. Sigma-1 receptor chaperones at the ER-mitochondrion interface regulate Ca2+ signaling and cell survival.Cell. 2007; 131: 596-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) showed that S1R residues 116–223 are sufficient for binding to the Hsp70 protein BiP. Therefore, the NMR spectrum of 15N-labeled S1R(cd) was monitored as a function of unlabeled BiP concentration (Fig. 8). The S1R(cd) cross-peak intensities decreased in a BiP concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that a BiP·S1R(cd) complex was formed. After several hours, a white precipitate formed, indicating that the complex was unstable in solution. By contrast, BiP alone in the titration buffer (containing 30 mm DPC) was more stable. It was speculated that binding of the S1R(cd)·micelle complex to BiP may increase the local concentration of DPC to destabilize BiP. The changes in 1H-15N cross-peak intensities upon addition of full-length BiP were plotted as a function of residue number at molar ratios of 0.5 and 1 ([BiP]/[S1R(cd)]) (Fig. 8A). Decreases in cross-peak intensities were higher for residues in the structured helical regions and smaller in the flexibly disordered regions at the N and C termini and residues ∼140–160, suggesting that these disordered residues retained some flexibility in the complex. BiP chaperone (27.Kassenbrock C.K. Kelly R.B. Interaction of heavy chain binding protein (BiP/GRP78) with adenine nucleotides.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and ATPase (1.Hayashi T. Su T.P. Sigma-1 receptor chaperones at the ER-mitochondrion interface regulate Ca2+ signaling and cell survival.Cell. 2007; 131: 596-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) activity has been shown to be inhibited by calcium, and the interaction between BiP and S1R is proposed also to be modulated by calcium under physiological conditions, with the presence of calcium leading to increased association and inactivation of S1R and BiP (1.Hayashi T. Su T.P. Sigma-1 receptor chaperones at the ER-mitochondrion interface regulate Ca2+ signaling and cell survival.Cell. 2007; 131: 596-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Therefore, a second titration of full-length BiP against S1R(cd) was carried out in the presence of 2.5 mm calcium chloride. A comparison of the cross-peak intensities for helical residues as a function of BiP indicates an increased association of S1R(cd) for full-length BiP in the presence of calcium (Fig. 8B). No chemical shift changes were observed upon addition of calcium to S1R(cd) alone, consistent with a calcium binding site on BiP (18.Wisniewska M. Karlberg T. Lehtiö L. Johansson I. Kotenyova T. Moche M. Schüler H. Crystal structures of the ATPase domains of four human Hsp70 isoforms: HSPA1L/Hsp70-hom, HSPA2/Hsp70–2, HSPA6/Hsp70B', and HSPA5/BiP/GRP78.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8625Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To test whether the NBD of BiP was sufficient for S1R binding, the isolated domain was titrated against S1R(cd). Addition of the NBD resulted in similar changes in intensities as full-length BiP (Fig. 8B), indicating that the BiP NBD was sufficient for S1R interactions. The NBD domain was generally less stable than full-length BiP and more unstable in the presence of calcium, preventing evaluation of the effects of calcium on the NBD interaction with S1R(cd). In contrast, no changes in intensities or chemical shifts were observed after addition of the SBD (Fig. 8D). Most membrane-associated proteins remain difficult to express at sufficient levels to enable inexpensive isotope labeling. We have found that the chaperone domain of human S1R could be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli using the single protein production approach (23.Suzuki M. Mao L. Inouye M. Single protein production (SPP) system in Escherichia coli.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In single protein production, the cells remain metabolically active and express the target protein, but cell growth is halted, which appears to greatly diminish expression toxicity. The approach permitted 10-fold condensation of the cultures when transferring the cells into labeled medium and resulted in yields of 8–10 mg of pure S1R(cd) per liter of labeled medium. The S1R chaperone domain is predicted to contain a C-terminal membrane-associated region (residues ∼180–203). Consistent with this prediction, solubilization o"

https://openalex.org/W1964734437,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, which is becoming an increasingly global public health problem due to the rise of drug-resistant strains. While residing in the human host, M. tuberculosis needs to acquire iron for its survival. M. tuberculosis has two iron uptake mechanisms, one that utilizes non-heme iron and another that taps into the vast host heme-iron pool. To date, proteins known to be involved in mycobacterial heme uptake are Rv0203, MmpL3, and MmpL11. Whereas Rv0203 transports heme across the bacterial periplasm or scavenges heme from host heme proteins, MmpL3 and MmpL11 are thought to transport heme across the membrane. In this work, we characterize the heme-binding properties of the predicted extracellular soluble E1 domains of both MmpL3 and MmpL11 utilizing absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopic methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Rv0203 transfers heme to both MmpL3-E1 and MmpL11-E1 domains at a rate faster than passive heme dissociation from Rv0203. This work elucidates a key step in the mycobacterial uptake of heme, and it may be useful in the development of anti-tuberculosis drugs targeting this pathway."

The CerS6KO mice show behavioral abnormalities including a clasping abnormality of their hind limbs and a habituation deficit. LacZ reporter expression in the brain reveals CerS6 expression in hippocampus, cortex, and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum.

https://openalex.org/W1978213316,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are essential to the normal function of the vertebrate nervous system. Aberrant function of VGSCs underlies a variety of disorders, including epilepsy, arrhythmia, and pain. A large number of animal toxins target these ion channels and may have significant therapeutic potential. Most of these toxins, however, have not been characterized in detail. Here, by combining patch clamp electrophysiology and radioligand binding studies with peptide mutagenesis, NMR structure determination, and molecular modeling, we have revealed key molecular determinants of the interaction between the tarantula toxin huwentoxin-IV and two VGSC isoforms, Nav1.7 and Nav1.2. Nine huwentoxin-IV residues (F6A, P11A, D14A, L22A, S25A, W30A, K32A, Y33A, and I35A) were important for block of Nav1.7 and Nav1.2. Importantly, molecular dynamics simulations and NMR studies indicated that folding was normal for several key mutants, suggesting that these amino acids probably make specific interactions with sodium channel residues. Additionally, we identified several amino acids (F6A, K18A, R26A, and K27A) that are involved in isoform-specific VGSC interactions. Our structural and functional data were used to model the docking of huwentoxin-IV into the domain II voltage sensor of Nav1.7. The model predicts that a hydrophobic patch composed of Trp-30 and Phe-6, along with the basic Lys-32 residue, docks into a groove formed by the Nav1.7 S1-S2 and S3-S4 loops. These results provide new insight into the structural and molecular basis of sodium channel block by huwentoxin-IV and may provide a basis for the rational design of toxin-based peptides with improved VGSC potency and/or selectivity."

Bourke B. Lewis C. The Macrophage. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 73-102Google Scholar). On the other hand, “alternatively activated (M2)” macrophages are induced by anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13 (11.Gordon S. Alternative activation of macrophages.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4733) Google Scholar). In addition, M1 macrophages produce high levels of toxic intermediates (e.g. nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates) via the activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (12.Modolell M. Corraliza I.M. Link F. Soler G. Eichmann K. Reciprocal regulation of the nitric oxide synthase/arginase balance in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages by TH1 and TH2 cytokines.Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), whereas arginase production is increased in M2 macrophages (13.Munder M. Eichmann K. Modolell M.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 5347-5354PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested that a high fat diet triggers the recruitment of M1 macrophages into the adipose tissue, whereas adipose tissue macrophages in lean animals exhibit an M2 phenotype (14.Lumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. Obesity induces a phenotypic switch in adipose tissue macrophage polarization.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (3335) Google Scholar). In obese mice, TNF-α, a potent proinflammatory cytokine, is produced by M1 ATMs (7.Kanda H. Tateya S. Tamori Y. Kotani K. Hiasa K. Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Miyachi H. Maeda S. Egashira K. Kasuga M.

Teruel T. Hernandez R. Lorenzo M. Tumor necrosis factor-α produces insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by activation of inhibitor κB kinase in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner.J. Biol.

Ikutani M. Oya T. Kanatani Y. Tsuneyama K. Nagai Y. Takatsu K. Urakaze M. Kobayashi M. Tobe K. Regulatory mechanisms for adipose tissue M1 and M2 macrophages in diet-induced obese mice.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2574-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The administration of IL-10 in diet-induced obese mice enhances the activation of insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle (18.Hong E.G. Ko H.J. Cho Y.R. Kim H.J. Ma Z. Yu T.Y. Friedline R.H. Kurt-Jones E. Finberg R. Fischer M.A. Granger E.L. Norbury C.C. Hauschka S.D. Philbrick W.M. Lee C.G. Elias J.A. Kim J.K. Interleukin-10 prevents diet-induced insulin resistance by attenuating macrophage and cytokine response in skeletal muscle.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2525-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, the balance between M1/M2 ATMs is important for maintaining the proper balance of pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine production in the adipose tissue, and its imbalance can lead to the development of insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying the determination of the ATM phenotypes are not fully understood. Oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines, exhibits a variety of biological effects depending on the target cells by binding to a heterodimeric membrane receptor comprising the OSM-specific β subunit (OSMRβ) and gp130 (19.Tanaka M. Hara T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Miyajima A. Reconstitution of the functional mouse oncostatin M (OSM) receptor. Molecular cloning of the mouse OSM receptor β subunit.Blood. 1999; 93: 804-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OSM is synthesized by various inflammatory cells, such as activated T-cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages (20.Tamura S. Morikawa Y. Miyajima A. Senba E. Expression of oncostatin M in hematopoietic organs.Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21.Wallace P.M. MacMaster J.F. Rouleau K.A. Brown T.J. Loy J.K. Donaldson K.L. Wahl A.F. Regulation of inflammatory responses by oncostatin M.J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5547-5555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of OSMRβ is induced in human peripheral blood monocytes treated with LPS (22.Dillon S.R. Sprecher C. Hammond A. Bilsborough J. Rosenfeld-Franklin M. Presnell S.R. Haugen H.S. Maurer M. Harder B. Johnston J. Bort S. Mudri S. Kuijper J.L. Bukowski T. Shea P. Dong D.L. Dasovich M. Grant F.J. Lockwood L. Levin S.D. LeCiel C. Waggie K. Day H. Topouzis S. Kramer J.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), suggesting that OSM plays an important role in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells during inflammation. However, the roles of OSM in ATMs and in metabolic disorders remain to be elucidated. In the present study we have addressed this question using OSMRβ-deficient (OSMRβ−/−) mice. Male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) were purchased from Nihon SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). The generation of OSMRβ−/− mice has been described previously (23.Tanaka M. Hirabayashi Y. Sekiguchi T. Inoue T. Katsuki M. Miyajima A. Targeted disruption of oncostatin M receptor results in altered hematopoiesis.Blood. 2003; 102: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). OSMRβ+/+ wild-type (WT) and OSMRβ−/− littermates were obtained from our breeding colony using heterozygous (+/−) breeding pairs. Male and female WT and OSMRβ−/− mice from 8 to 32 weeks old were used in the present study. All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free facilities and under light (12 h light/dark cycle)-, temperature (22–25 °C)-, and humidity (50–60% relative humidity)-controlled conditions. Mice were allowed free access to food (MF; Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) and water. C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle or recombinant mouse OSM (12.5 ng/g body weight; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) twice a day (10:00 and 18:00 h) for 1 week. OSMRβ−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle or sodium salicylate (120 μg/g body weight; Sigma) once a day (18:00 h) for 2 weeks. The mice were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether, and the epididymal adipose tissue were quickly removed. The adipose tissue was minced into fine pieces and digested with collagenase type 2 (Sigma) with PBS supplemented with 2% FCS at 37 °C for 20 min with high speed shaking. Next, the samples were passed through a 100-μm mesh (BD Biosciences) and fractioned by brief centrifugation (1200 rpm) at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. The floating cells were collected as the adipocyte fraction, and the pellets were collected as the SVF. The cells in the SVF were incubated with ammonium chloride buffer (PharmLyse; BD Biosciences) to lyse the erythrocytes. To evaluate insulin signaling, mice fasted for 24 h were intraperitoneally injected with human insulin (10 milliunits/g body weight). Ten minutes later epididymal fat, gastrocnemius muscle, and liver tissue were excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue lysates were prepared as described below. The preparation of PEMs was performed as described previously with some modifications (24.Morikawa Y. Furotani M. Matsuura N. Kakudo K. The role of antigen-presenting cells in the regulation of delayed-type hypersensitivity. II. Epidermal Langerhans' cells and peritoneal exudate macrophages.Cell. Immunol. 1993; 152: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Macrophages elicited in the 3 days after an intraperitoneal injection of 3 ml of thioglycollate medium (BD Biosciences) were harvested by flushing of the peritoneal cavity with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) with plastic syringes, suspended in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS, and incubated on 35-mm plastic dishes for 2 h at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish. Non-adherent cells were discarded, and the adherent cells were cultured at 37 °C for 3 days. PEMs were starved in DMEM with 0.75% bovine serum albumin for 16 h before the stimulation. Then PEMs were treated with PBS or 100 ng/ml concentrations of recombinant mouse OSM and maintained for the appropriate periods. Cell culture was performed with some modifications as described previously (25.Komori T. Doi A. Furuta H. Wakao H. Nakao N. Nakazato M. Nanjo K. Senba E. Morikawa Y.

Chem. 2010; 285: 37884-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, was grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml of penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen). All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish and cultured in a standard medium for 24 h. The cells were then treated with 10 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (Sigma) for 16 h and washed by a standard medium twice. Then the cells were treated with vehicle or 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse OSM and maintained for 24 h. The cells in the SVF were incubated with anti-CD16/CD32 antibodies (1:100, BD Biosciences) to block Fc binding at 4 °C for 20 min followed by incubation with fluorescently labeled primary antibodies or control IgG at 4 °C for 30 min. The FITC-conjugated anti-F4/80, FITC-conjugated rat IgG2a isotype controls, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD11c, PE-conjugated Armenian hamster IgG2a isotype controls, FITC-conjugated anti-Gr-1, FITC-conjugated rat IgG2b isotype controls, PE-conjugated anti-CD11b, and PE-conjugated rat IgG2b isotype controls were purchased from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA). The PE- or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-CD206 and their isotype controls were purchased from AbD Serotec (Oxford, UK). To detect OSMRβ in the SVF and PEMs, cells were incubated with goat anti-OSMRβ antibodies (diluted at 1: 5, R&D Systems) or control goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 4 °C for 30 min. Then the cells were incubated with PE-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (diluted at 1: 20, R&D Systems). The stained cells were analyzed using the C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) or the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were removed from the analysis using propidium iodide staining. The flow cytometry results were analyzed using the CFlow (BD Biosciences), the CellQuest software program (BD Biosciences), or FlowJo software suites (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). The events were first gated based on forward scatter versus propidium iodide to identify individual live cells. The plot of a forward versus side scatter was used as the second gate to gate out aggregates and debris. Next, the F4/80-positive cells were selected. Single color controls were used to set the compensation and gates. Western blot analysis was performed with some modifications as described previously (25.Komori T. Doi A. Furuta H. Wakao H. Nakao N.

Lysates were prepared by using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Upstate Biotechnology), 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Twenty micrograms of protein from the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare). The blotted membranes were incubated with rat anti-CD206 antibody (diluted at 1:500, AbD Serotec), rabbit anti-CD163 antibody (diluted at 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-iNOS antibody (diluted at 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-arginase-1 antibody (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-phosphorylated Akt antibody (diluted at 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-Akt antibody (diluted at 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phosphorylated STAT3 antibody (diluted at 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-STAT3 antibody (diluted at 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) antibody (diluted at 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit anti-CREB antibody (diluted at 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). Then the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat (diluted at 1:4,000, GE Healthcare), donkey anti-rat (diluted at 1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch), donkey anti-rabbit (diluted at 1:20,000, GE Healthcare), or donkey anti-mouse (diluted at 1:20,000, GE Healthcare) IgG antibodies. Labeled proteins were detected with chemiluminescence using ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were exposed to hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare) for an appropriate period. The blotted membranes were stripped in 0.25 m glycine, pH 2.5, at RT for 10 min and incubated with rat anti-tubulin antibody (diluted at 1:500; Abcam) at 4 °C for 16 h followed by the incubation with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rat antibody (diluted at 1:4000) at RT for 1 h. Immunofluorescence staining was performed with some modifications as described previously (26.Komori T. Gyobu H. Ueno H. Kitamura T. Senba E. Morikawa Y.

Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether, and the epididymal fat pads were quickly removed. Then the fat pads were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h followed by the preincubation in 5% normal donkey serum at RT for 1 h. Then the fat pads were incubated with goat anti-OSM antibody (diluted at 1:400), goat anti-OSMRβ antibody (diluted at 1:400), rat anti-F4/80 antibody (diluted at 1:1000; AbD Serotec), and rabbit anti-caveolin-1 antibody (diluted at 1:400; BD Biosciences). The fat pads were incubated with Cy2-conjugated, Cy3-conjugated, or biotinylated secondary antibodies (diluted at 1:800; Jackson ImmunoResearch) at RT for 1 h. Then the fat pads were incubated with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid-conjugated streptavidin (diluted at 1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch) at RT for 30 min and mounted in the mounting media (90% glycerol and 10% PBS) on the chambered slide. Immunofluorescence images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM700; Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan). To complete an immunohistochemical analysis in pancreas, mice were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.85% NaCl followed by ice-cold Zamboni's fixative (2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 m PBS). Tissues were quickly removed, postfixed in the same fixative at 4 °C for 3 h, and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in 0.1 m PBS. All specimens were frozen rapidly in cold n-hexane on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Frozen sections were cut on a cryostat (6-μm thickness). The sections were preincubated in 5% normal donkey serum at RT for 1 h followed by the incubation with rabbit anti-insulin antibody (diluted at 1:400; Abcam). Then they were incubated with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (diluted at 1:800; Jackson ImmunoResearch) at RT for 1 h followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) at RT for 30 min. Thereafter, the peroxidase reaction product was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.01% H2O2. After the reaction, the sections were counterstained with Eosin Y (Muto Pure Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). Images were acquired by using a BIOREVO BZ-9000 microscope (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan). To evaluate the area of β-cell in pancreas, every 20th section was selected from a series of consecutive pancreatic sections (6 μm), and 12 sections per mouse were used for analysis. For each section the cells were considered to be positive for insulin if the cell bodies were stained brown. The area of β-cells and pancreas was measured by using Image J analysis software (Version 1.46r, Scion, Frederick, MD). The following controls were performed: (i) incubation with protein A-purified goat or rabbit IgG instead of primary antibody; (ii) incubation without the primary antibody or without primary and secondary antibodies. None of the controls revealed any labeling (data not shown). These procedures were performed with some modifications as described previously (28.Komori T. Morikawa Y. Tamura S. Doi A. Nanjo K. Senba E. Subcellular localization of glucose transporter 4 in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of ob/ob mice under basal conditions.Brain Res. 2005; 1049: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mice were fasted for 4 h to remove the effects of food intake on glucose metabolism, and blood was taken from the tail vein at 18:00 h. In fasting experiments, mice were fasted for 24 h with free access to water. Then serum was immediately collected and stored at −20 °C. Blood glucose levels were measured by a glucose measurement device (Glucocard GT-1640, Arkray, Kyoto, Japan). The serum insulin concentrations were determined using kits from Morinaga (Tokyo, Japan). For ipGTT, the mice were fasted for 16 h and received an intraperitoneal injection of d-glucose (1 g/kg body weight). The blood samples were collected from the tail vein before and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the injection of d-glucose. For ITT, mice were fasted for 4 h and received an intraperitoneal injection of insulin (1 unit/kg body weight). The blood samples were collected from the tail vein before and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the injection of insulin. Concentrations of serum TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, adiponectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured by ELISA kits (R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The serum concentrations of leptin, serum amyloid A, and OSM were determined using ELISA kits from Morinaga, Invitrogen, and USCN Life Science (Wuhan, China), respectively. The serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and free fatty acids were measured at Nagahama Life Science Laboratory (Nagahama, Japan) using lipid assay kits (Triglyceride E-Test Wako, Total Cholesterol E-Test Wako, and NEFA C-Test Wako, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The contents of the triglycerides and total cholesterol in the liver were analyzed at Skylight Biotech (Akita, Japan). Lipids were extracted from the livers using the Folch method (29.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen liver tissues were homogenized, and triglycerides and total cholesterol were extracted from the homogenate with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), dried, and resuspended in 2-propanol. The amounts of triglycerides and total cholesterol in the extract were measured using lipid assay kits (Cholestest TG and Cholestest CHO, Sekisui Medical, Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with some modifications as described previously (25.Komori T. Doi A. Furuta H. Wakao H. Nakao N. Nakazato M. Nanjo K. Senba E. Morikawa Y.

https://openalex.org/W2137288582,"Cyclic di-AMP has been recognized as a ubiquitous second messenger involved in the regulation of bacterial signal transduction. However, little is known about the control of its synthesis and its physiological role in bacteria. In this study, we report a novel mechanism of control of c-di-AMP synthesis and its effects on bacterial growth in Mycobacterium smegmatis. We identified a DisA homolog in M. smegmatis, MsDisA, as an enzyme involved in c-di-AMP synthesis. Furthermore, MsRadA, a RadA homolog in M. smegmatis was found to act as an antagonist of the MsDisA protein. MsRadA can physically interact with MsDisA and inhibit the c-di-AMP synthesis activity of MsDisA. Overexpression of MsdisA in M. smegmatis led to cell expansion and bacterial aggregation as well as loss of motility. However, co-expression of MsradA and MsdisA rescued these abnormal phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that the interaction between RadA and DisA and its role in inhibiting c-di-AMP synthesis may be conserved in bacteria. Our findings enhance our understanding of the control of c-di-AMP synthesis and its physiological roles in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2011517712,"Neurotrophin-regulated gene expression is believed to play a key role in long-term changes in synaptic structure and the formation of dendritic spines. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to induce increases in dendritic spine formation, and this process is thought to function in part by stimulating CREB-dependent transcriptional changes. To identify CREB-regulated genes linked to BDNF-induced synaptogenesis, we profiled transcriptional occupancy of CREB in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, de novo motif analysis of hippocampal ChIP-Seq data identified a non-canonical CRE motif (TGGCG) that was enriched at CREB target regions and conferred CREB-responsiveness. Because cytoskeletal remodeling is an essential element of the formation of dendritic spines, within our screens we focused our attention on genes previously identified as inhibitors of RhoA GTPase. Bioinformatic analyses identified dozens of candidate CREB target genes known to regulate synaptic architecture and function. We showed that two of these, the RhoA inhibitors Par6C (Pard6A) and Rnd3 (RhoE), are BDNF-induced CREB-regulated genes. Interestingly, CREB occupied a cluster of non-canonical CRE motifs in the Rnd3 promoter region. Lastly, we show that BDNF-stimulated synaptogenesis requires the expression of Par6C and Rnd3, and that overexpression of either protein is sufficient to increase synaptogenesis. Thus, we propose that BDNF can regulate formation of functional synapses by increasing the expression of the RhoA inhibitors, Par6C and Rnd3. This study shows that genome-wide analyses of CREB target genes can facilitate the discovery of new regulators of synaptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2109415652,"The role of men who have sex with men (MSM) in the African HIV epidemic is gaining recognition yet capacity to address the HIV prevention needs of this group is limited. HIV testing and counselling is not only a critical entry point for biomedical HIV prevention interventions, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis, rectal microbicides and early treatment initiation, but is also an opportunity for focused risk reduction counselling that can support individuals living in difficult circumstances. For prevention efforts to succeed, however, MSM need to access services and they will only do so if these are non-judgmental, informative, focused on their needs, and of clear benefit. This study aimed to understand Kenyan providers' attitudes towards and experiences with counselling MSM in a research clinic targeting this group for HIV prevention. We used in-depth interviews to explore values, attitudes and cognitive and social constructs of 13 counsellors and 3 clinicians providing services to MSM at this clinic. Service providers felt that despite their growing experience, more targeted training would have been helpful to improve their effectiveness in MSM-specific risk reduction counselling. They wanted greater familiarity with MSM in Kenya to better understand the root causes of MSM risk-taking (e.g., poverty, sex work, substance abuse, misconceptions about transmission, stigma, and sexual desire) and felt frustrated at the perceived intractability of some of their clients' issues. In addition, they identified training needs on how to question men about specific risk behaviours, improved strategies for negotiating risk reduction with counselling clients, and improved support supervision from senior counsellors. This paper describes the themes arising from these interviews and makes practical recommendations on training and support supervision systems for nascent MSM HIV prevention programmes in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2010690249,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia associated with the expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the ataxin-1 (ATXN1) protein. Recent studies suggest that understanding the normal function of ATXN1 in cellular processes is essential to decipher the pathogenesis mechanisms in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. We found an alternative translation initiation ATG codon in the +3 reading frame of human ATXN1 starting 30 nucleotides downstream of the initiation codon for ATXN1 and ending at nucleotide 587. This novel overlapping open reading frame (ORF) encodes a 21-kDa polypeptide termed Alt-ATXN1 (Alternative ATXN1) with a completely different amino acid sequence from ATXN1. We introduced a hemagglutinin tag in-frame with Alt-ATXN1 in ATXN1 cDNA and showed in cell culture the co-expression of both ATXN1 and Alt-ATXN1. Remarkably, Alt-ATXN1 colocalized and interacted with ATXN1 in nuclear inclusions. In contrast, in the absence of ATXN1 expression, Alt-ATXN1 displays a homogenous nucleoplasmic distribution. Alt-ATXN1 interacts with poly(A)(+) RNA, and its nuclear localization is dependent on RNA transcription. Polyclonal antibodies raised against Alt-ATXN1 confirmed the expression of Alt-ATXN1 in human cerebellum expressing ATXN1. These results demonstrate that human ATXN1 gene is a dual coding sequence and that ATXN1 interacts with and controls the subcellular distribution of Alt-ATXN1."
https://openalex.org/W2042989487,"The μ-opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, undergoes extensive alternative pre-mRNA splicing, as illustrated by the identification of an array of splice variants generated by both 5' and 3' alternative splicing. The current study reports the identification of another set of splice variants conserved across species that are generated through exon skipping or insertion that encodes proteins containing only a single transmembrane (TM) domain. Using a Tet-Off system, we demonstrated that the truncated single TM variants can dimerize with the full-length 7-TM μ-opioid receptor (MOR-1) in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to increased expression of MOR-1 at the protein level by a chaperone-like function that minimizes endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. In vivo antisense studies suggested that the single TM variants play an important role in morphine analgesia, presumably through modulation of receptor expression levels. Our studies suggest the functional roles of truncated receptors in other G protein-coupled receptor families."
https://openalex.org/W2052595529,"Body condition is an indicator of health, and it plays a key role in many vital processes for mammalian species. While evidence of individual body condition can be obtained, these observations provide just brief glimpses into the health state of the animal. An analytical framework is needed for understanding how health of animals changes over space and time.Through knowledge of individual health we can better understand the status of populations. This is particularly important in endangered species, where the consequences of disruption of critical biological functions can push groups of animals rapidly toward extinction. Here we built a state-space model that provides estimates of movement, health, and survival. We assimilated 30+ years of photographic evidence of body condition and three additional visual health parameters in individual North Atlantic right whales, together with survey data, to infer the true health status as it changes over space and time. We also included the effect of reproductive status and entanglement status on health. At the population level, we estimated differential movement patterns in males and females. At the individual level, we estimated the likely animal locations each month. We estimated the relationship between observed and latent health status. Observations of body condition, skin condition, cyamid infestation on the blowholes, and rake marks all provided measures of the true underlying health. The resulting time series of individual health highlight both normal variations in health status and how anthropogenic stressors can affect the health and, ultimately, the survival of individuals. This modeling approach provides information for monitoring of health in right whales, as well as a framework for integrating observational data at the level of individuals up through the health status of the population. This framework can be broadly applied to a variety of systems – terrestrial and marine – where sporadic observations of individuals exist."
https://openalex.org/W2034082973,"Background Beef cattle are among the most economically important animals in the world because they are farmed for their meat and leather. However, a lack of genetic information remains an obstacle to understanding the mechanisms behind the development of this animal. Analysis of the beef cattle transcriptome and its expression profile data are essential to extending the genetic information resources for this species and would support studies on this animal. Results RNA sequencing of beef cattle was performed using the Illumina High-Seq2000 platform. A total of 25,605,140 and 26,214,800 reads were sequenced for embryonic and adult pooled samples, respectively. We identified 24,464–29,994 novel transcript units in two pooled samples. In addition, 8,533–10,144 genes showed evidence of alternative splicing, in agreement with the finding that alternative 3′ splicing is the most common type of alternative splicing event in cattle. We detected the expression levels of 16,174 genes, and 6,800 genes exhibited differential expression between the two pooled samples with a false discovery rate ≤0.001. Using GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis, multiple GO term and biological pathways were found to be significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes. In addition, we discovered that 30,618–31,334 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms were located in coding regions. Conclusions We obtained a high-quality beef cattle reference transcriptome using a high throughput sequencing approach, thereby providing a valuable resource for better understanding the beef cattle genome. The transcriptome data will facilitate future functional studies on the beef cattle genome and can be applied to breeding programs for cattle and closely related mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1965650513,"Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus or GAS) is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that has shown complex modes of regulation of its virulence factors to cause diverse diseases. Bacterial small RNAs are regarded as novel widespread regulators of gene expression in response to environmental signals. Recent studies have revealed that several small RNAs (sRNAs) have an important role in S. pyogenes physiology and pathogenesis by regulating gene expression at the translational level. To search for new sRNAs in S. pyogenes, we performed a genomewide analysis through computational prediction followed by experimental verification. To overcome the limitation of low accuracy in computational prediction, we employed a combination of three different computational algorithms (sRNAPredict, eQRNA and RNAz). A total of 45 candidates were chosen based on the computational analysis, and their transcription was analyzed by reverse-transcriptase PCR and Northern blot. Through this process, we discovered 7 putative novel trans-acting sRNAs. Their abundance varied between different growth phases, suggesting that their expression is influenced by environmental or internal signals. Further, to screen target mRNAs of an sRNA, we employed differential RNA sequencing analysis. This study provides a significant resource for future study of small RNAs and their roles in physiology and pathogenesis of S. pyogenes."

To date, comprehensive kinetic characterization of response regulator autophosphorylation is limited to CheY, which follows a simple model of phosphodonor binding followed by phosphorylation. We characterized autophosphorylation of the response regulator PhoB, known to dimerize upon phosphorylation. In contrast to CheY, PhoB time traces exhibited an initial lag phase and gave apparent pseudo-first order rate constants that increased with protein concentration. Furthermore, plots of the apparent autophosphorylation rate constant versus phosphodonor concentration were sigmoidal, as were PhoB binding isotherms for the phosphoryl group analog BeF3−. Successful mathematical modeling of the kinetic data necessitated inclusion of the formation of a PhoB heterodimer (one phosphorylated and one unphosphorylated monomer) with an enhanced rate of phosphorylation. Specifically, dimerization constants for the PhoB heterodimer and homodimer (two phosphorylated monomers) were similar, but the rate constant for heterodimer phosphorylation was ∼10-fold higher than for the monomer. In a test of the model, disruption of the known PhoBN dimerization interface by mutation led to markedly slower and noncooperative autophosphorylation kinetics. Furthermore, phosphotransfer from the sensor kinase PhoR was enhanced by dimer formation.

https://openalex.org/W2079613881,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading morbidity and mortality, and the first presenting sign in majority of people living with Human Immune deficiency Virus (PLWH). Determinants of active TB among HIV patients on anti retroviral treatment (ART) are not well described in resource limited settings. The aim of this study was to assess determinant factors for the occurrence of TB among people living with HIV after ART initiation in public hospitals and health centers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.A case control study was conducted from December 2011 to February 2012 in 2 public hospitals and 13 health centers in Addis Ababa. The study population consisted of 204 cases and 409 controls. Cases were adult people living with HIV who developed TB after ART initiation and controls were adult people living with HIV who did not develop TB after ART initiation. An interviewer administered structured questionnaire was used to collect information. After adjustment for potential confounders, presence of isoniazid prophylaxis (adjusted odd ratio [AOR] 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.125, 0.69) and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (AOR = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.62) had protective benefit against risk of TB. In contrary, bedridden (AOR = 9.36; 95% CI: 3.39, 25.85), having World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage III/IV (AOR = 3.40; 95% CI: 1.69, 6.87) and hemoglobin level <10 mg/dl (AOR = 7.43; 95% CI; 3.04, 18.31) at enrollment to ART care were predictors for increased risk of tuberculosis in PLWH after ART initiation.Increasing coverage of isoniazid preventive therapy and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy reduced risk of TB among HIV patients who started treatment. All PLWH should be screened for TB, but for patients who have advanced disease condition (WHO clinical stage III/IV, being bedridden and having hemoglobin level <10 mg/dl) intensified screening is highly recommended during treatment follow up."
https://openalex.org/W1967099368,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride (Cl(-)) channel, which plays an important role in physiological anion and fluid secretion, and is defective in several diseases. Although its activation by PKA and PKC has been studied extensively, its regulation by receptors is less well understood. To study signaling involved in CFTR activation, we measured whole-cell Cl(-) currents in BHK cells cotransfected with GPCRs and CFTR. In cells expressing the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, the agonist carbachol (Cch) caused strong activation of CFTR through two pathways; the canonical PKA-dependent mechanism and a second mechanism that involves tyrosine phosphorylation. The role of PKA was suggested by partial inhibition of cholinergic stimulation by the specific PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS. The role of tyrosine kinases was suggested by Cch stimulation of 15SA-CFTR and 9CA-CFTR, mutants that lack 15 PKA or 9 PKC consensus sequences and are unresponsive to PKA or PKC stimulation, respectively. Moreover the residual Cch response was sensitive to inhibitors of the Pyk2 and Src tyrosine kinase family. Our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation acts on CFTR directly and through inhibition of the phosphatase PP2A. Results suggest that PKA and tyrosine kinases contribute to CFTR regulation by GPCRs that are expressed at the apical membrane of intestinal and airway epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2102956539,"Acm2, the major autolysin of Lactobacillus plantarum, is a tripartite protein. Its catalytic domain is surrounded by an O-glycosylated N-terminal region rich in Ala, Ser, and Thr (AST domain), which is of low complexity and unknown function, and a C-terminal region composed of five SH3b peptidoglycan (PG) binding domains. Here, we investigate the contribution of these two accessory domains and of O-glycosylation to Acm2 functionality. We demonstrate that Acm2 is an N-acetylglucosaminidase and identify the pattern of O-glycosylation (21 mono-N-acetylglucosamines) of its AST domain. The O-glycosylation process is species-specific as Acm2 purified from Lactococcus lactis is not glycosylated. We therefore explored the functional role of O-glycosylation by purifying different truncated versions of Acm2 that were either glycosylated or non-glycosylated. We show that SH3b domains are able to bind PG and are responsible for Acm2 targeting to the septum of dividing cells, whereas the AST domain and its O-glycosylation are not involved in this process. Notably, our data reveal that the lack of O-glycosylation of the AST domain significantly increases Acm2 enzymatic activity, whereas removal of SH3b PG binding domains dramatically reduces this activity.

Here, we demonstrate that wild type SOD1 (wtSOD1) undergoes palmitoylation, a reversible post-translational modification that can regulate protein structure, function, and localization. SOD1 palmitoylation was confirmed by multiple techniques, including acyl-biotin exchange, click chemistry, cysteine mutagenesis, and mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry and cysteine mutagenesis demonstrated that cysteine residue 6 was the primary site of palmitoylation. The palmitoylation of FALS-linked mtSOD1s (A4V and G93A) was significantly increased relative to that of wtSOD1 expressed in HEK cells and a motor neuron cell line. The palmitoylation of FALS-linked mtSOD1s (G93A and G85R) was also increased relative to that of wtSOD1 when assayed from transgenic mouse spinal cords. We found that the level of SOD1 palmitoylation correlated with the level of membrane-associated SOD1, suggesting a role for palmitoylation in targeting SOD1 to membranes. We further observed that palmitoylation occurred predominantly on disulfide-reduced as opposed to disulfide-bonded SOD1, suggesting that immature SOD1 is the primarily palmitoylated species. Increases in SOD1 disulfide bonding and maturation with increased copper chaperone for SOD1 expression caused a decrease in wtSOD1 palmitoylation. Copper chaperone for SOD1 overexpression decreased A4V palmitoylation less than wtSOD1 and had little effect on G93A mtSOD1 palmitoylation. These findings suggest that SOD1 palmitoylation occurs prior to disulfide bonding during SOD1 maturation and that palmitoylation is increased when disulfide bonding is delayed or decreased as observed for several mtSOD1s.Background: Mutations in SOD1 cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).Results: SOD1 undergoes palmitoylation in the spinal cord and multiple cell types.

The Dsc E3 ligase consists of five integral membrane subunits, Dsc1 through Dsc5, and resembles membrane E3 ligases that function in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Using immunoprecipitation assays and blue native electrophoresis, we determined the subunit architecture for the complex of Dsc1 through Dsc5, showing that the Dsc proteins form subcomplexes and display defined connectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2045712777,"Human immunoglobulin G, subclass 2 (hIgG2), plays an important role in immunity to bacterial pathogens and in numerous pathological conditions. However, there is a lack of information regarding the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the hIgG2 molecule. We used electron microscopy (EM), differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) and fluorescence for structural analysis of the hIgG2. DSC and fluorescence indicated two types of interaction between CH1 domain of Fab (antigen-binding fragment/subunit) and CH2 domain of Fc (complement fixation fragment/subunit) simultaneously present in the sample: close interaction, which increases the thermostability of both, CH1 and CH2 domains, and weak (or no) interaction, which is typical for most IgGs but not hIgG2. Thermodynamics could not determine if both types of interactions are present within a single molecule. To address this question, EM was used. We employed a single-particle reconstruction and negative staining approach to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the hIgG2. A three-dimensional model of hIgG2 was created at 1.78 nm resolution. The hIgG2 is asymmetrical: one Fab subunit is in close proximity to the upper portion of the Fc subunit (CH2 domain) and the other Fab is distant from Fc. The plane of Fab subunits is nearly perpendicular to Fc. EM structure of the hIgG2 is in good agreement with thermodynamic data: a Fab distant from Fc should exhibit a lower melting temperature while a Fab interacting with Fc should exhibit a higher melting temperature. Both types of Fab subunits exist within one molecule resembling an A/B hIgG2 isoform introduced earlier on physicochemical level by Dillon et al. (2008). In such an arrangement, the access to the upper portion of Fc subunit is partially blocked by a Fab subunit. That might explain for instance why hIgG2 mildly activates complement and binds poorly to Fc receptors. Understanding of the three-dimensional structure of the hIgG2 should lead to better design of antibody-based therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2102096724,"Objectives Epidemiological evidence for associations of Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) with cardiometabolic risk factors is lacking. Existing evidence comes from small studies in select adult populations, and findings are conflicting. We aimed to assess whether AMH is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in a general population of adolescent females. Methods AMH, fasting insulin, glucose, HDLc, LDLc, triglycerides and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at a mean age 15.5 years in 1,308 female participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Multivariable linear regression was used to examine associations of AMH with these cardiometabolic outcomes. Results AMH values ranged from 0.16–35.84 ng/ml and median AMH was 3.57 ng/ml (IQR: 2.41, 5.49). For females classified as post-pubertal (n = 848) at the time of assessment median (IQR) AMH was 3.81 ng/ml (2.55, 5.82) compared with 3.25 ng/ml (2.23, 5.05) in those classed as early pubertal (n = 460, P≤0.001). After adjusting for birth weight, gestational age, pubertal stage, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, adiposity and use of hormonal contraceptives, there were no associations with any of the cardiometabolic outcomes. For example fasting insulin changed by 0% per doubling of AMH (95%CI: −3%,+2%) p = 0.70, with identical results if HOMA-IR was used. Results were similar after additional adjustment for smoking, physical activity and age at menarche, after exclusion of 3% of females with the highest AMH values, after excluding those that had not started menarche and after excluding those using hormonal contraceptives. Conclusion Our results suggest that in healthy adolescent females, AMH is not associated with cardiometabolic risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2089530770,"Melanins are synthesized by organisms of all biological kingdoms and comprise a heterogeneous class of natural pigments. Certain of these polymers have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several important human fungal pathogens. This study investigated whether the fungal skin pathogen Malassezia furfur produces melanin or melanin-like compounds. A melanin-binding monoclonal antibody (MAb) labelled in vitro cultivated yeast cells of M. furfur. In addition, melanization of Malassezia yeasts and hyphae was detected by anti-melanin MAb in scrapings from patients with pityriasis versicolor. Treatment of Malassezia yeasts with proteolytic enzymes, denaturant and concentrated hot acid yielded dark particles and electron spin resonance spectroscopy revealed that these particles contained a stable free radical compound, consistent with their identification as melanins. Malassezia yeasts required phenolic compounds, such as L-DOPA, in order to synthesize melanin. L-DOPA also triggered hyphal formation in vitro when combined with kojic acid, a tyrosinase inhibitor, in a dose-dependent manner. In this respect, L-DOPA is thought to be an essential substance that is linked to both melanization and yeast-mycelial transformation in M. furfur. In summary, M. furfur can produce melanin or melanin-like compounds in vitro and in vivo, and the DOPA melanin pathway is involved in cell wall melanization."
https://openalex.org/W1976618956,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate cytokine expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from stage I lung cancer patients and to confirm these expression patterns by exposing PBMCs to lung cancer cells in vitro. Five altered cytokines in stage I lung cancer patients (CCL3, IL8, IL1β, CXCL10, sIL2Rα) were identified in plasma from subjects (n = 15) before and after resection using a 30-plex panel protein assay. Gene expression studies using quantitative RT-qPCR were performed on PBMCs from stage I lung cancer patients (n = 62) before and after resection, and compared to non-cancer patients (n = 32) before and after surgery for benign disease. Co-culture experiments that exposed healthy donor PBMCs to lung cancer cells in vitro were performed to evaluate the effect on PBMC cytokine expression. PBMC gene expression of CCL3, IL8 and IL1β was higher in lung cancer patients compared to the same patients at each of four sequential timepoints after removal of their tumors, while CXCL10 and IL2Rα were essentially unchanged. This pattern was also detected when lung cancer patients were compared to non-cancer patients. When non-cancer patients underwent surgery for benign diseases, these cytokine expression changes were not demonstrable. Lung cancer cell lines, but not benign bronchial epithelial cells, induced similar changes in cytokine gene and protein expression by healthy donor PBMCs in an in vitro co-culture system. We conclude that PBMCs from stage I lung cancer patients possess distinct cytokine expression patterns compared to both non-cancer patients, and lung cancer patients following tumor removal. These expression patterns are replicated by healthy donor PBMCs exposed to lung cancer cell lines, but not benign bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. These findings have implications for understanding the immune response to lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1999775721,"Although the contribution of Broca's area to motor cognition is generally accepted, its exact role remains controversial. A previous functional imaging study has suggested that Broca's area implements hierarchically organised motor behaviours and, in particular, that its anterior (Brodmann area 45, BA45) and posterior (BA44) parts process, respectively, higher and lower-level hierarchical elements. This function of Broca's area could generalize to other cognitive functions, including language. However, because of the correlative nature of functional imaging data, the causal relationship between Broca's region activation and its behavioural significance cannot be ascertained. To circumvent this limitation, we used on-line repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt neuronal processing in left BA45, left BA44 or left dorsal premotor cortex, three areas that have been shown to exhibit a phasic activation when participants performed hierarchically organised motor behaviours. The experiment was conducted in healthy volunteers performing the same two key-press sequences as those used in a previous imaging study, and which differed in terms of hierarchical organisation. The performance of the lower-order hierarchical task (Experiment #1) was unaffected by magnetic stimulation. In contrast, in the higher-order hierarchical task (Experiment #2, “superordinate” task), we found that a virtual lesion of the anterior part of Broca's area (left BA45) delayed the processing of the cue initiating the sequence in an effector-independent way. Interestingly, in this task, the initiation cue only informed the subjects about the rules to be applied to produce the appropriate response but did not allow them to anticipate the entire motor sequence. A second important finding was a RT decrease following left PMd virtual lesions in the superordinate task, a result compatible with the view that PMd plays a critical role in impulse control. The present study therefore demonstrates the role of left BA45 in planning the higher-order hierarchical levels of motor sequences."

In addition to serving as a substrate of Pak1/2, we found that ArhGAP15, via its PH domain, bound to these kinases. The association of ArhGAP15 to Pak1/2 resulted in mutual inhibition of GAP and kinase catalytic activity, respectively. Knock-down of ArhGAP15 resulted in activation of Pak1/2, both indirectly, as a result of Rac activation, and directly, as a result of disruption of the ArhGAP15/Pak complex. Our data suggest that ArhGAP15 plays a dual negative role in regulating small GTPase signaling, by acting at the level of the GTPase itself, as well interacting with its effector, Pak kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2171914338,"In tight junctions, both claudin-2 and claudin-10b form paracellular cation-selective pores by the interaction of the first ECL 1 with permeating ions. We hypothesized that a highly conserved aromatic residue near the pore selectivity filter of claudins contributes to cation selectivity by cation-π interaction with the permeating cation. To test this, we generated MDCK I Tet-off cells stably transfected with claudin-2 Tyr67 mutants. The Y67L mutant showed reduced cation selectivity compared with wild-type claudin-2 due to a decrease in Na+ permeability, without affecting the Cl− permeability. The Y67A mutant enlarged the pore size and further decreased the charge selectivity due to an increase in Cl− permeability. The Y67F mutant restored the Na+ permeability, Cl− permeability, and pore size back to wild-type. The accessibility of Y67C to methanethiosulfonate modification indicated that its side chain faces the lumen of the pore. In claudin-10b, the F66L mutant reduced cation selectivity, and the F66A mutant lost pore conductance. We conclude that the conserved aromatic residue near the cation pore domain of claudins contributes to cation selectivity by a dual role of cation-π interaction and a luminal steric effect. Our findings provide new insight into how ion selectivity is achieved in the paracellular pore.Background: Claudin pore domain contains a highly conserved aromatic residue.Results: Cation selectivity of claudin-2 and claudin-10b was impaired by substitution of residues lacking an aromatic group.Conclusion: The aromatic residue confers cation selectivity by cation-π interaction and restricting the pore diameter.Significance: This advances our understanding of the paracellular ion selectivity mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2018620040,"Porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) is an immunosuppressive virus that mainly inhibits the immune function of the macrophage and T-cell lymphatic systems, and has caused huge economic losses to the porcine breeding industry. Molecular epidemiological investigation of PCMV is important for prevention and treatment, and this study is the first such investigation in Sichuan Province, Southwest China. A PCMV positive infection rate of 84.4% (865/1025) confirmed that PCMV is widely distributed in Sichuan Province. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the PCMV glycoprotein B gene (gB) nucleotide and amino acid sequences from 24 novel Sichuan isolates and 18 other PCMV gB sequences from Genbank. PCMV does not appear to have evolved into different serotypes, and two distinct sequence groups were identified (A and B). However, whether PCMV from this region has evolved into different genotypes requires further research. Analysis of the amino acid sequences confirmed the conservation of gB, but amino acid substitutions in the major epitope region have caused antigenic drift, which may have altered the immunogenicity of PCMV."
https://openalex.org/W1974225389,"Avian influenza A H7N7 virus poses a pandemic threat to human health because of its ability for direct transmission from domestic poultry to humans and from human to human. The wide zoonotic potential of H7N7 combined with an antiviral immunity inhibition similar to pandemic 1918 H1N1 and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses is disconcerting and increases the risk of a putative H7N7 pandemic in the future, underlining the urgent need for vaccine development against this virus.In this study, we developed a recombinant vaccine by expressing the H7N7-HA protein on the surface of baculovirus (Bac-HA). The protective efficacy of the live Bac-HA vaccine construct was evaluated in a mouse model by challenging mice immunized intranasally (i.n.) or subcutaneously (s.c.) with high pathogenic mouse adapted H7N7 reassorted strain. Although s.c. injection of live Bac-HA induced higher specific IgG than i.n. immunization, the later resulted in an elevated neutralization titer. Interestingly, 100% protection from the lethal viral challenge was only observed for the mice immunized intranasally with live Bac-HA, whereas no protection was achieved in any other s.c. or i.n. immunized mice groups. In addition, we also observed higher mucosal IgA as well as increased IFN-γ and IL-4 responses in the splenocytes of the surviving mice coupled with a reduced viral titer and diminished histopathological signs in the lungs.Our results indicated that protection from high pathogenic H7N7 (NL/219/03) virus requires both mucosal and systemic immune responses in mice. The balance between Th1 and Th2 cytokines is also required for the protection against the H7N7 pathogen. Intranasal administration of live Bac-HA induced all these immune responses and protected the mice from lethal viral challenge. Therefore, live Bac-HA is an effective vaccine candidate against H7N7 viral infections."

Blood samples were collected at day 0 and 28 after vaccination, and at delivery. Cord blood was also collected. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays were performed to determine seroprotection and seroconversion rates and fold increase in the HAI geometric mean titer (GMT).Twenty-eight days after vaccination the seroprotection rate against H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B was 91.3%, 84.8% and 56.5%, respectively. The GMT fold increase was 12.8, 8.4, and 4.6 for H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B, respectively. At delivery, both the seroprotection rate (86.4%, 68.2%, and 47.7%) and GMT fold increase (9.4, 5.7 and 3.8) were slightly lower than day 28. The seroprotection rate and GMT fold increase in maternal and cord blood samples were comparable. No significant adverse effects were detected.Trivalent flu vaccine induces a strong immune response in pregnant women and their infants without adverse effects.Clinical Trials. gov NCT01514708."
https://openalex.org/W1986221171,"It is generally agreed that some features of a face, namely the eyes, are more salient than others as indexed by behavioral diagnosticity, gaze-fixation patterns and evoked-neural responses. However, because previous studies used unnatural stimuli, there is no evidence so far that the early encoding of a whole face in the human brain is based on the eyes or other facial features. To address this issue, scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye gaze-fixations were recorded simultaneously in a gaze-contingent paradigm while observers viewed faces. We found that the N170 indexing the earliest face-sensitive response in the human brain was the largest when the fixation position is located around the nasion. Interestingly, for inverted faces, this optimal fixation position was more variable, but mainly clustered in the upper part of the visual field (around the mouth). These observations extend the findings of recent behavioral studies, suggesting that the early encoding of a face, as indexed by the N170, is not driven by the eyes per se, but rather arises from a general perceptual setting (upper-visual field advantage) coupled with the alignment of a face stimulus to a stored face template."
https://openalex.org/W2063224849,"The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by cell surface death receptors such as Fas. Engagement of Fas by Fas ligand triggers a conformational change that allows Fas to interact with adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) via the death domain, which recruits downstream signaling proteins to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Previous studies have shown that calmodulin (CaM) is recruited into the DISC in cholangiocarcinoma cells, suggesting a novel role of CaM in Fas-mediated signaling. CaM antagonists induce apoptosis through a Fas-related mechanism in cholangiocarcinoma and other cancer cell lines possibly by inhibiting Fas-CaM interactions. The structural determinants of Fas-CaM interaction and the underlying molecular mechanisms of inhibition, however, are unknown. Here we employed NMR and biophysical techniques to elucidate these mechanisms. Our data show that CaM binds to the death domain of Fas (FasDD) with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼2 μm and 2:1 CaM:FasDD stoichiometry. The interactions between FasDD and CaM are endothermic and entropically driven, suggesting that hydrophobic contacts are critical for binding. We also show that both the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM are important for binding. NMR and surface plasmon resonance data show that three CaM antagonists (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide, tamoxifen, and trifluoperazine) greatly inhibit Fas-CaM interactions by blocking the Fas-binding site on CaM.

https://openalex.org/W1975641141,"In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, fem-1, fem-2, and fem-3 play crucial roles in male sexual development. Among these three genes, fem-2 encodes a PP2C (serine/threonine phosphatase type 2C)-like protein, whose activity promotes the development of masculinity. Different from the canonical PP2Cs, FEM-2 consists of an additional N-terminal domain (NTD) apart from its C-terminal catalytic domain. Interestingly, genetic studies have indicated indispensable roles for both of these two domains of FEM-2 in promoting male development, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, we solved the crystal structure of full-length FEM-2, which revealed a novel structural fold formed by its NTD. Structural and functional analyses demonstrated that the NTD did not directly regulate the in vitro dephosphorylation activity of FEM-2, but instead functioned as a scaffold domain in the assembly of the FEM-1/2/3 complex, the executioner in the final step of the sex determination pathway. Biochemical studies further identified the regions in the NTD involved in FEM-1 and FEM-3 interactions. Our results not only identified a novel fold formed by the extra domain of a noncanonical PP2C enzyme, but also provided important insights into the molecular mechanism of how the NTD works in mediating the sex-determining role of FEM-1/2/3 complex."

https://openalex.org/W2028874480,"The ends of linear chromosomes are extended by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex minimally consisting of a protein subunit called telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the telomerase RNA (TER). TERT functions by reverse transcribing a short template region of TER into telomeric DNA. Proper assembly of TERT and TER is essential for telomerase activity; however, a detailed understanding of how TERT interacts with TER is lacking. Previous studies have identified an RNA binding domain (RBD) within TERT, which includes three evolutionarily conserved sequence motifs: CP2, CP, and T. Here, we used site-directed hydroxyl radical probing to directly identify sites of interaction between the TERT RBD and TER, revealing that the CP2 motif is in close proximity to a conserved region of TER known as the template boundary element (TBE). Gel shift assays on CP2 mutants confirmed that the CP2 motif is an RNA binding determinant. Our results explain previous work that established that mutations to the CP2 motif of TERT and to the TBE of TER both permit misincorporation of nucleotides into the growing DNA strand beyond the canonical template. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which the CP2 motif binds the TBE to strictly define which TER nucleotides can be reverse transcribed."

Although several different models for the activation process of the T cell via the T cell receptor have been proposed, it could not be shown that a structural mechanism, which discriminates between peptides of different immunogenicity levels, exists within the T cell receptor. In this study, we performed systematic molecular dynamics simulations of 172 closely related altered peptide ligands in the same T cell receptor/major histocompatibility complex system. Statistical evaluations yielded significant differences in the initial relaxation process between sets of peptides at four different immunogenicity levels."
https://openalex.org/W2075880640,"Histological staining of reactive stroma has been shown to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer, however, molecular markers of the stromal response to prostate cancer have not yet been fully delineated. The objective of this study was to determine whether or not the stromal biomarkers detected with a thioredoxin-targeted nanodevice could be used to distinguish the stroma associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia from that associated with PCA. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that a thioredoxin-targeted nanodevice selectively binds to reactive stroma in frozen prostate tumor tissue sections. To accomplish this, random frozen prostate tissue sections from each of 35 patients who underwent resection were incubated with the nanodevice and graded for fluorescent intensity. An adjacent section from each case was stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin to confirm the diagnosis. Select cases were stained with Masson's Trichrome or immunohistochemically using antibodies to thioredoxin reductase 1, thioredoxin reductase 2 or peroxiredoxin 1. Our results demonstrate that the graded intensity of nanodevice binding to the stroma associated with PCA was significantly higher (p = 0.0127) than that of benign prostatic hyperplasia using the t-test. Immunohistochemical staining of adjacent sections in representative cases showed that none of the two commonly studied thioredoxin interacting protein partners mirrored the fluorescence pattern seen with the nanodevice. However, thioredoxin reductase 2 protein was clearly shown to be a biomarker of prostate cancer-associated reactive stroma whose presence distinguishes the stroma associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia from that associated with prostate cancer. We conclude that the signal detected by the nanodevice, in contrast to individual targets detected with antibodies used in this study, originates from multiple thioredoxin interacting protein partners that distinguish the M2 neutrophil and macrophage associated inflammatory response in prostate cancer-associated stroma from the CD4+ T-Lymphocyte linked inflammation in benign prostatic hyperplasia."
