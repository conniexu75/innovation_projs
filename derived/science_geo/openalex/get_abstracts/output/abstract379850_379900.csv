https://openalex.org/W2001284661,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been generated by enforced expression of defined sets of transcription factors in somatic cells. It remains controversial whether iPSCs are molecularly and functionally equivalent to blastocyst-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells. By comparing genetically identical mouse ES cells and iPSCs, we show here that their overall messenger RNA and microRNA expression patterns are indistinguishable with the exception of a few transcripts encoded within the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster on chromosome 12qF1, which were aberrantly silenced in most of the iPSC clones. Consistent with a developmental role of the Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster, these iPSC clones contributed poorly to chimaeras and failed to support the development of entirely iPSC-derived animals ('all-iPSC mice'). In contrast, iPSC clones with normal expression of the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster contributed to high-grade chimaeras and generated viable all-iPSC mice. Notably, treatment of an iPSC clone that had silenced Dlk1-Dio3 with a histone deacetylase inhibitor reactivated the locus and rescued its ability to support full-term development of all-iPSC mice. Thus, the expression state of a single imprinted gene cluster seems to distinguish most murine iPSCs from ES cells and allows for the prospective identification of iPSC clones that have the full development potential of ES cells."

We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses for the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) in smokers (n = 31,266) and smoking initiation (n = 46,481) using samples from the ENGAGE Consortium. In a second stage, we tested selected SNPs with in silico replication in the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) and Glaxo Smith Kline (Ox-GSK) consortia cohorts (n = 45,691 smokers) and assessed some of those in a third sample of European ancestry (n = 9,040). Variants in three genomic regions associated with CPD (P < 5 x 10(-8)), including previously identified SNPs at 15q25 represented by rs1051730[A] (effect size = 0.80 CPD, P = 2.4 x 10(-69)), and SNPs at 19q13 and 8p11, represented by rs4105144[C] (effect size = 0.39 CPD, P = 2.2 x 10(-12)) and rs6474412-T (effect size = 0.29 CPD, P = 1.4 x 10(-8)), respectively. Among the genes at the two newly associated loci are genes encoding nicotine-metabolizing enzymes (CYP2A6 and CYP2B6) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (CHRNB3 and CHRNA6), all of which have been highlighted in previous studies of smoking and nicotine dependence. Nominal associations with lung cancer were observed at both 8p11 (rs6474412[T], odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, P = 0.04) and 19q13 (rs4105144[C], OR = 1.12, P = 0.0006)."
https://openalex.org/W2043854809,"The Notch–Delta signal transduction pathway is critical for many processes in development and disease, with a particular role in generating distinct cell fates among groups of initially equivalent cells and sharply defining neighbouring regions in developing tissues. Recent research has provided an increasingly comprehensive list of components and molecular interactions underlying Notch signalling, without revealing how these two proteins lead to clear cell-fate decisions. Sprinzak et al. use quantitative time-lapse microscopy to show that Notch levels in a given cell are ultrasensitive to the amount of Delta present at the surface of the same cell — as opposed to that exposed by its neighbours. This abrupt molecular switch means that a cell becomes exclusively a sender of Delta signalling (with high Delta and low Notch) or a receiver (vice versa). Numerical modelling shows how this new design principle enhances the sharpness of developmental boundaries set by classical lateral inhibition. Notch and Delta are transmembrane proteins that allow neighbouring cells to communicate during development. Here, quantitative time-lapse microscopy has been used to show that the response of Notch to Delta on a neighbouring cell is graded, whereas its response to Delta on the same cell is sharp and occurs at a fixed threshold. A mathematical model explores how this new design principle enhances the sharpness of developmental boundaries set by classical lateral inhibition. The Notch–Delta signalling pathway allows communication between neighbouring cells during development1. It has a critical role in the formation of ‘fine-grained’ patterns, generating distinct cell fates among groups of initially equivalent neighbouring cells and sharply delineating neighbouring regions in developing tissues2,3,4,5. The Delta ligand has been shown to have two activities: it transactivates Notch in neighbouring cells and cis-inhibits Notch in its own cell. However, it remains unclear how Notch integrates these two activities and how the resulting system facilitates pattern formation. Here we report the development of a quantitative time-lapse microscopy platform for analysing Notch–Delta signalling dynamics in individual mammalian cells, with the aim of addressing these issues. By controlling both cis- and trans-Delta concentrations, and monitoring the dynamics of a Notch reporter, we measured the combined cis–trans input–output relationship in the Notch–Delta system. The data revealed a striking difference between the responses of Notch to trans- and cis-Delta: whereas the response to trans-Delta is graded, the response to cis-Delta is sharp and occurs at a fixed threshold, independent of trans-Delta. We developed a simple mathematical model that shows how these behaviours emerge from the mutual inactivation of Notch and Delta proteins in the same cell. This interaction generates an ultrasensitive switch between mutually exclusive sending (high Delta/low Notch) and receiving (high Notch/low Delta) signalling states. At the multicellular level, this switch can amplify small differences between neighbouring cells even without transcription-mediated feedback. This Notch–Delta signalling switch facilitates the formation of sharp boundaries and lateral-inhibition patterns in models of development, and provides insight into previously unexplained mutant behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2063369009,"Fibrogenesis is a pathological wound repair process that fails to cease, even when the initial insult has been removed. Fibroblasts are principal mediators of fibrosis, and fibroblasts from fibrotic tissues fail to return to their quiescent stage, including when cultured in vitro. In a search for underlying molecular mechanisms, we hypothesized that this perpetuation of fibrogenesis is caused by epigenetic modifications. We demonstrate here that hypermethylation of RASAL1, encoding an inhibitor of the Ras oncoprotein, is associated with the perpetuation of fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis in the kidney. RASAL1 hypermethylation is mediated by the methyltransferase Dnmt1 in renal fibrogenesis, and kidney fibrosis is ameliorated in Dnmt1(+/-) heterozygous mice. These studies demonstrate that epigenetic modifications may provide a molecular basis for perpetuated fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis in the kidney."

https://openalex.org/W2050744136,"Reactive astrocytosis develops in many neurologic diseases, including epilepsy. Astrocytotic contributions to pathophysiology are poorly understood. Studies examining this are confounded by comorbidities accompanying reactive astrocytosis. We found that high-titer transduction of astrocytes with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) via adeno-associated virus induced reactive astrocytosis without altering the intrinsic properties or anatomy of neighboring neurons. We examined the consequences of selective astrocytosis induction on synaptic transmission in mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. Neurons near eGFP-labeled reactive astrocytes had reduced inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptic currents. This inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) erosion resulted from a failure of the astrocytic glutamate-glutamine cycle. Reactive astrocytes downregulated expression of glutamine synthetase. Blockade of this enzyme normally induces rapid synaptic GABA depletion. In astrocytotic regions, residual inhibition lost sensitivity to glutamine synthetase blockade, whereas exogenous glutamine administration enhanced IPSCs. Astrocytosis-mediated deficits in inhibition triggered glutamine-reversible hyperexcitability in hippocampal circuits. Thus, reactive astrocytosis could generate local synaptic perturbations, leading to broader functional deficits associated with neurologic disease."

https://openalex.org/W2067215762,"Staphylococcus aureus is a potent biofilm former on host tissue and medical implants, and biofilm growth is a critical virulence determinant for chronic infections. Recent studies suggest that many clinical isolates form polysaccharide-independent biofilms. However, a systematic screen for defective mutants has not been performed to identify factors important for biofilm formation in these strains. We created a library of 14,880 mariner transposon mutants in a S. aureus strain that generates a proteinaceous and extracellular DNA based biofilm matrix. The library was screened for biofilm defects and 31 transposon mutants conferred a reproducible phenotype. In the pool, 16 mutants overproduced extracellular proteases and the protease inhibitor α2-macroglobulin restored biofilm capacity to 13 of these mutants. The other 15 mutants in the pool displayed normal protease levels and had defects in genes involved in autolysis, osmoregulation, or uncharacterized membrane proteins. Two transposon mutants of interest in the GraRS two-component system and a putative inositol monophosphatase were confirmed in a flow cell biofilm model, genetically complemented, and further verified in a community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) isolate. Collectively, our screen for biofilm defective mutants identified novel loci involved in S. aureus biofilm formation and underscored the importance of extracellular protease activity and autolysis in biofilm development."

https://openalex.org/W2014564921,"Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) perform obsessive repetitive actions. Shahin Rafii and his colleagues show that mice lacking the gene Slitrk5 show OCD-like behavioral phenotypes and have deficits in corticostriatal communication in the brain. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric disorder defined by the presence of obsessive thoughts and repetitive compulsive actions, and it often encompasses anxiety and depressive symptoms1,2. Recently, the corticostriatal circuitry has been implicated in the pathogenesis of OCD3,4. However, the etiology, pathophysiology and molecular basis of OCD remain unknown. Several studies indicate that the pathogenesis of OCD has a genetic component5,6,7,8. Here we demonstrate that loss of a neuron-specific transmembrane protein, SLIT and NTRK-like protein-5 (Slitrk5), leads to OCD-like behaviors in mice, which manifests as excessive self-grooming and increased anxiety-like behaviors, and is alleviated by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Slitrk5−/− mice show selective overactivation of the orbitofrontal cortex, abnormalities in striatal anatomy and cell morphology and alterations in glutamate receptor composition, which contribute to deficient corticostriatal neurotransmission. Thus, our studies identify Slitrk5 as an essential molecule at corticostriatal synapses and provide a new mouse model of OCD-like behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W2151964510,"Identifying factors that accelerate the aging process can provide important therapeutic targets for slowing down this process. Misregulation of phosphate homeostasis has been noted in various skeletal, cardiac, and renal diseases, but the exact role of phosphate toxicity in mammalian aging is not clearly defined. Phosphate is widely distributed in the body and is involved in cell signaling, energy metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis, and the maintenance of acid-base balance by urinary buffering. In this study, we used an in vivo genetic approach to determine the role of phosphate toxicity in mammalian aging. Klothoknockout mice (klotho−/−) have a short life span and show numerous physical, biochemical, and morphological features consistent with premature aging, including kyphosis, uncoordinated movement, hypogonadism, infertility, severe skeletal muscle wasting, emphysema, and osteopenia, as well as generalized atrophy of the skin, intestine, thymus, and spleen. Molecular and biochemical analyses suggest that increased renal activity of sodium-phosphate cotransporters (NaPi2a) leads to severe hyperphosphatemia in klotho−/− mice. Genetically reducing serum phosphate levels in klotho−/− mice by generating a NaPi2a and klotho double-knockout (NaPi2a−/−/klotho−/−) strain resulted in amelioration of premature aging-like features. The NaPi2a−/−/klotho−/− double-knockout mice regained reproductive ability, recovered their body weight, reduced their organ atrophy, and suppressed ectopic calcifications, with the resulting effect being prolonged survival. More important, when hyperphosphatemia was induced in NaPi2a−/−/klotho−/− mice by feeding with a highphosphate diet, premature aging-like features reappeared, clearly suggesting that phosphate toxicity is the main cause of premature aging in klotho−/− mice. The results of our dietary and genetic manipulation studies provide in vivo evidence for phosphate toxicity accelerating the aging process and suggest a novel role for phosphate in mammalian aging.—Ohnishi, M., Razzaque, M.

https://openalex.org/W2010040408,"Previous work has shown reduced expression levels of let-7 in lung tumors. But little is known about the expression or mechanisms of let-7a in prostate cancer. In this study, we used in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate whether E2F2 and CCND2 are direct targets of let-7a, and if let-7a acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer by down-regulating E2F2 and CCND2.Findings Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that decreased levels of let-7a are present in resected prostate cancer samples and prostate cancer cell lines. Cellular proliferation was inhibited in PC3 cells and LNCaP cells after transfection with let-7a. Cell cycle analysis showed that let-7a induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase. A dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that the 3'UTR of E2F2 and CCND2 were directly bound to let-7a and western blotting analysis further indicated that let-7a down-regulated the expression of E2F2 and CCND2. Our xenograft models of prostate cancer confirmed the capability of let-7a to inhibit prostate tumor development in vivo.These findings help to unravel the anti-proliferative mechanisms of let-7a in prostate cancer. Let-7a may also be novel therapeutic candidate for prostate cancer given its ability to induce cell-cycle arrest and inhibit cell growth, especially in hormone-refractory prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2020325237,"Orai1 and STIM1 are critical components of Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels that mediate store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) in immune cells. Although it is known that Orai1 and STIM1 co-cluster and physically interact to mediate SOCE, the cytoplasmic machinery modulating these functions remains poorly understood. We sought to find modulators of Orai1 and STIM1 using affinity protein purification and identified a novel EF-hand protein, CRACR2A (also called CRAC regulator 2A, EFCAB4B or FLJ33805). We show that CRACR2A interacts directly with Orai1 and STIM1, forming a ternary complex that dissociates at elevated Ca(2+) concentrations. Studies using knockdown mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and mutagenesis show that CRACR2A is important for clustering of Orai1 and STIM1 upon store depletion. Expression of an EF-hand mutant of CRACR2A enhanced STIM1 clustering, elevated cytoplasmic Ca(2+) and induced cell death, suggesting its active interaction with CRAC channels. These observations implicate CRACR2A, a novel Ca(2+) binding protein that is highly expressed in T cells and conserved in vertebrates, as a key regulator of CRAC channel-mediated SOCE."

https://openalex.org/W1992187118,"The mechanisms that regulate the developmental potential of adult neural progenitor populations under physiological and pathological conditions remain poorly defined. Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)- and Doublecortin (Dcx)-expressing cells constitute major progenitor populations in the adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ). Under normal physiological conditions, SVZ-derived GAD65-positive and Dcx-positive cells expressed the transcription factor Pax6 and migrated along the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb to generate interneurons. After lysolecithin-induced demyelination of corpus callosum, however, these cells altered their molecular and cellular properties and migratory path. Demyelination upregulated chordin in the SVZ, which redirected GAD65-positive and Dcx-positive progenitors from neuronal to glial fates, generating new oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum. Our findings suggest that the lineage plasticity of SVZ progenitor cells could be a potential therapeutic strategy for diseased or injured brain."
https://openalex.org/W2073061583,"Myc is a transcription factor that significantly contributes to cancer progression by modulating the expression of important genes through binding to a DNA sequence, CACGTG, called E-box. We find that on Myc binding to chromatin, the lysine-demethylating enzyme, LSD1, triggers a transient demethylation of lysine 4 in the histone H3. In addition, we demonstrate that Myc binds and recruits LSD1 to the E-box chromatin and the formation of this complex is stimulated by cAMP-PKA. Demethylation by LSD1 produces H(2)O(2), which locally oxidizes guanine and induces the recruitment of 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and of the nuclease Ape1 on the E-box chromatin. Inhibition of oxidation or silencing of LSD1, OGG1 or Ape1 significantly reduce transcription and inhibit mRNA accumulation of Myc-target genes. Collectively, these data highlight the role of transient LSD1-mediated demethylation of H3K4 leading to local DNA oxidation as driving force in the assembly of the Myc-induced transcription initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1985717369,"Background Reporting of influenza-like illness (ILI) from general practice/family doctor (GPFD) clinics is an accurate indicator of real-time epidemic activity and requires little effort to set up, making it suitable for developing countries currently experiencing the influenza A (H1N1 -2009) pandemic or preparing for subsequent epidemic waves. Methodology/Principal Findings We established a network of GPFDs in Singapore. Participating GPFDs submitted returns via facsimile or e-mail on their work days using a simple, standard data collection format, capturing: gender; year of birth; “ethnicity”; residential status; body temperature (°C); and treatment (antiviral or not); for all cases with a clinical diagnosis of an acute respiratory illness (ARI). The operational definition of ILI in this study was an ARI with fever of 37.8°C or more. The data were processed daily by the study co-ordinator and fed into a stochastic model of disease dynamics, which was refitted daily using particle filtering, with data and forecasts uploaded to a website which could be publicly accessed. Twenty-three GPFD clinics agreed to participate. Data collection started on 2009-06-26 and lasted for the duration of the epidemic. The epidemic appeared to have peaked around 2009-08-03 and the ILI rates had returned to baseline levels by the time of writing. Conclusions/Significance This real-time surveillance system is able to show the progress of an epidemic and indicates when the peak is reached. The resulting information can be used to form forecasts, including how soon the epidemic wave will end and when a second wave will appear if at all."
https://openalex.org/W2055177969,"Polysaccharides constitute a major component of bacterial cell surfaces and play critical roles in bacteria-host interactions. The biosynthesis of such molecules, however, has mainly been characterized through in vivo genetic studies, thus precluding discernment of the details of this pathway. Accordingly, we present a chemical approach that enabled reconstitution of the E. coli O-polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway in vitro. Starting with chemically prepared undecaprenyl-diphospho-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, the E. coli O86 oligosaccharide repeating unit was assembled by means of sequential enzymatic glycosylation. Successful expression of the putative polymerase Wzy using a chaperone coexpression system then allowed demonstration of polymerization in vitro using this substrate. Analysis of more substrates revealed a defined mode of recognition for Wzy toward the lipid moiety. Specific polysaccharide chain length modality was furthermore demonstrated to result from the action of Wzz. Collectively, polysaccharide biosynthesis was chemically reconstituted in vitro, providing a well defined system for further underpinning molecular details of this biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2140433041,"Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is an aggressive, pediatric bone tumor characterized by extensive destruction of the surrounding bone. Although first described over 60 years ago, its molecular etiology remains poorly understood. Recent work revealed that ABCs harbor translocation of TRE17/USP6, leading to its transcriptional upregulation. TRE17 encodes a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP), and a TBC domain that mediates binding to the Arf6 GTPase. However, the mechanisms by which TRE17 overexpression contributes to tumor pathogenesis, and the role of its USP and TBC domains, are unknown. ABCs are characterized by osteolysis, inflammatory recruitment and extensive vascularization, the processes in which matrix proteases have a prominent role. This led us to explore whether TRE17 regulates the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we show that TRE17 is sufficient to induce expression of MMP-9 and MMP-10, in a manner requiring its USP activity, but not its ability to bind Arf6. TRE17 induces transcription of MMP-9 through activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mediated in part by the GTPase RhoA and its effector kinase, ROCK. Furthermore, xenograft studies show that TRE17 induces formation of tumors that reproduce multiple features of ABC, including a high degree of vascularization, with an essential role for the USP domain. In sum, these studies reveal that TRE17 is sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis, identify MMPs as novel TRE17 effectors that likely contribute to ABC pathogenesis and define the underlying signaling mechanism of their induction."

https://openalex.org/W1981255619,"The Eyes Absent (EYA) proteins combine transactivation, tyrosine phosphatase, and threonine phosphatase activities in their function as part of a conserved regulatory cascade involved in embryonic organ development. EYA tyrosine phosphatase activity contributes to fly eye development, and vertebrate EYA is involved in promoting DNA damage repair subsequent to genotoxic stress. EYAs are known to be expressed at elevated levels in ovarian and breast cancers. Here, we show that the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the EYAs promotes tumor cell migration, invasion, and transformation. These cellular effects are accompanied by alterations of the actin cytoskeleton and increased levels of active Rac and Cdc42. The invasiveness conferred by EYA is reflected in vivo by inhibition of metastasis seen when EYA3 expression is silenced in the invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Together, our data directly associate the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the EYAs with the oncogenesis-associated cellular properties of motility and invasiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2160904161,"Leukemias and other cancers possess self-renewing stem cells that help to maintain the cancer. Cancer stem cell eradication is thought to be crucial for successful anticancer therapy. Using an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model induced by the leukemia-associated monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ)-TIF2 fusion protein, we show here that AML can be cured by the ablation of leukemia stem cells. The MOZ fusion proteins MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-CBP interacted with the transcription factor PU.1 to stimulate the expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R, also known as M-CSFR, c-FMS or CD115). Studies using PU.1-deficient mice showed that PU.1 is essential for the ability of MOZ-TIF2 to establish and maintain AML stem cells. Cells expressing high amounts of CSF1R (CSF1R(high) cells), but not those expressing low amounts of CSF1R (CSF1R(low) cells), showed potent leukemia-initiating activity. Using transgenic mice expressing a drug-inducible suicide gene controlled by the CSF1R promoter, we cured AML by ablation of CSF1R(high) cells. Moreover, induction of AML was suppressed in CSF1R-deficient mice and CSF1R inhibitors slowed the progression of MOZ-TIF2-induced leukemia. Thus, in this subtype of AML, leukemia stem cells are contained within the CSF1R(high) cell population, and we suggest that targeting of PU.1-mediated upregulation of CSF1R expression might be a useful therapeutic approach."

While the molecular targeting signals and pathways responsible for sorting TA proteins to their correct intracellular destinations in yeasts and mammals have begun to be characterized, relatively little is known about TA protein biogenesis in plant cells, especially for those sorted to the plastid outer envelope.Here we investigated the biogenesis of three plastid TA proteins, including the 33-kDa and 34-kDa GTPases of the translocon at the outer envelope of chloroplasts (Toc33 and Toc34) and a novel 9-kDa protein of unknown function that we define here as an outer envelope TA protein (OEP9). Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays we show that OEP9 utilizes a different sorting pathway than that used by Toc33 and Toc34. For instance, while all three TA proteins interact with the cytosolic OEP chaperone/receptor, AKR2A, the plastid targeting information within OEP9 is distinct from that within Toc33 and Toc34. Toc33 and Toc34 also appear to differ from OEP9 in that their insertion is dependent on themselves and the unique lipid composition of the plastid outer envelope. By contrast, the insertion of OEP9 into the plastid outer envelope occurs in a proteinaceous-dependent, but Toc33/34-independent manner and membrane lipids appear to serve primarily to facilitate normal thermodynamic integration of this TA protein.Collectively, the results provide evidence in support of at least two sorting pathways for plastid TA outer envelope proteins and shed light on not only the complex diversity of pathways involved in the targeting and insertion of proteins into plastids, but also the molecular mechanisms that underlie the delivery of TA proteins to their proper intracellular locations in general."

It is the etiological agent of three different human cancers, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman disease. The far left end of the KSHV genome encodes a unique transmembrane glycoprotein called K1. K1 possesses the ability to transform rodent fibroblasts and block apoptosis. K1 has also been shown to activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in different cells. Using tandem affinity purification, we identified heat shock protein 90beta (Hsp90beta) and endoplasmic reticulum-associated Hsp40 (Erdj3/DnaJB11), as cellular binding partners of K1. Interactions of K1 with Hsp90beta and Hsp40 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in both directions. Furthermore, K1 also interacted with the Hsp90alpha isoform. We report that small-interfering RNAs directed against Hsp90 and Hsp40/Erdj3, as well as pharmacological inhibitors of Hsp90, dramatically reduced K1 expression, suggesting that K1 is a client protein of these chaperones. In addition, both Hsp90 and Hsp40/Erdj3 were essential for K1's anti-apoptotic function. Finally, we report that the Hsp90 inhibitors, 17-AAG and 17-DMAG, can suppress the proliferation of KSHV-positive PEL cell lines and exhibited IC(50) values of 50 nM and below."
https://openalex.org/W2015811602,"Objective While the majority of current diabetes treatments focus on reducing blood glucose levels, hypoglycemia represents a significant risk associated with insulin treatment. Glucagon plays a major regulatory role in controlling hypoglycemia in vivo, but its short half-life and hyperglycemic effects prevent its therapeutic use for non-acute applications. The goal of this study was to identify a modified form of glucagon suitable for prophylactic treatment of hypoglycemia without increasing baseline blood glucose levels. Methodology/Principal Findings Through application of the XTEN technology, we report the construction of a glucagon fusion protein with an extended exposure profile (Gcg-XTEN). The in vivo half-life of the construct was tuned to support nightly dosing through design and testing in cynomolgus monkeys. Efficacy of the construct was assessed in beagle dogs using an insulin challenge to induce hypoglycemia. Dose ranging of Gcg-XTEN in fasted beagle dogs demonstrated that the compound was biologically active with a pharmacodynamic profile consistent with the designed half-life. Prophylactic administration of 0.6 nmol/kg Gcg-XTEN to dogs conferred resistance to a hypoglycemic challenge at 6 hours post-dose without affecting baseline blood glucose levels. Consistent with the designed pharmacokinetic profile, hypoglycemia resistance was not observed at 12 hours post-dose. Importantly, the solubility and stability of the glucagon peptide were also significantly improved by fusion to XTEN. Conclusions/Significance The data show that Gcg-XTEN is effective in preventing hypoglycemia without the associated hyperglycemia expected for unmodified glucagon. While the plasma clearance of this Gcg-XTEN has been optimized for overnight dosing, specifically for the treatment of nocturnal hypoglycemia, constructs with significantly longer exposure profiles are feasible. Such constructs may have multiple applications such as allowing for more aggressive insulin treatment regimens, treating hypoglycemia due to insulin-secreting tumors, providing synergistic efficacy in combination therapies with long-acting GLP1 analogs, and as an appetite suppressant for treatment of obesity. The improved physical properties of the Gcg-XTEN molecule may also allow for novel delivery systems not currently possible with native glucagon."

An additional endometrial cancer mouse model is generated by the ablation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (Pten) (either as heterozygotes or by conditional uterine ablation). To determine the interplay between Mig-6 and the PTEN/phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway during endometrial tumorigenesis, we generated mice with Mig-6 and Pten conditionally ablated in progesterone receptor-positive cells (PR(cre/+)Mig-6(f/f)Pten(f/f); Mig-6(d/d)Pten(d/d)). The ablation of both Mig-6 and Pten dramatically accelerated the development of endometrial cancer compared with the single ablation of either gene. The epithelium of Mig-6(d/d)Pten(d/d) mice showed a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells compared with Pten(d/d) mice. The expression of the estrogen-induced apoptotic inhibitors Birc1 was significantly increased in Mig-6(d/d)Pten(d/d) mice. We identified extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) as an MIG-6 interacting protein by coimmunoprecipitation and demonstrated that the level of ERK2 phosphorylation was increased upon Mig-6 ablation either singly or in combination with Pten ablation. These results suggest that Mig-6 exerts a tumor-suppressor function in endometrial cancer by promoting epithelial cell apoptosis through the downregulation of the estrogen-induced apoptosis inhibitors Birc1 and the inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2070993269,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that recognize and regulate mRNA target genes. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that they are key regulators of numerous critical functions in development and disease, including cancer. However, defining the place and function of miRNAs in complex regulatory networks is not straightforward. Systems approaches, like the inference of a module network from expression data, can help to achieve this goal.During the last decade, much progress has been made in the development of robust and powerful module network inference algorithms. In this study, we analyze and assess experimentally a module network inferred from both miRNA and mRNA expression data, using our recently developed module network inference algorithm based on probabilistic optimization techniques. We show that several miRNAs are predicted as statistically significant regulators for various modules of tightly co-expressed genes. A detailed analysis of three of those modules demonstrates that the specific assignment of miRNAs is functionally coherent and supported by literature. We further designed a set of experiments to test the assignment of miR-200a as the top regulator of a small module of nine genes. The results strongly suggest that miR-200a is regulating the module genes via the transcription factor ZEB1. Interestingly, this module is most likely involved in epithelial homeostasis and its dysregulation might contribute to the malignant process in cancer cells.Our results show that a robust module network analysis of expression data can provide novel insights of miRNA function in important cellular processes. Such a computational approach, starting from expression data alone, can be helpful in the process of identifying the function of miRNAs by suggesting modules of co-expressed genes in which they play a regulatory role. As shown in this study, those modules can then be tested experimentally to further investigate and refine the function of the miRNA in the regulatory network."

Recent advances in high-content imaging techniques allow simultaneous analysis of a range of cellular events. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to identify drug targets by combining genetic screening and high-content imaging in yeast. Methodology In this approach, we infer the cellular functions affected by candidate drugs by comparing morphologic changes induced by the compounds with the phenotypes of yeast mutants. Conclusions Using this method and four well-characterized reagents, we successfully identified previously known target genes of the compounds as well as other genes involved with functionally related cellular pathways. This is the first demonstration of a genetic high-content assay that can be used to identify drug targets based on morphologic phenotypes of a reference mutant panel."
https://openalex.org/W2092208753,"PABPC1 (cytosolic poly(A)-binding protein 1) is an RNA-binding protein that binds to the poly(A) tail of mRNAs to promote translation and mRNA turnover. In addition to RNA-binding domains, PABPC1 contains a unique protein-protein interaction domain, MLLE (also known as PABC) that binds regulatory proteins and translation factors that contain a conserved 12 amino acid peptide motif termed PAM2. Eukaryotic Release Factor 3 (eRF3/GSPT1) contains two overlapping PAM2 sequences, which are required for its activity. Here, we determined the crystal structures of the MLLE domain from PABPC1 in complex with the two PAM2 regions of eRF3. The structures reveal a mechanism of cooperativity between the two PAM2 sites that increases the binding affinity but prevents the binding of more than one molecule of eRF3 to PABPC1. Relative to previous structures, the high-resolution crystal structures force a re-evaluation of the PAM2 motif and improve our understanding of the molecular basis of MLLE peptide recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2141605170,"Background Life cycles of medusozoan cnidarians vary widely, and have been difficult to document, especially in the most recently proposed class Staurozoa. However, molecular data can be a useful tool to elucidate medusozoan life cycles by tying together different life history stages. Methodology/Principal Findings Genetic data from fast-evolving molecular markers (mitochondrial 16S, nuclear ITS1, and nuclear ITS2) show that animals that were presumed to be a hydrozoan, Microhydrula limopsicola (Limnomedusae, Microhydrulidae), are actually an early stage of the life cycle of the staurozoan Haliclystus antarcticus (Stauromedusae, Lucernariidae). Conclusions/Significance Similarity between the haplotypes of three markers of Microhydrula limopsicola and Haliclystus antarcticus settles the identity of these taxa, expanding our understanding of the staurozoan life cycle, which was thought to be more straightforward and simple. A synthetic discussion of prior observations makes sense of the morphological, histological and behavioral similarities/congruence between Microhydrula and Haliclystus. The consequences are likely to be replicated in other medusozoan groups. For instance we hypothesize that other species of Microhydrulidae are likely to represent life stages of other species of Staurozoa."
https://openalex.org/W1964697420,"The onset of infection and the switch from primary to secondary niches are dramatic environmental changes that not only alter bacterial transcriptional programs, but also perturb their sociomicrobiology, often driving minor subpopulations with mutant phenotypes to prevail in specific niches. Having previously reported that M1T1 Streptococcus pyogenes become hypervirulent in mice due to selection of mutants in the covRS regulatory genes, we set out to dissect the impact of these mutations in vitro and in vivo from the impact of other adaptive events. Using a murine subcutaneous chamber model to sample the bacteria prior to selection or expansion of mutants, we compared gene expression dynamics of wild type (WT) and previously isolated animal-passaged (AP) covS mutant bacteria both in vitro and in vivo, and we found extensive transcriptional alterations of pathoadaptive and metabolic gene sets associated with invasion, immune evasion, tissue-dissemination, and metabolic reprogramming. In contrast to the virulence-associated differences between WT and AP bacteria, Phenotype Microarray analysis showed minor in vitro phenotypic differences between the two isogenic variants. Additionally, our results reflect that WT bacteria's rapid host-adaptive transcriptional reprogramming was not sufficient for their survival, and they were outnumbered by hypervirulent covS mutants with SpeB(-)/Sda(high) phenotype, which survived up to 14 days in mice chambers. Our findings demonstrate the engagement of unique regulatory modules in niche adaptation, implicate a critical role for bacterial genetic heterogeneity that surpasses transcriptional in vivo adaptation, and portray the dynamics underlying the selection of hypervirulent covS mutants over their parental WT cells."
https://openalex.org/W1977416546,"The Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor molecule-1 (TICAM-1, also called TRIF) is a signaling adaptor for TLR3 and TLR4 that activates the transcription factors IRF-3, NF-κB, and AP-1, leading to induction of type I interferon and cytokines. The N-terminal region of TICAM-1 participates in IRF-3 activation, although the C-terminal region is involved in NF-κB activation. However, the mechanism by which TICAM-1 is activated and transmits signals is largely unknown. In this study, we identified Leu194 as a critical amino acid for TICAM-1-mediated IRF-3 activation. When Leu194 was substituted with Ala, the mutant TICAM-1 failed to recruit the IRF-3 kinase TBK1, resulting in lack of IRF-3 phosphorylation, although TRAF3 and NAP1 appeared to be recruited. The N-terminal 176 amino acids of TICAM-1 (N-terminal domain (NTD)) form a protease-resistant structural domain. A TICAM-1 mutant lacking the N-terminal 180 amino acids showed greater interferon-β promoter activation than wild-type TICAM-1. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that the NTD interacted with the N terminus of TICAM-1-TIR. These results suggest that the NTD folds into the TIR domain structure to maintain the naive conformation of TICAM-1.

IntroductionThe innate immune system senses microbial infection using Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptors, which rapidly induce an antimicrobial response (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8544) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that these receptors also recognize molecular patterns associated with tissue damage and induce cytokine and chemokine production, which may lead to a sterile inflammation and progression of autoimmune diseases (2Baccala R. Hoebe K. Kono D.H. Beutler B. Theofilopoulos A.N. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Downstream of each pattern-recognition receptor is a signaling adaptor protein that determines the nature of response by activating distinct transcription factors (3O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev.

The final response mediated by TICAM-1 depends on the cell type and the activating TLR3/4 ligand.Poly(I-C) is a synthetic analog of viral double strand RNA that generates a unique maturation stage in mDCs via TLR3-TICAM-1-dependent gene expression, leading to activation of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (8Schulz O. Diebold S.S. Chen M. Näslund T.I. Nolte M.A. Alexopoulou L. Azuma Y.T. Flavell R.A. Liljeström P. Reis E. Sousa C.R. Nature. 2005; 433: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 9Akazawa T.

Science. 2007; 316: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), implying that TICAM-1 signaling is crucial for inducing effective cellular responses. In contrast, oxidized phospholipids generated by oxidative stress or virus infection activate cytokine production in lung macrophages through the TLR4-TICAM-1 pathway, and this is the key disease pathway in acute lung injury (11Imai Y.

Thus, specific stimuli have been discovered, but the mechanism by which TICAM-1 is activated by upstream pattern-recognition receptors and transmits downstream signals is largely unknown.TICAM-1 is expressed at a low level in most tissues and cells and is diffusely localized in the cytoplasm of resting cells (4Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 12Funami K. Sasai M. Ohba Y. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Matsumoto M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When endosomal TLR3 is activated by double strand RNA, TICAM-1 transiently colocalizes with TLR3 and then dissociates from the receptor and forms speckled structures that colocalize with downstream signaling molecules (12Funami K. Sasai M. Ohba Y. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Matsumoto M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Matsumoto M. Funami K. Tanabe M. Oshiumi H. Shingai M. Seto Y. Yamamoto A. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, TICAM-1 is activated by endosomal TICAM-2 (also called TRIF-related adaptor molecule), which associates with the internalized TLR4 (14Kagan J.C. Su T. Horng T. Chow A. Akira S. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Forced expression of TICAM-1 leads to homo-oligomerization through the TIR domain and the C terminus, forming a complex called the TICAM-1 signalosome (15Funami K. Sasai M. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Matsumoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18283-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The TIR domain of TICAM-1 is essential for binding to the TIR domain of TLR3 and to TICAM-2. The N-terminal region of TICAM-1 participates in IRF-3 activation by recruiting the IRF-3-activating kinases, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase ϵ (also called IKKι) (16Sato S.

Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of TICAM-1 is involved in NF-κB activation and inducing apoptosis by binding the RIP1 at the receptor-interacting protein homotypic interacting motif (RHIM) domain (19Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 20Kaiser W.J. Offermann M.K. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4942-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 3 and NF-κB-activating kinase-associated protein 1 (NAP1) engage in TICAM-1-mediated activation of IRF-3 (21Sasai M. Oshiumi H.

Thus, although molecules involved in the TICAM-1-mediated signaling have been identified, the molecular mechanism for TICAM-1 activation remains unknown.Recently, the N-terminal 176 amino acids (aa) of TICAM-1 (NTD) were found to form a protease-resistant structure of eight α-helices (24Horiuchi M. Sakakibara H. Kumeta H. Takahashi K. Enokizono A. Ishii A. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Inagaki F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Abstr. 2008; 31: 533Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the structure-function relationship of TICAM-1 with a series of TICAM-1 mutants and identified the critical amino acid for TICAM-1-mediated IRF-3 activation. Moreover, we offer a structural model of the resting form of TICAM-1, in which NTD folds into the TIR domain structure, preventing homodimerization and access of downstream signaling molecules to TICAM-1.DISCUSSIONActivation of the transcription factor IRF-3 is a key downstream event in the signaling cascade of TICAM-1, resulting in induction of antiviral genes, including IFN-β. Direct binding of TICAM-1 to the IRF-3 activating kinase TBK1 is necessary for IRF-3 phosphorylation. Here, we identified Leu194 as essential in TICAM-1 for recruiting TBK1. Although Leu194 was critical for TBK1 binding, Ser189, Arg195, and Ser196 may stabilize the interaction.TICAM-1 has two structural domains, the NTD and the TIR domain. Results from trypsin digestion of the TICAM-1 (1–566 aa) suggest the region between the NTD and the TIR domain forms a loose structure that might recruit downstream signaling molecules (24Horiuchi M. Sakakibara H. Kumeta H. Takahashi K. Enokizono A. Ishii A. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Inagaki F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Abstr. 2008; 31: 533Google Scholar). Because the crucial amino acids for TRAF2, TRAF6, and TBK1 binding reside in this region, naive TICAM-1 may have a closed conformation that covers these sites. Indeed, using the protein-protein association analysis, we clearly showed that the NTD interacted with the N-terminal TIR domain. These observations suggest that the NTD folds into the TIR domain, preventing downstream signaling molecules from accessing their binding sites. Upon stimulation of TLR3/4, or TICAM-1 overexpression, TICAM-1 oligomerizes through the TIR domain and the C-terminal region (15Funami K. Sasai M. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Matsumoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18283-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This may break the intramolecular association and induce a conformational change that allows downstream signaling molecules to their binding sites.Deletion of the NTD augmented the TICAM-1 activity (Fig. 7). The association sites of TRAF2/6 and TBK1 are likely to be available in the Δ180 mutant. This would facilitate recruitment of the IRF-3 kinase complex. The Δ190 mutant showed reduced IFN-β promoter activation compared with the Δ180 mutant, probably because the absence of Ser189 stabilized TBK1 binding to TICAM-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the NTD may act as a repression domain within TICAM-1. Remarkably, exogenous NTD did not affect activation of IRF-3 or NF-κB by wild-type TICAM-1, the Δ180 mutant, or by TLR3-TICAM-1 activated with poly(I-C) (supplemental Fig. 1). We propose that exogenous NTD failed to interact with naive TICAM-1 because the TIR domain was occupied intramolecularly with NTD. Once TICAM-1 was recruited to TLR3, and oligomerized, the TRAF2/6 and TBK1 association sites appeared and signaling occurred quickly. When expressed with mutant Δ180, exogenous NTD interacted with the TIR domain of Δ180, whose binding site is distant from the TBK1 association sites, and did not affect TBK1 recruitment.RIP1 binding to the C-terminal RHIM domain is necessary for TICAM-1 to mediate NF-κB activation (18Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), and the L194A mutant recruited RIP1 and activated NF-κB (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 2). How NF-κB activation is controlled when TICAM-1 is in the resting form is unknown, but we surmise that the RHIM domain is unexposed in the resting state and that homodimerization opens the RHIM domain for RIP1 binding. Pro434 in the BB loop of the TICAM-1-TIR domain is critical for TICAM-1 homodimerization, but the C-terminal homodimerization determinant remains unidentified (15Funami K. Sasai M. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Matsumoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18283-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further analysis is required to elucidate the mechanism of TICAM-1 activation.TICAM-1 acts as a platform that accumulates signaling molecules to the TICAM-1 signalosome and triggers diversified cellular responses. TICAM-1-dependent gene expression directs mDCs to activate natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are both the most effective for antiviral response, and are an anti-cancer immune response (8Schulz O. Diebold S.S. Chen M. Näslund T.I. Nolte M.A. Alexopoulou L. Azuma Y.T. Flavell R.A. Liljeström P. Reis E. Sousa C.R. Nature. 2005; 433: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 9Akazawa T.

Interestingly, the RIG-I-like receptor-mediated signaling pathway shares most of its downstream signaling molecules with the TICAM-1 pathway, but it plays a distinct role in antivirus immunity by producing type I IFNs (30Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Although TICAM-1-mediated signaling is initiated from the endosome, RIG-I-like receptor-mediated signaling occurs at the mitochondrial outer membrane (31Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Hence, compartmentalization of signal platforms might be significant for activating distinct transcription factors, resulting in different cellular responses.In certain RNA viral infections, TLR3-TICAM-1-dependent inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production affects virally induced pathology and host survival (32Matsumoto M. Seya T. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In addition, biased activation of the TLR4-TICAM-1 pathway in lung macrophages by oxidized phospholipids triggers acute lung injury through cytokine production (11Imai Y. Kuba K. Neely G.G. Yaghubian-Malhami R. Perkmann T. van Loo G. Ermolaeva M. Veldhuizen R. Leung Y.H. Wang H. Liu H. Sun Y. Pasparakis M. Kopf M. Mech C. Bavari S. Peiris J.S. Slutsky A.S. Akira S. Hultqvist M.

Therefore, control of TICAM-1 activation is a novel therapeutic target for acute lung injury. The development of an inhibitory molecule that blocks homo-oligomerization of TICAM-1 might be a straightforward approach for controlling excessive activation of TICAM-1 after viral infection. IntroductionThe innate immune system senses microbial infection using Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptors, which rapidly induce an antimicrobial response (1Akira S.

In this study, we analyzed the structure-function relationship of TICAM-1 with a series of TICAM-1 mutants and identified the critical amino acid for TICAM-1-mediated IRF-3 activation. Moreover, we offer a structural model of the resting form of TICAM-1, in which NTD folds into the TIR domain structure, preventing homodimerization and access of downstream signaling molecules to TICAM-1. DISCUSSIONActivation of the transcription factor IRF-3 is a key downstream event in the signaling cascade of TICAM-1, resulting in induction of antiviral genes, including IFN-β. Direct binding of TICAM-1 to the IRF-3 activating kinase TBK1 is necessary for IRF-3 phosphorylation. Here, we identified Leu194 as essential in TICAM-1 for recruiting TBK1. Although Leu194 was critical for TBK1 binding, Ser189, Arg195, and Ser196 may stabilize the interaction.TICAM-1 has two structural domains, the NTD and the TIR domain. Results from trypsin digestion of the TICAM-1 (1–566 aa) suggest the region between the NTD and the TIR domain forms a loose structure that might recruit downstream signaling molecules (24Horiuchi M. Sakakibara H. Kumeta H. Takahashi K. Enokizono A. Ishii A. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Inagaki F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Abstr. 2008; 31: 533Google Scholar). Because the crucial amino acids for TRAF2, TRAF6, and TBK1 binding reside in this region, naive TICAM-1 may have a closed conformation that covers these sites. Indeed, using the protein-protein association analysis, we clearly showed that the NTD interacted with the N-terminal TIR domain. These observations suggest that the NTD folds into the TIR domain, preventing downstream signaling molecules from accessing their binding sites. Upon stimulation of TLR3/4, or TICAM-1 overexpression, TICAM-1 oligomerizes through the TIR domain and the C-terminal region (15Funami K. Sasai M. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Matsumoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18283-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This may break the intramolecular association and induce a conformational change that allows downstream signaling molecules to their binding sites.Deletion of the NTD augmented the TICAM-1 activity (Fig. 7). The association sites of TRAF2/6 and TBK1 are likely to be available in the Δ180 mutant. This would facilitate recruitment of the IRF-3 kinase complex. The Δ190 mutant showed reduced IFN-β promoter activation compared with the Δ180 mutant, probably because the absence of Ser189 stabilized TBK1 binding to TICAM-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the NTD may act as a repression domain within TICAM-1. Remarkably, exogenous NTD did not affect activation of IRF-3 or NF-κB by wild-type TICAM-1, the Δ180 mutant, or by TLR3-TICAM-1 activated with poly(I-C) (supplemental Fig. 1). We propose that exogenous NTD failed to interact with naive TICAM-1 because the TIR domain was occupied intramolecularly with NTD. Once TICAM-1 was recruited to TLR3, and oligomerized, the TRAF2/6 and TBK1 association sites appeared and signaling occurred quickly. When expressed with mutant Δ180, exogenous NTD interacted with the TIR domain of Δ180, whose binding site is distant from the TBK1 association sites, and did not affect TBK1 recruitment.RIP1 binding to the C-terminal RHIM domain is necessary for TICAM-1 to mediate NF-κB activation (18Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), and the L194A mutant recruited RIP1 and activated NF-κB (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 2). How NF-κB activation is controlled when TICAM-1 is in the resting form is unknown, but we surmise that the RHIM domain is unexposed in the resting state and that homodimerization opens the RHIM domain for RIP1 binding. Pro434 in the BB loop of the TICAM-1-TIR domain is critical for TICAM-1 homodimerization, but the C-terminal homodimerization determinant remains unidentified (15Funami K. Sasai M. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Matsumoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18283-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further analysis is required to elucidate the mechanism of TICAM-1 activation.TICAM-1 acts as a platform that accumulates signaling molecules to the TICAM-1 signalosome and triggers diversified cellular responses. TICAM-1-dependent gene expression directs mDCs to activate natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are both the most effective for antiviral response, and are an anti-cancer immune response (8Schulz O. Diebold S.S. Chen M. Näslund T.I. Nolte M.A. Alexopoulou L. Azuma Y.T. Flavell R.A. Liljeström P. Reis E. Sousa C.R. Nature. 2005; 433: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 9Akazawa T.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Indeed, TLR3/4 ligands are strong candidates for adjuvant anti-cancer and infectious disease immunotherapy (10Mata-Haro V.

Interestingly, the RIG-I-like receptor-mediated signaling pathway shares most of its downstream signaling molecules with the TICAM-1 pathway, but it plays a distinct role in antivirus immunity by producing type I IFNs (30Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Although TICAM-1-mediated signaling is initiated from the endosome, RIG-I-like receptor-mediated signaling occurs at the mitochondrial outer membrane (31Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Hence, compartmentalization of signal platforms might be significant for activating distinct transcription factors, resulting in different cellular responses.In certain RNA viral infections, TLR3-TICAM-1-dependent inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production affects virally induced pathology and host survival (32Matsumoto M. Seya T. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In addition, biased activation of the TLR4-TICAM-1 pathway in lung macrophages by oxidized phospholipids triggers acute lung injury through cytokine production (11Imai Y. Kuba K. Neely G.G. Yaghubian-Malhami R. Perkmann T. van Loo G. Ermolaeva M. Veldhuizen R. Leung Y.H. Wang H. Liu H. Sun Y. Pasparakis M. Kopf M. Mech C. Bavari S. Peiris J.S. Slutsky A.S. Akira S. Hultqvist M. Holmdahl R. Nicholls J. Jiang C. Binder C.J. Penninger J.M. Cell. 2008; 133: 235-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Therefore, control of TICAM-1 activation is a novel therapeutic target for acute lung injury. The development of an inhibitory molecule that blocks homo-oligomerization of TICAM-1 might be a straightforward approach for controlling excessive activation of TICAM-1 after viral infection. Activation of the transcription factor IRF-3 is a key downstream event in the signaling cascade of TICAM-1, resulting in induction of antiviral genes, including IFN-β. Direct binding of TICAM-1 to the IRF-3 activating kinase TBK1 is necessary for IRF-3 phosphorylation. Here, we identified Leu194 as essential in TICAM-1 for recruiting TBK1.

We propose that exogenous NTD failed to interact with naive TICAM-1 because the TIR domain was occupied intramolecularly with NTD. Once TICAM-1 was recruited to TLR3, and oligomerized, the TRAF2/6 and TBK1 association sites appeared and signaling occurred quickly. When expressed with mutant Δ180, exogenous NTD interacted with the TIR domain of Δ180, whose binding site is distant from the TBK1 association sites, and did not affect TBK1 recruitment. RIP1 binding to the C-terminal RHIM domain is necessary for TICAM-1 to mediate NF-κB activation (18Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), and the L194A mutant recruited RIP1 and activated NF-κB (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 2). How NF-κB activation is controlled when TICAM-1 is in the resting form is unknown, but we surmise that the RHIM domain is unexposed in the resting state and that homodimerization opens the RHIM domain for RIP1 binding. Pro434 in the BB loop of the TICAM-1-TIR domain is critical for TICAM-1 homodimerization, but the C-terminal homodimerization determinant remains unidentified (15Funami K. Sasai M. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Matsumoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18283-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further analysis is required to elucidate the mechanism of TICAM-1 activation. TICAM-1 acts as a platform that accumulates signaling molecules to the TICAM-1 signalosome and triggers diversified cellular responses. TICAM-1-dependent gene expression directs mDCs to activate natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are both the most effective for antiviral response, and are an anti-cancer immune response (8Schulz O. Diebold S.S. Chen M. Näslund T.I. Nolte M.A. Alexopoulou L. Azuma Y.T. Flavell R.A. Liljeström P. Reis E. Sousa C.R. Nature. 2005; 433: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 9Akazawa T.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Indeed, TLR3/4 ligands are strong candidates for adjuvant anti-cancer and infectious disease immunotherapy (10Mata-Haro V.

Interestingly, the RIG-I-like receptor-mediated signaling pathway shares most of its downstream signaling molecules with the TICAM-1 pathway, but it plays a distinct role in antivirus immunity by producing type I IFNs (30Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Although TICAM-1-mediated signaling is initiated from the endosome, RIG-I-like receptor-mediated signaling occurs at the mitochondrial outer membrane (31Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Hence, compartmentalization of signal platforms might be significant for activating distinct transcription factors, resulting in different cellular responses. In certain RNA viral infections, TLR3-TICAM-1-dependent inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production affects virally induced pathology and host survival (32Matsumoto M. Seya T. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In addition, biased activation of the TLR4-TICAM-1 pathway in lung macrophages by oxidized phospholipids triggers acute lung injury through cytokine production (11Imai Y. Kuba K. Neely G.G. Yaghubian-Malhami R. Perkmann T. van Loo G. Ermolaeva M. Veldhuizen R. Leung Y.H. Wang H. Liu H. Sun Y. Pasparakis M. Kopf M. Mech C. Bavari S. Peiris J.S. Slutsky A.S. Akira S. Hultqvist M. Holmdahl R. Nicholls J. Jiang C. Binder C.J. Penninger J.M. Cell. 2008; 133: 235-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Therefore, control of TICAM-1 activation is a novel therapeutic target for acute lung injury. The development of an inhibitory molecule that blocks homo-oligomerization of TICAM-1 might be a straightforward approach for controlling excessive activation of TICAM-1 after viral infection.

https://openalex.org/W2007461563,"Lysosome function is essential to many physiological processes. It has been suggested that deregulation of lysosome function could contribute to cancer. Through a genetic screen in Drosophila, we have discovered that mutations disrupting lysosomal degradation pathway components contribute to tumor development and progression. Loss-of-function mutations in the Class C vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) gene, deep orange (dor), dramatically promote tumor overgrowth and invasion of the Ras(V12) cells. Knocking down either of the two other components of the Class C VPS complex, carnation (car) and vps16A, also renders Ras(V12) cells capable for uncontrolled growth and metastatic behavior. Finally, chemical disruption of the lysosomal function by feeding animals with antimalarial drugs, chloroquine or monensin, leads to malignant tumor growth of the Ras(V12) cells. Taken together, our data provide evidence for a causative role of lysosome dysfunction in tumor growth and invasion and indicate that members of the Class C VPS complex behave as tumor suppressors."
https://openalex.org/W2039864424,"Homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is an evolutionary conserved serine/threonine kinase whose activity is fundamental in maintaining wild-type p53 function, thereby controlling the destiny of cells when exposed to DNA damaging agents. We recently reported an altered conformational state of p53 in tissues from patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that led to an impaired and dysfunctional response to stressors.Here we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the impairment of p53 activity in two cellular models, HEK-293 cells overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein and fibroblasts from AD patients, starting from recent findings showing that p53 conformation may be regulated by HIPK2. We demonstrated that beta-amyloid 1-40 induces HIPK2 degradation and alters HIPK2 binding activity to DNA, in turn regulating the p53 conformational state and vulnerability to a noxious stimulus. Expression of HIPK2 was analysed by western blot experiments, whereas HIPK2 DNA binding was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. In particular, we evaluated the recruitment of HIPK2 onto some target promoters, including hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha and metallothionein 2A.These results support the existence of a novel amyloid-based pathogenetic mechanism in AD potentially leading to the survival of injured dysfunctional cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968139381,"Osteochondroma, the most common benign bone tumor, may occur as a sporadic lesion or as multiple neoplasms in the context of multiple osteochondromas syndrome. The most severe complication is malignant transformation into peripheral secondary chondrosarcoma. Although both benign conditions have been linked to defects in EXT1 or EXT2 genes, contradictory reports are present in the literature regarding the requirement of their biallelic inactivation for osteochondroma development. A major limitation of these studies is represented by the small number of samples available for the screening. Taking advantage of a large series of tissues, our aim was to contribute to the definition of a genetic model for osteochondromas onset and transformation. EXT genes point mutations and big deletions were analyzed in 64 tissue samples. A double hit was found in 5 out of 35 hereditary cases, 6 out of 16 chondrosarcomas and 2 recurrences; none of the 11 sporadic osteochondromas showed two somatic mutations. Our results clearly indicate that, in most cases, biallelic inactivation of EXT genes does not account for osteochondromas formation; this mechanism should be regarded as a common feature for hereditary osteochondromas transformation and as an event that occurs later in tumor progression of solitary cases. These findings suggest that mechanisms alternative to EXT genetic alteration likely have a role in osteochondromas pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2020841189,"Background Leeches have gained a fearsome reputation by feeding externally on blood, often from human hosts. Orificial hirudiniasis is a condition in which a leech enters a body orifice, most often the nasopharyngeal region, but there are many cases of leeches infesting the eyes, urethra, vagina, or rectum. Several leech species particularly in Africa and Asia are well-known for their propensity to afflict humans. Because there has not previously been any data suggesting a close relationship for such geographically disparate species, this unnerving tendency to be invasive has been regarded only as a loathsome oddity and not a unifying character for a group of related organisms. Principal Findings A new genus and species of leech from Perú was found feeding from the nasopharynx of humans. Unlike any other leech previously described, this new taxon has but a single jaw with very large teeth. Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial genes using parsimony and Bayesian inference demonstrate that the new species belongs among a larger, global clade of leeches, all of which feed from the mucosal surfaces of mammals. Conclusions This new species, found feeding from the upper respiratory tract of humans in Perú, clarifies an expansion of the family Praobdellidae to include the new species Tyrannobdella rex n. gen. n.sp., along with others in the genera Dinobdella, Myxobdella, Praobdella and Pintobdella. Moreover, the results clarify a single evolutionary origin of a group of leeches that specializes on mucous membranes, thus, posing a distinct threat to human health."
https://openalex.org/W2082796170,"The migration and invasion inhibitor protein (MIIP, also known as IIp45) was discovered as a negative regulator of cell migration and invasion in glioma. Our previous studies have shown that the MIIP protein was reduced or undetectable in some tissue samples obtained from patients with glioblastoma. The significance of MIIP in gliomagenesis is unknown. In this study, we report that MIIP has an important role in the inhibition of gliomagenesis and attenuation of mitotic transition. Increased MIIP expression levels inhibited colony formation and cell growth of glioma cell lines in vitro, whereas decreased expression by specific small interfering RNA for MIIP resulted in increased cell growth. Expression of MIIP in a glial-specific mouse model blocked glioma development and progression, thus showing that MIIP is an inhibitor of gliomagenesis. Furthermore, we show that MIIP attenuates mitotic transition and results in increased mitotic catastrophe. The biochemical mechanism of MIIP in this process is associated with its regulation of anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) activity. MIIP interacts directly with Cdc20, and the interaction of MIIP with Cdc20 inhibits APC/C-mediated degradation of cyclin B1. Thus, MIIP attenuates mitotic transition and increases mitotic catastrophe, thereby inhibiting glioma development and progression."

https://openalex.org/W1989879671,"When reading bioscience journal articles, many researchers focus attention on the figures and their captions. This observation led to the development of the BioText literature search engine, a freely available Web-based application that allows biologists to search over the contents of Open Access Journals, and see figures from the articles displayed directly in the search results. This article presents a qualitative assessment of this system in the form of a usability study with 20 biologist participants using and commenting on the system. 19 out of 20 participants expressed a desire to use a bioscience literature search engine that displays articles' figures alongside the full text search results. 15 out of 20 participants said they would use a caption search and figure display interface either frequently or sometimes, while 4 said rarely and 1 said undecided. 10 out of 20 participants said they would use a tool for searching the text of tables and their captions either frequently or sometimes, while 7 said they would use it rarely if at all, 2 said they would never use it, and 1 was undecided. This study found evidence, supporting results of an earlier study, that bioscience literature search systems such as PubMed should show figures from articles alongside search results. It also found evidence that full text and captions should be searched along with the article title, metadata, and abstract. Finally, for a subset of users and information needs, allowing for explicit search within captions for figures and tables is a useful function, but it is not entirely clear how to cleanly integrate this within a more general literature search interface. Such a facility supports Open Access publishing efforts, as it requires access to full text of documents and the lifting of restrictions in order to show figures in the search interface."
https://openalex.org/W2053292523,"Current treatment for medulloblastoma is successful in more than half of all cases but results in substantial disability in survivors. Accordingly, there is considerable interest in drugs that may target specific signaling pathways activated in the tumors, with inhibitors of both the Hedgehog and Notch pathways currently proposed as possible therapeutics. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Notch pathway inhibition in vivo may block the formation of Hedgehog-dependent medulloblastoma. We took the general approach of using a cre recombinase under the control of the GFAP promoter to generate medulloblastoma in mice carrying a conditional Ptc1 allele and introduced a conditional RBP-J allele to ablate canonical Notch signaling. Loss of RBP-J from the developing cerebellum led to a modest loss of stem cells and an overall developmental delay. These phenotypes could be partially compensated by activation of the Hedgehog pathway. Hedgehog-dependent medulloblastoma were not blocked by loss of RBP-J, indicating that canonical Notch signaling is not required for tumor initiation and growth in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2097638868,"Hexaacyl lipopolysaccharide (LPS) aggregates in aqueous media, but its partially deacylated lipid A moiety forms monomers with weaker toxicity. Because plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) transfers hexaacyl LPS, its impact on metabolism and biological activity of triacyl lipid A in mice was addressed. Triacyl lipid A bound readily to plasma high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) when active PLTP was expressed [HDL-associated lipid A after 4.5 h: 59.1±16.0% of total in wild-type (WT) vs. 32.5±10.3% in PLTP-deficient mice, P<0.05]. In the opposite to hexaacyl LPS, plasma residence time of lipid A was extended by PLTP, and proinflammatory cytokines were produced in higher amounts in WT than PLTP−/− mice (remaining lipid A after 8 h: 53±12 vs. 35±7%, and IL6 concentration after 4.5 h: 45.5±5.9 vs. 14.6±7.8 ng/ml, respectively;P<0.05 in all cases). After 1 wk, onset of B16-induced melanoma was observed in only 30% of lipid A-treated WT mice, whereas >80% of the untreated WT, untreated PLTP-deficient, or lipid A-treated PLTP-deficient animals bore tumors (P<0.05 in all cases). It is concluded that PLTP is essential in mediating the association of triacyl lipid A with lipoproteins, leading to extension of its residence time and to magnification of its proinflammatory and anticancer properties.—Gautier, T., Paul, C., Deckert, v., Desrumaux, C., Klein, A., Labbe, J., Le Guern, N., Athias, A., Monier, S., Hammann, A., Bettaieb, A., Jeannin, J.-F., Lagrost, L.

https://openalex.org/W2014162567,"The PI3-kinase pathway is the target of inactivation in achieving better cancer chemotherapy. Here, we report that p53-mediated transcription is inhibited by pharmacological inhibitors and a dominant-negative mutant of PI3-kinase, and this inhibition was relieved by a constitutively active mutant of PI3-kinase. Akt/PKB and mTOR, the downstream effectors of PI3-kinase, were also found to be essential. LY294002 (PI3-kinase inhibitor) pre-treatment altered the post-translational modifications and the sub-cellular localization of p53. Although LY294002 increased the chemosensitivity of cells to low concentrations of adriamycin (adriamycin-low), it protected the cells from cytotoxicity induced by high concentrations of adriamycin (adriamycin-high) in a p53-dependent manner. Further, we found that LY294002 completely abolished the activation of p53 target genes (particularly pro-apoptotic) under adriamycin-high conditions, whereas it only marginally repressed the p53 target genes under adriamycin-low conditions; in fact, it further activated the transcription of NOXA, HRK, APAF1 and CASP5 genes. Thus, the differential effect of PI3-kinase on p53 functions seems to be responsible for the differential regulation of DNA damage-induced cytotoxicity and cell death by PI3-kinase. Our finding becomes relevant in the light of ongoing combination chemotherapy trials with the PI3-kinase pathway inhibitors and underscores the importance of p53 status in the careful formulation of combination chemotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W1999968946,"Many gram-positive bacteria produce pore-forming exotoxins that contain a highly conserved, 12-residue domain (ECTGLAWEWWRT) that binds cholesterol. This domain is usually flanked N-terminally by arginine and C-terminally by valine. We used this 14-residue sequence as a template to create a small library of peptides that bind cholesterol and other lipids.Several of these peptides manifested anti-inflammatory properties in a predictive in vitro monocyte chemotactic assay, and some also diminished the pro-inflammatory effects of low-density lipoprotein in apoE-deficient mice. The most potent analog, Oxpholipin-11D (OxP-11D), contained D-amino acids exclusively and was identical to the 14-residue design template except that diphenylalanine replaced cysteine-3. In surface plasmon resonance binding studies, OxP-11D bound oxidized (phospho)lipids and sterols in much the same manner as D-4F, a widely studied cardioprotective apoA-I-mimetic peptide with anti-inflammatory properties. In contrast to D-4F, which adopts a stable alpha-helical structure in solution, the OxP-11D structure was flexible and contained multiple turn-like features.Given the substantial evidence that oxidized phospholipids are pro-inflammatory in vivo, OxP-11D and other Oxpholipins may have therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2050389684,"Background Segmental duplication is widely held to be an important mode of genome growth and evolution. Yet how this would affect the global structure of genomes has been little discussed. Methods/Principal Findings Here, we show that equivalent length, or , a quantity determined by the variance of fluctuating part of the distribution of the -mer frequencies in a genome, characterizes the latter's global structure. We computed the s of 865 complete chromosomes and found that they have nearly universal but (-dependent) values. The differences among the of a chromosome and those of its coding and non-coding parts were found to be slight. Conclusions We verified that these non-trivial results are natural consequences of a genome growth model characterized by random segmental duplication and random point mutation, but not of any model whose dominant growth mechanism is not segmental duplication. Our study also indicates that genomes have a nearly universal cumulative “point” mutation density of about 0.73 mutations per site that is compatible with the relatively low mutation rates of (15)10/site/Mya previously determined by sequence comparison for the human and E. coli genomes."
