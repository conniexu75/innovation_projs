We here demonstrate that Sca-1-positive (Sca-1+) cells in adult hearts have some of the features of stem cells. Sca-1+ cells were isolated from adult murine hearts by a magnetic cell sorting system and cultured on gelatin-coated dishes. A fraction of Sca-1+ cells stuck to the culture dish and proliferated slowly. When treated with oxytocin, Sca-1+ cells expressed genes of cardiac transcription factors and contractile proteins and showed sarcomeric structure and spontaneous beating. Isoproterenol treatment increased the beating rate, which was accompanied by the intracellular Ca2+ transients. The cardiac Sca-1+ cells expressed oxytocin receptor mRNA, and the expression was up-regulated after oxytocin treatment. Some of the Sca-1+ cells expressed alkaline phosphatase after osteogenic induction and were stained with Oil-Red O after adipogenic induction. These results suggest that Sca-1+ cells in the adult murine heart have potential as stem cells and may contribute to the regeneration of injured hearts.

Adult cardiac Sca-1-positive cells differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 288Issue 52PreviewVOLUME 279 (2004) PAGES 11384–11391 Full-Text PDF Open Access The heart has long been thought to adapt to increased work and loss of cardiomyocytes by the cellular hypertrophy of residual cardiomyocytes, but not by the proliferation of mature cardiomyocytes or the differentiation of undifferentiated cells. However, recent reports have suggested that adult cardiomyocytes can proliferate under certain pathologic conditions and that there are cells expressing stem cell markers in the adult heart (1Kajstura J.

It has been reported that Sca-1- and c-kit-positive (+) cells exist in the adult heart (5Anversa P. Nadal-Ginard B. Nature. 2002; 415: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and that adult murine hearts contain potential stem cells; side population (SP) 1The abbreviations used are: SP, side population; PE, phycoerythrin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MHC, myosin heavy chain; MLC, myosin light chain; MACS, Magnetic Cell Sorting; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; MEF, muscle enhancer factor. cells (6Asakura A.

However, it remains to be clarified whether these cells have the characteristics of stem cells such as abilities of self-renewal and differentiation into various types of cells including mature cardiomyocytes. Sca-1 is a member of the Ly-6 family and has first reported as one of the cell surface markers of hematopoietic stem cells (8van der Rijn M. Heimfeld S. Spangruade G.J. Wiessman I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recently many reports have demonstrated that multipotential stem cells derived from bone marrow and skeletal muscle express Sca-1. Okumoto et al. (9Okumoto K. Saito T. Hattori E. Ito J.I. Adachi T. Takeda T. Sugahara K. Watanabe H. Saito K. Togashi H. Kawata S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have reported that Sca-1+ cells from bone marrow differentiate into hepatocyte when treated with hepatic growth factor. Gojo et al. (10Gojo S. Gojo N. Takeda Y. Mori T. Abe H. Kyo S. Hata J. Umezawa A. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) have reported that adult mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow abundantly express Sca-1 and differentiate into cardiomyocyte in vivo. Qu-Petersen et al. (11Qu-Petersen Z. Deasy B. Jankowski R. Ikezawa M. Cummins J. Pruchnic R. Mytinger J. Cao B. Gates C. Wernig A. Huard J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) have shown that skeletal muscle-derived stem cells, which highly express Sca-1, contribute to the regeneration of the skeletal muscle in a mouse model of Duchenne muscle dystrophy. They also demonstrated that the skeletal muscle-derived stem cells were able to differentiate into neural cells and endothelial cells. Asakura et al. (12Asakura A. Seale P. Girgis-Gabardo A. Rudnicki M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) have reported that ∼90% of SP cells in skeletal muscle express Sca-1. It has been reported that skeletal muscle-derived Sca-1+ and CD34+ cells restore dystrophin in mdx mice (13Torrente Y. Tremblay J.P. Pisati F. Belicchi M. Rossi B. Sironi M. Fortunato F. El Fahime M. D'Angelo M.G. Caron N.J. Constantin G. Paulin D. Scarlato G. Bresolin N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and that CD34+ and CD45- cells in the interstitial spaces of skeletal muscle, which highly express Sca-1, differentiate into adipocytes, endothelial, and myogenic cells (14Tamaki T. Akatsuka A. Ando K. Nakamura Y. Matsuzawa H. Hotta T. Roy R.R. Edgerton V.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Sca-1 might be important evidence for somatic stem cells. Currently little is known about the humoral or growth factors that induce cardiomyogenic differentiation. It has been shown that ectopic application of bone morphological protein (BMP) 2 and 4 elicits cardiogenic responses in the chick in vivo system (15Schultheiss T.M. Burch J.B. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 and 4, combined with BMP-2 or BMP-4 can induce cardiogenesis in chick non-precardiac mesoderm (16Sugi Y. Lough J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The non-canonical Wnt/c-Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways have been reported to be essential for cardiac induction in frog and chick embryo systems (17Pandur P. Lasche M. Eisenberg L.M. Kuhl M. Nature. 2002; 418: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 18Eisenberg C.A. Gourdie R.G. Eisenberg L.M. Development. 1997; 124: 525-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These factors are prerequisites for early cardiac differentiation but are not sufficient for accomplishing differentiation into mature beating cardiomyocytes. Recently Paquin et al. (19Paquin J. Danalache B.A. Jankowski M. McCann S.M. Gutkowska J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9550-9555Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have reported that oxytocin induces differentiation of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells to beating cardiomyocytes. In support of the role of oxytocin in cardiac development, the oxytocin receptor is increased at the protein level in the murine heart from day 7 of gestation, when cardiac differentiation starts (20Mukaddam-Daher S. Jankowski M. Wang D. Menaouar A. Gutkowska J. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 175: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of the effect of oxytocin is not clear, oxytocin may play an important role in the differentiation into cardiomyocytes from primitive cells including adult somatic stem cells. Here, we first report that a novel population from Sca-1+ cells derived from the adult murine heart proliferates and differentiates into beating cardiomyocytes with oxytocin treatment. Animals and Reagents—Wild mice (C57Bl/6) were purchased from Takasugi Experimental Animals Supply, Co, LTD, Japan. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chiba University. Phycoerythrin (PE) -conjugated anti-Sca-1 (anti-Ly6A/E), anti-c-kit (anti-CD117) antibodies were purchased from eBio-science (San Diego, CA). PE-conjugated anti-CD34, anti-CD45, and biotin-conjugated anti-Sca-1 antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The following antibodies were used for immunostaining: mouse monoclonal anti-cardiac troponin T (RV-C2, DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Germany), rabbit polyclonal anti-atrial natriuretic factor-1 (ANF) (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos. CA), goat polyclonal anti-GATA4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-myosin light chain-2v (MLC-2v) (BioCytex, France), mouse monoclonal anti-tropomyosin (Sigma Aldrich), mouse monoclonal anti-sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MF-20) (American Type Culture Collection), rabbit polyclonal anti-connexin 43 (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). Fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Other reagents that are not specified were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Isolation and Culture of Sca-1+ Cells from the Adult Murine Heart—A heart of adult C57Bl/6 mouse (10–12 weeks old) was enzymatically dissociated into a single cell suspension as described previously (21Yao A. Kohmoto O. Oyama T. Sugishita Y. Shimizu T. Harada K. Matsui H. Komuro I. Nagai R. Matsuo H. Serizawa T. Maruyama T. Takahashi T. Circ. J. 2003; 67: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Enrichment of Sca-1+ cells was achieved by sorting using the Magnetic Cell Sorting (MACS) system (Miltenyl Biotec, Sunnyvale, CA). Whole primary cell suspension was incubated with PE-conjugated anti-Sca-1 antibody for 10 min on ice, washed in PBS supplemented with 3% FBS, incubated with anti-PE micro beads for 15 min at 4 °C, and washed with PBS supplemented with 3% FBS. The samples were passed through a MACS column set up in a Miltenyl magnet and the Sca-1+ cells were eluted from the column by washing with PBS supplemented with 3% FBS. To increase the purity of the Sca-1+ cells, magnetic sorting was performed one more time. The Sca-1+ cells were cultured on 1% gelatin-coated dishes with Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml of penicillin, and 250 μg/ml of streptomycin at 37 °C in humid air with 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the cells were treated with 10 μm 5′-azacytizine for the initial 72 h or 100 nm oxytocin (WAKO, Japan). After treatment, the medium was changed every 3 days. Characterization of Cardiac Muscle-derived Stem Cells for Flow Cytometric Analysis—Sca-1+ cells were isolated by the MACS system with biotin-conjugated anti-Sca-1 antibody and anti-biotin micro beads. Magnetic sorting was repeated twice, and the cells were incubated with PE-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody, PE-conjugated anti-CD34 antibody, and PE-conjugated anti-c-kit antibody, respectively for 10 min on ice and washed with PBS supplemented with 3% FBS. The percentages of CD45+, CD34+, and c-kit+ cells were analyzed by the EPICS ALTRA flow cytometer using EXPO32 software (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the adult murine heart, liver, and Sca-1+ cells by RNA-bee reagent (TEL-TEST, Friendswood, TX).

After preblocking with PBS containing 2% donkey serum, 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min, primary antibodies in PBS containing 2% donkey serum, 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 were applied overnight in 4 °C. Subsequently cells were washed three times in PBS, and then fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied to visualize expression of specific proteins. Nuclear staining was performed with TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images of cells were taken by laser confocal microscopy (Radiance2000, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Phase Contrast Live Imaging—Live images were taken by a Zeiss inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with phasecontrast objectives and an AxioCam camera. Live image of beating cells were obtained by a chilled CCD camera (Hamamatsu) using I-O DATA Videorecorder software. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration—Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in beating cells derived from cardiac Sca-1+ cells was measured as previously described (31Yao A. Su Z. Nonaka A. Zubair I. Spitzer K.W. Bridge J.H. Muelheims G. Ross Jr., J. Barry W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1441-H1448PubMed Google Scholar). The beating cells on gelatin-coated glass coverslips were incubated in HEPES (loading) solution containing 1 μm fluo 3-acetoxymethyl ester (fluo 3-AM; Molecular Probes) at 36 °C in the dark for 30 min. The loading solution was prepared by diluting a 100 μm fluo 3 stock solution, which contained 0.45% Pluronic F127 (Molecular Probes), 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 90% FBS. HEPES solution consisted of (in mm) 126 NaCl, 4.4 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 1.08 CaCl2, 24 HEPES, 13 NaOH, 11 glucose, and 0.5 probenecid (pH 7.4). The coverslips were washed twice with dye-free HEPES solution and placed in a flow-through chamber on the microscope. Fluo 3-loaded beating cells were excited by 480-nm light and emitted fluorescence was recorded at 530 nm by a photomultiplier tube (AIM-10, InterMedical, Co, Japan) and digitized (PowerLab 2/20, AD-instruments, Castle Hill, Australia). Curve fits were performed with Origin 7J software (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). The intensity of the fluorescence at 530 nm increased with an increase in [Ca2+]i. Estimation of Pluripotency—Osteogenic differentiation of Sca-1+ cells from the adult murine heart was induced in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μm ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate as described previously (32Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. Caplan A.I. Bruder S.P. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 64: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). For detection of osteocytes, alkaline phosphatase staining (leukocyte alkaline phosphatase assay kit, Sigma-Aldrich) was used. Adipogenic differentiation was induced as described previously (28Asakura A. Komaki M. Rudnicki M.A. Differentiation. 2001; 68: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Briefly the cells were cultured with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% horse serum with MDI-I mixture; 0.5 mm methyl-isobutylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 100 mm indomethacin, and 10 μg/ml insulin for 2 days and then cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum and 10 μg/ml of insulin for 1 day. Treatment with MDI-I followed by insulin was repeated four times. For detection of accumulated oil droplets, Oil-Red O staining was performed followed by nuclear hematoxylin counterstaining. Statistical Analysis—Values are presented as mean ± S.E. The significance of differences among mean values was determined by analysis of variance. The accepted level of significance was p < 0.05. Cell Surface Antigens of Sca-1+ Cells Derived from the Adult Murine Heart—Flow cytometric analysis revealed that Sca-1+ cells were enriched to over 90% when adult murine cardiac cells were sorted twice with the MACS system using PE-conjugated anti-Sca-1 antibody and anti-PE micro beads (Fig. 1A). The number of purified Sca-1+ cells was ∼1 × 104 cells. Limana et al. (33Limana F. Urbanek K. Chimenti S. Quaini F. Leri A. Kajstura J. Nadal-Ginard B. Izumo S. Anversa P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6257-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have estimated the number of cardiomyocytes in an adult murine heart as ∼3 × 106. Therefore the percentage of cardiac Sca-1+ cells was ∼0.3% of the total number of cardiomyocytes. Next we examined other cell surface antigens such as CD45, CD34, and c-kit in Sca-1+ cells. After repeated magnetic sorting with biotin-conjugated anti-Sca-1 antibody and anti-biotin micro beads, enriched Sca-1+ cells were incubated with PE-conjugated anti-CD45, CD34 and c-kit antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. In enriched Sca-1+ cells, ∼40% of the cells expressed CD45 (Fig. 1B), and ∼10% of the cells expressed CD34 (Fig. 1C) and c-kit (Fig. 1D). Sca-1+ Cells from the Adult Murine Heart Differentiate into Beating Cardiomyocytes—In order to induce differentiation into cardiomyocytes, Sca-1+ cells were treated with either 5′-azacytizine or oxytocin. When Sca-1+ cells were cultured with medium containing FBS, they showed various cell shapes, and spindle-like and elongated shapes were predominant (Fig. 2A). Two weeks after treatment with oxytocin, small round cells with prominent nucleus and little cytoplasm appeared (arrowheads in Fig. 2B). These round cells rapidly proliferated, formed clusters, and detached from the culture dish so that spindle-shaped cells were left. The cells were re-plated when reached to confluence. Four weeks after starting treatment with oxytocin, some spontaneously beating cells were recognized among spindle-shaped cells (arrow in Fig. 2, C and D and Supplemental Data). Spontaneous beating was observed at ∼1% cells. On the other hand, cells after treatment with 5′-azacytizine or vehicles showed fibroblast-like morphology, and never exhibited round or spindle-shaped morphology, or spontaneous beating. Next we examined the gene expression of cardiac transcription factors and cardiac structural proteins in Sca-1+ cells by RT-PCR. Before treatment with 5′-azacytizine or oxytocin, only Csx/Nkx-2.5 and GATA4 were slightly expressed (Fig. 3, lane P). Four weeks after treatment with 5′-azacytizine or oxytocin, all genes of cardiac transcription factors including Csx/Nkx-2.5, GATA4, and MEF-2C and structural proteins such as α- and β-MHC, MLC-2a, MLC-2v, and cardiac α-actin were expressed (Fig. 3, lane A for 5′-azacytizine and lane OT for oxytocin). Treatment with 100 nm oxytocin antagonist (OTA, [d(CH2)5-1,Tyr(Me)-2,Thr-4,Orn-8,Tyr-NH2-9] vasotocin, Wako, Japan) completely inhibited oxytocin-induced expression of cardiac genes (Fig. 3, lane OT+OTA). Total RNA obtained from the adult murine heart and liver were used as positive and negative controls (Fig. 3, lane H for heart and lane L for liver). Loading of equal amounts of RNA was confirmed by expression of the β-actin gene. Cardiac gene expression was not observed in cells cultured with vehicle (Fig. 3, lane V). To examine the expression and localization of cardiac proteins, the Sca-1+ cells treated with oxytocin and 5′-azacytizine were stained with specific antibodies against cardiac proteins. The cells treated with oxytocin expressed GATA4 (Fig. 4A), ANF (Fig. 4B), and cardiac troponin T (Fig. 4, A and B). MLC-2v (Fig. 4C), sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (Fig. 4D), and tropomyosin (data not shown) were also expressed. Notably, staining of each contractile protein showed a fine striated pattern. Connexin 43 was expressed at the junction between two cardiac troponin T-expressing cells (Fig. 4E). These findings indicate that treatment with oxytocin induced differentiation of Sca-1+ cells, derived from the adult murine heart, into mature cardiomyocytes, which had well-organized structures and electrical junctions. After treatment with 5′-azacytizine, a fraction of cells expressed sarcomeric myosin heavy chain in fibrillar pattern (Fig. 4F), but not cardiac troponin T (data not shown). Next we sorted cardiac Sca-1+ cells on the basis of CD45 expression and cultured with oxytocin. Some of the Sca-1+/CD45- cells expressed sarcomeric myosin after oxytocin treatment, but none of the Sca-1+/CD45+ cells expressed myosin (data not shown), suggesting that Sca-1+ cells that can differentiate into cardiomyocytes are in CD45- population. Cardiac contraction is regulated by beat to beat change in [Ca2+]i. To ascertain that the spontaneous beating of differentiated cardiac Sca-1+ cells depends on intracellular level of Ca2+, we analyzed [Ca2+]i transients of the beating cells. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 5A, the spontaneous beating of differentiated Sca-1+ cells was accompanied with [Ca2+]i transients. After treatment with 10-7m isoproterenol for 5 min, the frequency of [Ca2+]i transients was increased in comparison with control (Fig. 5A, upper panel versus lower panel). Next we examined the predominant subtype of β receptors, which mediates changes in beating rate. Differentiated cardiac Sca-1+ cells were treated with vehicle (PBS), propranolol, CGP20712A (β1-selective blocker), or ICI118551 (β2-selective blocker) for 30 min and then stimulated with isoproterenol alone for 5 min. Isoproterenol significantly increased the beating rate of the control cells (control: 131.9 ± 5.6, n = 10 versus isoproterenol: 228.9 ± 7.3, n = 10, p < 0.01, Fig. 5B). The pretreatment with propranolol (average 196.4 ± 5.6, n = 10, p < 0.05 versus isoproterenol) and CGP20712A (average 188.9 ± 7.5, n = 10, p < 0.05 versus isoproterenol) reduced the increase in beating rate in response to isoproterenol significantly (Fig. 5B). ICI118551 had no effect on the isoproterenol-induced increase in beating rate. Sca-1+ Cells from the Adult Murine Heart Express Oxytocin Receptor mRNA—To elucidate the role of oxytocin receptor in cardiomyogenesis of Sca-1+ cells, we examined the expression of oxytocin receptor in Sca-1+ cells. Oxytocin receptor mRNA was present at low levels in Sca-1+ cells before oxytocin treatment (Fig. 6, lane P). Expression levels of oxytocin receptor remained low in cells cultured with vehicle (Fig. 6, lane V). After treatment with oxytocin, expression levels of oxytocin receptor were up-regulated (Fig. 6, lane OT). In accordance with the inhibitory effect of oxytocin antagonist on oxytocin-induced cardiac differentiation, oxytocin antagonist inhibited oxytocin-induced up-regulation of the oxytocin receptor (Fig. 6, lane OT+OTA). These results suggest that the positive feedback mechanism, namely oxytocin-induced up-regulation of oxytocin receptor, plays an important role in oxytocin-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation of cardiac Sca-1+ cells. Sca-1+ Cells Can Differentiate into Osteocytes and Adipocytes—It has been reported that Sca-1+ cells from skeletal muscle and bone marrow differentiate into various types of cells such as adipocytes, endothelial cells, muscle, neural, and hepatic cells (9Okumoto K. Saito T. Hattori E. Ito J.I. Adachi T. Takeda T. Sugahara K. Watanabe H. Saito K. Togashi H. Kawata S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To determine whether the Sca-1+ cells from the adult murine heart have pluripotency, we examined whether these cells could differentiate into cells other than cardiomyocytes. When treated with osteogenic inducers, some of Sca-1+ cells were stained with alkaline phosphatase, one of the early markers of osteogenesis (Fig. 7A). RT-PCR clearly revealed that osteogenic marker mRNAs such as alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin were induced in Sca-1+ cells after treatment with osteogenic inducers (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, Sca-1+ cells treated with oxytocin never expressed alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. When Sca-1+ cells were cultured with MDI-I mixture for twelve days, some of Sca-1+ cells showed cytoplasmic accumulation of oil droplets stained with Oil-Red O, indicating that Sca-1+ cells differentiated into adipocytes (Fig. 7C). In this report, we have first demonstrated that adult cardiac Sca-1+ cells can differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes in vitro by treatment with oxytocin. When treated with oxytocin, the Sca-1+ cells expressed cardiac genes including Csx/Nkx-2.5, GATA4, MEF-2C, α-MHC, β-MHC, MLC-2a, MLC-2v, and cardiac α-actin, and cardiac proteins including GATA4, cardiac troponin T, tropomyosin, MLC-2v, sarcomeric myosin heavy chain, ANF, and connexin 43. Furthermore, some of Sca-1+ cells showed well organized sarcomere and spontaneous beating. Although transient treatment with 5′-azacytizine also induced expression of cardiac genes in Sca-1+ cells, it did not induce expression of cardiac troponin T, assembly of sarcomere or spontaneous beating. These results suggest that treatment with 5′-azacytizine induces differentiation of Sca-1+ cells into cardiomyocytes incompletely and that oxytocin is a more potent inducer of cardiac differentiation than 5′-azacytizine. P19 teratocarcinoma cells differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes after treatment with Me2SO and have been considered as a good model of in vitro cardiogenesis (34Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y.

Telomeres are heterochromatic regions. Yeast and flies with defects in activities that modify the state of chromatin also have abnormal telomere function, but the putative role of chromatin-modifying activities in regulating telomeres in mammals is unknown. Here we report on telomere length and function in mice null with respect to both the histone methyltransferases (HMTases) Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 (called SUV39DN mice). Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 govern methylation of histone H3 Lys9 (H3-Lys9) in heterochromatic regions. We show that primary cells derived from SUV39DN mice have abnormally long telomeres relative to wild-type controls. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, we found that telomeres were enriched in di- and trimethylated H3-Lys9 but that telomeres of SUV39DN cells had less dimethylated and trimethylated H3-Lys9 but more monomethylated H3-Lys9. Concomitant with the decrease in H3-Lys9 methylation, telomeres in SUV39DN cells had reduced binding of the chromobox proteins Cbx1, Cbx3 and Cbx5, homologs of Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). These findings indicate substantial changes in the state of telomeric heterochromatin in SUV39DN cells, which are associated with abnormal telomere elongation. Taken together, the results indicate epigenetic regulation of telomere length in mammals by Suv39h1 and Suv39h2."

This dark energy now appears to dominate the Universe and not only alters its expansion rate, but also affects the evolution of fluctuations in the density of matter, slowing down the gravitational collapse of material (into, for example, clusters of galaxies) in recent times. Additional fluctuations in the temperature of CMB photons are induced as they pass through large-scale structures and these fluctuations are necessarily correlated with the distribution of relatively nearby matter. Here we report the detection of correlations between recent CMB data and two probes of large-scale structure: the X-ray background and the distribution of radio galaxies. These correlations are consistent with those predicted by dark energy, indicating that we are seeing the imprint of dark energy on the growth of structure in the Universe."
https://openalex.org/W2091296342,"Depletion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) accompanies myofibroblastic transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), the primary cellular event underlying liver fibrogenesis. The treatment of activated HSC in vitro or in vivo with synthetic PPARγ ligands suppresses the fibrogenic activity of HSC. However, it is uncertain whether PPARγ is indeed a molecular target of this effect, because the ligands are also known to have receptor-independent actions. To test this question, the present study examined the effects of forced expression of PPARγ via an adenoviral vector on morphologic and biochemical features of culture-activated HSC. The vector-mediated expression of PPARγ itself is sufficient to reverse the morphology of activated HSC to the quiescent phenotype with retracted cytoplasm, prominent dendritic processes, reduced stress fibers, and accumulation of retinyl palmitate. These effects are abrogated by concomitant expression of a dominant negative mutant of PPARγ that prevents transactivation of but not binding to the PPAR response element. PPARγ expression also inhibits the activation markers such as the expression of α-smooth muscle actin, type I collagen, and transforming growth factor β1; DNA synthesis; and JunD binding to the activator protein-1 (AP-1) site and AP-1 promoter activity. Inhibited JunD activity by PPARγ is not due to reduced JunD expression or JNK activity or to a competition for p300. But it is due to a JunD-PPARγ interaction as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down analysis. Further, the use of deletion constructs reveals that the DNA binding region of PPARγ is the JunD interaction domain. In summary, our results demonstrate that the restoration of PPARγ reverses the activated HSC to the quiescent phenotype and suppresses AP-1 activity via a physical interaction between PPARγ and JunD.

Upon injury to the liver, HSC become transdifferentiated into myofibroblastic cells to participate in wound healing (1Hautekeete M.L. Geerts A. Virchows Arch. 1997; 430: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This transdifferentiation is characterized by reduced vitamin A content, increased cell proliferation and migration, enhanced matrix protein expression, and induced expression of α-smooth muscle actin (1Hautekeete M.L. Geerts A. Virchows Arch. 1997; 430: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This response of HSC constitutes the normal, reparative homeostatic response of the liver to injury. However, dysregulation of HSC leads to excessive accumulation of extracellular matrices, resulting in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. No curative medical treatments are available for cirrhosis except liver transplantation, and a precise understanding of transdifferentiation of HSC is the prerequisite for eventual identification of “dysregulation” and future developments of specific therapeutic modalities for the disease. To this end, much investigative effort has been made to characterize transcriptional regulation that underlies HSC transdifferentiation. Such examples include identification of Kruppel-like factor 6, a differentially expressed zinc finger protein in activated HSC in vitro and in vivo (2Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G. Lalazar A. Theiss G.

The myofibroblastic phenotype seen in activated HSC is best characterized by induction of α-smooth muscle actin that is mediated by c-Myb binding to an E-box element in its promoter (4Buck M. Kim D.J. Houglum K. Hassanein T. Chojkier M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G321-G328PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of this mode of regulation is supported by the demonstration of prevention of the myofibroblastic phenotypic switch by the treatment of HSC with antisense oligonucleotides for c-Myb (4Buck M. Kim D.J. Houglum K. Hassanein T. Chojkier M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G321-G328PubMed Google Scholar). Sustained NF-κB activation confers activated HSC their proliferative and antiapoptotic status that may be important in progressive liver fibrogenesis (5Lang A. Schoonhoven R. Tuvia S. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. J. Hepatol. 2000; 33: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). NF-κB may also mediate inflammatory responses by HSC via induction of chemokines and adhesion molecules (6Hellerbrand C. Jobin C. Licato L.L. Sartor R.B. Brenner D.A. Am. J.

A complexity in the understanding of HSC differentiation is underscored by different cellular phenotypes that HSC are shown to express. In addition to the myofibroblastic phenotype exhibited by activated HSC, they also express MyoD, the myogenic transcription factor specific for skeletal muscle (9Vincent K.J. Jones E. Arthur M.J.

Activated HSC express leptin (13Potter J.J. Womack L. Mezey E. Anania F.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), an adipocyte-specific gene, raising an intriguing possibility that HSC may also share the adipocytic phenotype. In fact, the quiescent HSC is laden with lipids including triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids in addition to retinyl esters (14Yamada M. Blaner W.S. Soprano D.R. Dixon J.L. Kjeldbye H.M. Goodman D.S. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), one of the key transcription factors for adipocyte differentiation (15Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S.

Further, the treatment of culture-activated HSC with the natural or synthetic ligands for PPARγ suppresses many functional parameters of the cell activation, including cell proliferation (17Galli A. Crabb D.W. Ceni E. Salzano R. Mello T. Svegliati-Baroni G. Ridolfi F. Trozzi L. Surrenti C. Casini A.

More importantly, the treatment of the animal models of liver fibrosis with the PPARγ ligands ameliorates not only induction of fibrosis but also progression of preexisting fibrosis (17Galli A. Crabb D.W. Ceni E. Salzano R. Mello T. Svegliati-Baroni G. Ridolfi F. Trozzi L. Surrenti C. Casini A. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1924-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings support the hypothesis that the maintenance of the quiescent state of HSC requires PPARγ and depletion of this adipogenic transcription factor underlies activation of HSC that can be circumvented by the ligand treatment. However, the ligands for PPARγ are also known to have receptor-independent effects. Using the embryonic stem cells from PPARγ null mice, neither macrophage differentiation nor anti-inflammatory effects of synthetic PPARγ ligands are shown to be dependent on PPARγ (19Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Indeed, the PPARγ ligand 15-deoxyprostaglandin J2 suppresses NF-κB activation by directly inhibiting IκB kinase in a PPARγ-independent manner (20Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Troglitazone also selectively induces early growth response-1 gene independently of PPARγ (21Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Hsi L.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5845-5853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase are activated by PPARγ ligands such as 15-deoxyprostaglandin J2 and ciglitazone in astrocytes and preadipocytes through the mechanisms that are independent of PPARγ but involving reactive oxygen species (22Lennon A.M. Ramauge M. Dessouroux A. Pierre M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29681-29685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is yet to be determined whether PPARγ directly inhibits HSC activation. In order to test this question, the present study was undertaken to express PPARγ via an adenoviral vector in culture-activated HSC and to determine its effects on the cell activation. Our results demonstrate that the restoration of PPARγ in activated HSC induces a reversal of the morphological features of HSC to the quiescent phenotype associated with inhibition of the known activation markers such as induced α-smooth muscle actin, collagen, and TGFβ expression; enhanced DNA synthesis; increased AP-1 binding; and promoter activity. Inhibition of AP-1 binding is due to PPARγ-mediated interference of JunD binding but not to suppression of JunD expression or JNK activity. Further, our results demonstrate a direct interaction of the PPARγ DNA binding domain with JunD that appears to underlie inhibited JunD binding to the AP-1 site. HSC Isolation and Culture—HSC were isolated from normal male Wister rats as previously described (23Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar) by the Non-Parenchymal Liver Cell Core of the USC-UCLA Research Center for Alcoholic Liver and Pancreatic Diseases. The use of animals for this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern California (protocol 9823). In brief, the liver was sequentially digested with Pronase and type IV collagenase to isolate nonparenchymal cells. These cells were subsequently subjected to arabinogalactan gradient ultracentrifugation to collect a pure fraction of HSC from the interface between the medium and a density of 1.035. The purity of isolated HSC was examined by phase-contrast microscopy, UV-excited fluorescence microscopy, and the viability by trypan blue exclusion. Isolated HSC from normal rats were cultured in a 100-mm plastic dish, 6- or 12-well plates with low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml amphotericin B. The cultures were maintained for 7 days before the addition of viral vectors. In addition, a spontaneously immortalized HSC line established from experimental biliary liver fibrosis (24Xiong S. Yavrom S. Hazra S. Wu D. She H. Hepatology. 2001; 34 (abstr.): 520AGoogle Scholar) was maintained in culture in 6-well plates with low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and used for a transient transfection experiment for AP-1 promoter activity. Construction of Viral Vectors and Transduction of the Viral Vector-mediated Genes—Full-length PPARγ1 cDNA was cloned from pCMX-PPARγ into the transfer vector, subsequently allowing homologous recombination with the pAdEasy-1 adenoviral plasmid containing GFP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). GFP alone was used as a control for PPARγ (Ad.GFP). An adenoviral vector expressing a dominant negative mutant form of PPARγ with a GFP tag (Ad.dn.PPARγ) was used. This dn.PPARγ carries the mutations at leucine and glutamic acid residues in the conserved AF-2 region of the C-terminal end. These mutations cause inhibition of recruitment of coactivators such as CBP and SRC-1 and ligand-dependent release of corepressors while promoting the basal recruitment of corepressors (25Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M. Collingwood T.N. Provenzano C. Browne P.O. Rajanayagam O. Burris T.P. Schwabe J.W. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5754-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). All adenoviral vectors (Ad.GFP, Ad.PPARγ, and Ad.dn.PPARγ) were propagated using 293A cells in high glucose DMEM medium containing 5% FBS and then purified using cesium chloride gradient followed by dialysis for removing cesium chloride. The viral particle was titrated by the TCID50 (tissue culture infectious dose 50) method. Briefly, dilutions of viruses were incubated with 293-A cells in 96-well plates, and the presence or absence of cytopathic effect in each well was determined for titration. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 was used for the efficient tansduction of viral vector-mediated genes in activated HSC without any toxicity. HSC were cultured for 7 days. On day 7 of culture, cells were transduced with Ad.GFP, Ad.PPARγ, or Ad.dn.PPARγ or in combination using a total MOI of 100. The next day, medium was changed and cultured for another 4 days. DNA Synthesis—DNA synthesis was determined by the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Activated HSC were cultured in 24-well plates (27,000 cells/well) and were transduced with Ad.GFP or Ad.PPARγ and cultured for an additional 5 days. On the 4th day after infection, [methyl-3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (1 μCi/ml) was added into each well and incubated overnight. After washing the cells, DNA was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. After several washes of the trichloroacetic acid precipitates, incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was determined by counting the radioactivity of the precipitates using liquid scintillation counter. The count was standardized by the cell number. RNA Extraction and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HSC transduced with Ad.GFP, Ad.PPAR plus Ad.GFP, or Ad.PPARγ plus Ad.dn.PPARγ using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of RNA were reverse-transcribed at 37 °C for 60 min with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. For PCR analysis, the synthesized cDNA was amplified using primers for PPARγ, α1(I) procollagen, TGFβ1, and β-actin (16Miyahara T. Schrum L. Rippe R. Xiong S. Yee Jr., H.F. Motomura K. Anania F.A. Willson T.M. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35715-35722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). For real time PCR, 2 ng of total RNA was used in a 20-μl reaction for reverse transcription for 50 min followed by 40 cycles of PCR to produce PCR products using the TaqMan Gold RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA). Probes were 5,6 carboxyl fluorescein amidite labeled at the 5′-end and black hole quencher-1 labeled at the 3′-end (Biosearch Technologies Inc., Novato, CA). Here, ABI 7700 SDS was used as a detection system. Each Ct value was first normalized to the respective glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Ct value of a sample and subsequently to a control sample. A difference in -fold was calculated from these Ct values. Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay—HSC nuclear proteins (5–10 μg) or PPARγ, JunD, or RXRα in vitro translated using the coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega, Madison, WI) were incubated in a reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 200 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) on ice for 15 min and further incubated with 1–2 ng of α-32P-labeled doubled-stranded ARE-7 (the PPAR response element from the adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein gene) or AP-1 element (26Ohata M. Lin M. Satre M. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G589-G596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for an additional 30 min. The reaction mixture was then resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 4× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. For a supershift analysis, polyclonal antibodies against c-Fos, FosB, JunD, or PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added and incubated for an additional 20 min after the 30-min incubation. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—To determine whether PPARγ expressed by the adenoviral vector induces the PPAR response element (PPRE) promoter activity, HSC were transiently transfected with a PPRE-luciferase construct (tk-PPRE × 3-luciferase) using Targefect F-2 (Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA). To examine the effect of PPARγ expression on AP-1 activity, HSC transduced with Ad.PPARγ or Ad.GFP were transiently transfected with an AP-1 luciferase construct containing seven repeats of TGACTAA from the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). We also examined the effects of CBP/p300 expression on the PPARγ-mediated effect on AP-1 by co-transfecting the Ad.GFP or Ad.PPARγ HSC line with a CBP/p300 expression plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Stallcup, University of Southern California). For the determination of transfection efficiency, Renilla phRL-TK vector was used (Promega, Madison, WI). For transfection, 10-day cultures of HSC or HSC line in 6-well plates (70,000 cells/well; 3 days after infection with a viral vector) were incubated with 2 μg of each reporter construct, 0.02 μg of Renilla phRL-TK, and 2 μl of F-2 reagent in 1 ml of serum-free high glucose DMEM. Two h later, 1 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS was added to achieve the final FBS concentration of 5% for overnight incubation. On the next day, the medium was changed to DMEM with 10% FBS, and the cells were incubated for another 30 h. The cell lysate was collected for determination of both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The results were normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. Morphological Analysis—To investigate the effects of PPARγ on the HSC morphology, 7-day cultured HSC were transduced with Ad.GFP, Ad.PPARγ plus Ad.GFP, or Ad.PPARγ plus Ad.dn.PPARγ using a total MOI of 100 of virus and cultured for an additional 5 days. The cells were examined under a fluorescent microscopy and photographed for documentation. The cells were also fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in a phosphate buffer for 1 h and washed with a phosphate buffer. Stress fibers were subsequently stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin for 30 min and washed with a phosphate buffer, and differential interference contrast images were acquired to assess the effects of PPARγ expression. Retinyl Palmitate Measurement—To investigate the effect of PPARγ on the formation of intracellular lipid droplets, the cells were cultured with retinol (5 μm), palmitate (100 μm), or both for 48 h and stained with Oil Red O solution (in 60% isopropyl alcohol) for 20 min followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. The stained slides were examined and photographed using an inverted light microscope. For chemical quantification of retinyl palmitate (a predominant vitamin A form stored in HSC), lipids were extracted with methanol and hexane from HSC treated with both retinol and palmitate (27Bhat P.V. Lacroix A. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 272: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Retinyl palmitate in the hexane-extractable lipid phase was analyzed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the wavelength detector set at 325 nm. To prepare samples for HPLC analysis, solvent was evaporated from portions of lipid extracts in a 37 °C water bath using a gentle stream of N2. Samples were resolubilized in 1:1 methanol-chloroform solvent before HPLC. For data acquisition and peak area integration, the Winflow software package system (Inus Systems, Tampa, FL) was used. The data were standardized with the cell number. The HPLC analyses were performed at the Cell Biology Core of the USC Research Center for Liver Diseases. Western Blot Analysis of Cellular Proteins—HSC were cultured in a 100-mm dish for 7 days. On day 7, HSC were transduced with Ad.GFP or Ad.PPARγ using an MOI of 100 and cultured for additional 5 days. On day 12, cells were washed with PBS once and lysed with a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaF, 20 β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 300 NaCl, with 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were stored at -80 °C until assayed. An equal amount of the whole cell protein (100 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose filters. Proteins were detected by incubating the filter with monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-type I collagen (Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA), anti-PPARγ, or anti-JunD antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a concentration of 0.2–2 μg/10 ml in TBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4) with 5% nonfat milk followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1 μg/10 ml. Proteins were detected by a chemiluminescent method using the PIERCE ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). JNK Assay—To assay the activity of JNK, HSC transduced with Ad.GFP or Ad.PPARγ were lysed for collection of the whole cell proteins as described above. Each 100 μg of lysate was used to immunoprecipitate with 2 μg of anti-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were then incubated with 2 μg of the N-terminal peptide of c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20 μm ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi) for 1 h at 30 °C. The protein mixture was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by a transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane and exposure of the membrane to a PhosphorImager. Phosphate incorporated into c-Jun was visualized. Total JNK levels were determined by immunoblot analysis. PPARγ Immunoprecipitation and JunD Immunoblot Analysis—In order to assess the protein-protein interaction between PPARγ and JunD, in vitro translated PPARγ and JunD were incubated with an anti-PPARγ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. Protein A/G beads were added and incubated for another 24 h. Beads were washed three times and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-JunD antibody (2 μg/10 ml) in TBS containing 5% nonfat milk. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 μg/10 ml) was added and incubated followed by detection of JunD with the ECL reagent as described. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assay—Expression vectors for GST, GST-PPARγ (pGEX-4T2 and pGEX-4T2-PPARγ provided by Dr. Akira Sugawara, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan), and GST fusion proteins of PPARγ deletion mutants (pGEX-4T1-PPARγ deletion mutants provided by Dr. Shigeaki Kato, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) were produced in Escherichia coli BL21. The glutathione beads were coated with the fusion proteins by incubating both together overnight at 4 °C. JunD protein was translated in vitro from pcDNA3-mJunD plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Sunita K. Agarwal, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT-T7-coupl"
https://openalex.org/W2022158005,"The Succulent Karoo is an arid region, situated along the west coast of southern Africa. Floristically this region is part of the Greater Cape Flora and is considered one of the Earth's 25 biodiversity hotspots. Of about 5,000 species occurring in this region, more than 40% are endemic. Aizoaceae (ice plants) dominate the Succulent Karoo both in terms of species numbers (1,750 species in 127 genera) and density of coverage. Here we show that a well-supported clade within the Aizoaceae, representing 1,563 species almost exclusively endemic to southern Africa, has diversified very recently and very rapidly. The estimated age for this radiation lies between 3.8 and 8.7 million years (Myr) ago, yielding a per-lineage diversification rate of 0.77-1.75 per million years. Both the number of species involved and the tempo of evolution far surpass those of any previously postulated continental or island plant radiation. Diversification of the group is closely associated with the origin of several morphological features and one anatomical feature. Because species-poor clades lacking these features occur over a very similar distribution area, we propose that these characteristics are key innovations that facilitated this radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2075555616,"The ability of the semiconductor industry to continue scaling microelectronic devices to ever smaller dimensions (a trend known as Moore's Law) is limited by quantum mechanical effects: as the thickness of conventional silicon dioxide (SiO(2)) gate insulators is reduced to just a few atomic layers, electrons can tunnel directly through the films. Continued device scaling will therefore probably require the replacement of the insulator with high-dielectric-constant (high-k) oxides, to increase its thickness, thus preventing tunnelling currents while retaining the electronic properties of an ultrathin SiO(2) film. Ultimately, such insulators will require an atomically defined interface with silicon without an interfacial SiO(2) layer for optimal performance. Following the first reports of epitaxial growth of AO and ABO(3) compounds on silicon, the formation of an atomically abrupt crystalline interface between strontium titanate and silicon was demonstrated. However, the atomic structure proposed for this interface is questionable because it requires silicon atoms that have coordinations rarely found elsewhere in nature. Here we describe first-principles calculations of the formation of the interface between silicon and strontium titanate and its atomic structure. Our study shows that atomic control of the interfacial structure by altering the chemical environment can dramatically improve the electronic properties of the interface to meet technological requirements. The interface structure and its chemistry may provide guidance for the selection process of other high-k gate oxides and for controlling their growth."

Signals activated by various pathogens are integrated by IRF-3 kinase, resulting in the specific phosphorylation of IRF-3 in the cytoplasm. This phosphorylation induces dimerization and association with the coactivators CREB-binding protein/p300, and the resultant complex activates the target genes in the nucleus. However, the phosphorylation sites that determine the active/inactive status of IRF-3 have been a source of controversy. In this study, we generated an antibody that specifically detects the phosphorylation of Ser-386 and used it as a probe. We found: 1) viral infection specifically induces phosphorylation of the Ser-386; 2) recently identified IRF-3 kinases (IKK-i/∈ and TBK-1) phosphorylate Ser-386 and induce its dimerization; 3) phosphorylation of Ser-386 is exclusively observed with the dimer; 4) mutation at Ser-386 abolishes the dimerization potential; 5) a constitutively active 5D mutant designed to mimic phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues other than Ser-385 and -386 is secondarily phosphorylated at Ser-386, presumably by an irrelevant kinase.

These results strongly suggest that Ser-386 is the target of the IRF-3 kinase and critical determinant for the activation of IRF-3. Immediately after infection by bacteria or viruses, a series of host responses known as innate immunity takes place.

IFN-α/β genes are normally silent, but their expression is dramatically induced at the transcriptional level following infection. Regulatory transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 play a critical role in this regulation (4Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). IRF-3 is ubiquitously expressed in its inactive form in the cytoplasm. Upon signaling triggered by the infection, cellular kinases are activated and result in the phosphorylation of IRF-3 on specific Ser residues (5Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

In contrast, IRF-7 is normally absent, and its expression is secondarily induced by IFN-α/β (4Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Like IRF-3, IRF-7 needs to be specifically phosphorylated to become active, presumably by the same kinases (6Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol.

Thus, unlike IRF-3, IRF-7 plays a role in the later amplification phase of the gene expression. The primary structure of IRF-7 shows that it is the closest relative of IRF-3. Notably, the SSL motif, which is indispensable for their activity, is conserved among IRF-3 from different species and IRF-7 (see Fig. 1A) (16Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E.

The mutation of Ser-385 or -386 to Ala totally abolished the activity of IRF-3 (5Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T.

These results strongly suggest that the 2S site is the critical phosphorylation target and the 5ST site may have an accessory role. However, Hiscott and colleagues (12Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) have proposed that the 2S site is constitutively phosphorylated and the 5ST site is the target for inducible phosphorylation. More recently, they showed that Ser-396 is phosphorylated by virus-activated kinase in vivo (19Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and is the target of IKK-i and TBK-1 in vitro (11Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they made “phospho-mimetic” mutants, 5D, S396D and S396D,S398D, which have substitutions of Ser with Asp at the 5ST site, Ser-396, and Ser-396/398, respectively. These mutants constitutively dimerize, associate with CBP/p300, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the reporter gene (19Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The initial observation that the deletion of the C-terminal region including the 5ST site also resulted in an active IRF-3 (12Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) led them to propose an “auto-inhibition” model in which the C-terminal region acts as a steric intramolecular inhibitor and blocks DNA binding and dimerization. According to their model, the inhibition is reversed by the phosphorylation of the 5ST site, which confers negative charges to the inhibitory domain, resulting in a dramatic conformational change (12Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).However, the model is inconsistent with several observations. First, the deletion mutant IRF-3 (1–394), originally described as constitutively active (12Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), was not active even after viral stimulation (13Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The 5D mutant was active as reported when produced in human 293T cells (12Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar); however, it was much less active in mouse L929 cells (13Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and was produced as an inactive monomer in Escherichia coli. 2M. Mori, M. Yoneyama, and T. Fujita, unpublished observation.2M. Mori, M. Yoneyama, and T. Fujita, unpublished observation. These observations suggest that the observed activity of 5D is not an intrinsic feature and 5D is post-translationally modified in 293T.In the present study, we investigated the phosphorylation of Ser-386 using a novel phosphospecific antibody and showed that viral infection specifically induced the phosphorylation of this site. Furthermore, we found that IKK-i and TBK-1 specifically induce phosphorylation of Ser-386 with a concomitant dimerization of IRF-3. Using various mutants, we concluded that the specific phosphorylation of Ser-386 is the key determinant for the subsequent activation of IRF-3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Preparation of Cell Extracts— L929 cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. 293T cells and U373/CD14 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Whole cell extract was prepared by mixing 3 × 106 cells with 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm orthovanadate).

The samples were electrophoresed at 25 mA for 50 min in a cold room. The samples in the gel were electroblotted to Immobilon membrane (Millipore) using semidry apparatus. The membrane was treated with blocking solution (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% Tween 20, 5% non-fat milk) for 20 min. Primary antibody was diluted with the blocking solution and incubated with the membrane at 4 °C for 20 h. Blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) system (Promega) or ECL+plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) after reacting with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody or peroxidase-conjugated-Protein A, respectively.RESULTSAlthough mutagenesis studies show the importance of the 2S site (13Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), its phosphorylation status was not rigorously investigated so far. To investigate this issue, we immunized a rabbit with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 380–389 of human IRF-3 in which Ser-386 was phosphorylated (Fig. 1A). To assess the specificity of the antibody (anti-p-386), a tagged IRF-3 was expressed in 293T cells and activated by infection with NDV. NDV infection resulted in the formation of IRF-3 dimer as revealed by native PAGE analysis (Fig. 1B, anti-p50 blot). Anti-p-386 selectively detected the induced dimer, and the reactivity was completely blocked by the immunogen peptide but not by unphosphorylated peptide or peptide phosphorylated at Ser-385 or at Ser-385/Ser-386, showing that anti-p-386 is specific to phosphorylation at Ser-386 (Fig. 1B, anti-p-386). We next examined the phosphorylation of endogenous IRF-3 using anti-p-386. Human glioma cell line U373/CD14 (23Shinobu N. Iwamura T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi K. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Amano F. Fujita T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was induced by NDV infection (Fig. 1C, Exp.1) or with poly(I:C) or LPS (Fig. 1C, Exp.2); the latter two stimulate TLR3 and -4, respectively. Anti-IRF-3 blot detected dimerization of endogenous IRF-3 (anti-NES) after these stimuli. Anti-p-386 selectively detected the induced dimer (anti-p-386). These results show that irrespective of different stimuli, the same residue, Ser-386, is phosphorylated in correlation with the dimerization. Next, wild type and various mutant human IRF-3 were transiently expressed in mouse L929 cells, and their virus-induced dimerization and phosphorylation at Ser-386 was examined. Wild type IRF-3 was strongly phosphorylated at Ser-386 and dimerized after virus infection. Mutants S396A and 3A behaved virtually as wild type, indicating that these residues are not critical for IRF-3 activation, whereas the mutation at 2S site totally abolished the dimerization potential of IRF-3 mutants (2A and 2D). Although the 5A mutant dimerized less efficiently than the wild type, a significant portion of this mutant was dimerized by viral induction with concomitant phosphorylation at Ser-386 (5A). We do not know the reason for the less efficient phosphorylation of the mutant. Either conformational change due to the substitution of multiple residues or involvement of these residues in phosphorylation (see “Discussion”) is a possibility. Although the 2D mutation did not result in constitutive formation of the dimer, a fraction of 5D is expressed as dimer without induction, and further induction by virus increased the dimer fraction. Interestingly, 5D was constitutively phosphorylated at Ser-386, and the phosphorylation and the dimerization were further enhanced by viral induction. The additional mutation at the 2S site abolished the constitutive and induced dimerization (2A5D). In summary, these results indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-386 is the key determinant for subsequent dimer formation.Recently Servant et al. (19Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) identified Ser-396 and -398 as minimal phosphorylation sites critical for activation, based on their observation that S396D and S396D,S398D are constitutively active. These mutants along with 5D were expressed in 293T cells and analyzed by native PAGE (Fig. 2). As expected, a majority of 5D was expressed as a dimer in unstimulated cells (anti-p50 tag). S396D,S398D and S396D, which are partially substituted at the 5ST site with Asp, resulted in the formation of a dimer, albeit less efficiently. Probing the same blot with anti-p-386 revealed that specific phosphorylation was observed exclusively on the dimer, indicating a strong correlation between the phosphorylation at Ser-386 and the dimer formation.Fig. 2Constitutive phosphorylation of the 5D and related Asp mutants at Ser-386. 5D, S396D, and S396D,S398D were transiently expressed in 293T cells. The extracts were separated by native PAGE. The membrane was first probed with anti-p-386 (lanes 4–6) and then reprobed with anti-p50 tag (lanes 1–3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recently, it was reported that the IKK family of protein kinases, IKK-i and TBK-1, function as IRF-3 kinases and are responsible for the activation (10Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 11Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a signaling adapter molecule TICAM-1/TRIF plays a critical role in the activation of IRF-3 induced by stimuli through TLR-3 and 4 (22Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 24Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). When tagged wild type IRF-3 was co-expressed with IKK-i or TBK-1 or TICAM-1/TRIF in 293T cells, an efficient dimerization of IRF-3 was observed, confirming the published results (Fig. 3A). Probing the blot with anti-p-386 showed that the kinases and the adapter induced phosphorylation at Ser-386 with concomitant formation of the dimer. These results are consistent with the result of Fig. 1B that irrespective of different trigger, the signal is integrated at IRF-3 as phosphorylation at the critical Ser-386. Furthermore, 5A is phosphorylated at Ser-386 by TBK-1 and dimerized (Fig. 3B), excluding the possibility that the induced dimerization is due to phosphorylation at the 5ST site. These results strongly suggest that TBK-1 phosphorylates the critical Ser-386, then resulting in the active dimer.Fig. 3IKK-i and TBK-1 phosphorylate IRF-3 at the Ser-386 and induce its dimerization. A, expression vector for tagged wild type IRF-3 was transiently transfected with control vector (lanes 1 and 5) or with expression vector for IKK-i (lanes 2 and 6) or for TBK-1 (lanes 3 and 7) or for TRIF (lanes 4 and 8) to 293T. The extract was separated by native PAGE and blotted. Probes are as follows: anti-p50 tag (lanes 1–4); anti-p-386 (lanes 5–8). B, expression vector for tagged IRF-3 5A (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or 2A (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) was transiently transfected with empty vector (–) or with the expression vector for TBK-1 (+) in 293T. The expressed IRF-3 was analyzed by native PAGE. Probes are as follows: anti-p50 tag (lanes 1–4); anti-p-386 (lanes 5–8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, we tested phosphorylation of Ser-396 using phospho-specific antibody used in recent reports (11Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 19Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Tagged wild type IRF-3 was expressed in 293T cells and stimulated by NDV infection or co-expression of TBK-1 (Fig. 4). Anti-tag antibody clearly detected the generation of the dimer in response to the stimuli (lanes 1–4). The Ser396P antibody exhibited a strong reactivity to the IRF-3 monomer as well as to the dimer (lanes 5–8). Because the antibody exhibited a similar reactivity to S396A (data not shown), it is likely that the antibody preparation contains a high level of antibody reactive to unphosphorylated IRF-3. Due to this undesirable reactivity, we were unable to detect the phosphorylation at Ser-396 with this antibody. Conversely, another antibody prepared by immunizing peptide phosphorylated Ser-385/386, independently prepared by Hiscott and Servant, exclusively reacted with the dimer (lanes 9–12). A blocking experiment similar to the Fig. 1B showed that this antibody is specific to phosphorylation at Ser-386 and Ser-385/Ser-386 but not Ser-385 (data not shown). Furthermore, the antibody detected constitutive phosphorylation of the 2S site in the context of 5D (data not shown).Fig. 4Analysis of IRF-3 phosphorylation by other phospho-specific antibodies. Expression vector for tagged wild type IRF-3 was transiently transfected to 293T with empty vector (lanes 1–3, 5–7, and 9–11) or with expression vector for TBK-1 (lanes 4, 8, and 12). The cells were stimulated by infecting with NDV (lanes 2, 6, and 11) or uninfected. The extracts were separated by native PAGE and blotted. The membrane was probed with anti-tag antibody (lanes 1–4) or anti-IRF-3 Ser396P (lanes 5–8) or with anti-IRF-3 S385P,S386P (lanes 9–12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe found that the Ser-386 is phosphorylated dependent on stimulation by virus infection or treatment with double-stranded RNA or LPS, using a novel phospho-specific antibody. The phosphorylation is also induced by the co-expression of either of two recently identified IRF-3 kinases, IKK-i and TBK-1. A strong correlation between the phosphorylation of Ser-386 and dimerization was observed. Moreover, the 5A mutant, in which candidate phospho-acceptor sites other than 2S are substituted with Ala, is strongly phosphorylated at Ser-386 by TBK-1 and dimerized (Fig. 3). We conclude therefore that IRF-3 is phosphorylated by signal-activated IRF-3 kinases at Ser-386, and this phosphorylation directly determines whether a dimer and subsequently a holocomplex forms. This is consistent with the results of mutagenesis (Fig. 1D) (13Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem.

Here we show that an animal, the plant-parasitic roundworm Globodera rostochiensis, can also produce a functional expansin, which it uses to loosen cell walls when invading its host plant. As this nematode is known to be able to disrupt covalent bonds in plant cell walls, its accompanying ability to loosen non-covalent bonds challenges the prevailing view that animals are genetically poorly equipped to degrade plant cell walls."
https://openalex.org/W2000685943,"The genetic imprinting of individual loci or whole chromosomes, as in imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in mammals1,2, is established and reset during gametogenesis; defects in this process in the parent can result in disease in the offspring3. We describe a sperm-specific chromatin-based imprinting of the X chromosome in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that is restricted to histone H3 modifications. The epigenetic imprint is established during spermatogenesis and its stability in the offspring is affected by the presence of a pairing partner during meiosis in the parental germ line. We observed that DNA lacking a pairing partner during meiosis, the normal situation for the X chromosome in males, is targeted for methylation of histone H3 at Lys9 (H3-Lys9) and can be silenced. Targeting unpaired DNA for silencing during meiosis, a potential hallmark of genome defense, could therefore have a conserved role in imprinted X-chromosome inactivation and, ultimately, in sex chromosome evolution."

The increase in Ang2 mRNA levels occurred by transcriptional regulation and by post-transcriptional increase in mRNA stability. Induction of Ang2 mRNA resulted in an increase of intracellular and secreted Ang2 protein levels. Since the transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in angiogenesis during hypoxia is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), it was conceivable that Ang2 expression might be regulated by the same oxygen-dependent mechanism. However, our data showed that pharmacological HIF inducers, CoCl2 and DFO, did not affect Ang2 expression. Moreover, HIF-1-deficient hepatoma cell (Hepa1 c4) and its wild-type counterpart (Hepa1 c1c4) up-regulates Ang2 during hypoxia. These results indicated that hypoxia-driven Ang2 expression may be independent of the HIF pathway. Using neutralizing VEGF antibody or pharmacological inhibitors of VEGF receptors, we showed that hypoxia-induced VEGF participates but could not account completely for Ang2 expression during hypoxia. In addition, hypoxia elicited an increase of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and a parallel increase in prostanglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) production. COX-2 inhibitors decreased the hypoxic induction of Ang2 and the hypoxic induction of PGE2 and PGI2 in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, COX-2 but not COX-1 antisense treatment decreased hypoxic induction of Ang2 expression, and this effect was reversed by exogenous PGE2. Finally, exogenous PGE2 and PGI2 were able to stimulate Ang2 under normoxic conditions.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8219-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In addition, using the papillary membrane in vivo model, Lobov et al. (4Lobov I.B. Brooks P.C. Lang R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11205-11210Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Ang2 could stimulate angiogenesis or capillary regression depending on the presence of VEGF. Like VEGF, Ang2 is also hypoxia-inducible. Its expression was found to be increased in cultured endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia (20Mandriota S.J. Pepper M.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 21Mandriota S.J. Pyke C. Di Sanza C. Quinodoz P. Pittet B. Pepper M.S. Am. J.

These observations suggest that Ang2 may be a significant mediator of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis but the mechanisms regulating its expression are not known. Some of the cellular responses to hypoxia involve the transcriptional activation of a variety of oxygen responsive genes through the action of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1). For instance, HIF-1 target genes involved in angiogenesis and vasomotor control include VEGF and its receptor Flt-1, nitric-oxide synthase-2, endothelin-1, heme oxygenase, adrenomedullin, and plasminogen activator inhitor-1 (26Cormier-Regard S.

On the other hand, increasing evidence strongly supports the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its metabolic product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as regulators of angiogenesis (35Amano H. Hayashi I. Endo H. Kitasato H. Yamashina S. Maruyama T. Kobayashi M. Satoh K. Narita M. Sugimoto Y. Murata T. Yoshimura H. Narumiya S. Majima M. J. Exp.

For instance, an in vitro model has been used to demonstrate that overexpression of COX-2 in colon cancer cells leads to increased production of angiogenic factors (e.i.VEGF, bFGF, PDGF), which, in turn, induce angiogenesis (38Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of COX-2 by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suppresses tumor growth in animal models, at least in part, by inhibiting angiogenesis (39Jones M.K. Wang H. Peskar B.M.

Edwards D.A. Flickinger A.G. Moore R.J. Seibert K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1306-1311PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that COX-2 expression is induced by hypoxia in cultured endothelial cells and this induction was not mediated by HIF-1 (41Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.S. Liu W.L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 42Xu Q. Ji Y.S. Schmedtje Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

We explored the role of HIF-1 as a transcriptional activator of Ang2. Moreover, the potential role of COX-2 as a regulator of angiogenesis prompted us to study its contribution to hypoxia-driven induction of Ang2 in endothelial cells. Reagents—SU1498 (selective inhibitor of Flk-1 kinase) and 4-[(4′-chloro-2′-fluoro)phenylamino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (inhibitor of Flt-1 and Flk-1) were obtained from Calbiochem. Recombinant human VEGF165 and neutralizing antibody directed against human VEGF were purchased from R&D Systems. Prostaglandin E2 and Prostaglandin F2α, were obtained from Calbiochem. Iloprost (stable structural analog of prostacyclin), U-46619 (thromboxane A2 receptor agonist) and SC-560 (COX-1 inhibitor) were obtained from Cayman Chemical. Actinomycin D, cobalt chloride (CoCl2), indomethacin (non-selective COX inhibitor) and desferrioxamine (DFO) were obtained from Sigma. The preferential COX-2 inhibitors, NS-398(N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitophenylmethanesulfonamide) and PTPBS (4-[5-phenyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1yl]benzenesulfonamide), were obtained from Calbiochem. Like the clinically used COX-2 inhibitor celocoxib (Celebrex), PTPBS is a sulfonamide-containing 1,5-diarylpyrazole derivative with an IC50 = 0.032 μm for COX-2 and an IC50 = 55.1 μm for COX-1 (43Penning T.D.

Rofecoxib was prepared from commercial Vioxx® tablets by organic solvent extraction and recrystallization. The purity of this compound was verified by mass spectroscopy. Endothelial Cell Culture and Hypoxia Treatment—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Clonetics and cultured in endothelial basal medium (EBM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum and growth supplements as formulated by Clonetics (hFGF, VEGF, IGF-1, hEGF, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, GA-1000 and heparin). Only passages 3–5 were used and experiments were performed on cells approaching confluence. bEnd3 cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Exposure to normoxia was performed under standard culture conditions in a humidified incubator maintained at 5%CO2/95% room air at 37 °C. For hypoxic exposure, cells were placed in a controlled environment chamber (Forma Scientific) flushed with 1% O2/5% CO2/94% N2. Before normoxic or hypoxic exposure, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added. In the case of HUVECs, fresh medium contained only 2% fetal bovine serum, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, GA-1000, and heparin. Preliminary immunoblot experiments demonstrated that basal normoxic expression of either Ang2 or COX-2 in HUVEC and bEnd3 cells did not change at 3, 6, 12, or 24 h after new medium was added (data not shown). For simplicity, when the experiments involved a time course of hypoxic exposure, the normoxic control corresponded to cells that remained with new medium for 24 h in normoxic conditions. PGE2, Iloprost, PGF2α, and U46619, COX inhibitors (indomethacin, NS-396, PTPBS, SC-560, rofecoxib), VEGF receptor inhibitors (SU1498 or VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor), neutralizing antibody directed against VEGF or vehicle were added just prior to hypoxic or normoxic exposure. Analysis of Cell Viability—Release of lactate hydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium was measured using the in vitro toxicology assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Levels of histone-associated DNA fragments were assayed using the cell death enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). Northern Blot and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with RNAgents total RNA isolation system (Promega Corp) following the manufacturer's instructions. Equal samples (10 μg/lane) of total RNA were electrophoresed in 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then UV cross-linked, prehybridized with Quickhyb solution (Stratagene) containing salmon sperm DNA and then hybridized overnight (68 °C) with random prime-labeled probes. Specific cDNA probes for VEGF, Glut-1, COX-1, COX-2, and 18 S were purchased from Research Genetics. Ang2, EPO, and β-actin cDNAs for Northern blots were generated by RT-PCR using the Access RT-PCR system kit (Promega) with the following primers: sense 5′-TCAGACCACGAGACTTGAACTTC-3′ and antisense 5′-TCAGACCACGAGACTTGAACTTC-3′ for Ang2; sense 5′-CTCTGGGCCTCCCAGTC-3′ and antisense 5′-TCATGAGGTAGTCGTTCAGGT-3′ for Epo; and sense 5′TGTTCGGAGTGGAGCAG-3′ and antisense 5′-AACCCTAAGGCCAACCGTGAA-3′ for β-actin. Labeling of the probe was performed using [32P]dCTP and a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The blots were washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, once with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and analyzed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For detection of both Ang2 and Ang2443 mRNA, RT-PCR was performed with the following primers: sense 5′-AGCTGTGATCTTGTCTTGGC-3′ and antisense 5′-GTTCAAGTCTCGTGGTCTGA-3′. The amplified products were eluted, and their identity confirmed by sequencing. Nuclear Run-on Transcription Analysis—Nuclei isolation from HUVECs and run-on transcription analysis were carried out as described by Greenberg et al. (44Greenberg M.E. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 26. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 10.1-10.11Google Scholar) with few modifications. Briefly, nuclei suspension was mixed with equal volume of 2× reaction medium (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, ATP, GTP, CTP (1 mm each one), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 120 units of RNase inhibitor, 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with the addition of DNase I (140 units) for 5 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, 10 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and 100 μl of SDS/Tris buffer (5%SDS, 0.5m Tris-Cl, 0.12 m EDTA) were added and the mixture incubated for 30 min at 42 °C. Radioactively labeled RNAs were extracted with RNAgents total RNA isolation system (Promega Corp) and hybridized to cDNAs (5 μg) immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. Ang2 and β-actin cDNA slot blotting to nitrocellulose was performed with the Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration Apparatus (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization was performed with 1–3 × 106 cpm of nascent RNA and Quickhyb solution (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. This experiment was repeated three separate times and quantification was performed using a PhosphorImager system. Measurement of RNA Stability—Cells were grown under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. Thereafter, actinomycin D (ActD, 5 μg/ml) was added and incubation continued under the same conditions. Cells were harvested for RNA isolation at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 h after the addition of ActD. Total RNA was prepared using RNAqueous (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Ang2 and 18 S rRNA were detected by Northern blot analysis as described above. Quantification was performed by using a PhosphorImager system. The half-life of Ang2 mRNA was calculated by using the log-linear plot of percentage of remaining Ang2 mRNA levels versus time. This experiment was repeated three separate times. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (Bio-Rad). Samples (30 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on 7.5% or 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by standard procedures. Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk and were incubated with either anti Ang2 (R&D Systems), VEGF (R&D Systems), HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals), COX-1(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or COX-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. After washing, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham). Ang2 and VEGF were identified as single bands of about 68 kDa and 23kDa, respectively, which are consistent with published sizes. HIF-1α migrated with a characteristic diffuse pattern (∼120 kDa). Recombinant human Ang2 (R&D systems) was used as positive control for Ang 2 immunoblot. Crude nuclear extracts of Hep3B cells (ATTC, CRL-1830) exposed to 1 or 21% oxygen were used as positive controls (30 μg of protein) in HIF-1α Western blot analysis. Lysates from macrophages treated with LPS/IFNg (Transduction Laboratories) were used for positive control for COX. ELISA and Prostanoids Measurement—The secreted Ang2 and VEGF protein levels were measured in cell culture supernatants by sandwich ELISA using the reagents and the protocol supplied with the Human VEGF and Ang2 DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems). PGE2, PGF2α, 6-keto-PGF1α, and TXB2 (the stable hydrolysis products of PGI2 and TXA2, respectively) were determined in the cultured cell supernatants using commercial immunoassay kits (R&D systems). Prostanoids results were expressed as either pg/ml of media or pg/mg of protein. Protein concentration in the cell culture dish was measured after washing with phosphate-buffered saline and extracting with 0.62 m NaOH. Antisense Oligonucleotide Treatment—The phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides for COX-1 and COX-2 used here were identical to the ones previously used by Tsujii et al. with HUVECs (38Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). These sequences were as follows: COX-1 antisense: 5′-AGAACCGGAGCAAGA and COX-2 antisense: 5′-GGAAACATCGACAGT-3′. Corresponding sense oligonucleotides were used as controls. HUVECs were transfected with either sense or antisense oligonucleotide (0.5 μm) with LipofectAMINE transfection reagent for 4 h according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Twelve hours after transfection, treated cells were exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for 24 h, and then cells were lysed for immunoblot analysis. COX Enzyme Analysis—COX activity was analyzed in HUVECs cell lysates using the COX activity assay kit from Cayman Chemical following the manufacturer instructions. This colorimetric assay measures the peroxidase activity of the enzyme using N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) as the reducing co-substrate. COX activity was expressed as the rate of oxidation of TMPD in nmol/min/mg protein. This kit includes purified ovine COX-1 as positive control and the inhibitors SC-560 (COX-1 inhibitor) and DuP-697 (COX-2 inhibitor). Purified COX-1 activity was inhibited by SC-560 but not by DuP-697. Statistical Analysis—All results are shown as means ± S.D., and p < 0.05 was selected as the statistically significant value. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 11.5 software. Analysis of variance with Tukey correction was employed for the statistical comparisons among groups. Student's t test was employed to assess differences between the two groups. Hypoxia Increases Ang2 mRNA in Endothelial Cells—Subconfluent HUVEC cultures were exposed to hypoxia (1%O2) for different time periods and Ang2 mRNA analyzed by Northern blot. Our results showed basal low Ang2 mRNA levels in normoxic cells that increased with hypoxia (Fig. 1A). This up-regulation was evident at 6 h and continued to increase at 24 h. We also performed RT-PCR analysis in HUVEC to assess the differential response of Ang2 splicing isoforms to hypoxia. Although three human Ang2 mRNA isoforms have been described (45Kim I. Kim J.H.

Francone V. Vilagrasa X. Mezquita C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the primers used in this study only recognized the Ang2 and Ang2443 isoforms (also known as Ang2A and Ang2C, respectively). RT-PCR analysis showed higher basal levels of Ang2 than Ang2443 at normoxic conditions. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in an increase of both Ang2 and Ang2443 mRNA, which was observed at 3–24 h of hypoxic exposure (Fig. 1B). The identities of these RT-PCR products were confirmed by sequence analysis. bEnd3 cells, a mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell line, also displayed time-dependent induction of Ang2 mRNA level in response to hypoxia (Fig. 1C). Only one mouse Ang2 isoform has been reported so far. Analysis of cell viability of HUVEC and bEnd3 cells exposed to 1% O2 for 24 h was assessed by measuring levels of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments and extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity. In agreement with previous observations (47Stempien-Otero A. Karsan A. Cornejo C.J. Xiang H. Eunson T. Morrison R.S. Kay M. Winn R. Harlan J. J. Biol.

Effect of Hypoxia on Ang2 mRNA Transcription and Stability—Induction of Ang2 mRNA expression during hypoxia could result from an increased gene transcription, increased mRNA stability, or both. To investigate the effect of hypoxia on Ang2 transcription rate, we performed nuclear run-on experiments using HUVECs exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, normoxic cells presented basal Ang2 transcriptional activity. Hypoxia increased the rate of transcription of Ang2 more than 3-fold (3.19 ± 0.4, n = 3; p <"

An exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) are both located within the regulatory element. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A/B proteins bind the ESS to repress splicing, whereas the SR protein SC35 binds the ESE to activate it.

The study of HIV-1 splicing gives us helpful insights into the general mechanisms regulating the alternative splicing of cellular and viral messages. HIV-1 utilizes the cellular splicing machinery to properly regulate production of its primary transcripts through at least four alternative 5′ splice sites (ss) and eight alternative 3′ ss.Several of the HIV-1 viral sequences that regulate splicing have been characterized. These include suboptimal 3′ ss sequences characterized by weak polypyrimidine tracts, non-consensus branch points (6O'Reilly M.M. McNally M.T. Beemon K.L.

These regulatory sequences often bind trans-acting factors that interact with the basal splicing machinery. The factors that have been characterized as binding to HIV-1 regulatory elements belong to either the arginine-serine-rich (SR) protein family (25Graveley B.R. RNA (N.Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) or the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family (26Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). SR proteins mainly participate in positive regulation of splicing, whereas members of the hnRNP family are often involved in negative regulation. However, proteins from both families have been implicated in positive as well as negative splicing regulation (26Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 27Graveley B.R. Hertel K.J. Maniatis T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R6-R7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which ESEs, ESS, and the factors they bind modulate splicing are still elusive.The binding properties of hnRNP A1 to different nucleic acid substrates have been thoroughly investigated (26Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Although a minimal recognition sequence (UAGG) has been found (28Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 29Ding J. Hayashi M.K. Zhang Y. Manche L. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1102-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), it has become evident that hnRNP A1 interacts with a broad range of RNA substrates. Similarly, SR proteins have a range of preferential binding sequences (25Graveley B.R. RNA (N.Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). SELEX experiments and functional studies have characterized consensus binding sequences for several SR proteins (30Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 31Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 32Cavaloc Y.

Nevertheless, a fine mapping of the precise site of interactions between SR proteins and their target ESEs has rarely been carried out (33Nagel R.J. Lancaster A.M. Zahler A.M. RNA (N.Y.). 1998; 4: 11-23PubMed Google Scholar).Five splicing inhibitory sequences in the HIV-1 pre-mRNA have been identified. ESS2 and ESS2p are located within tat exon 2 (3Amendt B.A. Hesslein D.

Valcarcel J. Kjems J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5748-15758Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In a previous study we showed that hnRNPs of the A/B family bind ESS2 to repress splicing of the upstream intron (34Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Similar studies have extended these results to the ESS3, ESSV, and ISS elements (13Tange T.O. Damgaard C.K. Guth S.

ESS2p has been shown to be a binding site for hnRNP H, and this binding is thought to be important for inhibition of usage of the upstream 3′ splice site (14Jacquenet S. Mereau A. Bilodeau P.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40464-40475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).ESE sequences that bind SR proteins and promote the usage of both 3′ and 5′ splice sites have been found in tat exons 2 and 3 (10Staffa A.

RNA (N.Y.). 2001; 7: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Proper splicing of the intron upstream tat exon 3 is regulated by a combination of the ESS binding hnRNP A/B proteins and ESEs binding the SR proteins SC35 and SF2/ASF (13Tange T.O. Damgaard C.K. Guth S. Valcarcel J. Kjems J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5748-15758Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Zhu J. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 118: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar). hnRNP A1 appears to bind cooperatively to the ESS3, a UAGNNAUG motif in the ESE, and to an ISS that overlaps with the branch point (17Damgaard C.K. Tange T.O. Kjems J. RNA (N.Y.). 2002; 8: 1401-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Marchand V. Mereau A. Jacquenet S. Thomas D. Mougin A. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Branlant C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This may in turn block U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) from binding to the branch point and prevent positive splicing factors from binding to the ESE (13Tange T.O. Damgaard C.K. Guth S. Valcarcel J. Kjems J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5748-15758Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Zhu J. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Binding of SF2/ASF to the ESE located upstream of ESS3 appears to interfere with binding of hnRNP A1 to the transcript, thus activating splicing (13Tange T.O. Damgaard C.K. Guth S. Valcarcel J. Kjems J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5748-15758Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Zhu J. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).The alternative 3′ splice sites necessary for the generation of the tat, rev, env, vpu, and nef gene products are located within tat exon 2 (see Figs. 1A and 6A). The characterization of the viral sequences and cellular proteins involved in this complex splicing regulatory system is essential for our understanding of the viral replication process. In particular, repression of the tat-specific 3′ splice site 4 is key for the production of rev, env, vpu, and nef gene products. Our previous functional characterization of ESS2 and its interacting factors, the hnRNP A/B proteins, demonstrated that these factors are essential for ESS2 function without giving us a clear understanding of the mechanism by which these factors repress splicing of the upstream intron (34Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the exact viral sequences that interact with hnRNP A/B proteins. Because ESS elements are often associated with ESE sequences (10Staffa A. Cochrane A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Caputi M. Casari G. Guenzi S. Tagliabue R. Sidoli A. Melo C.A. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1018-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that an SR protein-dependent ESE is localized in close proximity to ESS2. Utilizing biochemical and functional assays, we describe a novel SC35-dependent ESE that overlaps an hnRNP A1 binding site. We propose a model for HIV-1 splicing inhibition in which SC35 and hnRNP A/B proteins compete for binding the same viral sequences regulating the splicing of an upstream intron.Fig. 6A, schematic model of the inhibitory effect on SC35 recruitment exerted by hnRNP A/B protein binding to ESS2 (left panel). Mutation of the ESS or depletion of hnRNP A/B allows efficient binding of SC35 to the ESE2 (right panel).

SR proteins were prepared from HeLa cells and calf thymus as described previously (37Zahler A.M. Methods Mol.

Immunoblots were stained using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detected using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Pierce).Nuclear Extract Depletion/Reconstitution Assay—Two consecutive rounds of hnRNP A/B protein depletion were performed using an RNA containing five high affinity hnRNP A1 binding sites as previously published (34Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). 650 μl of splicing reaction mixture containing 250 μl of nuclear extract, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, and 5 mm creatine phosphate in buffer D (20 μm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 m EDTA, 0.5 m dithiothreitol) was incubated two consecutive times with the RNA-bound beads to deplete >95% of hnRNP A/B proteins.Substrate RNA Synthesis, Immobilization of RNA on Agarose Beads, and RNA Affinity Chromatography Assays—Substrate RNAs for bead immobilization were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and DNA oligonucleotide templates.Substrate RNA synthesis from oligonucleotides, covalent linkage to adipic acid dihydrazide-agarose beads, and RNA affinity chromatography assays were performed as described previously (34Caputi M.

Lane 5 contains 10 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract. The ESS2/ESE2 Mut substrate carries mutations in both the ESS2 and ESE2 sequences, whereas the ΔESE2 substrate carries a 10-nucleotide deletion just upstream of ESS2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RNA Footprinting Analysis—RNA footprinting was essentially done as described previously (17Damgaard C.K. Tange T.O. Kjems J. RNA (N.Y.). 2002; 8: 1401-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 9 μl containing 42 ng of 5′ end-labeled tat exon 2 RNA and 1 μg of rRNA in probing buffer (10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol, v/v) were incubated with either 1 μl of buffer D or increasing amounts of either recombinant GST-hnRNP A1 (150 or 300 ng) or purified SC35 (30, 100, or 250 ng) at room temperature for 15 min. Each sample was treated with either 1 μl of double-distilled H2O (negative control) or 0.5 μl of RNase T1 (5 units/ml), 0.5 μl of RNase T2 (2 units/ml), or 0.5 μl of RNase V1 (5 units/ml). One reaction without RNase was included as a control for nonspecific background. After incubation for 15 min on ice, reactions were terminated by adding 180 μl of 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and 2 mm EDTA, and reactions were phenol-extracted twice and the RNA was precipitated. The RNA pellets were re-dissolved in 10 μl of 95% formamide-loading buffer and analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Markers were generated as described previously (17Damgaard C.K. Tange T.O. Kjems J. RNA (N.Y.). 2002; 8: 1401-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).RESULTSESS2 Inhibits Binding of SC35 to the Viral Substrate—To determine whether ESS2 functions like other ESS as a modulator of an SR protein-dependent ESE, we utilized an RNA affinity chromatography assay to determine the effects of ESS2 mutation on SR protein recruitment to the exon. Short RNA substrates (Fig. 1A) were covalently linked to agarose beads and incubated in HeLa cell nuclear extract. Proteins that bound specifically to the beads were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies specific for hnRNP A1, SF2/ASF, SC35, and all the SR proteins (mAb 1O4) (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the proteins bound to the wild type substrate (ESS2 WT, Fig. 1B, lane 1) showed that no SR protein can bind specifically to the substrate, as demonstrated by comparison to a random control RNA sequence (RNA Cont, Fig. 1B, lane 3). Analysis of the proteins bound by the ESS2 mutant substrate showed an overall increase in SR protein binding. In particular an SR protein of 30 kDa was predominantly bound to the ESS2 mutant substrate. Because the mAb 1O4 recognizes the phosphoserine/arginine domain of SR protein family members, and SC35, SF2, and 9G8 have similar gel mobility, we utilized SC35, SF2/ASF, and 9G8-specific antibodies to determine which of these SR proteins is the main 30-kDa SR protein that binds to the mutant ESS2 substrate. From this analysis we determined that SC35 specifically binds to the ESS2 mutant substrate (Fig. 1B, lane 2). hnRNP A1 binds efficiently to the wild type substrate but not the ESS2 mutated or the control RNA sequence. Because recruitment of the SC35 is dependent on the ESS2 mutation, it is possible that the mutation introduced into ESS2 introduced a new SC35 binding site. However, different nucleotide substitutions in the ESS2 activate tat exon 2 splicing with equal efficiency (7Si Z.H. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and we have tested several of these in an RNA affinity chromatography assay similar to that shown in Fig. 1B. All that we tested promoted SC35 recruitment (data not shown).hnRNP A1 Inhibits Binding of SC35 to the ESE2—Based on the increased ability of SC35 to bind to the tat exon 2 substrate when ESS2 is mutated, we hypothesized that the function of hnRNP A1 binding to this ESS is to inhibit binding of SC35 to the exon. If this is the case, then it is predicted that SC35 binding to the wild type substrate should be increased by depletion of hnRNP A/B proteins from the nuclear extract. We have previously shown that all the members of the hnRNP A/B protein family (A1, A1b, A2, and B1) share common activities and binding specificities for ESS2 (34Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test if hnRNP A/B proteins are important for inhibiting SC35 recruitment to tat exon 2, nuclear extract must be functionally depleted of all hnRNP A/B proteins. To generate an hnRNP A/B protein-depleted extract, we incubated HeLa cell nuclear extract with beads linked to RNA whose sequence contains several high affinity binding sites for hnRNP A/B proteins in tandem. After two consecutive incubations of the extract with these beads, >95% of hnRNP A/B proteins were removed from the extract (Fig. 2, compare nuclear extract samples in lanes 1 versus 2). Using untreated, hnRNP A/B protein-depleted and mock-depleted extracts, we tested the ability of SC35 and hnRNP A1 to bind to RNA substrates from tat exon 2 containing wild type sequence or a mutation in ESS2 (Fig. 2). Depletion of hnRNP A/B proteins from HeLa nuclear extract resulted in a dramatic increase in SC35 binding to the wild type substrate (Fig. 2, ESS2 WT, lanes 4 and 5), whereas no change in the ability of SC35 to bind to the ESS2 Mut substrate was detected. This is consistent with a model in which binding of hnRNP A/B proteins to ESS2 results in a block in SC35 association with tat exon 2. This blockage can be reversed by mutating ESS2 so that it no longer binds hnRNP A/B proteins or by depleting hnRNP A/B proteins from the extract.Fig. 2Analysis of SC35 and hnRNP A1 proteins bound to the tat exon 2 substrate RNAs. The tat exon 2 substrates ESS2 WT and ESS2 Mut (schematically represented in Fig. 1A) were covalently linked to agarose beads and incubated in untreated (lanes 1 and 4), hnRNP A/B protein-depleted (lanes 2 and 5), and mock-depleted (lane 3 and 6) HeLa cell nuclear extracts (NE). Proteins bound to the substrates were eluted and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for hnRNP A1 (lanes 1–3) and SC35 (lanes 4–6) proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2286633221,"The most massive galaxies and the richest clusters are believed to have emerged from regions with the largest enhancements of mass density relative to the surrounding space. Distant radio galaxies may pinpoint the locations of the ancestors of rich clusters, because they are massive systems associated with 'overdensities' of galaxies that are bright in the Lyman-alpha line of hydrogen. A powerful technique for detecting high-redshift galaxies is to search for the characteristic 'Lyman break' feature in the galaxy colour, at wavelengths just shortwards of Lyalpha, which is due to absorption of radiation from the galaxy by the intervening intergalactic medium. Here we report multicolour imaging of the most distant candidate protocluster, TN J1338-1942 at a redshift z approximately 4.1. We find a large number of objects with the characteristic colours of galaxies at that redshift, and we show that this excess is concentrated around the targeted dominant radio galaxy. Our data therefore indicate that TN J1338-1942 is indeed the most distant cluster progenitor of a rich local cluster, and that galaxy clusters began forming when the Universe was only ten per cent of its present age."

However, the mechanism by which Rap1 is activated remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 plays a critical role in the signaling pathway leading to Rap1 activation triggered by the TCR. In Jurkat T cells, TCR cross-linking triggered persistent Rap1 activation, and SDF-1 (CXCL12) activated Rap1 transiently. A phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122, abrogated Rap1 activation triggered by both the TCR and SDF-1 (CXCL12). PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat T cells showed a marked reduction of TCR-triggered Rap1 activation and adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mediated by LFA-1. In contrast, SDF-1-triggered Rap1 activation and adhesion were not affected in these cells. Transfection of these cells with an expression plasmid encoding PLC-γ1 restored Rap1 activation by the TCR and the ability to adhere to ICAM-1, accompanied by polarized LFA-1 surface clustering colocalized with regulator of adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues (RAPL).

Rap1 is activated by a number of external stimuli, including antigens and chemokines, and plays a pivotal role in mediating “inside-out signals” to activate integrins. Rap1 activation by TCR regulates the strength of the LFA-1/ICAM-1-mediated interaction between the T cell and antigen-presenting cells, which has decisive effects on the T cell response to antigen (4Sebzda E.

Rapid Rap1 activation in chemokine-stimulated lymphocytes induces lymphocyte polarization, attachment to endothelial cells, and motility across endothelial barriers under flow (8Shimonaka M.

Thus, lymphocyte Rap1 is the key modulator of T cell activation and trafficking.Rap1 cycles between an active, GTP-bound form and an inactive, GDP-bound form. The GDP-GTP cycle is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (9Stork P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound, active form of Rap1 is thought to exert its biological effects. Recently, we have identified a novel Rap1-binding molecule, RAPL, that is an essential regulator in LFA-1 activation and operates via spatial regulation of LFA-1 distribution (10Katagiri K. Maeda A. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways by which the TCR and chemokine receptors increase GTP-bound Rap1 have not been defined. GEFs promote the dissociation of GDP from Rap1, thereby allowing its association with GTP. Rap1 activation has been shown to be mediated by GEFs, such as C3G, CalDAG-GEF, and Epac, which respond to specific intracellular signals (1Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 9Stork P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In T cells, C3G has been shown to form a complex with Cbl via CrkL upon TCR stimulation (11Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This tertiary complex was formed constitutively in anergic T cells, in which Rap1-GTP also accumulated (11Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This study suggests that the Cbl-CrkL-C3G pathway regulates Rap1 activation triggered by the TCR. On the other hand, PLC-γ2 has been shown to be critical for Rap1 activation in chicken DT 40 B cells, as PLC-γ2-deficient DT 40 B cells were found to be defective in Rap1 activation by BCR. Notably, PLC-γ2 deficiency did not affect a BCR-triggered Cbl-CrkL-C3G association, suggesting a dominant role of PLC-γ2 in regulating Rap1 in B cells (12McLeod S.J. Ingham R.J. Bos J.L. Kurosaki T.

To date, it is unclear whether PLC-γ1, the major isotype of PLC-γ in T cells, could contribute to TCR-triggered Rap1 activation and also play a critical role in regulating integrin-mediated adhesion. Here, we report that PLC-γ1 plays a major role in Rap1 activation by TCR, resulting in LFA-1 activation. We further demonstrate that Rap1 is associated with CalDAG-GEFI and augments LFA-1-mediated adhesion upon TCR cross-linking.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Anti-Rap1 (Transduction Laboratory), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-PLC-γ1 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-T7 (Novagen), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling) were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Anti-human LFA-1 (TS2/4) (American Type Culture Collection) conjugated with AlexaFluor 546 (Molecular Probes) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human CD44 (G44-20)(Pharmingen) were used for immunostaining.Cell Culture and Transfection—Jurkat T cells and PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained as described previously (14Irvin B.J. Williams B.L. Nilson A.E. Maynor H.O. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected by electroporation with FLAG-tagged PLC-γ1 (kindly donated by P-G. Suh, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Korea) and pEFpuro vector, CalDAG-GEFI (provided by M. Matsuda, Osaka University), pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector (Invitrogen), and T7-tagged Rap1 and Rap1V12 cDNAs, as described previously (2Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) or 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin B (Wako). T cells were purified from mouse lymph nodes with MidiMACS (Mitenyl Biotech) using CD90 (Pharmingen). These T cells were stimulated with anti-TCR antibodies (OKT3 or 2C11) or SDF-1 (R & D Systems) for the indicated time.Pull-down Assays—Jurkat cells or LN T cells suspended at 2 × 107/ml in RPMI 1640 were stimulated with anti-TCR antibody or 100 nm SDF-1 at 37 °C for the indicated times. After stimulation, cells were resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 containing lysis buffer (2Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Active, GTP-bound Rap1 was measured using a GST-RalGDS-RBD fusion protein, as described previously (15Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).Cell Adhesion Assay—Adhesion assays were performed as described previously (16Kinashi T. Katagiri K. Watanabe S.

Following blocking in 1% BSA, cells were labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethl)-5 (and -6) carbofluorescein (Molecular Probes) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 5% fetal calf serum. Labeled cells were transferred to coated plates in the presence of OKT3 (2 μg/ml), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (10 ng/ml), or no stimulus, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Non-adherent cells were removed by 4 consecutive washes. Input and bound cells were measured in the 96-well plate using a fluorescence multiwell plate reader (Cytofluor4000, Applied Biosystems). SDF-1-induced adhesion to ICAM-1 was measured at 37 °C in a parallel-plate flow chamber (FCS2 system, Bioptechs), as described previously (8Shimonaka M. Katagiri K. Nakayama T. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Yoshie O. Kinashi T. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Recombinant human ICAM-1 IgG1Fc was coated on polystyrene disks, which were then blocked with 1% BSA. The flow chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted confocal laser microscope (LSM510, Zeiss). Cells suspended in 500 μl of Lefkovitz L15 medium (Invitrogen), containing 0.5% BSA, were loaded with or without SDF-1 (100 nm, R & D Systems) and incubated before shear stress was applied at 2 dyne/cm2. Phase-contrast images were recorded. Cell numbers were determined using ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics).Immunofluorescent Staining—T cells, unstimulated or stimulated with OKT3, for 20 min were fixed in suspension with 3.3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides and blocked with 10% goat serum for 20 min. For double staining of LFA-1 and CD44, fixed cells were directly stained with AlexaFluor 546-labeled TS2/4 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled CD44. For double staining of LFA-1 and RAPL, fixed cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were stained with antibody to RAPL (E11.2) (10Katagiri K. Maeda A. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) followed by AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat antibody to rat IgG. LFA-1 was then detected with AlexaFluor 546-conjugated TS2/4. Cells were incubated with each antibody for 1 h. Unbound antibodies were removed by five washes with PBS, 0.1% BSA. Stained cells were observed by confocal microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Transfected cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, 1 m Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation, the cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. Precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose 4B. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting as described previously (2Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).Detection of CalDAG-GEFI Expression by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—CalDAG-GEFI expression was detected by RT-PCR from mRNA isolated from Jurkat cells. Two sets of primers were designed based on the human CalDAG-GEFI sequence (GenBank™ accession number NP005816) to amplify the fragments specific for CalDAG-GEFI by 5′-1596-GATAACTTACTTCCTGAGAGC-3′ and 5′-2046-CCAGCCTCTGACCAGG-3′ (primer set 1) or by 5′-1537-GTTACAGGCTCTTCGCAAG-3′ and 5′-1967-ATTGCCTTCAGTTTCCGCAGC-3′ (primer set 2). The PCR products were cloned into a TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing.RESULTSThe Effects of Signal Inhibitors on Rap1 Activation by TCR and SDF-1—To explore the signal transduction pathways leading to Rap1 activation triggered by TCR and chemokines, we measured active Rap1-GTP using GST-RalGDS-RBD, which binds specifically to Rap1-GTP (15Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Both TCR cross-linking and SDF-1 induced strong Rap1 activation in Jurkat T cells. TCR-triggered Rap1 activation persisted for as long as 30 min. In contrast, SDF-1 induced a transient Rap1 activation, which peaked at 0.5 min and diminished rapidly thereafter (Fig. 1A). The kinetics of Rap1 activation in Jurkat T cells are similar to those in primary lymphocytes (8Shimonaka M. Katagiri K. Nakayama T. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Yoshie O. Kinashi T. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Medium alone did not activate Rap1 in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that Rap1 activation was specific for TCR and SDF-1 stimulation and not due to the mixing in the tube (18de Bruyn K.M. Zwartkruis F.J. de Rooij J. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22412-22417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To identify the signaling pathway that couples TCR to Rap1 activation, Jurkat T cells were treated with specific signal inhibitors and then stimulated for Rap1 activation. As shown in Fig. 1B, Rap1 activation by TCR or SDF-1 was completely inhibited by the PLC inhibitor, U73122. The inactive analog, U73343, did not affect Rap1 activation (Fig. 1B). U73122 also inhibited Rap1 activation in primary mouse T cells (Fig. 1C). A calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, did not block Rap1 activation at all (Fig. 1B). PP1, a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abolished TCR-induced Rap1 activation, but did not affect SDF-1-induced activation (Fig. 1B), demonstrating contrasting requirements for Src family protein-tyrosine kinases in Rap1 activation triggered by TCR and SDF-1.Activation of Rap1 by the TCR Requires PLC-γ1—Because the inhibitor experiment suggested that protein-tyrosine kinase-dependent PLC activity is critical for TCR-mediated Rap1 activation, we examined the involvement of PLC-γ1 using a mutant Jurkat cell line, in which there is no expression of PLC-γ1 (14Irvin B.J. Williams B.L. Nilson A.E. Maynor H.O. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Because these cells do not express PLC-γ2, they are unable to produce IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to TCR engagement, resulting in defective calcium influx and IL-2 production (14Irvin B.J. Williams B.L. Nilson A.E. Maynor H.O. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found that TCR-induced activation of Rap1 was markedly reduced in the PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2B, left). In contrast, SDF-1-induced Rap1 activation was normal, ruling out the possibility that Rap1 itself is defective in the mutant cells (Fig. 2B, right). To further confirm the role of PLC-γ1 in Rap1 activation by the TCR, we conducted rescue experiments to restore PLC-γ1 expression. FLAG-tagged PLC-γ1 was introduced into the mutant cells at a level similar to that in wild-type cells (Fig. 2A). The expression of PLC-γ1 resulted in almost fully restored Rap1 activation by the TCR (Fig. 2B, left), while introduction of PLC-γ1 did not affect the level of Rap1-GTP when stimulated with SDF-1 (Fig. 2B, right). These results demonstrated the critical involvement of PLC-γ1 in Rap1 activation triggered by TCR engagement, but not SDF-1.Fig. 2Dependence of Rap1 activation on PLC-γ1 following TCR ligation. A, FLAG-tagged PLC-γ1 or empty vector was transfected into PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells. The amounts of PLC-γ1 were detected by Western blotting with anti-PLC-γ1-specific antibody. B, wild-type, or PLC-γ1-deficient cells transfected with vector alone (+vector) or PLC-γ1 (+PLC-γ1), were stimulated with OKT3 or SDF-1 for 10 min or 30 s, respectively, and analyzed for Rap1 activation as in Fig. 1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PLC-γ1 Regulates LFA-1/ICAM-1-mediated Adhesion—Because Rap1 mediates inside-out signaling from TCR to activate LFA-1 binding of ICAM-1 (6Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we examined whether PLC-γ1 deficiency could impair LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1. As shown in Fig. 3A, TCR stimulation did not induce ICAM-1 adhesion in PLC-γ1-deficient cells. The expression of LFA-1 in the PLC-γ1-deficient cells was similar to that in wild-type cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown). In contrast, PMA stimulated adhesion of PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells, which was comparable with that of the wild type. This result rules out the possibility that the adhesion defect is due to defects downstream of PLC-γ1. The re-expression of PLC-γ1 in the mutant cells restored TCR-induced LFA-1 adhesive activity to ICAM-1 at a level similar to that in wild-type cells, indicating that PLC-γ1 deficiency impaired TCR-triggered adhesion. Importantly, SDF-1-triggered adhesion to ICAM-1 in PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells was comparable with that of the wild-type and was not changed significantly by introducing PLC-γ1 (Fig. 3B). This result is consistent with the result that showed that Rap1 activation occurred normally upon SDF-1 treatment in PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 2B). Therefore, these results indicate that Rap1 activation by PLC-γ1 is crucial in adhesion by TCR. In addition, the involvement of PLC-γ1 downstream of Rap1 is unlikely, because Rap1V12 induced spontaneous adhesion of PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells, comparable with that of wild type cells (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3PLC-γ1 is critical for Rap1-dependent LFA-1 activation. A, PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells were transfected with the empty vector or PLC-γ1. These cells were stimulated with OKT3 or PMA (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C on human ICAM-1-Ig-coated plates and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average and S.E. values of triplicate experiments are shown. *, p < 0.01, compared with wild-type cells stimulated with TCR.

C, adhesion to ICAM-1 of Rap1V12-expressing wild-type and PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells. Rap1V12 expression was similar in wild-type and mutant cells.

The scale bar shows 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined whether the redistribution of RAPL depended on PLC-γ1, because RAPL is the Rap1 effector molecule critical for Rap1-mediated adhesion, and RAPL associates with LFA-1 and relocates LFA-1 to the leading edge upon Rap1 activation (10Katagiri K. Maeda A. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). We compared the distribution of LFA-1 and RAPL in adhesion-defective, PLC-γ1-deficient Jurkat cells with cells reconstituted with PLC-γ1. TCR engagement has been found to induce a patch-like distribution of LFA-1 at the leading edge, and CD44 to a uropod, and RAPL colocalized with the patches of LFA-1 (10Katagiri K. Maeda A. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In PLC-γ1 deficient Jurkat cells, the uniform distribution of LFA-1 and CD44 on the cell surface was not changed significantly upon TCR engagement (Fig. 3D), as seen in unstimulated wild-type cells (data not shown). In contrast, the introduction of PLC-γ1 induced segregation of LFA-1 and CD44 at opposite sides upon TCR engagement. RAPL colocalized with polarized surface LFA-1. This result is consistent with the results in an earlier report (10Katagiri K. Maeda A. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), showing colocalization of LFA-1 and RAPL at the leading edge is critical for LFA-1 activation. These further results demonstrated that PLC-γ1 was indispensable for the redistribution of LFA-1 and RAPL and support the notion that PLC-γ1 deficiency results in defective Rap1 activation, which in turn impairs spatial regulation of LFA-1 distribution mediated by RAPL.CalDAG-GEFI Enhances TCR-induced Rap1 Activation and Adhesion—Because PLC-γ1 generates IP3 and DAG, the Rap1 GEF family, having Ca2+ and DAG binding domains, is likely to be involved in Rap1 activation downstream of PLC-γ1. To explore this possibility, we examined whether CalDAG-GEFI, which is exclusively expressed in the hematopoietic system, the immune system, and the brain (19Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), could be involved in Rap1 activation triggered by TCR. CalDAG-GEFI mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4A). FLAG-tagged CalDAG-GEFI was overexpressed in wild-type Jurkat cells (Fig. 4B), and the effects on Rap1 activation by TCR were examined. As shown in Fig. 4C, Rap1 activation following TCR engagement was increased ∼2-fold in CalDAG-GEF I-expressing cells, compared with the level of activation in control cells. Consistently, the introduction of CalDAG-GEFI into Jurkat cells resulted in significantly more adhesion to ICAM-1 than was observed in parent cells upon TCR engagement (Fig. 4D). The treatment by U73122, but not control U73343, inhibited TCR-stimulated adhesion. Thus, forced expression of CalDAG-GEFI enhanced TCR-induced endogenous Rap1 activation and adhesion to ICAM-1. In addition, we found that CalDAG-GEFI could associate with Rap1. As shown in Fig. 4E, when introduced into Jurkat cells, T7-tagged Rap1 and FLAG-tagged CalDAG-GEFI coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified an association with either anti-T7 or anti-FLAG antibody. Furthermore, this association was augmented upon TCR engagement. However, this coimmunoprecipitation was not detected with control mouse IgG and not with either anti-T7 or anti-FLAG antibodies using each of the single transfectants (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data indicate that CalDAG-GEFI could be physically and functionally linked with TCR-triggered Rap1 activation.Fig. 4Involvement of CalDAG-GEFI in Rap1 activation by the TCR.

The proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-T7 or anti-FLAG antibody, control mouse IgG (Ig), and detected with anti-FLAG or anti-T7 antibody, respectively (upper).

Our results have demonstrated that PLC-γ1 plays an essential role in Rap1 activation by the TCR but not in activation by SDF-1. The inability to activate Rap1 due to PLC γ1-deficiency resulted in the failure of TCR-triggered adhesion to ICAM-1. However, little effect on SDF-1-induced adhesion was observed. Our results further suggest that CalDAG-GEFI could be an important Rap1 exchange factor downstream of PLC-γ1 activity triggered by TCR.Using variant Jurkat cells, we have demonstrated that PLC-γ1 was required for Rap1 activation and LFA-1-mediated adhesion upon TCR engagement. The defective Rap1 activation was associated with a downstream failure in polarized redistribution"
https://openalex.org/W2029915881,"Nearly a century after the true nature of galaxies as distant 'island universes' was established, their origin and evolution remain great unsolved problems of modern astrophysics. One of the most promising ways to investigate galaxy formation is to study the ubiquitous globular star clusters that surround most galaxies. Globular clusters are compact groups of up to a few million stars. They generally formed early in the history of the Universe, but have survived the interactions and mergers that alter substantially their parent galaxies. Recent advances in our understanding of the globular cluster systems of the Milky Way and other galaxies point to a complex picture of galaxy genesis driven by cannibalism, collisions, bursts of star formation and other tumultuous events."
https://openalex.org/W2041378699,"Tripeptidyl-peptidase I (TPP I) is a lysosomal serine-carboxyl peptidase that sequentially removes tripeptides from polypeptides. Naturally occurring mutations in TPP I are associated with the classic late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Human TPP I has five potential N-glycosylation sites at Asn residues 210, 222, 286, 313, and 443. To analyze the role of N-glycosylation in the function of the enzyme, we obliterated each N- glycosylation consensus sequence by substituting Gln for Asn, either individually or in combinations, and expressed mutated cDNAs in Chinese hamster ovary and human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Here, we demonstrate that human TPP I in vivo utilizes all five N-glycosylation sites. Elimination of one of these sites, at Asn-286, dramatically affected the folding of the enzyme. However, in contrast to other misfolded proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, only a fraction of misfolded TPP I mutant expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, but not in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, was arrested in the ER, whereas its major portion was secreted. Secreted proenzyme formed non-native, interchain disulfide bridges and displayed only residual TPP I activity upon acidification. A small portion of TPP I missing Asn-286-linked glycan reached the lysosome and was processed to an active species; however, it showed low thermal and pH stability. N-Glycans at Asn-210, Asn-222, Asn-313, and Asn-443 contributed slightly to the specific activity of the enzyme and its resistance to alkaline pH-induced inactivation. Phospholabeling experiments revealed that N-glycans at Asn-210 and Asn-286 of TPP I preferentially accept a phosphomannose marker. Thus, a dual role of oligosaccharide at Asn-286 in folding and lysosomal targeting could contribute to the unusual, but cell type-dependent, fate of misfolded TPP I conformer and represent the molecular basis of the disease process in subjects with naturally occurring missense mutation at Asn-286."

X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the copper K-edge has been used to explore the site geometry under each binding mode using both insoluble polymeric Cu(II)·αBoPrP-(24-242) (bovine PrP) complexes and soluble Cu(II) complexes of peptides containing one, two, and four copies of the octarepeat. Analysis of the extended region of the spectra using a multiple scattering approach revealed two types of sites differing in the number of His residues in the first coordination shell of Cu(II). Peptides containing one and two-octarepeat copies in sub-stoichiometric Cu(II) complexes showed the direct binding of a single His in accord with crystallographic intra-repeat geometry. Alternatively, the polymeric Cu(II)·αBoPrP-(24-242) complex and Cu(II) in its soluble complex with a four-octarepeat peptide at half-site-occupancy showed Cu(II) directly bound to two His residues, consistent with an inter-repeat binding mode. Increasing the Cu(II) site occupancy from 0.5 to 0.75 in the peptide containing four octarepeats resulted in spectral features that are intermediate to those of the inter- and intra-repeat modes. The transition from His-Cu-His (inter-repeat) to Cu-His (intra-repeat) on increasing Cu(II) saturation offers a structural basis for the positive cooperativity of the cation binding process and explains the capacity of αPrP to participate in Cu(II)-mediated intermolecular interactions.

The binding affinity constants varied in the femto to micromolar range and show strong pH dependence. From a structural point of view, different models for the Cu(II) site in αPrP have been proposed. Based on circular dichroism spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, in one group of models Cu(II) has been proposed to be coordinated to two His residues, thereby bringing into close contact successive octarepeats (12Stockel J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 23Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J.

These models, which were elaborated considering the substoichiometric complexations of Cu(II) per octarepeat, differ in the final assembly, being either helical or planar. The models of the second group, which corresponds to full site occupancy, are formed in the crystal structure of Cu(II) in complex with the minimal site HGGGW and are then considered to be applicable to the fully saturated SHaPrP-(23-231) (17Burns C.S.

In these fully saturated forms, the Cu(II) geometry is one of penta-coordination with the nearly equatorial ligation to the δ1 nitrogen of the His, the deprotonated amide nitrogens of the two sequential Gly residues, the amide carbonyl oxygen of the second Gly residue, and the axial ligation of the oxygen of a water molecule hydrogen bonded to the Trp indole. Regarding biding sites other than those involving the octarepeats, the XAS analysis of human PrP-(90-231) in complex with Cu(II) has provided the geometry for the site involving the side chains of His-96, Gln-98, Met-109, and His-111 (20Hasnain S.S.

This site appears as a high affinity binding site in N-terminal domain truncated forms (16Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to the intramolecular Cu(II), the binding process represented by the previous models, Cu(II) has been reported to mediate the incorporation of PrPC and αPrP into intermolecular assemblies. In the presence of Cu(II), PrP (as PrPC or αPrP) is retained in inner membrane immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography matrices, binds tighter to sulfated glycosaminoglycans and their complexes, and forms homo-polymers at protein concentrations above 40 μm (9Pan K.M.

Despite the large number of studies on Cu(II)-PrP interaction, the structural basis of the Cu(II)-mediated αPrP assembly and of the binding cooperativity are still unknown. In this study, our use of XAS analysis of Cu(II) bound to αBoPrP-(24-242) and to synthetic peptides containing different octarepeat copies at varying saturation levels has revealed two types of Cu(II) site geometries. The two geometries differ in the number of equatorially coordinated imidazole rings that support inter-repeat and intra-repeat binding modes. Inter-repeat geometries of intermolecular nature sustain the Cu(II)-mediated αPrP assembly, whereas the intramolecular inter-repeat to intra-repeat transition on increasing Cu(II) saturation provides a structural framework for binding cooperativity. Preparation of Cu(II) Complexes of αBoPrP-(24-242) and Synthetic Peptides—αBoPrP-(24-242) was produced, purified and refolded as described (27Gonzalez-Iglesias R. Pajares M.A. Ocal C. Espinosa J.C.

Before use, the protein solution was extensively dialyzed against 20 mm MES-HCl, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm citrate, and 0.03% sodium azide.

Complex formation was carried out by incubating the protein solution for 10 min at room temperature with three equivalents of Cu(II). The Cu(II)·αBoPrP-(24-242) complex was isolated by a centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and then mounted between two Kapton windows in 1-mm-thick plastic holders and transferred into liquid nitrogen.

After an inspection of copper K-edge consistency, scans were summed and averaged, and the absorption signal used in the analysis was given by the equation μexp=(∑I=1NμI)/N, where μI=(∑k=113Ik)/Io, in which Ik is the fluorescence signal collected by the k-th detector and Io is the incident flux. The experimental signal μexp was analyzed using the GNXAS package as described previously (29Benfatto M. Natoli C.R. Bianconi A. Garcia J. Marcelli A. Fanfoni M. Davoli I.I. Phys. Rev. B.

The EXAFS structural signal χ(κ) is defined as the relative oscillations of the total absorption coefficient μ(k) with respect to the absorption coefficient of an isolated copper atom, μo(k) (34Lee P.A. Citrin P.H. Eisenberg P. Kinkaid B.M. Rev. Mod. Phys. 1981; 53: 769-806Crossref Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). In single scattering approximation, the theoretical EXAFS signal is given by the well known formula shown in Equation 1, χ(k)=So2∑iNiAoiRi2sin(2kRi+ϕoi)e-2σi2k2e-eRi/λ(Eq. 1) in which the sum runs over the different coordination shells around the absorber. For each shell, Ni, Ri, and σi2 represent, respectively, the coordination number, the average coordination distance, and the variance of the atomic pair distribution (mean square relative displacement). Aoi(kRoi) and ϕoi(kRoi) are the modulus and phase of the backscattering amplitudes, respectively. λ(k) is the photoelectron mean free path, and So2 is an empirical parameter that accounts for the many body losses in the photo-absorption processes. For multiple scattering (MS) processes, an expression that is formally similar to Equation 1 can be derived in which Ro represents the full length of the MS path. The modulus and phase functions are now more complicated expressions describing each scattering event along the MS path. Moreover, the σ2 factor embodies not only the variance of the MS path length but also the effects of the distribution of the scattering angles. The MS effects are usually negligibly small in the EXAFS region, except for (near) collinear atomic arrangements in which they are enhanced by the large forward scattering amplitude (focusing effect). For Cu(II)-bound imidazole rings, large MS effects due to the three-body Cu-Nδ1-Cϵ1 and Cu-Nδ1-Cγ, and the four-body Cu-Nδ1-Cγ-Nϵ2 and Cu-Nδ1-Cϵ1-Cδ2 paths, are observed. The approach implemented in the GNXAS package allows an ab initio computation of the backscattering functions for all of the involved ions using the Heidin-Lundqvist complex potentials in the muffin-tin approximation. The theoretical absorption coefficient μth(k) is computed by combining signals (single and MS events) from the structural contributions for given atomic configurations around the absorber. The model signal is then subjected to a refinement procedure that consists of varying the structural parameters that define the geometry of the cluster in order to fit to the experimental data μexp(k). As a starting geometrical model, the coordinates from the crystal of the Cu(II)·HGGGW complex were considered (17Burns C.S. Aronoff-Spencer E. Dunham C.M. Lario P. Avdievich N.I. Antholine W.E. Olmstead M.M. Vrielink A. Gerfen G.J. Peisach J. Scott W.G. Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3991-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). For PrP forms with a large number of octarepeat copies, more than one His residue around the Cu(II) ion was allowed in the fitting. In the fitting, the γ (2) signals (Fig. 3) represent the Cu-Ai, where Ai are the atoms of the first shell. The three-body and four-body signals are called γ(3) and γ(4) functions. The three-body γ(3) is the sum of the signal due to the Cu-A-B triple scattering process plus the Cu-B two-body signal. The four-body γ (4) signal is the sum of the signal due to the Cu-A-B-C four-body contribution plus the two Cu-A-C and Cu-B-C three-body and the Cu-C two body contributions. This way of grouping together contributions forces the identification of certain geometrical parameters and substantially reduces the number of free parameters in the fitting (see Ref. 34Lee P.A. Citrin P.H. Eisenberg P. Kinkaid B.M. Rev. Mod. Phys. 1981; 53: 769-806Crossref Scopus (1704) Google Scholar for a detailed explanation of the fitting procedure). The Cu(II) site geometry in its insoluble complex with αBoPrP-(24-242) has been probed with XAS. Because αBoPrP-(24-242) contains both octarepeat and non-octarepeat Cu(II) binding sites, we have used Cu(II) complexes of synthetic peptides containing one, two, and four tandem copies of the octarepeat to establish the nature of the predominant binding site as well as to validate the spectral procedure analysis. The Cu(II) complexes studied and their composition are summarized in Table I. It must be stressed that XAS study requires the observable Cu(II) to be fully saturated by the ligand to avoid heterogeneities resulting from free Cu(II). Consequently, this requirement precludes the XAS study of complexes corresponding to full site saturation states.Table ICu(II)-complexes of α BoPrP-(24-242) and its templated synthetic peptides used for XAS analysisPeptidePeptide sequenceCu(II) sitesCu(II) saturationaExperimentally determined Cu(II) saturation from the complex compositionCu(II)/PrPCu(II)/ORBoPrP-(25-30,60-70)KKRPKPWGQPHGGGWGQ10.50.5BoPrP-(25-30,60-78)KKRPKPWGQ(PHGGGWGQ)221.50.75BoPrP-(25-30,60-94)KKRPKPWGQ(PHGGGWGQ)4420.53.20.8αBoPrP (24-242)BoPrP-(24-242)6bThe total number of Cu(II) binding sites has been calculated by adding one site from the extra octarepeat copy to the number reported for the mouse PrP (18).30.5a Experimentally determined Cu(II) saturation from the complex compositionb The total number of Cu(II) binding sites has been calculated by adding one site from the extra octarepeat copy to the number reported for the mouse PrP (18Qin K.

Open table in a new tab For all the Cu(II) complexes considered in this study, the XANES pattern was conserved to a large extent, supporting the preservation of the Cu(II) oxidation state (Fig. 1). However, a closer inspection of the main edge peak (∼9000 eV) and the first oscillations (9040-9080 eV) revealed two groups of Cu(II) complexes that suggested structural differences in the absorber environment. The first group, formed by the complexes of Cu(II)·αBoPrP-(24-242) at 3:1 and Cu(II)·BoPrP-(25-30, 60-94) at 2:1, showed a split maximum and a humpback shaped over the 9040-9080 eV region. The second group, formed by the Cu(II) complexes of synthetic peptides containing one and two octarepeat copies, showed a single maximum at the edge followed by a broad oscillation in the 9040-9080 eV region. These differences in the peak shape should be assigned to distinct structural features rather than to perturbations of the oxidation state of Cu(II) because of edge consistency. The experimental k-weighted EXAFS spectra (kχ(k)) and the modulus of the amplitude of the corresponding Fourier transform (FT) of each of the Cu(II) complexes studied are displayed in Fig. 2, A and C. A simple visual inspection of both the kχ(k) and its FT confirmed the existence of the two groups of complexes suggested by the XANES data. One group results from the Cu(II) complexes of the peptides containing one- and two-octarepeat copies. In these complexes, the EXAFS spectrum is dominated by a single low frequency signal due to nearest neighbor coordination and by weak high frequency oscillations, signaling highly disordered near neighbor shells. Both of these features at ∼4 Å-1 and at the broad weak peak between 3 and 4.2 Å-1 of the FT support the presence of His in the metal ion binding site (20Hasnain S.S. Murphy L.M. Strange R.W.

On the other hand, the second group of data resulting from the complexes Cu(II)·BoPrP-(25-30, 60-94) (2:1) and Cu(II)·αBoPrP-(24-242) (3:1) exhibits strong high frequency oscillations from nearest neighbor contributions that suggest a strong contribution from imidazole rings (see below). Cu(II) Site Geometry in its Complexes with Peptides Containing One- and Two-octarepeats—To validate the analysis of the EXAFS spectra of the Cu(II) complexes, we first analyzed the Cu(II) complex of BoPrP-(25-30, 60-70) because its geometry should reproduce that of the crystal structure of the minimum site (17Burns C.S. Aronoff-Spencer E. Dunham C.M. Lario P. Avdievich N.I. Antholine W.E. Olmstead M.M. Vrielink A. Gerfen G.J. Peisach J. Scott W.G. Millhauser G.L.

As pointed out previously, the EXAFS signal of this complex and that of the Cu(II)·BoPrP-(25-30, 60-78) 1.5, are superimposable, as is evident by a flat difference spectrum (Fig. 2B, a-b). The very similar, if not identical, spectrum will also provide a suitable internal check for the variability of the output parameter solutions. The spectral fitting was initialized by calculating the atomic potentials from the atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of the Cu(II)·HGGGW complex (17Burns C.S. Aronoff-Spencer E. Dunham C.M. Lario P. Avdievich N.I. Antholine W.E. Olmstead M.M. Vrielink A. Gerfen G.J. Peisach J. Scott W.G. Millhauser G.L.

Four contributions were required to independently fit each spectrum from this group of complexes (Figs. 3A and 4A, and Tables II and III). The first signal ( γ1(2)) accounted for the contribution to the absorption coefficient from the first coordination shell formed by four light atoms (nitrogen and oxygen) at an average distance of 1.97 Å. A ratio of three nitrogen atoms to one oxygen atom was fixed from the crystallographic structure, because the similarity between nitrogen and oxygen backscattering amplitude and phase functions precludes the refinement of this magnitude. Trial fits showed that increasing the coordination number (4.5-5) also suffices to fit the data. The component γ2(2) is from a light atom at ∼2.4 Å, which agrees with the axial coordination of 1 oxygen. A third component, γ3(2), is seen in the fit with a multiplicity of ∼3 at an average distance of 3.3 Å. Based on geometrical considerations and their large Debye-Waller factors (∼0.009-0.018 Å2), this was attributed to Cu-C coordinations from Gly residues (Fig. 4). The γ1(4) signal contained the contribution of the Cu-Nδ1-Cγ-Nϵ1 and Cu-Nδ1-Cϵ1-Cδ2 paths of the Cu(II)-bound imidazole ring and yielded distance and angle values that were compatible with the pres"

In vertebrates, AChE is encoded by a single gene whose mRNA can be alternatively spliced to yield several forms that differ in their C-terminal domains but share identical catalytic N-terminal domains that compose 95% of their sequence (reviewed in Refs. 1Massoulié J.

Molecular studies have identified three such variants in mammals, AChET, AChEH, and AChER, of about 80 kDa each. In adult mammalian brain and muscle, post-translational processing of AChET produces secreted monomers, dimers, and tetramers as well as membrane-bound and extracellular matrix-associated oligomers. In skeletal muscle the predominant species of AChE present at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the asymmetric A12 form (4Hall Z.W. J. Neurobiol. 1973; 4: 343-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), consisting of three tetramers of the AChET variant covalently linked to a triple helical collagen-like tail (ColQ). ColQ is encoded by a separate gene (5Krejci E. Coussen F. Duval N. Chatel J.M. Legay C. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Cartaud J. Bon S. Massoulie J.

Several lines of evidence, including in vitro and in culture binding studies, as well as studies using genetically modified mice, indicate that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan is responsible for localizing AChE on the synaptic basal lamina. Initially, the localization of the collagen-tailed AChE forms was thought to take place via electrostatic interactions with the polyanionic components of the extracellular matrix (8Bon S. Cartaud J. Massoulie J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (9Brandan E. Inestrosa N.C. Biochem.

Sci. 1989; 10: 325-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our current model of extracellular matrix specialization at the NMJ suggests that the collagen-tailed AChE form is localized in association with the transmembrane dystroglycan complex via binding of its collagen-like tail to the proteoglycan perlecan. Several studies support this view. First, the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, a major constituent of skeletal muscle basal lamina, colocalizes with acetylcholine receptors (AChR) both at the NMJ in vivo and in culture (12Anderson M.J. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1396-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Bayne E.K. Anderson M.J. Fambrough D.M. J.

Second, studies utilizing monoclonal antibodies or rhodamine-conjugated fasciculin to visualize AChE together with anti-perlecan monoclonal antibodies show that A12-AChE binds to, and colocalizes with, perlecan in vivo and in cultured muscle cells (15Peng H.B. Xie H. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Third, perlecan binds to dystroglycan (DG) and clusters at the sites of nerve-muscle contact (16Peng H.B. Ali A.A. Daggett D.F. Rauvala H. Hassell J.R. Smalheiser N.R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Asymmetric AChE is thought to be mobilized to the NMJ through interactions with DG and the cytoskeletal linking proteins underlying the postsynaptic membrane. Indeed, when Xenopus muscle cells are innervated after the addition of asymmetric quail A12-AChE, and clustering of A12-AChE is tracked via fluorescence microscopy, A12-AChE, like AChR, is recruited to the NMJ on innervation (15Peng H.B. Xie H. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Finally, muscle fibers devoid either of DG (18Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) or of perlecan (19Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Yamada Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have no detectable AChE at the NMJ. Together, these results suggest that the initial localization of AChE to the postsynaptic density occurs via a perlecan- and DG-mediated clustering process. Once localized, AChE is thought to form a more permanent, possibly covalent interaction at sites of nerve-muscle contact as evidenced at mammalian NMJs by a “non-extractable AChE pool” (20Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19152-19159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although questions remain regarding the precise mechanism of AChE localization and attachment at the NMJ, knowledge gleaned from studies in patients with endplate AChE deficiency suggests that the CTD of ColQ is essential in this process (21Donger C.

Open table in a new tab Based on our observations that purified, collagen-tailed AChE can be transplanted to heterospecific synapses (27Rotundo R.L. Rossi S.G. Anglister L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and to determine the respective roles of the HSBDs and CTD in AChE localization and attachment at the NMJ, we tested the insertion competence of five previously reported (R315X, Q371X, D342E, R410Q, and C444Y) and three novel (S312G, R410P, and E415G) CTD mutants, and two HSBD mutants of human ColQ, at the frog NMJ. All of the CTD mutations have been identified in patients with endplate AChE deficiency. The HSBD mutants were engineered to examine the necessity of the HSBDs of ColQ for insertion. We also studied in vitro binding of the two HSBD mutants to purified perlecan. Our results indicate that the HSBD of ColQ is necessary but not sufficient for attachment of AChE at the NMJ, and the CTD of ColQ is essential for insertion of this molecule into the synaptic basal lamina. Patients (Pts)—Clinical features and endplate studies in Pts 1 and 2 were reported previously as cases 5 and 3 by Hutchinson et al. (24Hutchinson D.O. Walls T.J. Nakano S. Camp S. Taylor P. Harper C.M. Groover R.V. Peterson H.A. Jamieson D.G. Engel A.G. Brain. 1993; 116: 633-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Neither patient expressed AChE at the NMJ. Pt 3 is a 3-year-old girl with moderate myasthenic symptoms including eyelid ptosis, limb/neck/axial muscle weakness, and fluctuating hyperlordosis. No endplate studies were available from Pt 3. Mutation Analysis—Genomic DNA and mRNA were isolated from muscle specimens as described (28Ohno K. Hutchinson D.O. Milone M. Brengman J.M. Bouzat C. Sine S.M. Engel A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood from family members with the QIAamp Blood kit (Qiagen). We directly sequenced 17 constitutive and 2 alternatively transcribed COLQ exons and their flanking regions with ABI377 DNA sequencer as described previously (25Ohno K. Brengman J.M. Tsujino A. Engel A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9654-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Vectors—Human ACHET and COLQ cDNAs were cloned and introduced into a cytomegalovirus-based mammalian expression vector pTargeT (Promega) (25Ohno K. Brengman J.M. Tsujino A. Engel A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9654-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Each CTD mutation, as well as S312G/R410Q double mutations, was introduced into COLQ cDNA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Fig. 1 shows positions of the CTD mutations introduced into the human COLQ cDNA. We similarly constructed artificial HSBD mutants. pTargeT-ColQ-HSBD-del carries the deletion of RKG at codons 130–132 in the first HSBD and deletion of KRG at codons 235–237 in the second HSBD. pTargeT-ColQ-HSBD-NQGG harbors 8 missense codons: NQGG substitution for RKGR at codons 130–133 in the first HSBD and NQGG substitution for KRGK at codons 235–238 in the second HSBD. For each construct, the presence of the desired mutation and absence of unwanted artifacts were confirmed by sequencing the entire insert. RT-PCR to Test Aberrant Splicing of Exon 16 —To examine if E415G causes aberrant splicing of exon 16, we amplified a cDNA fragment with 5′-CAGCTGACCCCTTTCTACCC-3′ in exon 15 and 5′-AGCGGCAGGGCGTGGAGT-3′ in exon 17 using mRNA extracted from an endplate-enriched muscle biopsy sample of Pt 1 (Table I). A normally spliced transcript would yield a 286-bp fragment, whereas an exon 16-skipped would give rise to a 183-bp fragment. To identify the allelic origin of the normally spliced transcript, we next performed allele-specific RT-PCR. The R410Q allele-specific forward primer was 5′-CTACTGTGGAGATGGTCAaCA-3′, and the E415G allele-specific forward primer was 5′-CCGGCATGAGGGTGTcGG-3′. Lowercase letters at position –3 represent artificial mismatches to enhance discrimination of the two alleles. The reverse primer was 5′-AGCGGCAGGGCGTGGAGT-3′ in exon 17. The PCR protocol comprised 35 cycles of reactions at the annealing temperature of 60 °C. The R410Q- and E415G-specific primers would yield 149- and 131-bp fragments, respectively. We tested these allele-specific primers using genomic DNA of Pt 1 and the family members. Construction of COLQ Minigenes for Pre-mRNA Splicing Analysis—A 5-kb fragment spanning the 5′ end of exon 15 to the stop codon in exon 17 was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from Pt 1. The forward primer harbored an XhoI restriction site followed by the Kozak consensus sequence, 5′-CCACCATG-3′, at the 5′ end. The Kozak sequence was placed to retain the normal open reading frame of COLQ. The reverse primer carried a NotI restriction site at the 5′ end. The PCR amplicon was cloned into a cytomegalovirus-based expression vector pCI (Promega). We transfected C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with a minigene carrying either R410Q or E415G in exon 16, extracted total RNA using the RNeasy Mini kit (Promega), and analyzed pre-mRNA splicing by RT-PCR spanning exons 15–17, as described elsewhere (29Ohno K. Milone M. Shen X.M. Engel A.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3055-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transfection and AChE Extraction—Plasmids encoding the wild-type or mutant form of human ColQ were cotransfected into COS cells with a plasmid encoding the wild-type human AChET catalytic subunit using the DEAE-dextran method described previously (30Duval N. Krejci E. Grassi J. Coussen F. Massoulie J. Bon S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3255-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Five μg of each plasmid DNA was added to COS cells in 100-mm culture dishes in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and chloroquine and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline; 6 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum was added, and the dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. To extract the expressed enzyme, cells were scraped from dishes in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (from now on “Tris-HCl buffer” refers to 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4), containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin (2 μg/ml). The crude extract was vortexed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was stored in 50% glycerol at –20 °C until used. Aliquots (200 μl) of the AChE-containing supernatant were centrifuged on 5–20% sucrose gradients in Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA, and the fractions collected were assayed for AChE activity using the Ellman method. Bacterial β-galactosidase (∼16.1 S) was included in the gradients as a marker for the A12-AChE. Isolation of A12-AChE on Heparin-Agarose Columns—Extracts from COS cells expressing wild-type or mutated collagen-tailed AChE were vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was diluted to 0.2 m NaCl with Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm EDTA, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin (2 μg/ml) and loaded onto columns containing 250 μl of heparin-agarose (Sigma) that had been pre-equilibrated with 1 volume of Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. The columns were washed with 5 volumes of Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and the asymmetric forms eluted with 1 ml of Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The eluate containing the asymmetric AChE forms was concentrated with YM-30 Centricon concentrators (Amersham Biosciences) and diluted in Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. To verify that indeed only the collagen-tailed AChE forms were being retained on the column and eluted, the eluates were analyzed by velocity sedimentation. β-Galactosidase (∼16.1 S) was included in the gradients as a marker for the A12-AChE form. This procedure showed that only the collagen-tailed AChE forms are retained on the heparin column and specifically eluted with 1 m NaCl. Transplantation of AChE to Frog Neuromuscular Junctions—The method of Rotundo et al. (27Rotundo R.L. Rossi S.G. Anglister L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. Frog (Rana pipiens) gastrocnemius muscles were excised, snap-frozen by immersion of the muscle in 2-methylbutane cooled with liquid nitrogen, and stored frozen at –80 °C. Ten-μm cross-sections from the belly of the muscle were cut in a Leica CM1900 cryostat at –20 °C, adhered to Gold Seal microscope slides, and stored at –80 °C until used. For analysis, the slides were brought to room temperature; excess moisture was removed, and plastic wells for transplantation and immunological staining were affixed to the slides using rubber cement. Stock asymmetric AChE solutions used for transplantation were eluted from heparin columns with Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 m NaCl and concentrated. For addition to sections, the stock solutions were diluted in Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 5 mg/ml each of bovine serum albumin, chicken ovalbumin, and gelatin (all from Sigma) to give 1–2ng of AChE/well final, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.5 m. The ionic strength of the enzyme solution (100 μl/well) was adjusted stepwise over a period of 3 h to 0.3 m to prevent aggregation of collagen-tailed AChE forms. After addition of the enzyme preparation, the wells were sealed with coverslips, placed in a humidified chamber, and incubated overnight at room temperature. The sections were then washed for 2 h with Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and the protein mixture described above prior to processing for immunofluorescence. The specific binding is not disrupted by high salt concentrations (1 m NaCl) or heparin (500 μg/ml) (27Rotundo R.L. Rossi S.G. Anglister L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Colocalization of AChE with AChR was visualized with a Leica DMRA fluorescence microscope. AChRs were labeled with rhodamine-labeled α-bungarotoxin (1 μg/ml), and human AChE was detected with a primary mouse anti-human AChE monoclonal AE3 that does not recognize frog AChE (31Fambrough D.M. Engel A.G. Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (10 μg/ml) followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse second antibody (10 μg/ml). Muscle sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, mounted in glycerol containing p-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml), 0.02 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.5 and 0.06× phosphate-buffered saline, and sealed with clear nail polish. In Vitro Perlecan Binding Assay—Plasmids encoding the indicated HSBD mutants of human ColQ cDNAs were cotransfected into COS cells with the plasmid encoding the wild-type human AChET catalytic subunit, and the A12-AChE was isolated and tested for its ability to bind immobilized perlecan. The microtiter plate perlecan binding assay developed by Vigny et al. (32Vigny M. Martin G.R. Grotendorst G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8794-8798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used with 10 ng of perlecan, and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan was isolated from the mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma cells (Sigma) per well (see Fig. 10A for an example). A12-AChE harboring mutations HSBD-del and HSBD-NQGG described earlier as well as wild-type A12 and G1/G2 globular forms of AChE were added to the polystyrene microtiter plates in a total volume of 200 μl. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed with Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 or 1 m NaCl, and the bound AChE activity was determined by the Ellman method. In contrast to wild-type collagen-tailed AChE, the globular G1/G2 and G4 AChE forms exhibited little or no binding to immobilized perlecan in vitro. Mutation Analysis—As endplate studies (Pts 1 and 2) and clinical features (Pts 1–3) indicated endplate AChE deficiency, we directly sequenced COLQ and found that each patient carried two mutant COLQ alleles (Fig. 1, A and C). Pt 1 carried three missense mutations in CTD (S312G, R410Q, and E415G"

Coleman-McGhee in 1992, is believed to be 38 rebounds. Following earlier attempts to analyse the physics of this ancestral human activity, we focus here on the crucial moment in stone skipping: when the stone bounces on the water's surface. By monitoring the collision of a spinning disc with water, we have discovered that an angle of about 20 degrees between the stone and the water's surface is optimal with respect to the throwing conditions and yields the maximum possible number of bounces."

Signal transduction pathways that lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; HOG, high osmolarity glycerol; DSP, dual-specificity protein phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CH2, Cdc25 homology regions. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; HOG, high osmolarity glycerol; DSP, dual-specificity protein phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CH2, Cdc25 homology regions. are widely used by eukaryotic cells. Reversible protein phosphorylation is a key mechanism involved in the modulation of signaling through evolutionary conserved modules in which MAPKs are the final components. These proteins are activated through the phosphorylation of conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in their phosphorylation lip by specific MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because both higher and lower eukaryotic cells share the components operating in these pathways, studies with model systems, particularly yeast, have been of great importance in elucidating the mechanisms through which MAPK-mediated signaling is regulated. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains several MAPK cascades involved in the mediation of different physiological responses (for review see Ref. 2Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pheromones activate the Fus3 MAPK-mating module, which allows fusion of the mating partners. The filamentous growth pathway, which is activated by nutrient starvation, is mediated by the MAPK Kss1. In the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, the MAPK Hog1 is activated to trigger the osmo-adaptive response. Different stimuli associated with cell surface alterations activate the Slt2 MAPK-mediated cell integrity pathway, which leads to an appropriate response oriented to maintaining cell wall stability (3Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 4De Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martín H. Morris W. Brul S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recently, an additional pathway, which used the same MAPK module as the filamentous growth cascade, the STE-vegetative growth pathway, has been proposed to be also involved in cell wall integrity (5Lee B.N. Elion E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12679-12684Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Proteins and mechanisms that lead to MAPK activation have been extensively studied in the recent years. However, the duration and extent of MAPK activation not only relies on the activity of the upstream kinases, but also on protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate either or both of the Thr and Tyr residues in the TXY motif in MAPKs (6Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The identity and regulation of the protein phosphatases that down-regulate these pathways are less known. Frequently, the same protein phosphatase can act on different MAPKs. For example, the tyrosine phosphatases Ptp2 and Ptp3 have been shown to down-regulate the mating, the HOG, and the cell integrity pathways in S. cerevisiae by acting on Fus3, Hog1, and Slt2 MAPKs, respectively (7Jacoby T. Flanagan H. Faykin A. Seto A.G. Mattison C. Ota I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Mattison C.P. Spencer S.S. Kresge K.A. Lee J. Ota I.M. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, the same protein phosphatase is able to regulate a pathway at different stages of the signaling process. This is again the case of Ptp2 and Ptp3, which seem to be responsible for the tyrosine dephosphorylation of these MAPKs to maintain a low basal activity and also to inactivate them following stimulation of the pathway, thereby playing a role in adaptation. It is also remarkable that a single MAPK can be regulated by more than one class of protein phosphatases. Hog1 has also been shown to be inactivated by Ptc1, a type 2C Ser/Thr phosphatase, both in basal conditions and in adaptation (11Warmka J. Hanneman J. Lee J. Amin D. Ota I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although there is currently no evidence for direct dephosphorylation of Slt2 by Ptc1, a genetic interaction of PTC1 with the cell integrity pathway has been reported previously (12Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ser/Thr phosphatases and Tyr phosphatases dephosphorylate either Thr or Tyr residues, which is sufficient for MAPK inactivation. However, to control the activity of MAPKs, eukaryotic cells also use dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs) that cleave phosphoester bonds in phospho-Tyr as well as in phospho-Thr and phospho-Ser residues. Although >10 DSPs have been identified in higher eukaryotes (13Zhang Z.Y. Zhou B. Xie L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), only two DSPs have been shown to act on MAPKs in S. cerevisiae. One of them, Msg5, is a phosphatase that promotes adaptation to pheromone response by dephosphorylating Fus3 (10Zhan X.L. Deschenes R.J. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1690-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Besides, the involvement of Msg5 in the maintenance of a low basal level of activity through the cell integrity pathway has been suggested because the disruption of MSG5 results in increased phospho-Slt2 levels under non-inducing conditions (15Martín H. Rodríguez-Pachón J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The second one, Sdp1, has recently been shown to target Slt2, regulating the phosphorylation level of this MAPK in response to heat shock (16Hahn J.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21278-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Collister M. Didmon M.P. MacIsaac F. Stark M.J. MacDonald N.Q. Keyse S.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, MAPK phosphatases are very versatile elements that must be perfectly regulated to ensure the appropriate inactivation of the different MAPKs and the correct moment for acting on each substrate. Some studies with cells from higher organisms have indicated the existence of posttranslational mechanisms that might regulate the action of MAPK-directed phosphatases (18Saxena M. Williams S.

However, to date no posttranslational modifications of these phosphatases have been described in S. cerevisiae, an organism that has been essential in obtaining current knowledge regarding MAPK signaling. In an effort to gain insight into the mechanisms that modulate the action of the MAPKs phosphatases on their substrates, we have studied the role of the DSP Msg5 within the cell integrity pathway in S. cerevisiae. Here we report the existence of a reciprocal regulation between the MAPK Slt2 and various isoforms of Msg5 generated by alternative translational initiation and phosphorylation. These studies indicate the existence of different posttranscriptional mechanisms that operate on MAPK phosphatases in S. cerevisiae, reinforcing the importance of this yeast as a model for studying MAPK signaling in eukaryotic cells.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To obtain a C-terminal Myc6-tagged version of Slt2, plasmid pRS305SLT2m was constructed. The SLT2 open reading frame was amplified with primers 5′-CCCGGATCCGTCGACTTGAGGAGAATT-3′ and 5′-CCCGAATTCGCGGCCGCAAAAAAAATATTTTCTATCTAATC-3′ (BamHI and EcoRI sites are underlined) and subcloned into pGFP-C-FUS (23Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It was digested with HindIII, and the resulting fragment was introduced into pRS305m to produce pRS305SLT2m. pRS305m was obtained by subcloning a Myc6 epitope into the integrative LEU2 vector pRS305 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pRS305SLT2m expressed a functional Slt2-Myc6 protein because it suppressed the lytic phenotype of slt2 mutants. To integrate SLT2-Myc6 into the SLT2 locus, pRS305SLT2m was linearized at the unique PstI site. To construct pRS305MSG5m, the MSG5 open reading frame was PCR-amplified with primers MSGU 5′-CCCCCCGGGATCCATGCAATTTCACTCAG-3′ and MSGD 5′-CCCCCCGGGGATCCAGGAAGAAACATCATCTG-3′ (BamHI site is underlined), subcloned into the vector pGEM-T (Promega) to afford pGEMT-MSG5, and sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations. It was digested with BamHI, and the DNA fragment bearing MSG5 was introduced into pRS305m. To integrate MSG5-Myc6 into the MSG5 locus, pRS305MSG5m was linearized at the unique SphI site. To construct YCplac22MSG5m, PROMMSG5 5′-CCGGATCCGTAGTGATGGATAATGTG-3′ (BamHI site is underlined) and INT2MSG5 5′-CCGGCGATGGGAATTTTAC-3′ were used to amplify a fragment spanning from 1 kb upstream to 140 bp downstream from the initiation codon of MSG5, cloned into pGEM-T to afford pGEMT-PMSG5, and sequenced to verify the absence of mutations. EcoRI fragment from pRS305MSG5m then was inserted into pGEMT-PMSG5 to generate MSG5 with promoter sequences. The BamHI-SacI DNA fragment from pRS305MSG5m carrying the Myc6 epitope and the BamHI fragment bearing MSG5 were sequentially subcloned into YCplac22 (CEN4, TRP1) (25Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar) to give YCplac22MSG5m. To obtain the mutant allele MSG5-M1A, primers 5′-GCGATAAGTGCACGCGCAATTTCACTCAGATAAGC-3 and 5′-GCTTATCTGAGTGAAATTGCGCGTGCACTTATCGC-3′ were used. To generate MSG5-M45A, primers 5′-CGATGAGAATTCCGCTAATGGATGGAGTG-3 and 5′-CACTCCATCCATTAGCGGAATTCTCATCG-3′ were used. In both cases, PCR amplification from plasmid YCplac22MSG5m was performed as described previously (26Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). msg5C319A was obtained by mutagenic PCR in two parts using the MSGU with the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CTCCACACTGAGCGTGTACGAGTAT-3′ and the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-ATACTCGTACACGCTCAGTGTGGAG-3′ with MSGD. Products were combined, and a second amplification was performed using MSGU and MSGD. The product was subcloned into pRS305m to afford pRS305MSG5C319Am. YCplac22MSG5C319Am was obtained by replacing the StuI fragment of YCplac22MSG5 by the same fragment from pRS305MSG5C319Am. pGAD424-based plasmids bearing SLT2, SLT2ΔC396, and SLT2ΔN322 have been described previously (27Soler M. Plovins A. Martín H. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). pGBT9-MSG5 was constructed by subcloning the SmaI DNA fragment from pGEMT-MSG5 into pGBT9. MSG5ΔC229 was obtained by PCR of MSG5 with MSGU and MSGND, 5′-CCCCCGGGTCAGGATCCCGTTCGTTGATAAATCTCTGC-3′ (SmaI site is underlined). The resulting fragment was cloned into pGEM-T to give pGEMT-MSG5ΔC229 and sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations. This fragment was subcloned into pGBT9 to give pGBT9-MSG5ΔC229. pGBT9-MSG5ΔN228 was obtained similarly but using the primers 5′-CCCCCGGGATCCGTTTATTTAGATGGACCATTG-3′ (SmaI site is underlined) and MSGD. pEG(KG)-MSG5 was obtained by cloning the BamHI DNA fragment from pGEMT-MSG5 into pEG(KG) (2 μm of GAL1–10UAS-CYC1) (28Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). pGEX-MSG5 was constructed by cloning the same fragment into pGEX-KG (29Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). pGEX-MSG5C319A was obtained by subcloning the BamHI DNA fragment carrying msg5C319A from pRS305MSG5C319Am into pGEX-KG. pEG(KG)-SLT2 and pEG(KG)-SLT2K54F were constructed by PCR-amplifying the wild type SLT2 coding region and the slt2K54F mutant version using plasmids pHR0 and pHR3, respectively, as templates (30Martín H. Arroyo J. Sánchez M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SLT2 was amplified with primers 5′-GCCAGATCTCCGGATCCCATGGCTGATAAGATAGAG-3′ (BglII site is underlined) and 5′-GGATCCGTCGACTTAGCGGCCGCACACAGGTTCGTCAGC-3′ (SalI site is underlined), and SLT2K54F was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-GGATCCATGGCTGATAAGATAGAG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCTAAAAATATTTTCTATC-3′ (BamHI sites are underlined). PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T and sequenced, and then the BamHI fragment carrying slt2K54F and the BglII-SalI fragment carrying SLT2 from the generated plasmids were subcloned into BamHI and BamHI/SalI sites of pEG-(KG), respectively. Culture Conditions, Preparation of Yeast Extracts, and Immunoblot Analysis—The procedures employed have been described previously (15Martín H. Rodríguez-Pachón J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (New England Biolabs), anti-GST-Slt2 (30Martín H. Arroyo J. Sánchez M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), anti-Clb2 (kindly provided by D. Kellogg) and anti-GST antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Detection of actin and Myc-tagged proteins was carried out using monoclonal C4 (ICN Biomedicals) and 9E10 (BAbCO) antibodies, respectively. β-Galactosidase Assays—β-Galactosidase activities were determined according to Guarente (31Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Values are averages of at least three independent transformants assayed in duplicate. In Vivo Binding Assays—Cells bearing pEGKG-derived plasmids were grown in SG medium lacking uracil and containing 2% galactose at the indicated temperature. Cells were collected and lysed as above in lysis buffer lacking SDS and Nonidet P-40. The lysates were clarified and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Beads were washed extensively with the same buffer and resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Expression and Purification of Recombinant GST, GST-Msg5, and GST-Msg5C319A in Escherichia coli—E. coli DH5α cells transformed with the plasmid pGEX-KG, pGEX-MSG5, or pGEX-MSG5C319A were grown in LB with ampicillin to A600 = 0.5, and then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm for 3 h. Protein was isolated from overexpressing cells as described previously (32Millar J.B. Russell P. Dixon J.E. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4943-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GST-Slt2 Precipitation and Msg5 Phosphatase Assays—DL454 cells transformed with the plasmids pEG(KG) or pEG(KG)-SLT2 were heat-shocked at 39 °C for 1 h. Cells were glass bead-lysed in IPP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate and tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, pepstatinA, antipain, and aprotinin (each at 25 μg/ml), plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were clarified and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h. Beads were washed four times with IPP buffer and four times with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), after which recombinant GST, GST-Msg5, or GST-Msg5C319A was added. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with occasional gentle mixing and were stopped by the addition of SDS-sample loading buffer. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment of Msg5-Myc6—Msg5-Myc6 protein from cells incubated for 1 h at 39 °C was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with IPP buffer and three times with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase buffer (Roche Diagnostics) and resuspended in this buffer with or without 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase then was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by the addition of SDS-sample loading buffer. In Vitro Slt2 Kinase Assays—GST, GST-Slt2, or GST-Slt2K54F was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads as described above from cells lysed in IPK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate and leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, and aprotinin (each at 25 μg/ml), plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The precipitates were washed three times with IPK buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate). Recombinant GST or GST-Msg5C319A was added to the beads, and kinase reactions were initiated by adding 30 μm [γ-32P]ATP (50 Ci/mmol). After 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped with 2× SDS-loading buffer and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed. Msg5 Phosphatase Activity Regulates the Activation of the Cell Integrity Pathway—We have previously shown that deletion of MSG5 resulted in increased levels of phospho-Slt2 as revealed by Western blotting using antibodies that detect dually phosphorylated and thereby activated Slt2 (15Martín H. Rodríguez-Pachón J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms used by Msg5 to operate in the cell integrity pathway, we investigated whether the observed down-regulating effect of Msg5 on Slt2 phosphorylation was the result of the phosphatase activity of this protein. To this end, the codon for the conserved cysteine residue at the catalytic site (Cys-319) of MSG5, essential for phosphatase activity (14Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), was mutated to encode alanine. As shown in Fig. 1A, cells bearing the msg5C319A allele in a centromeric plasmid, growing either at 24 or 39 °C, displayed phospho-Slt2 levels similar to those of null msg5Δ cells. Therefore, the negative regulation exerted by Msg5 on Slt2 must be because of its phosphatase activity. Consistent with our previous results (15Martín H. Rodríguez-Pachón J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), the impact of Msg5 on Slt2 phosphorylation is higher at 24 °C than at 39 °C (Fig. 1A), indicating that Msg5 plays a more important role in down-regulating Slt2 under basal conditions than following induction. We next speculated that the Slt2 up-regulation promoted by the lack of Msg5 could have phenotypic consequences related to cell wall integrity. Fig. 1B shows that the absence of Msg5 leads to an increased sensitivity of cells to Congo Red, a compound that interferes with cell wall assembly (33Roncero C. Durán A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for Msg5 in cell wall construction, we also observed that msg5Δ cells transformed with a FKS2-lacZ reporter displayed double the β-galactosidase activity of the wild type cells (data not shown), reflecting the transcriptional induction of FKS2, a known output of the cell integrity pathway (34Zhao C. Jung U.S. Garrett-Engele P. Roe T. Cyert M.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies support the notion that Msg5 regulates cell wall physiology, and taken together, all of these findings indicate that this phosphatase is a key regulator of the cell integrity pathway. Two-hybrid Analysis of the Msg5 and Slt2 Interaction—We next wished to know whether Slt2 and Msg5 interact in vivo. To this end, we used the two-hybrid system. Slt2 was fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain, and its interaction with Msg5 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was tested. Cells containing both fusion proteins exhibited a reproducible 30-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2). This activity was triple the magnitude of that observed for the interaction between Slt2 and its direct activator, the MAPKK Mkk1. Thus, Slt2 and Msg5 are capable of physically associating in vivo, suggesting that Msg5 might directly dephosphorylate Slt2. We extended these studies by determining the regions of Slt2 and Msg5 that are essential for their interaction. In the case of Slt2, the protein kinase domain was located at the N terminus, whereas the catalytic active site of Msg5, similar to other DSPs, was localized within the C-terminal half of the protein. The function of the Slt2 C-terminal and Msg5 N-terminal regions is currently unknown, although they are assumed to perform a regulatory function. As shown in Fig. 2, the Slt2 N-terminal region was sufficient for binding to Msg5 and the N-terminal domain of Msg5 was the one involved in the association with Slt2. Msg5 Dephosphorylates Slt2 in Vitro—The results described above suggested that Msg5 inactivates Slt2 directly. To test this possibility, we studied whether recombinant Msg5 was able to dephosphorylate Slt2 in vitro. Wild type Msg5 and the catalytically inactive Msg5C319A forms were tagged with GST at the N terminus and expressed in E. coli. As expected, purified GST-Msg5 but not GST-Msg5C319A showed phosphatase activity toward the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate, indicating that the GST-Msg5 obtained was active (data not shown). Recombinant GST-Msg5 but not GST dephosphorylated GST-Slt2 that had been purified from heat-shocked yeast cells (Fig. 3). The mutant form GST-Msg5C319A retained some activity on Slt2 although much less pronounced than the wild type protein (Fig. 3). This result is similar to that previously obtained when the same mutant protein was assayed for its activity on the MAPK Fus3 (14Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). All of these findings indicate that phosphatase activity of Msg5 is responsible for the observed Slt2 dephosphorylation in vitro, suggesting that in vivo Msg5 would act as a negative regulator of the cell integrity pathway by directly inactivating Slt2. Alternative Translational Initiation Sites Result in Two Different Forms of Msg5 That Are Active and Phosphorylated following Heat Shock—In contrast to that observed following stimulation of the pheromone pathway, MSG5 transcription does not seem to be increased under conditions of cell integrity pathway activation (14Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Hahn J.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, we analyzed whether Msg5 might be somehow regulated by posttranscriptional modifications. To facilitate the analysis of Msg5 protein, the chromosomal MSG5 gene was C-terminally tagged with a sequence encoding six copies of the Myc epitope. As shown in Fig. 4A, Western blotting analysis revealed that Msg5-Myc6 from wild-type ce"

Immun. 1993; 61: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we reported that the toxin-induced production of O2- and adhesion to the matrix of rabbit neutrophils are due to the activation of phospholipid metabolism by pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein (9Ochi S. Miyawaki T. Matsuda H. Oda M. Nagahama M. Sakurai J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, the activation of the sphingomyelin (SM) cycle, analogous to the glycerophospholipid cycles, has been recognized as a key event in the signal transduction cascade involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Ohanian J. Ohanian V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2053-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 11Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis (11Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). S1P has been reported to promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis (11Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim.

Therefore, it is speculated that the conversion of ceramide and sphingosine to S1P plays an important role in apoptotic and survival signaling. Several studies (14Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N.

Olivera et al. (18Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26121-26127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that exogenous SMase induces the synthesis of DNA and potentiates the actions of known growth factors in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. The SM metabolites, ceramide and S1P, have been shown to play an important role in such fundamental biological processes (10Ohanian J. Ohanian V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2053-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). α-Toxin possesses SMase activity, but little is known about the relationship between this activity and the action of the toxin. Nelson (19Nelson G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 144: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) reported that in rabbit erythrocytes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) constitutes ∼34% of the total amount of phospholipids, whereas in sheep erythrocytes, no PC is detected, and SM accounts for about 50% of all phospholipids. It is known that the α-toxin induces hot-cold hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes. Bacillus cereus SMase has also been reported to cause hot-cold hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes (20Ikezawa H. Taguchi R. Asahi Y. Tomita M. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1982; 1: 223-255Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

B-5354c was a gift from Dr. Takahumi Kohama, Pharmacology and Molecular Biology Research Laboratories, Research Institute, Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Ci/mmol) was supplied by ICN Biochemicals, Inc., Irvine, CA. [N-methyl-14C]SM was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other drugs were of analytical grade. Purification of C. perfringens α-Toxin and the Variant Toxin (H148G)—A recombinant form of the plasmid pHY300PLK harboring the structural gene of α-toxin was introduced into B. subtilis ISW1214 by transformation (21Nagahama M. Okagawa Y. Nakayama T. Nishioka E. Sakurai J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg of ampicillin per ml, with aeration, to an A600 of 0.8–0.85. The culture was centrifuged, and then ammonium sulfate (472 g/liter) was added to the supernatant fluid. The ammonium sulfate fraction obtained was used as the starting material for purifying the toxin. The purification of toxins was performed as described in detail previously (21Nagahama M. Okagawa Y. Nakayama T. Nishioka E. Sakurai J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the variant toxin (H148G) from cultures of Bacillus subtilis transformant was performed as described in detail previously (21Nagahama M. Okagawa Y. Nakayama T. Nishioka E. Sakurai J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Sheep Erythrocytes—Sheep erythrocytes were suspended in 0.02 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.9% NaCl (TBS) and centrifuged at 1,100 × g for 3 min. The sedimented erythrocytes were then washed three times in the same buffer. The number of erythrocytes was determined with a cell counter (Celltac; Nihon Kohden Co., Tokyo, Japan). The erythrocyte concentration was adjusted to 6 × 1011 cells per ml. Treatment of Sheep Erythrocytes with Saponin—Sheep erythrocytes (12 × 1010 cells per ml) were suspended in TBS and 15–20 μg of β-escin per ml and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After the incubation, the erythrocytes were washed by centrifugation (1,100 × g, 3 min) and suspended in TBS. The β-escin concentration chosen was below the threshold for hemolysis as determined for each erythrocyte preparation. Under the conditions used, no hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes was observed. Determination of Hemolytic Activity—α-Toxin was incubated with washed sheep erythrocytes or saponin-treated erythrocytes (12 × 1010 cells per ml) in TBS at 37 °C for 30 min, and then the cells were chilled at 4 °C. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,100 × g for 3 min. The lysis was determined by measuring the amount of hemoglobin released, spectrophotometrically at A550. All assay mixtures were supplemented with Ca2+ to 3 mm. Hemolysis was expressed as a percentage of the amount of hemoglobin released from 0.1 ml of erythrocytes suspended in 0.4 ml of 0.4% NaCl. Thin Layer Chromatography of Sheep Erythrocyte Membrane Phospholipids—Sheep erythrocytes (12 × 1010 cells per ml) were incubated with various concentrations of α-toxin in a total volume of 0.2 ml of TBS containing 3 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.72 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Biophysiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar) except that 0.2 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA was used instead of water (23Nakashima S. Suganuma A. Matsui A. Hattori H. Sato M. Takenaka A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The final organic phase was concentrated to 0.1 ml under a N2 stream and spotted on a Silica Gel 60 plate. The plate was developed in a solvent system consisting of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/distilled water (25:15:4:2, v/v). After drying, the phospholipids were visualized by exposure to Dittmer-Lester reagent (24Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and identified by comigration with standard lipids. Determination of 1,2-Diacylglycerol in Sheep Erythrocytes—Erythrocyte suspensions (12 × 1010 cells per ml) were incubated with α-toxin at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Biophysiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar) except that 0.2 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA was used instead of water. The final organic phase was dried under a stream of N2 and used for analysis of the mass amount of 1,2-diacylglycerol. The 1,2-diacylglycerol content of crude lipid fractions was measured as described by Sakurai et al. (8Sakurai J. Ochi S. Tanaka H. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate in Sheep Erythrocytes—Erythrocyte suspensions (12 × 1010 cells per ml) were incubated with α-toxin at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold 10% perchloric acid. The samples were kept on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.5 with 10 n KOH. The solution was kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in the supernatant was measured as described by Sakurai et al. (8Sakurai J. Ochi S. Tanaka H. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Ceramide—Erythrocyte suspensions (12 × 1010 cells per ml) were incubated with or without α-toxin in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 0.02 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 3 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.8 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Biophysiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar) except that 0.2 m KCl-5 mm EDTA was used instead of water (23Nakashima S. Suganuma A. Matsui A. Hattori H. Sato M. Takenaka A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The final organic phase was dried under a N2 stream and used for the analysis of ceramide. The ceramide content of the crude lipid fraction was measured based on the conversion of ceramide into [32P]ceramide 1-phosphate by Escherichia coli 1,2-diacylglycerol kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (25Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipids were separated on Silica Gel 60 plates in a solvent system consisting of diisobutyl ketone/acetic acid/distilled water (62:32.5:5.2, v/v). Labeled lipids on the plate were visualized with a Bio-Imaging Analyzer FLA-2000 (Fujifilm Co., Tokyo, Japan). The area corresponding to [32P]ceramide 1-phosphate was scraped into a scintillation vial, to which 5 ml of scintillation mixture was added. Radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka Co., Tokyo, Japan). Known amounts of ceramide were assayed as described above, and a standard curve was drawn. The amount of ceramide in 1 ml of the original sample was calculated from the standard curve. Determination of Phosphorylcholine—Erythrocyte suspensions (12 × 1010 cells per ml) or SM-cholesterol liposomes were incubated with various concentrations of α-toxin in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 0.02 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 3 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.8 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), and the phases were separated by the addition of 0.49 ml of chloroform and 0.49 ml of 1 m KCl. The upper phase was divided into two tubes, evaporated with a Centrifugal Concentrator CC-181 (Tomy Seiko Co., Tokyo, Japan), and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm ZnCl2 in the presence (phosphatase-treated sample) or absence (untreated sample) of 10 units of phosphatase alkaline per ml. After incubation, 0.24 mm 4-aminoantipyrine, 3.9 units of ascorbate oxidase per ml, 0.77 mm N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-3,5-dimethoxyaniline, 2 units of choline oxidase per ml, and 4.2 units of peroxidase per ml were added to the reaction mixture (final volume; 1 ml) and then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The A600 of the reaction mixture was measured. Known amounts of phosphorylcholine were assayed as described above, and a standard curve was drawn. The amount of phosphorylcholine produced by treatment with the toxin was obtained by subtracting the value for the untreated sample from the value for the phosphatase-treated sample. Determination of Sphingosine—Erythrocyte suspensions (12 × 1010 cells per ml) were incubated with or without dimethyl sulfate in a total volume of 0.5 ml of TBS at 37 °C for 60 min. After the incubation, the erythrocytes were washed by centrifugation (1,100 × g, 3 min) and suspended in TBS. The treated erythrocytes (12 × 1010 cells per ml) were then incubated with α-toxin in a total volume of 0.5 ml of TBS at 37 °C for various periods. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.8 ml of chloroform/methanol (1: 2, v/v). The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Biophysiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar) except that 0.2 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA was used instead of water (23Nakashima S. Suganuma A. Matsui A. Hattori H. Sato M. Takenaka A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The final organic phase was dried under a N2 stream and used for the analysis of sphingosine. The sphingosine content of the crude lipid fraction was determined by the method of Van Veldhoven et al. (26Van Veldhoven P.P. Bishop W.R. Bell R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Sphingosine in the crude lipid fraction was converted to C6-ceramide (N-hexanol-sphingosine) by N-acylation with hexanoic anhydride. The C6-ceramide formed by this reaction was quantitatively phosphorylated using E. coli 1,2-diacylglycerol kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. [32P]C6-ceramide 1-phosphate was then separated from other phosphorylated products by reverse-phase thin layer chromatography employing chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (10: 85:5, v/v). Labeled lipids on the plate were visualized with a Bio-Imaging Analyzer FLA-2000. The area corresponding to [32P]C6-ceramide 1-phosphate was scraped into a scintillation vial, to which 5 ml of scintillation mixture was added. Radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Known amounts of sphingosine were assayed as described above, and a standard curve was drawn. The amount of sphingosine present in 1 ml of the original sample was calculated from the radioactivity of the original sample and the standard curve. Assay of Sphingosine Kinase Activity—Sphingosine kinase activity in sheep erythrocytes was evaluated using the method described by Yatomi et al. (27Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Ohta H. Welch R.J. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with some modification. Saponin-treated erythrocytes (12 × 1010 cells per ml) were incubated with α-toxin (20 ng per ml) in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per ml and 2.5 μm sphingosine in a total volume of 0.5 ml of TBS at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) and 3 μg of S1P per ml, followed by thorough mixing and sonication for 10 min. The phases were separated by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform, 2 ml of 1 m KCl, and 0.1 ml of 7 n NH4OH, and the resultant upper phase was transferred. The lipids were extracted by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform and 0.2 ml of concentrated HCl. The organic phase was dried under a stream of N2 and analyzed for the formation of [32P]S1P from sphingosine by thin layer chromatography developed in n-butanol/acetic acid/distilled water (7:1:1, v/v). The plate was exposed to a Fuji-Imaging Plate (BAS-SR-2040) for 30 min. Labeled S1P was visualized with a Bio-Imaging Analyzer FLA-2000. The area corresponding to [32P]S1P was scraped into a vial and measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Others—Protein kinase C activity was measured using a PepTag non-radioactive protein kinase assay kit (Promega Co., Madison, WI). Multilamellar liposomes composed of SM and cholesterol were prepared according to the method of Nagahama et al. (28Nagahama M. Michiue K. Sakurai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The release of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate from liposomes was measured by the method of Nagahama et al. (28Nagahama M. Michiue K. Sakurai J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Statistical Analysis—All mean values are shown with their calculated standard error. Student's t test was used to determine the significance of differences between controls and experimental groups; a p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant. The Relationship between α-Toxin-induced Hemolysis and Variations in Phospholipids Levels in the Membranes of Sheep Erythrocytes—When α-toxin was incubated with sheep erythrocytes in TBS at 37 °C for 30 min and the mixture was then chilled at 4 °C for 10 min, the toxin at concentrations exceeding 5 ng/ml caused a dose-dependent increase in hemolysis with a maximum at 20 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). No hemolysis was evident at 37 °C, until the mixture had been cooled to 4 °C, even when the cells were incubated with 30 ng/ml of the toxin. This result shows that the toxin induced a typical hot-cold hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes, as reported by MacFarlane (30MacFarlane M.G. Biochem. J. 1950; 47: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether incubation of sheep erythrocytes with the toxin at 37 °C leads to a change in the levels of phospholipids in the cells, the cells were treated with various concentrations of the toxin at 37 °C, and then the phospholipids extracted from the cells were analyzed using one-dimensional thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, the SM content decreased with an increase in the dose of α-toxin, but no effect of the toxin on phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine levels was observed under these conditions. As reported by Nelson (19Nelson G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 144: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), phosphatidylcholine was not detected in sheep erythrocytes. SM is composed of a phosphorylcholine head group linked to ceramide by a phosphodiester bond. SMase catalyzes the cleavage of this bond and produces ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Thus, ceramide and phosphorylcholine levels were determined in cells treated with various concentrations of the toxin. As shown in Fig. 1B, α-toxin at concentrations of 5–20 ng/ml caused a dose-dependent increase in the production of ceramide and phosphorylcholine. These results show that the dose-dependent increase in the toxin-induced hemolysis was identical to that in the toxin-induced formation of ceramide and phosphorylcholine. We reported that endogenous phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-specific PLC activated by the toxin is essential for the hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes, and that the hemolysis is closely related to the generation of phosphatidic acid via the formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol in the cell membranes (8Sakurai J. Ochi S. Tanaka H. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify whether the toxin stimulates PIP2-specific PLC activity in sheep erythrocytes, the production of 1,2-diacylglycerol in sheep erythrocytes treated with various concentrations of the toxin was measured. When the erythrocytes were incubated with 20 ng/ml of the toxin at 37 °C, no 1,2-diacylglycerol was detected in the cells (data not shown). However, when cell lysates of the erythrocytes were incubated with 20 ng/ml toxin at 37 °C, the formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol and IP3 began simultaneously 20 min after the incubation and peaked after 30 min (data not shown). Treatment of the lysates with 20 ng/ml of the toxin for 30 min stimulated the formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol and IP3 (about 3.8 and 2.7 pmol/12 × 1010 cells, respectively), and the toxin at concentrations exceeding 5 ng/ml induced a rise in production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3), suggesting that it activates PIP2-specific PLC in the cells. It appears that the concentration of PIP2 hydrolyzed by this PIP2-specific PLC activity is at least 2.7 pmol/12 × 1010 cells. Thus, the concentration of PC calculated in terms of the amounts of 1,2-diacylglycerol and IP3 is predicted to be about 1 pmol/12 × 1010 cells, 10,000 times less than the level of SM calculated in terms of the amount of ceramide (Fig. 1B), if PC exists in the cells. It is likely that the toxin-induced formation of phosphorylcholine is mostly due to the hydrolysis of SM. Therefore, the level of phosphorylcholine was about three times that of ceramide (Fig. 1B), suggesting that ceramide is rapidly converted to other products. Next, we tested if the toxin-induced production of 1,2-diacylglycerol and IP3 is related to the hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes. Fig. 4 shows that U73122, an endogenous PLC inhibitor, at concentrations of 5–20 μm, inhibited the toxin-induced formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol and IP3 in a dose-dependent manner but not the toxin-induced hemolysis under these conditions.Fig. 4Effect of U73122 on hemolysis and formation of diacylglycerol and IP3 induced by α-toxin in sheep erythrocytes. Saponin-treated sheep erythrocytes (12 × 1010 cells per ml) were incubated with various concentrations of U73122 in TBS at 37 °C for 60 min and washed three times. They were then incubated with 20 ng/ml α-toxin at 37 °C for 30 min. Hemolysis (%) was evaluated a"
https://openalex.org/W2034479484,"Paneth cells secrete microbicidal enteric α-defensins into the small intestinal lumen, and cryptdin-4 (Crp4) is the most bactericidal of the mouse α-defensin peptides in vitro. Here, site-directed Arg to Asp mutations in Crp4 have been shown to attenuate or eliminate microbicidal activity against all of the bacterial species tested regardless of the Arg residue position. R31D/R32D charge-reversal mutagenesis at the C terminus and mutations at R16D/R18D, R16D/R24D, and R18D/R24D in the Crp4 polypeptide chain eliminated in vitro bactericidal activity, blocked peptide-membrane interactions, as well as Crp4-mediated membrane vesicle disruption. Lys for Arg charge-neutral substitutions in (R16K/R18K)-Crp4 did not alter the bactericidal activity relative to Crp4, showing that bactericidal activity appears not to require the guanidinium side chain of Arg at those two positions. Partial restoration of (R31D/R32D)-Crp4 bactericidal activity occurred when an electropositive Arg for Gly substitution was introduced at the peptide N terminus and the (G1R/R31D/R32D)-Crp4 peptide exhibited intermediate membrane binding capability. Also, the loss of peptide bactericidal activity in (G1D/R31D/R32D)-Crp4 and (R16D/R24D)-Crp4 mutants corresponded with diminished phospholipid vesicle disruptive activity. Fluorophore leakage from anionic phospholipid vesicles induced by the charge-reversal variants was negligible relative to Crp4 and lower than that induced by pro-Crp4, the inactive Crp4 precursor. Thus, Arg residues function as determinants of Crp4 bactericidal activity by facilitating or enabling target cell membrane disruption. The role of the Arg residues, however, was surprisingly independent of their position in the polypeptide chain. Paneth cells secrete microbicidal enteric α-defensins into the small intestinal lumen, and cryptdin-4 (Crp4) is the most bactericidal of the mouse α-defensin peptides in vitro. Here, site-directed Arg to Asp mutations in Crp4 have been shown to attenuate or eliminate microbicidal activity against all of the bacterial species tested regardless of the Arg residue position. R31D/R32D charge-reversal mutagenesis at the C terminus and mutations at R16D/R18D, R16D/R24D, and R18D/R24D in the Crp4 polypeptide chain eliminated in vitro bactericidal activity, blocked peptide-membrane interactions, as well as Crp4-mediated membrane vesicle disruption. Lys for Arg charge-neutral substitutions in (R16K/R18K)-Crp4 did not alter the bactericidal activity relative to Crp4, showing that bactericidal activity appears not to require the guanidinium side chain of Arg at those two positions. Partial restoration of (R31D/R32D)-Crp4 bactericidal activity occurred when an electropositive Arg for Gly substitution was introduced at the peptide N terminus and the (G1R/R31D/R32D)-Crp4 peptide exhibited intermediate membrane binding capability. Also, the loss of peptide bactericidal activity in (G1D/R31D/R32D)-Crp4 and (R16D/R24D)-Crp4 mutants corresponded with diminished phospholipid vesicle disruptive activity. Fluorophore leakage from anionic phospholipid vesicles induced by the charge-reversal variants was negligible relative to Crp4 and lower than that induced by pro-Crp4, the inactive Crp4 precursor. Thus, Arg residues function as determinants of Crp4 bactericidal activity by facilitating or enabling target cell membrane disruption. The role of the Arg residues, however, was surprisingly independent of their position in the polypeptide chain. Paneth cells at the base of the crypts of Lieberkühn in the small intestine secrete apically oriented granules as components of innate immunity. The secretory granules are discharged in response to cholinergic stimulation or exposure to bacteria or their antigens (1Satoh Y.

Also, Crps became implicated as components of mouse innate enteric immunity in vivo when mice that lacked matrix metalloproteinase-7, the pro-Crp-activating enzyme, were shown to have impaired host defense against oral infections (18Wilson C.L.

Remarkably, mice transgenic for human Paneth cell α-defensin HD5 expressed the minigene specifically in Paneth cells and they were immune to oral infection by high doses of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) (20Salzman N.H. Ghosh D. Huttner K.M. Paterson Y. Bevins C.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Accordingly, an understanding of structure-activity relationships in α-defensins will improve the understanding of mucosal innate immune mechanisms. To investigate the role of α-defensin primary structure in innate immunity, amino acid substitutions that alter charge were introduced into the Crp4 peptide and tested for effects on microbicidal activity and on Crp4-membrane interactions. Regardless of the site of mutagenesis, charge-reversal substitutions at Arg positions altered Crp4 bactericidal activity profoundly and the loss of activity correlated directly with quantitative effects on peptide binding to phospholipid vesicles and with peptide-induced vesicular permeabilization. Preparation of Recombinant Crp4 Peptide Variants—Recombinant Crp4 peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins from the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pET28a expression vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) as described previously (21Shirafuji Y.

In the first reaction, a mutant forward primer, e.g. Crp4-R16D-F, containing the mutant codon flanked by three natural codons was paired with reverse primer, [pMALCrp4-R], the normal reverse primer at the 3′-end of the desired sequence. In the second reaction, the mutant reverse primer, Crp4-R16D-R, the reverse complement of the mutant forward primer, was paired with the normal forward primer, [ER1-Met-C4-F], at the 5′ end of Crp4. After amplification at 95 °C for 5 min followed by successive cycles at 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles, samples of purified products from reactions 1 and 2 were combined as templates in PCR in the third reaction using the Crp4 external primers ER1-Met-C4-F and SLpMALCrp4R as amplimers. All of the mutated Crp4 constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, subcloned into pET28a plasmid DNA (Novagen, Inc.), and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene) for recombinant expression.

Bacteria (∼5 × 106 CFU/ml) were incubated with test peptides in 50 μl for 1 h in a shaking incubator at 37 °C, and then 20-μl samples of incubation mixtures were diluted 1:100 with 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4) and 50 μl of the diluted samples were plated on trypticase soy agar plates using an Autoplate 4000 (Spiral Biotech Inc., Bethesda, MD). Surviving bacteria were counted as colony forming units per milliliter after incubation at 37 °C for 12-18 h. Peptide Interactions with Phospholipid/Polydiacetylene (PDA) Mixed Vesicles—Crp4 and three mutant peptides with varied Arg charge reversals were investigated for their relative membrane perturbation activities. Colorimetric phospholipid/PDA vesicles were prepared using dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (Sigma) as described previously (22Satchell D.P. Sheynis T. Shirafuji Y. Kolusheva S. Ouellette A.J.

Vesicles consisting of two parts phospholipid to three parts PDA were prepared by dissolving the phospholipids and 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid monomer (GFS Chemicals, Powell, OH) together in chloroform/ethanol (1:1), drying in vacuo to constant weight, suspending in H2O, probe-sonicating for 3 min at 70 °C, and incubating overnight. PDA was polymerized by irradiation at 254 nm for 10-20 s, producing suspensions with an intense blue appearance. Peptides (0.2-20 μm) were added to 60 μl of vesicle solutions (0.5 mm total lipid) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and diluted to 1 ml, and spectra were acquired at 28 °C between 400 and 700 nm on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer (Jasco Corp., Tokyo, Japan) using a 1-cm optical path cell. Blue-to-red color transitions within the vesicle solutions, defined as the percent colorimetric response (%CR), were calculated as described previously (22Satchell D.P. Sheynis T. Shirafuji Y.

LUV of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) were loaded with a fluorophore/quencher system (27Smolarsky M. Teitelbaum D. Sela M. Gitler C. J. Immunol.

Vesicles were separated from unencapsulated ANTS/DPX by gel-permeation chromatography with 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 4.5 mm NaOH (260 mosm/liter, pH 7.4) as column eluant. Vesicular suspensions diluted with eluant buffer to ∼74 μm of total lipid were incubated with peptides at ambient temperature. Time-dependent fluorescence produced by ANTS release was monitored at 520 nm (excitation at 353 nm) as described previously (24Satchell D.P. Sheynis T. Kolusheva S. Cummings J.E. Vanderlick T.K.

Purity was verified by analytical reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (data not shown) and acid-urea-PAGE analyses (Fig. 1B). The molecular masses of individual recombinant peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and they matched the respective theoretical values. Thus, the purified recombinant peptides were homogeneous (Fig. 1B) and their biochemical features were consistent with the modifications introduced to the natural Crp4 molecule (29Selsted M.E. Genet. Eng. 1993; 15: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As a first step toward investigating structure-activity relationships in Crp4, the in vitro microbicidal activities of Crp4, pro-Crp4, and selected N-terminal Crp4 variants were measured against a panel of bacterial test species (data not shown) (24Satchell D.P. Sheynis T. Kolusheva S. Cummings J.E. Vanderlick T.K. Jelinek R. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The overall bactericidal activities of the N-terminal variants differed only slightly over a range of 0.6-10 μg/ml of peptide as observed previously (24Satchell D.P. Sheynis T. Kolusheva S.

In contrast to the bactericidal activities of these mature Crp4 peptide variants, pro-Crp4 lacks microbicidal activity because matrix metalloproteinase-7-mediated proteolysis is required for Crp4 activation (18Wilson C.L.

Although the (G1D)-Crp4 peptide was consistently less active at ≤5 μg/ml of peptide (data not shown), modifications at the Crp4 N terminus had very modest effects on bactericidal activity (24Satchell D.P.

Modifications at the Crp4 C terminus—Because the Cys-1 to Cys-6-disulfide bond common to α-defensins places the Crp4 N and C termini in proximity (13Selsted M.E. Harwig S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4003-4007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we prepared a series of Crp4 peptide variants with charge-modified C termini including (R31D/R32D)-Crp4, (R31G/R32G)-Crp4, (R31V/R32V)-Crp4, and (ΔR31/R32)-Crp4 (Fig. 1). Bactericidal activity assays of these variants showed that deleting the two C-terminal Arg residues or converting them to Gly or Val altered peptide activity variably depending on the bacterial target species (Fig. 2, compare B with D). In contrast, however, the R31D/R32D charge-reversal mutation eliminated bactericidal activity, even against the S. typhimurium PhoP-strain (data not shown), which is very sensitive to membrane-active cationic peptides (Fig. 2) (30Fields P.I. Groisman E.A. Heffron F. Science. 1989; 243: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 31Miller S.I. Pulkkinen W.S. Selsted M.E. Mekalanos J.J. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3706-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, wild-type S. typhimurium and the PhoP-constitutive (PhoPc) CS022 strain were less sensitive to all of the peptides (data not shown). Additional (R31D/R32D)-Crp4 variants with modified N termini were prepared and analyzed including an Arg1 for Gly1 substitution ((G1R/R31D/R32D)-Crp4) and an Asp1 for Gly1 variant ((G1D/R31D/R32D)-Crp4). Under the conditions of the assays, no bactericidal activity was detected with the (G1D/R31D/R32D)-Crp4 peptide but the (G1R/R31D/R32D)-Crp4 activity improved with the added electropositive side chain at the N terminus (Fig. 3). These findings showed that modifications of combined N- and C-terminal charge can modulate Crp4 bactericidal activity. To investigate the effect of added C-terminal Arg residues on Crp4 bactericidal activity, additional modifications were introduced at the Crp4 C terminus. C57/BL6 mice express a Crp4 variant (Crp4(B6b)) that has four Arg residues at its C terminus (21Shirafuji Y. Tanabe H. Satchell D.P. Henschen-Edman A. Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7910-7919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but because Crp4 and Crp4(B6b) differ at several other positions, the specific role of C-terminal charge in these peptides cannot be compared directly. Accordingly, the natural Crp4 C terminus was extended by two Arg residues to place the Crp4-(B6b) C terminus in the context of the Crp4 primary structure. The peptide, (Arg-33/Arg-34)-Crp4, had greater in vitro bactericidal peptide activity than Crp4 against E. coli and wild-type and PhoPc S. typhimurium strains (Fig. 4), suggesting that C-terminal charge could be a determinant of bactericidal activity. However, the Crp4(B6b) molecule lacks the Pro-30 residue present in Crp4 between Cys-29 and Arg-31. Therefore, the effect of the Pro-30 residue was tested by assaying the bactericidal activity of (ΔPro-30/Arg-33/Arg-34)-Crp4, a variant of (Arg-33/Arg-34)-Crp4 from which Pro-30 was deleted (Fig. 1). (ΔPro-30/Arg-33/Arg-34)-Crp4 was less active than Crp4 and (Arg-33/Arg-34)-Crp4 against E. coli and S. typhimurium PhoPc (Fig. 4), and the results in Fig. 4 also are representative of the relative bactericidal activities of these peptides against V. cholera, S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes (data not shown). Thus, addition of Arg residues at the C terminus per se is not sufficient to improve peptide activity in the absence of proline at residue position 30. Because the R31D/R32D C-terminal charge reversal eliminated Crp4 bactericidal activity, the effects of charge alterations at other residue positions in the Crp4 polypeptide chain were studied to test whether the effects were specific to C-terminal modification. Charge Reversal at Arg Positions Result in Loss-of-function—Crp4 mutants with double Asp for Arg substitutions were introduced at three additional Arg pairs, purified, and assayed for bactericidal peptide activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). As was observed for (R31D/R32D)-Crp4, the R16D/R18D, R16D/R24D, and R18D/R24D variants of Crp4 all lacked bactericidal activity under the conditions of these in vitro assays (Fig. 5). Thus, the loss of activity by charge reversal is not a specific effect at the C terminus, because all of the peptides with double charge-reversal mutations were inactive. Perhaps, Asp for Arg substitutions eliminate bactericidal activity by reducing the overall electropositivity of the Crp4 peptide. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Arg residues at specific positions are required for Crp4 bactericidal activity because all of the mutations introduced resulted in equivalent loss-of-function independent of the position of the replacements. To determine whether a specific requirement exists for the guanidinium group of the Arg side chain in Crp4 or whether charge-neutral substitutions at Arg positions would result in peptides with equivalent bactericidal activity, we prepared (R16K/R18K)-Crp4 (Fig. 1A) and evaluated its antimicrobial activity. Because all of the Crp4 charge-reversal mutants were attenuated similarly including (R16D/R18D)-Crp4, the (R16K/R18K)-Crp4 internal charge-neutral mutant was taken to be representative of such peptide alterations. As stated earlier, the Lys for Arg substituted peptide was purified to homogeneity as"

Previous results showed that the H3 domain of syntaxin-1A (S1A) binds to ENaC to reduce N, supporting a role for S1A in the regulation of ENaC trafficking. The aim of this study was to determine whether S1A-induced reductions in ENaC current also result from interactions between cell surface ENaC and S1A that alter ENaC Po. Injection of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-H3 S1A fusion protein into ENaC-expressing Xenopus oocytes inhibited whole cell Na+ current (INa) by 33% within 5 min. This effect was dose-dependent, with a Ki of 7 ng/μl (∼200 nm). In contrast, injection of GST alone or a H3 domain-deleted GST-S1A fusion protein had no effect on INa. In cell-attached patch clamp experiments, GST-H3 acutely decreased ENaC Po by 30%, whereas GST-S1A Δ H3 was without effect. Further analysis revealed that ENaC mean closed time was significantly prolonged by S1A. Interestingly, GST-H3 had no effect on channel activity of an ENaC pore mutant that constitutively gates open (Po ≅ 1.0), supporting the idea that S1A alters the closed state of ENaC and indicating that the actions of S1A on ENaC trafficking and gating can be separated experimentally. This study indicates that, in addition to a primary effect on ENaC trafficking, S1A interacts with cell surface ENaC to rapidly decrease channel gating.

The channel is composed of three homologous subunits (α-, β-, and γ-ENaC); each consists of two transmembrane domains, short cytoplasmic N and C termini and a large extracellular loop (1Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). The expression and assembly of all three subunits is required for fully functional ENaC channels, which are characterized by an ionic selectivity of Li+ > Na+ »K+, a low single channel conductance (∼ 5 picoSiemens), and a high affinity blockade by the diuretic amiloride (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The channel is thought to associate as a tetramer composed of 2α:1β;1γ (3Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O.

Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The control of whole body Na+ homeostasis is achieved via regulation of the number (N) and open probability (Po) of ENaC channels in the apical membranes of distal nephron principal cells. Recently, many of the important mechanisms that govern ENaC N through endocytic processes have been elucidated (for review, see Ref. 6Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, comparatively little is known regarding the regulation of ENaC insertion into the apical membrane. Previous work suggests SNARE proteins play an important role in the regulated insertion of ENaC (7Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30345-30348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cognate, pairwise interactions of SNARE proteins, are responsible for membrane vesicle docking and fusion in all intracellular trafficking steps (for review, see Ref. 9Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Central to the process of vesicle fusion at the nerve terminus are interactions between the coiled-coil domains (“SNARE motifs”) of syntaxin, SNAP-25 and VAMP2 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 2), which together form an extremely stable core complex that is thought to promote the membrane fusion event. The SNARE motif of S1A is contained within the third helical (H3) domain, which we have shown to bind the ENaC subunit C termini, resulting in a decrease in cell surface ENaC expression that inhibits Na+ transport (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). S1A has also been shown to interact with other channel proteins to influence their insertion into the plasma membrane, including CFTR (10Peters K.W. Qi J. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 277: 174-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Kv 2.1 (11Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsuk S. Lotan I. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17532-17538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to its effects on ENaC trafficking, the binding of S1A to ion channels in the plasma membrane has been proposed to alter their kinetic properties. Naren et al. (12Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) demonstrate that S1A acutely decreased whole cell CFTR currents in epithelial cells. The activation rate of Kv 2.1 was significantly prolonged in the presence of S1A (11Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsuk S. Lotan I. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17532-17538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and various gating effects have been described for the family of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) (for review, see Ref. 13Atlas D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of S1A binding on channel gating is unclear, although it has been postulated that, at least in VGCC and Kv 2.1, modification of channel kinetics serves as a further means of controlling the duration and magnitude of vesicular exocytosis (11Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsuk S. Lotan I. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17532-17538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Atlas D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine whether S1A influences ENaC channel activity. In a previous study injection of a GST-H3 fusion protein into ENaC-expressing oocytes caused a large decrease in current after 1 h that was due to a concomitant decrease in ENaC N (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to influencing channel insertion, it is also possible that S1A binds to ENaC channels resident in the surface membrane to alter their Po.To investigate this possibility we examined the acute effects of injecting the H3 domain of S1A into ENaC-expressing Xenopus oocytes during whole cell and single channel patch clamp recordings. We demonstrate that S1A causes a rapid, dose-dependent decrease in whole cell current via a decrease in ENaC open probability. Channel Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Plasmids containing mouse ENaC cDNAs (generously provided by the laboratory of Dr. Thomas Kleyman, University of Pittsburgh) were linearized, and cRNAs were synthesized in vitro using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ T3 cRNA synthesis kit (Ambion Inc. Austin, TX). Oocyte isolation and RNA injection were performed as described previously (14Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1887-C1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.25–1 ng of cRNA encoding each ENaC subunit was injected into stage V or VI oocytes. Expression proceeded at 18 °C in low sodium-modified Barth’s solution (5 mm NaCl, 83 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3), 0.41 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin; pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl) for 1–3 days before ENaC currents were recorded. Glutathione S-Transferase-S1A Fusion Proteins—Syntaxin 1A fusion proteins containing GST at the N terminus were generated in BL21-competent cells; conditions for bacterial growth and fusion protein purification were described previously (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). GST-H3 contains the S1A H3 domain (S1A185–265) and GST-ΔH3 (S1A1–189) truncates both the H3 and TM domains from full-length S1A. These fusion proteins were injected into oocytes during electrophysiological recordings using a nanoliter injector (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Whole Cell Electrophysiology—Whole cell Na+ currents were measured by 2-electrode voltage clamp of ENaC expressing oocytes bathed in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). In experiments investigating the effect of protein injection, oocytes were clamped at–100 mV until the basal current stabilized. An injection tip was then inserted into the oocyte, and current levels were monitored for another 2 min before injection of 23 nl of a GST fusion protein (see above) or GST alone. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents (INa) were recorded as the difference in current before and after the addition of 10 μm amiloride. Amiloride or S1A have no effect on whole cell currents in oocytes not expressing ENaC (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); therefore, the current inhibition produced by S1A is directed at amiloride-sensitive currents arising from ENaC expression. Single Channel Recording—Before patch clamp recordings, the vitelline membrane of ENaC-expressing oocytes was removed by mechanical dissection after cell shrinkage in a hypertonic solution (200 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH). Devitellinized oocytes were immediately transferred to the patch bath (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3), 0.4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and left to recover a minimum of 10 min before patching. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass (G150–3, Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co. Novato, CA). After fire polishing, patch pipettes had resistances between 5 and 10 megaohms when filled with the pipette solution (96 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 3.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm CaCl2; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Single channel currents were recorded in the cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp technique using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and interfaced via a DigiData 1322a acquisition board (Axon Instruments) to a Micron Electronics PC (Nampa, ID). Data were acquired at 1 kHz and stored directly on the hard drive of the PC using pClamp 8.1 (Axon Instruments) software before digitizing at 100 Hz for subsequent analysis and presentation. The product of the number of channels and the channel open probability (NPo) was calculated from amplitude histograms generated using Biopatch software (Version 3.42, Bio-Logic) as the mean total current (I) divided by the single channel current amplitude (i), or NPo = I/i. Open probability (Po) was then calculated by dividing NPo by the total number of channels in the patch (N) estimated from the number of detectable peaks in amplitude histograms generated from records of sufficient duration (typically at least 7 min). This approach provides 95% confidence in determining the correct N value based on methodology developed by Marunaka and Eaton (15Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether experimental modifications alter Po by affecting the channel open or closed state, mean open and closed times of N channels were calculated from topen=TNPon/2(Eq. 1) tclosed=TN(1-Po)n/2(Eq. 2) where T represents the total recording time, and n represents the number of transitions as described previously for ENaC (15Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CFTR (16Hallows K.R. McCane J.E. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 998-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is important to consider that this calculation represents the numerical average of all open or closed times and is not a measure of the residency time in that particular state. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E., and statistical significant (p ≤ 0.05) was determined using analysis of variance. Syntaxin 1A Rapidly Inhibits Whole Cell Na+ Current—We previously demonstrated that injection of a GST-H3 syntaxin 1A fusion protein into ENaC-expressing oocytes produced an 80% decrease in Na+ current 1 h after its injection. This current inhibition was associated with a concomitant decrease in ENaC cell surface expression, consistent with a S1A-induced block of ENaC trafficking to the plasma membrane (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data showed also that the inhibition of INa by GST-H3 is quantitatively indistinguishable from that observed when full-length S1A is co-expressed with ENaC. Therefore, to determine whether syntaxin had an acute functional effect on ENaC channels residing in the plasma membrane, we injected ENaC-expressing oocytes with GST-H3 during whole cell Na+ current recordings performed using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Injection of GST-H3 (final estimated concentration = 25 ng/μl) caused a rapid inhibition of Na+ current that reached a relative plateau after 5 min (Fig. 1A). In 8 experiments GST-H3 elicited a mean decrease in current of 1.4 ± 0.3 μA (33 ± 8% inhibition) 5 min after its injection (Fig. 1C). Subsequent amiloride (10 μm) perfusion inhibited the remainder of the current, confirming that the whole cell current was ENaC-dependent and that S1A did not completely block channel activity over this time period. To control for the physical effect of protein injection during recording, the effect of introducing GST was examined. In contrast to results with GST-H3, injection of GST alone had no significant effect on Na+ current (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the H3 domain (SNARE motif) was responsible for this rapid current inhibition we examined the effects of the syntaxin H3 deletion fusion protein, GST-ΔH3. Similar to GST injection, GST-ΔH3 did not significantly affect INa (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the H3 domain of S1A is responsible for this acute inhibitory effect. The rapid inhibition of ENaC by GST-H3 exhibited a dose-dependent relationship with a Ki of 7 ng/μl, corresponding to a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of ∼200 nm (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the H3 domain of syntaxin 1A acutely and selectively regulates ENaC channel activity. The rapidity of inhibition (<5 min) is consistent with an alteration in the gating of plasma membrane ENaC channels; however, a larger component of Na+ current remains sensitive to amiloride after this acute effect, suggesting that another action of S1A is responsible for the remainder of the 80% inhibition in Na+ current observed 1 h post-injection. Na+ Current Inhibition Is Composed of Two Components— Results obtained from the short term recordings described above suggest that two processes may be responsible for the overall current inhibition observed in prior studies 1 h post-GST-H3 injection. To test this hypothesis, we measured amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in oocytes at 10-min intervals for 1 h after injection of GST-H3. Fig. 2 shows that ENaC current inhibition over this period is best fit by a double exponential relation; an initial rapid decrease over the first 10 min accounts for 29 ± 8% inhibition of the initial INa, and a slower, long term decline reduces current to 33 ± 8% of the initial value after 1 h. These results suggest that S1A inhibits ENaC current via two different mechanisms, which are likely composed of an acute decrease in the Po of plasma membrane ENaC followed by a slower reduction in cell surface channel number as was demonstrated previously (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Syntaxin Injection Alters ENaC Channel Activity—Rapid changes in whole cell current are likely to reflect alterations in channel Po. To determine whether the initial inhibition of ENaC current by S1A was due to effects on ENaC gating, we recorded single channel currents from cell-attached patches on ENaC-expressing oocytes before and after injection of S1A fusion proteins. Fig. 3A shows a representative recording of channel activity before injection of GST-H3, obtained at –Vp = –80 mV, to generate inward Na+ currents (downward current deflections). The amplitude histogram generated from this trace (Fig. 3C) was used to calculate a Po of 0.46 as described under “Experiment Procedures.” This value is in agreement with the mean Po for ENaC reported in other studies of ∼0.5 (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Channel activity was continuously recorded at the same holding potential after injecting GST-H3. Fig. 3B illustrates a 2-min trace from the same patch recorded 3 min post-GST-H3 injection. Channel activity was significantly reduced compared with the pre-injection period, with a calculated Po of 0.34. Compiling the data from six such recordings yielded a GST-H3-induced decrease in ENaC Po from an average of 0.51 ± 0.02 to 0.36 ± 0.04 (Fig. 3E). This represents an average decrease of 30 ± 7%. This value is within the range observed for the rapid change in whole cell current, demonstrating that the acute reduction in ENaC INa by S1A is due to a decrease in ENaC channel activity. To determine whether these changes in ENaC gating were mediated by interactions between the H3 domain of S1A and ENaC, we tested the effect of injecting ΔH3-GST during cell-attached ENaC recordings. Representative traces of single channel currents are shown before (Fig. 4A) and after (Fig. 4B) injecting ΔH3-GST. Subsequent analysis revealed that Po values were similar in control and treatment conditions (0.48 versus 0.45). The average ENaC Po from several experiments did not change significantly after ΔH3-GST injection (Fig. 4E), suggesting that the H3 domain is responsible for the observed inhibition of channel activity. Syntaxin Decreases ENaC Open Probability by Increasing Closed Time—A reduction in Po can be achieved by decreasing channel open time or increasing closed time. These parameters can be measured readily by kinetic analysis of patches containing a single channel. However, kinetic analysis of ENaC activity is complicated by its slow closed-open transition rates and a high degree of Po variability (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we rarely obtained patches containing a single ENaC channel under our experimental conditions. Nevertheless, a method for measuring the mean open time of multiple channels in a patch has been described previously for ENaC, providing a means to distinguish whether S1A alters Po by primarily interacting with the channel open or closed state (15Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We employed this analysis on patches containing ≤5 channels to determine the basis for S1A modulation of ENaC Po. The mean open time for ENaC recordings made before GST-H3 injection was 6.0 ± 1.0 s. This value was not significantly different from the mean open time calculated from recordings made 5 min after GST-H3 injection (Fig. 5). This indicates that S1A does not reduce ENaC Po by decreasing channel open time. In contrast, the analysis revealed that the mean closed time increased significantly from 5.6 ± 0.6 to 11.1 ± 1.6 s after GST-H3 injection (Fig. 5). Therefore, S1A decreases ENaC Po by significantly prolonging the mean closed time of the channel while having no effect on mean open time. Pore Mutation Prevents Inhibition of Channel Gating—To further characterize the effect of S1A on ENaC channel activity, we expressed an ENaC construct with a mutation in an extracellular loop near the second transmembrane domain of the β subunit. At the so-called DEG position in ENaC-related Caenorhabditis elegans channels, mutating the native alanine to a residue that contains a bulky or charged side chain causes neuronal swelling and degeneration due to enhanced channel activity (17Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Snyder et al. (18Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have since reported that mutating DEG residues in ENaC channel subunits produces channels with inherent Po fixed near unity. We examined the effect of S1A on the gating properties of mouse ENaC channels expressing a β subunit with serine in the DEG position mutated to a lysine (β-S518K). Consistent with data from a similar mutation made in human ENaC (18Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), oocytes expressing mouse ENaC channels containing β-S518K had approximately twice the amiloride-sensitive whole cell current of those expressing wild type ENaC (Fig. 6C). Subsequent patch clamp analysis confirmed that this gain of function was due to an increase in Po from an average of 0.5 in wild type ENaC to ∼0.97 in β-S518K (Fig. 7A). To determine the effect of S1A on this gating mutant we injected GST-H3 into oocytes expressing β-S518K ENaC channels. Fig. 6A illustrates a representative trace of whole cell current from this experiment. GST-H3 did not elicit the rapid decrease in INa of β-S518K ENaC over the initial 5-min recording period observed in oocytes expressing wt ENaC. In paired wild type controls current decreased by an average of 24 ± 2% in response to H3 domain injection, whereas β-S518K ENaC currents exhibited no significant change (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, similar to wild type ENaC, the amiloride-sensitive β-S518K ENaC currents measured 1 h after GST-H3 injection were significantly reduced (Fig. 6C). This likely results from the decrease in channel surface expression observed 1 h after GST-H3 injection with wild type ENaC (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that S1A still binds to β-S518K ENaC to perturb its trafficking but is unable to modify channel activity.Fig. 7GST-H3 has no effect on β-S518K single channel ENaC current. Single channel currents were recorded from oocytes expressing β-S518K ENaC by patch clamp in the cell-attached configuration as in Figs. 3 and 4. A, representative recording of β-S518K ENaC single channel currents before injection of GST-H3. B, recording from the same patch as shown in A 3 min after GST-H3 injection. Amplitude histograms generated from traces A and B are shown in C and D, respectively. The experiment was performed three additional times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that GST-H3 had no effect on β-S518K ENaC gating, we measured single channel activity in oocytes expressing β-S518K ENaC before and after injection of GST-H3. Fig. 7A illustrates that β-S518K ENaC channels remain locked open with brief and infrequent closing events after GST-H3 injection. The Po was estimated at 0.97 from the amplitude histogram (Fig. 7C). From the record in Fig. 7B and the corresponding amplitude histogram (Fig. 7D) it is apparent that GST-H3 had no significant effect on β-S518K ENaC gating. Channels recorded from the same patch 3 min post-GST-H3 injection remained largely in the open state. These results demonstrate that S1A has no rapid effect on β-S518K ENaC currents as it is unable to modify channel kinetics. Recently, we demonstrated that the H3 domain of S1A interacts physically with the ENaC subunit C termini to decrease whole cell Na+ current by reducing plasma membrane ENaC channel density (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study we describe an additional regulatory role of S1A on ENaC channel gating. Injection of the GST-H3 S1A fusion protein into ENaC-expressing oocytes during whole cell Na+ current recordings resulted in a rapid inhibitory effect on ENaC currents. This effect was examined further using the cell-attached patch clamp technique, which revealed that the rapid inhibition of INa by S1A was due to a significant reduction in ENaC Po, which appears to be produced by a S1A-induced stabilization of the closed channel conformation. These effects were not observed in a gating mutant, β-S518K ENaC, which is characterized by constitutively open channel activity. These results suggest that S1A regulates both ENaC trafficking to the plasma membrane and the activity of channels at the cell surface. SNARE proteins play an important role in the trafficking of vesicles to target membranes. Interactions between the SNARE motifs of cognate SNARE proteins on the target (t) and carrier vesicle membranes interact to facilitate vesicle docking, subsequent membrane fusion, and cargo delivery (9Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins have been shown to co-ordinate the trafficking of several ion channels and transporters, including aquaporin 2 (19Gouraud S. Laera A. Calamita G. Carmosino M. Procino G. Rossetto O.

These studies confirm that regulation of transporter trafficking in a variety of cell types is dependent on the SNARE vesicular transport machinery. A rapidly growing body of literature indicates that, in addition to their role in trafficking, SNARE proteins functionally interact with many ion channels to control their gating properties (11Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsuk S. Lotan I. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17532-17538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Naren A.P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The understanding of this process is perhaps most advanced in studies of the VGCC of neuronal tissues. It has been proposed that physical interactions between SNARE components and VGCC serve to regulate presynaptic Ca2+ entry via alterations in gating. This interaction would provide a means to finely regulate vesicle membrane fusion and coordinate this process with Ca2+ entry, which signals secretion (13Atlas D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This so-called “excitosome” model has been extended to include other voltage-dependent channels of neuronal tissues such as Kv 2.1 (11Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsuk S. Lotan I.

In addition, channels from non-excitable cells are regulated via interactions with SNARE proteins. Naren et al. (26Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) report that the H3 domain of S1A binds to the N terminus of CFTR to inhibit cAMP-stimulated Cl– currents. In addition to their role in trafficking these studies argue for an additional role of SNARE proteins in regulating channel activity. The results of the present study extend our previous observations, indicating that S1A regulates plasma membrane ENaC density to include an additional effect on channel gating. These actions can be separated temporally into a rapid inhibition of channel activity that occurs within minutes, whereas changes in N take place over a longer time course. The prolonged and progressive rate of decline of current, illustrated by the second exponential component of Fig. 2, is consistent with the expected rate of ENaC endocytosis from the plasma membrane. This time -course agrees with published endocytic rates for ENaC in oocytes treated with brefeldin A to block progression of the channel to the cell surface (27Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This finding implies that the S1A-induced decrease in N is due to a block of ENaC channel insertion. How this trafficking effect of expressed S1A relates to the physiological role of this t-SNARE in apical membrane ENaC insertion and to the physical interaction between ENaC and S1A remains unclear. Overexpression of a syntaxin isoform (or expression of its essential protein interaction motif, the H3 domain) commonly inhibits the vesicle trafficking step in which that isoform serves as the t-SNARE for vesicle fusion (28Scales S.J. Chen Y.A. Yoo B.Y. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is due to selective disruption of the stoichiometric protein interactions required for formation of a specific SNARE fusion complex. Yet, our previous findings argue for an action that is more specific, since elimination of the S1A binding sites on the ENaC subunits abolished the effect of syntaxin on ENaC trafficking (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the S1A inhibition is related to the physical presence of ENaC in the trafficking vesicles. Disruption of SNARE protein interactions by overexpressed S1A should lack specificity for vesicle cargo; in this case, ENaC. Rather, the domain-specific interactions of ENaC cytoplasmic tails with S1A may reflect an involvement of the channel in its own trafficking through interactions of ENaC with SNARE proteins. Further understanding of this phenomenon will require definition of whether S1A is the t-SNARE that normally mediates apical ENaC insertion or whether it is a modulator of insertion mediated by another apical t-SNARE. Butterworth et al. (29Butterworth M.B. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P. Edinger R.S. FASEB J. 2003; 17 (Abstr. 585.10): 914PubMed Google Scholar) find that syntaxins 1A and 3 are expressed at the apical membranes of cortical collecting duct cells, and it will be important to determine whether ENaC insertion shows t-SNARE specificity at this site. The rapid inhibition of ENaC current (first exponential of Fig. 2) also is likely to be associated with a physical interaction of S1A and the channel subunit C termini. This conclusion is supported by the lack of effect on whole cell ENaC current or single channel activity of a S1A variant in which the H3 domain was deleted. GST-H3 prolonged the mean closed time of the channel, suggesting that the binding of H3 stabilizes the channel closed state, resulting in the observed decrease in Po. The results obtained with the β-S518K ENaC mutant support this interpretation rather than an inhibitory effect of S1A on the channel open state. Because β -S518K ENaC is essentially locked in the open state, a reduction in open time would have been expected if S1A decreased Po via an interaction with the open conformation. In β-S518K ENaC, S1A presumably does not have access to the closed state that is stabilized by its binding, and therefore, it would not be expected to alter ENaC kinetics, as demonstrated. Nevertheless, β-S518K ENaC currents were inhibited 1 h after injection of the S1A H3 domain, indicating that syntaxin has access to its binding sites at the C termini of the mutant channel and that the β-S518K mutation does not alter the action of S1A on ENaC trafficking. Thus, the trafficking and gating effects of S1A can be separated. Work by Ganeshan et al. (30Ganeshan R. Di A. Nelson D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2876-2885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrates that it was possible to identify separate sites on S1A that affected the ability of syntaxin to modulate CFTR activity as opposed to its ability to assemble into SNARE complexes. It will be interesting to determine also whether similar or separate sites on S1A and ENaC mediate the effects of syntaxin on ENaC gating and trafficking. Both effects may require or be influenced by interactions of S1A with other SNARE proteins. For example, Michaelevski et al. (25Michaelevski I. Chikvashvili D. Tsuk S. Singer-Lahat D. Kang Y. Linial M. Gaisano H.Y. Fili O. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34320-34330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) report that Kv 2.1 channel activity is differentially regulated depending on whether S1A is expressed alone or in combination with its partner t-SNARE, SNAP-25, and similar data have been obtained for S1A and SNAP-23 interactions with CFTR (31Cormet-Boyaka E. Di A. Chang S.Y. Naren A.P. Tousson A. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12477-12482Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). At present, we do not know whether SNAP-23 modifies the action of S1A on ENaC trafficking or gating. The action of S1A on ENaC gating may represent a means of controlling overall channel activity during rapid apical insertion of ENaC channels, a process that underlies the regulation of Na+ transport by ENaC agonists (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). A similar concept has been raised in regard to the regulation of neurotransmitter exocytosis at the nerve terminus, where S1A participates in the fusion of vesicles but then may limit further Ca2+ entry via inhibition of VGCC gating (13Atlas D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The rapid response of ENaC-expressing epithelia to a Na+ transport agonist is often biphasic, a transient increase followed by recovery to a sustained plateau. These kinetics may reflect feedback inhibition of Na+ entry when channel insertion is rapidly stimulated. Increased cellular Na+ concentrations generally elicit a decrease in ENaC-mediated apical membrane conductance in epithelial cells, and this cellular protective mechanism balances apical Na+ entry with basolateral Na+ extrusion (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The possibility that S1A may be involved in feedback regulation related to ENaC trafficking was suggested by our previous data, which showed that the binding of S1A to the ENaC C-terminal tails was sensitive to elevated Na+ or Ca2+ concentrations in the binding buffer (8Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our data support the concept that S1A interactions with ENaC serve to regulate both channel activity and channel trafficking. Syntaxin 1A is potentially a component of the apical SNARE machinery that mediates ENaC insertion; alternately, it modulates this process mediated by other SNARE components. Independent of its possible roles in ENaC trafficking, S1A is also a negative regulator of ENaC gating, which may control channel activity in relation to the status of SNARE interactions and the availability of free syntaxin 1A.

Previously we demonstrated that the interaction between the suppressor for Gal 1 (SUG1) and nuclear receptors, the vitamin D receptor, or the pregnane X receptor was involved in proteasome-mediated degradation. In our recent experiments, we examined the potential role of SUG1 in the proteasome-mediated degradation of estrogen receptors (ER)α and -β. Both ERs interacted with SUG1 in a ligand-dependent manner. Functionally, the overexpression of SUG1 inhibited both ERα- and ERβ-mediated transcription in the presence of ligands. Transient expression studies demonstrated that the overexpression of wild-type SUG1 generated proteolytic fragments of both ERs and that these products were blocked by a proteasome inhibitor. The overexpression of SUG1 also enhanced the formation of ubiquitinated proteins of both ERs in the presence of ligand. On the other hand, bisphenol A (BSA), which activated ER-mediated transcription, did not enhance the interaction between ERβ and SUG1. Furthermore, the degradation of ERβ was much slower in the presence of BSA than in the presence of estradiol or phthalate, which is another endocrine-disrupting chemical. Also, BSA had no effect on the formation of proteolytic fragments of ERβ, and neither did it have any effect on the ubiquitination of ERβ. These findings indicate that the ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of both ER proteins may involve the interaction of SUG1 with both ERs. Moreover, BSA strongly blocked the ubiquitination and degradation of ERβ compared with estradiol, suggesting that BSA may affect the ERβ-mediated transcription of target genes by inhibiting ERβ degradation.

Steroid hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, as well as non-steroid hormones, vitamin D, retinoids, thyroid hormone, and prostanoids regulate their specific genes by binding to their specific receptors, which comprises the nuclear receptor superfamily.

Together, these finding suggested that SUG1 might be involved in the degradation of nuclear receptors by proteasome.Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been defined as exogenous agents that interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of the body's natural hormones, which are responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis, reproduction, development, and/or behavior (16Kavlock R.J. Daston G.P. DeRosa C. Fenner-Crisp P. Gray L.E. Moore J. Rolland R. Scott G. Sheehan D.M. Sinks T. Tilson H.A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1996; 104: 715-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). These chemicals can alter endocrine functions through a variety of mechanisms, including steroid hormone receptor-mediated changes in protein synthesis, interference with membrane receptor binding, steroidogenesis, or the synthesis of other hormones (17Cooper R.L. Kavlock R.J. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although major chemicals, such as phthalates, alkylphenols, bisphenol A (BSA), and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, have been shown to disrupt estrogenic actions mainly through their binding to estrogen or androgen receptors (17Cooper R.L. Kavlock R.J. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether EDCs directly affect endocrine functions in vivo.We have examined the potential role of SUG1 in the proteasome-mediated degradation of ERα and ERβ. In this aspect, we checked whether or not SUG1 interacts with ERs in the presence of several ligands, including estradiol and EDCs, which activate ER-mediated transcription. Next, the effects of ligands for ERs on the steady states of both ERs were examined because we had observed a different effect of BSA, an EDC, on the interaction between SUG1 and ERβ compared with the interaction between SUG1 and ERα. We also examined the effect of SUG1 on ER-mediated transcription in the presence of these ligands. Furthermore, we used a transient transfection assay to determine whether or not the interaction between SUG1 and either of the ERs is involved in this degradation system. Finally, we checked whether or not SUG1 plays a role in the ubiquitination of ER proteins. The results of these inquiries indicate that the interactions between ERs and SUG1 may be involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of ER proteins. Moreover, BSA may affect ERβ-mediated transcription of target genes by inhibiting ERβ degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—BSA, phthalic acid bis(2-ethylhexel ester) (phthalate), 4-pregnene-3,20-dione (progesterone), and 17β-estradiol (1,3,5(10)-estratriene-3,17β-diol) (estradiol) were purchased from Sigma. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) was kindly provided by Dr. M. R. Uskokovic (Hoffmann-La Roche). 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane was obtained from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All endocrine-disrupting chemicals and ligands were added simultaneously to the culture media at the indicated concentrations. Primary rabbit polyclonal antibody for ERα (MC-20), which reacts with mouse, rat, and human ERα but does not cross-react with ERβ, and for ERβ (H-150), which reacts with mouse, rat, and human ERβ but does not cross-react with ERα, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibody for SUG1, which reacts with mouse and human SUG1, was generated against the N-terminal amino acid sequence of SUG1 (36-NDKSQNLRRL-45) (Sigma Genosys Japan K.K., Sapporo, Japan). Two plasmids, pSG5-hERα and ERE2-G-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), were kindly provided by Dr. S. Kato (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), and cDNA for hERβ was a gift from Dr. S. Mosselman (N.V. Organon, Oss, The Netherlands) and was subcloned into pSG5 expression vector. Wild-type and mutant (K196H) mSUG1 constructs have been described previously (10Masuyama H. MacDonald P.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ishikawa cells were kindly provided by Dr. M. Nishida (Tsukuba University, Tochigi, Japan). HEC-1 cells and COS-7 cells were provided by the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan).Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Studies—COS-7, HEC-1, and Ishikawa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red. The medium was supplemented with 10% charcoal-striped fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of a reporter gene construct ((ERE)2-G-CAT) and 0.5 μg of a receptor expression vector (pSG5-ERα or ERβ) or of an empty vector (pSG5). Ishikawa cells were transfected with 1 μg of a reporter gene construct ((ERE)2-G-CAT) or of an empty vector (G-CAT) without the ER expression vector. For SUG1 expression, pcDNA3-SUG1 (wild-type or K196H) or pcDNA3 alone was transfected into the cells. All transfections were liposome-mediated by the use of lipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were treated for 36 h, either with the vehicle alone or with the indicated concentrations of estradiol or EDCs. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT activity. The amount of CAT was determined using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Preparation of Two-hybrid Expression Vectors and β-Gal Assays—All two-hybrid plasmid constructs used the pAS1 (18Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) and pAD-GAL4 yeast expression vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The AS1-VDR, -PXR, -ERα, and -ERβ constructs have been previously described (11Masuyama H. Hiramatsu Y. Kunitomi M. Kudo T. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The pAD-GAL4-SUG1 (wild-type or K196H) was cotransformed with pAS1-ERα or ERβ into yeast strain Hf7c. Transformants were plated on synthetic complete medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (SC-Leu-Trp) and were grown for 4 days at 30 °C to yield yeast that had acquired both plasmids. Triplicate independent colonies from each plate were grown overnight in 2 ml of SC-Leu-Trp with or without the indicated concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, 1,25(OH)2D3, or EDCs. Cells were harvested and assayed for β-Gal activity as described previously (4Masuyama H. Brownfield C. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Nuclear Extracts and Western Analysis—Nuclear extracts were obtained from Ishikawa cells and HEC-1 cells using nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were stored at –80 °C until analysis. Equivalent amounts of nuclear protein (25 μg/sample) from each extract were determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce), solubilized in SDS buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 6% mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8), and were analyzed by Western blot analysis as previously described (10Masuyama H. MacDonald P.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using rabbit polyclonal antibody for ERα (1:1000 dilution), ERβ (1:1000 dilution), and SUG1 (1:1000 dilution).Enrichment of Ubiquitinated Protein—Polyubiquitin affinity beads and control beads were provided from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Whole cell extracts were obtained from Ishikawa cells using M-Per reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An equivalent amount of whole cell extract (1 mg) was incubated with 40 μl of beads for 4h at 4 °C with constant mixing in lysis buffer. This buffer consisted of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The beads were washed three times, solubilized in SDS buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), -ERα or -ERβ antibody.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was evaluated by one factor ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. Data are mean ± S.D. p < 0.05 denoted statistical significance.RESULTSDifferential Effects of EDCs on the Interaction between ER and SUG1—As illustrated in Fig. 1A, SUG1 interacted with VDR, PXR, ERα, and ERβ in the presence of endogenous ligands for each receptor in the two-hybrid system. ERα interacted with SUG1 in the presence of EDCs, phthalate and BSA, both of which have been demonstrated to activate ERα-mediated transcription (19Inoshita H. Masuyama H. Hiramatsu Y. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, which had no transcriptional activity on ERα, had no effect on the interaction. In contrast, interaction between ERβ and SUG1 was not observed in the presence of BSA (Fig. 1B). The effect on the interaction of SUG1 with ERα depended on the concentration of ligands, and this effect increased significantly at 10 pm estradiol, 1 nm BSA, or 10 nm phthalate (Fig. 1C, p < 0.01 compared with ethanol). The effect on the interactions between SUG1 and ERβ also depended on the concentration of ligands and significantly increased at 10 pm estradiol or 10 nm of phthalate, but BSA had no effect on the interaction at any concentration (Fig. 1D;*, p < 0.01 compared with ethanol). Also, we checked the interaction between ERs and SUG1 (K196H), which in previous studies did not interact with VDR or ERα (10Masuyama H. MacDonald P.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Vom Bauer E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J.S. Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The presence of any of the ligands had no effect on the interaction between ERs and the SUG1 mutant (Fig. 1E).Effect of Proteasome Inhibitors on ER Protein Levels in Endometrial Cancer Cell Lines—Because the turnover of ERα has been demonstrated to be involved in the proteasome-mediated degradation system (20Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 21Alarid E.T. Bakopoulos N. Solodin N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether or not ERβ as well as ERα is also a target for proteasome-mediated degradation in endometrial cancer cell lines, Ishikawa cells, and HEC-1 cells. The protein levels of ERα and ERβ were examined in Ishikawa cells and HEC-1 cells that had been exposed to proteasome inhibitors. The protein levels of both ERα and ERβ were markedly increased in the presence of 5 mm MG132 or 0.05 mm β-lactone, both of which strongly inhibit proteasome activities (22Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A.

Furthermore, Ishikawa cells were treated with cycloheximide (10 mg/ml), and the effect of estradiol or either of two EDCs, phthalate and BSA, on ER turnover was determined. In the presence of estradiol, the protein levels of both ERs were rapidly degraded compared with ethanol-treated cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 6). The effects of BSA and phthalate on ERα turnover were similar to those in the presence of estradiol (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4), but the degradation of ERβ was blocked in the presence of BSA (Fig. 2B, lane 7) compared with that in the presence of estradiol or phthalate.Fig. 2Effect of proteasome inhibitors on ER protein levels in endometrial cancer cell lines. A, subconfluent HEC-1 and Ishikawa cells were treated with Me2SO or protease inhibitors for 6 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An equivalent amount of each extract was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. ER protein levels were determined by Western blotting using anti-ERα and -ERβ antibody. B, subconfluent Ishikawa cells were treated with cycloheximide (10 mg/ml media) for 10 min prior to the addition of ligands. Cells were then treated in the presence of 10–6m estradiol, EDCs, or vehicle. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and ER protein levels were examined as described above. This level of cycloheximide inhibited >95% of 35S-labeled methionine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitated protein (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Suppression of ER-mediated Transcription by Overexpressed Wild-type SUG1—We used transient reporter expression assays in COS-7 cells and Ishikawa cells to examine whether or not SUG1 affected ERα- and ERβ-mediated transcription. Expression of SUG1 suppressed estradiol-mediated transactivation of both overexpressed ERα and overexpressed ERβ, but SUG1 overexpression had no effect on basal transcription using COS-7 cells (Fig. 3A). The suppressive effect on estradiol-dependent transcription was the result of an interaction between ERs and SUG1 because the expression of mutant SUG1 (K196H), which interacted with neither of the ERs (Fig. 1E), had no significant effect on ER-mediated transactivation in this system (Fig. 3A). And, as described in Fig. 3B, SUG1 suppressed the ERα-mediated transcription in the presence of BSA or phthalate, both of which enhanced the interaction between ERα and SUG1 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, SUG1 had no suppressive effect on ERβ-mediated transcription in the presence of BSA, which had no effect on the interaction between SUG1 and ERβ (Fig. 1B). Mutant SUG1 had no effect on ER-mediated transcription in any ligands. Moreover, SUG1 had a negative effect on endogenous ER-mediated transcription in the presence of phthalate or estradiol, but there was no change in the presence of BSA in Ishikawa cells (Fig. 3C). We also examined the effect of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, on ER-mediated transcription using Ishikawa cells. MG132 weakly suppressed basal transcription and ER-mediated transcription in the presence of estradiol or BSA and completely blocked the suppressive effect of SUG1 on ER-mediated transcription in the presence of estradiol or phthalate (Fig. 3D), suggesting that SUG1 affected the transcription through the proteasome-mediated degradation.Fig. 3Suppression of ER-mediated transcription by overexpressed wild-type SUG1. A, COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of a reporter gene construct ((ERE)2-G-CAT), 0.5 μg of a receptor expression vector (pSG5-ERα or -ERβ) or an empty vector (pSG5), and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-SUG1 (wild-type (WT) or K196H) or pcDNA3 expression vector together. The cells were treated with an ethanol vehicle or 10–6m estradiol for 36 h. The amount of CAT was determined with a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Results represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of a reporter gene construct ((ERE)2-G-CAT), 0.5 μg of a receptor expression vector (pSG5-ERα or ERβ), and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-SUG1 (wild-type (WT) or K196H) or pcDNA3 expression vector together. The cells were treated with an ethanol vehicle, 10–6m estradiol, or 10–6m EDCs for 36 h. The amount of CAT was determined as described above. Results represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. C, Ishikawa cells were transfected with 1 μg of a reporter gene construct ((ERE)2-G-CAT) and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-SUG1 (wild-type (WT) or K196H) or pcDNA3 expression vector together. The cells were treated with an ethanol vehicle, 10–6m estradiol, or 10–6m EDCs for 36 h. The amount of CAT was determined as described above. Results represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. D, Ishikawa cells were transfected with 1 μg of a reporter gene construct ((ERE)2-G-CAT) and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-SUG1 (wild-type (WT) or K196H) or pcDNA3 expression vector together. The cells were treated with an ethanol vehicle, 10–6m estradiol, or 10–6m EDCs for 36 h in the presence or absence of 5 mm MG132. The amount of CAT was determined as described above. Results represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SUG1 Overexpression Enhances ER Proteolysis in Ishikawa Cells—To test whether or not SUG1-ER interactions are involved in ER degradation in proteasome-mediated systems, wild-type and mutant SUG1 were transiently overexpressed in Ishikawa cells, and their respective effects on ER protein levels were examined by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). In the absence of estradiol, overexpression of wild-type or mutant SUG1 did not significantly affect the protein levels of ERα (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3) or ERβ (Fig. 4A, lanes 7–9). However, in the presence of estradiol, novel proteolytic fragments of both ERs were observed when Ishikawa cells were transfected with the wild-type SUG1 expression vector (Fig. 4A, lane 5 and 11). The ER proteolytic fragments were not observed in the cells transfected with mutant SUG1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 12). The overexpression of SUG1 was confirmed using anti-SUG1 antibody. Moreover, proteolytic fragments of ERα were also observed in the presence of BSA or phthalate (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). However, we observed proteolytic fragments of ERβ only in the presence of phthalate and not in the presence of BSA (Fig. 4B, lanes 8 and 9), suggesting that this phenomenon requires interaction between ERs and SUG1, whereas MG132 completely blocked the formation of SUG1-dependent fragments of both ERs (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–6 and 10–12). Then, we checked the dominant-negative effect of SUG1 (K196H) on wild-type SUG1-induced proteolysis of both ERs. As described in Fig. 4C, mutant SUG1 inhibited the proteolytic fragments of both ERs by overexpressed wild-type SUG1 in a dose-dependent manner.Fig. 4Enhancement of wild-type SUG1 on ER proteolysis in Ishikawa cells. A, Ishikawa cells on 150-mm plates were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3-SUG1 (wild-type (WT) or K196H) or pcDNA3 expression vector. The cells were treated with an ethanol vehicle or 10–6m estradiol for 24 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. The protein levels of ERs were examined as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The expression of overexpressed SUG1 was confirmed using anti-SUG1 antibody. B, Ishikawa cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3-SUG1 (wild-type (WT)). The cells were treated with 10–6m estradiol or EDCs and exposed to 5 mm MG132 or vehicle for 24 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. The protein levels of the ERs were examined as described under “Fig. 2.” C, Ishikawa cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3-SUG1 (wild-type (WT)) and increasing amount of pcDNA3-SUG1 (K196H). The cells were treated with 10–6m estradiol for 24 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared.

Rep. 1999; 26: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we checked whether or not SUG1 is involved in the process of ER ubiquitination. We used polyubiquitin affinity beads to pull polyubiqutinated proteins down from whole cell extracts of Ishikawa cells (Fig. 5A). We detected ubiquitinated proteins of both ERα and ERβ with overexpressed wild-type SUG1 alone; none were detected with the pcDNA3 expression vector alone or with SUG1 (K196H) (Fig. 5B). No nonspecific interaction with control beads was observed. Moreover, ubiquitinated ERα protein was observed in the presence of BSA or phthalate as well as estradiol, but the ubiquitination of ERβ was detected in the presence of phthalate or estradiol (Fig. 5C), suggesting that ubiquitination of ER proteins requires interaction between SUG1 and the ER.

https://openalex.org/W2058666925,"Telomeres are the specialized structures at the end of linear chromosomes and terminate with a single-stranded 3′ overhang of the G-rich strand. The primary role of telomeres is to protect chromosome ends from recombination and fusion and from being recognized as broken DNA ends. This protective function can be achieved through association with specific telomere-binding proteins. Although proteins that bind single-stranded G-rich overhang regulate telomere length and telomerase activity in mammals and lower eukaryotes, equivalent factors have yet to be identified in plants. Here we have identified proteins capable of interacting with the G-rich single-stranded telomeric repeat from the Arabidopsis extracts by affinity chromatography. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis indicates that the isolated protein is a chloroplast RNA-binding protein (and a truncated derivative). The truncated derivative, which we refer to as STEP1 (single-stranded telomere-binding protein 1), binds specifically the single-stranded G-rich plant telomeric DNA sequences but not double-stranded telomeric DNA. Unlike the chloroplast-localized full-length RNA-binding protein, STEP1 localizes exclusively to the nucleus, suggesting that it plays a role in plant telomere biogenesis. We also demonstrated that the specific binding of STEP1 to single-stranded telomeric DNA inhibits telomerase-mediated telomere extension. The evidence presented here suggests that STEP1 is a telomere-end binding protein that may contribute to telomere length regulation by capping the ends of chromosomes and thereby repressing telomerase activity in plants.

Telomeres are the specialized nucleoprotein complexes of eukaryotic chromosome ends that are essential for chromosome stability and integrity (1Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1999; 350: 569-573Crossref Scopus (3027) Google Scholar, 2Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 3Muniyappa K. Kironmai K.M. Crit. Rev.

Without functional, intact telomeres, the chromosomes are prone to nucleolytic degradation leading to apoptosis and cell death (4Blackburn E.H.

Dividing cells show progressive loss of telomeric DNA during successive rounds of replication, because the lagging strand of DNA synthesis is unable to replicate the extreme 3′ end of the chromosome (7Lingner J. Cooper J.P. Cech T.R. Science. 1995; 269: 1533-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Thus, telomere shortening has been proposed as a regulatory mechanism that controls the replicative capacity of primary cells and cellular senescence by acting as a mitotic clock (8Harley C.B. Mutat. Res. 1991; 256: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The loss of telomeric sequences can be avoided by the reactivation of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that carries out telomere elongation and thus stabilizes the telomere length (9Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Telomeres in most eukaryotes are composed of tandem repeats of short sequence elements, which are five to eight nucleotides long (10Zakian V.A.

Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Cdc13p mediates telomerase access to chromosome termini by a direct interaction with Est1, a component of telomerase that interacts with telomerase RNA (22Evans S.K. Lundblad V. Science. 1999; 286: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The fission yeast Pot1p plays a direct role in protecting the ends of chromosomes (23Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Deletion of pot1 gene affects chromosome stability, causing rapid loss of telomeric DNA and circularization. In unicellular organisms, several telomere end-binding proteins, such as αβ protein from Oxytricha (24Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 719-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), TBP from Euplotes (25Price C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TEP and TGP from Tetrahymena (26Schierer T. Henderson E.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3648-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), have been characterized. These proteins protect single-stranded overhangs from nucleolytic degradation and chemical modification and thus confer chromosome stability.

Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 580-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hnRNP A1/UP1 protein is the first single-stranded binding protein shown to be directly involved in mammalian telomere biogenesis (30LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Short telomeres in hnRNP A1-deficient mouse cell line can be elongated by restoring A1 expression. Because expressing UP1, the proteolytic fragment of hnRNP A1, does not affect alternative splicing (but increases telomere length in hnRNP A1-deficient cells), the effect of hnRNP A1 on telomere length regulation is not due to A1-induced alternative splicing. hnRNPs A2/B1 and D have also been reported as functional G-rich single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (31Kamma H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5425-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Telomeric DNA in plants consists of tandem arrays of TT-TAGGG repeats (33Richards E.J. Ausubel F.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 127-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Plants share many common features in the regulation of telomere length and telomerase activity with mammals (34Riha K. Fajkus J. Siroky J. Vyskot B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 35Fitzgerald M.S. McKnight T.D. Shippen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 36Kilian A. Heller K. Kleinhofs A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the dicot plants, Silene latifolia and Arabidopsis thaliana, telomeres carry G-rich overhangs longer than 20–30 nucleotides (37Riha K. McKnight T.D. Fajkus J. Vyskot B. Shippen D.E. Plant J. 2000; 23: 633-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, in contrast to mammalian telomeres, only half of the telomeres possess detectable G-rich overhangs, implying that two distinct telomere architectures may exist in plants. Nevertheless, the presence of G-rich overhangs in plant telomeres suggests that single-stranded telomere-binding activity plays an important role in telomere function. In a search for proteins capable of interacting with the G-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA, we isolated several polypeptides from Arabidopsis extracts by affinity chromatography. MALDI-TOF MS analysis allowed us to identify three proteins that turned out to be multiple isoforms encoded by a chloroplast RNA-binding protein gene (38Cheng S.H. Cline K. DeLisle A.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 39Ohta M. Sugita M. Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One of the naturally occurring isoforms, which we refer to as STEP1 (single-stranded telomere-binding protein 1), lacks a chloroplast transit peptide and acidic domain but contains RNA-binding domains (RBDs). Here we show that STEP1 binds specifically the single-stranded G-rich plant telomeric DNA sequences but not double-stranded telomeric DNA. STEP1 binding to single-stranded telomeric DNA inhibits telomerase-mediated telomere extension. We also demonstrate that STEP1 is targeted to the nucleus. Thus, our results suggest that STEP1 could function in vivo to protect the ends of chromosomes and modulate telomere replication in plants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Plant Extracts—Four week-grown Arabidopsis whole plants were ground in a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen, suspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m dextrose, 0.25 m sucrose, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), filtered through several layers of cheese cloth, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was washed twice with buffer A and resuspended with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nonidet P-40 was immediately added to a final concentration of 1% and mixed for 30 min at 4 °C. To extract proteins, one-tenth volume of 5 m NaCl was slowly added and mixed for 60 min at 4 °C with constant stirring. The extracts were then subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant were extensively dialyzed against buffer B and stored at -80°C until used. Protein concentrations in extracts ranged from 1 to 2 mg/ml.Affinity Chromatography—Streptavidin immobilized on agarose (Sigma) was activated by incubation with the 3′-biotinylated oligodeoxyribonucleotide (TTTAGGG)6. For protein purification, the activated resin (1 ml) was packed in a column and extensively washed with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol). Arabidopsis extracts containing 10 mg of protein were preincubated with 100 μg of nonspecific single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide (Table I) to reduce nonspecific DNA-protein binding and then loaded onto the column. After washing the column with 20 ml of binding buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with 0.1% SDS in binding buffer.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideaPT, plant G-rich telomere; HT, human telomere; CT, C. elegans telomere; NS, nonspecific sequence; ds, double-strandedSequence (5′→3′)PT4(TTTAGGG)4HT4(TTAGGG)4CT4(TTAGGC)4T1(ATTAGGG)4T2(TATAGGG)4T3(TTAAGGG)4A4(TTTTGGG)4G5(TTTACGG)4G6(TTTAGCG)4G7(TTTAGGC)4NSTAAGCTTCTAGATTAGGCTATCAGAPT10(ds)(TTTAGGG)10/(AAATCCC)10a PT, plant G-rich telomere; HT, human telomere; CT, C. elegans telomere; NS, nonspecific sequence; ds, double-stranded Open table in a new tab Mass Spectrometry and Protein Identification—The gel pieces corresponding to protein bands were excised from the polyacrylamide gel, crushed, and destained by washing with 50% acetonitrile in 25 mm NH4HCO3. After washing with 100% acetonitrile, the gel pieces were dried and incubated in trypsin digestion solution containing 10 μg/ml of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides were extracted by incubating the gel pieces with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 37 °C for 1 h. The extraction was repeated three times, and the extracted solutions were pooled and evaporated in a Speed-Vac vacuum centrifuge. The dried peptides were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and treated with ZipTips containing C18 resin (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The washed peptides were eluted with matrix solution (5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 50% acetonitrile), applied to the sample plate and then dried. Peptides molecular weights were measured on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR; Applied Biosystems, Inc.). For interpretation of the mass spectra, we used the MS-Fit program available on the web site (prospector.ucsf.edu).Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The plasmid vector, pGEX-6p-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the expression of full-length and various deletion proteins. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain the proteins lacking the GST moiety, the bound proteins were treated with Prescission Protease (Amersham Biosciences), and the released proteins were collected.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DNA probes and competitors used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay are described in Table I. DNA probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and purified by free nucleotide removal spin column (Qiagen). The recombinant proteins were preincubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 μg of nonspecific single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide in 20 μl of a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) for 15 min on ice to reduce nonspecific DNA-protein binding. End-labeled DNA probe (0.3 ng) was then added to the reaction mixtures and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The mixtures were loaded on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the binding activity was quantified with an image analyzer (BAS 2500; Fuji Photo Film). For competition experiments, various competitors were preincubated with proteins before the addition of labeled DNA probe.Telomerase Assays—Telomerase activity was detected by a modified version of the TRAP assay (35Fitzgerald M.S. McKnight T.D. Shippen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Whole plant extracts were prepared by grinding of 7-day-grown Arabidopsis in CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% CHAPS). The GG substrate primer (5′-CACTATCGACTACGCGATCGG-3′) and the antisense telomeric repeat primer (5′-CCCTAAACCCTAAACCCTAAA-3′) were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Telomerase extension reactions were carried out in TRAP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 63 mm KCl, 0.005% Tween 20, and 1 mm EGTA) containing 200 nm GG primer, and 100 μm concentrations of each dNTP. Extracted plant protein (1.5 μg) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The extended products were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA samples were amplified by PCR using 200 nm forward primer and 200 nm reverse primer for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with an additional 10-min extension step at the end. The amplified products were resolved by 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by staining with SYBR Green (Molecular Probes). The signal intensity was quantified with an image analyzer (LAS-1000 Plus; Fuji Photo Film). To test RNA-dependent extension, RNase A (0.25 mg/ml) was added to the extract before incubation with the GG primer.Nuclear Localization Analysis of STEP1—The green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector pBI221-GFP was generated by replacement of GUS region of pBI221 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) with GFP. The coding sequence of STEP1 was inserted into pBI221-GFP to be fused in-frame to the N terminus of GFP coding sequence. The fusion construct was introduced into onion epidermal cells using a helium biolistic particle delivery system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). After incubation for 24 h at 22 °C, the subcellular distribution of GFP was examined by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). A pBI221-GFP construct without STEP1 was used as a control.RESULTSIdentification of Arabidopsis Proteins That Specifically Bind to the Single-stranded G-rich Telomeric Repeats—Proteins that bind single-stranded telomeric overhang play an important role in chromosome capping and telomere length regulation (21Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 30LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat.

Such proteins have not yet been identified and characterized in plants. To identify telomere end-binding proteins in plants, affinity chromatography using single-stranded (TTTAGGG)6 oligodeoxyribonucleotide was applied to Arabidopsis extracts. The eluted fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1). The electrophoretic pattern of the proteins recovered by affinity chromatography shows two major bands, three intermediate bands, and six faint bands having apparent molecular masses ranging from 20 to 64 kDa (lane 2). No stainable protein was retained when streptavidin-agarose conjugate resins were not functionalized (lane 3). Because Arabidopsis extracts were preincubated with nonspecific single-stranded oligonucleotide as a competitor DNA, the retained proteins should show high specificity for the single-stranded G-rich telomeric sequence. To identify the protein components with the telomere binding activity, each protein band was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin, and the recovered peptide mixtures were directly subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The obtained mass data were fitted by MS-fit data base search analysis. Although there were some unidentified bands that had no matching proteins in the data base (or the amount of protein was too little to be precisely identified), this method allowed us to identify nine polypeptides. Table II shows the peptide mass fingerprint results, which contain NCBI accession number, theoretical and experimental molecular weights, the number of matching peptides, and the amino acid coverage of the obtained peptides. Bands 6 and 7 were identified as a chloroplast RNA-binding protein (cp31) that contains four structural domains: a chloroplast transit peptide (TP) in the N terminus, followed by an acidic domain (AD) and a tandem pair of RNA-binding domains (RBD1 and RBD2) in the C terminus (Fig. 2A) (38Cheng S.H.

Biol. 1995; 27: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Band 11 was identified as a truncated derivative (RNA-binding protein 3) lacking the N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide and acidic domain. It was previously reported that the single chloroplast RNA-binding protein gene generates multiple messages that potentially encode two distinct proteins (38Cheng S.H. Cline K. DeLisle A.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the larger messages encode a full-length protein that functions in chloroplast, the shorter messages encode a truncated derivative (named STEP1 in this study) that is likely to function in cellular compartments other than chloroplast due to the absence of a chloroplast transit peptide (38Cheng S.H. Cline K. DeLisle A.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Table IIProteins identified by MALDI-TOF MS Each identified protein shows protein name, NCBI protein accession number (NCBI accession no.), theoretical molecular weight (Theor.

The hnRNPs have been implicated to have roles in telomere and telomerase regulation (29Ford L.P. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 580-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to examine whether STEP1 interacts directly with the single-stranded G-rich telomeric repeat. Recombinant forms of full-length cp31, STEP1, N-terminal half (NT), RBD1, and RBD2 were expressed in bacteria (Fig. 2, A and B) and used in gel shift assays with a labeled PT4 oligonucleotide having four plant telomeric repeats. As shown in Fig. 2C, cp31 gave rise to a discrete protein-DNA complex that migrated more slowly than the free probe. Intensities of shifted bands increased upon the addition of increasing amounts of the protein. Likewise, STEP1 bound slightly more efficiently to PT4 than cp31. In contrast, NT containing the transit peptide (TP) and acidic domains (AD) did not show any binding activity under the conditions used in these experiments. We also tested the binding activity of each RBD. No binding activity was observed in RBD1 or RBD2.Sequence Specificity of STEP1 Binding to Single-stranded Telomeric Repeats—To determine the relative binding specificity of STEP1 to plant telomeric sequence, we performed various competition experiments. The complex detected in STEP1 was significantly reduced in the presence of 10-fold excess of unlabeled PT4 oligonucleotide and completely disappeared by 50-fold excess (Fig. 3A). When the human telomeric repeats were substituted for the plant telomeric repeats, HT4 competed less efficiently than its counterpart for the PT4-binding activity. In contrast, the signals were not diminished by the addition of the same molar excess of unlabeled Caenorhabditis elegans telomeric repeats. To see whether STEP1 binds to double-stranded telomeric DNA, a duplex DNA that contains 10 copies of the telomeric repeats was prepared. Even when excess amounts of double-stranded telomeric DNA were used as competitor DNA, the binding activity remained unaffected (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Sequence specific binding of STEP1 to single-stranded telomeric repeats. A, competition assay for STEP1 binding to the PT4 probe. Labeled PT4 was incubated with STEP1 (5 μm) in the presence of either unlabeled PT4, HT4, CT4, or PT10(ds) as a competitor. The excess molar amounts of the competitors are indicated above each lane. The first lane contained free probe alone, and the second lane contained STEP1 (5 μm) without competitor.

However, overexpression of full-length ZNF143, ZNF76, or dominant-negative DNA-binding domain of ZNF143 enhanced, maintained, or abolished transaldolase promoter activity, respectively, in HepG2 and HeLa cells, suggesting that ZNF143 initiates transcription from the transaldolase core promoter. ZNF143 overexpression also increased transaldolase enzyme activity. ZNF143 and transaldolase expression correlated in 21 different human tissues and were coordinately upregulated 14- and 34-fold, respectively, in lactating mammary glands compared with nonlactating ones.

Many of these processes are associated with apoptosis, a fundamental form of programmed cell death (17Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is indispensable for normal development and maintenance of homeostasis within multicellular organisms (18Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6712) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have long been considered as toxic by-products of aerobic existence, but evidence is now accumulating that controlled levels of ROS modulate cellular function and are necessary for signal transduction pathways, including those mediating programmed cell death (19Perl A. Gergely Jr., P. Puskas F. Banki K. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 427-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A normal reducing atmosphere, required for cellular integrity is provided by reduced GSH that protects cells from damage by ROS (2Mayes P.A. Murray R.K. Granner D.K. Mayes P.A. Rodwell V.W. Harper's Biochemistry. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1993: 201-211Google Scholar). Regeneration of GSH from its oxidized form, GSSG, is dependent on NADPH produced by the PPP (2Mayes P.A. Murray R.K. Granner D.K. Mayes P.A. Rodwell V.W. Harper's Biochemistry. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1993: 201-211Google Scholar). Understanding how the PPP is regulated has been complicated by the fact that the pathway is composed of two separate phases, oxidative and nonoxidative. Reactions in the oxidative phase are irreversible, whereas all reactions of the nonoxidative phase are fully reversible. Nevertheless, the two phases are functionally connected. The nonoxidative phase can convert ribose 5-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate for the oxidative phase, and thus, indirectly, it can also contribute to generation of NADPH (20Horecker B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47965-47971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting enzymes for the two phases are different. The oxidative phase is primarily dependent on G6PD (21Wood T. The Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Academic Press, New York1985Google Scholar). Although the control of the nonoxidative branch is less well established, transaldolase (TAL) has been proposed as its rate-limiting enzyme (21Wood T. The Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Academic Press, New York1985Google Scholar, 22Heinrich P.C. Morris H.P. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 3189-3197PubMed Google Scholar). TAL catalyzes the transfer of a 3-carbon fragment, corresponding to dihydroxyacetone, to d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, d-erythrose 4-phosphate, and a variety of other acceptor aldehydes, including nonphosphorylated trioses and tetroses. Enzymatic activity of TAL is regulated in a tissue-specific (21Wood T. The Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Academic Press, New York1985Google Scholar, 22Heinrich P.C. Morris H.P. Weber G.

In the brain, TAL is expressed selectively in oligodendrocytes at high levels (28Banki K. Colombo E. Sia F. Halladay D. Mattson D.H. Tatum A.H. Massa P.T. Phillips P.E. Perl A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1649-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This is particularly interesting because myelin sheaths are formed by oligodendrocytes, and lesions in the most common demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis, are characterized by a progressive loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination (30Martin R. McFarland H.F. McFarlin D.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). High levels of TAL expression in oligodendrocytes may be related to synthesis of lipids as major constituents of myelin and exquisite susceptibility of these cells to damage by reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and tumor necrosis factor α released by activated macrophages and astrocytes (31Merrill J.E. Ignarro L.J. Sherman M.P. Melinek J. Lane T.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2132-2141PubMed Google Scholar). Data from this laboratory have provided evidence that TAL can regulate susceptibility to apoptosis through control of the balance between the two branches of the PPP and its overall output as measured by NADPH and GSH production (32Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TAL in Jurkat and H9 human T cell lines results in a decrease in G6PD and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities and NADPH and GSH levels and renders the cell highly susceptible to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, H2O2, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor α, Fas antibody, or infection by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (32Banki K.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 1466-1479PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, reduced levels of TAL results in increased G6PD and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities and increased GSH levels with inhibition of apoptosis. Disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm), the point of no return in the effector phase of programmed cell death (35Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Daugas E. Wang H.G. Geley S.

Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is subject to regulation by an oxidation-reduction equilibrium of ROS, pyridine nucleotides (NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH), and GSH levels (37Constantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6746-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The extent of Fas-induced mitochondrial ROI production, changes in Δψm, caspase activation, and cell death are regulated by TAL expression levels (34Banki K. Hutter E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1466-1479PubMed Google Scholar). The impact of TAL on apoptotic signaling (32Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol.

TAL-dependent changes in NADP/NADPH levels may regulate expression of G6PD through oxidative stress-response elements located in the G6PD promoter (39Ursini M.V. Lettieri T. Braddock M. Martini G. Virology. 1993; 196: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of TAL expression may play a pivotal role in tissue- and cell type-specific metabolic signaling (19Perl A. Gergely Jr., P. Puskas F. Banki K. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 427-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 38Ni T.-C. Savageau M.A. J. Biol.

The eight exons encoding a 337-amino acid protein of 37.6 kDa (41Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are contained within a 17.5-kb genomic locus (TALDO1) (42Perl A. Colombo E. Samoilova E. Butler M.C. Banki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7261-7272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the present study, we localized the core promoter of TAL-H to nucleotide positions (np) –49 to –1 that harbors a DNA element that is recognized and functionally activated by transcription factor ZNF143, a human homolog of Xenopus selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription activating factor (Staf) (43Myslinski E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is a seven-zinc finger transcription factor capable of enhancing transcription of mRNA, tRNASec, snRNA, and snRNA-type genes via RNA polymerase II or III (43Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J.

ZNF143 is encoded by a single copy genomic locus within a 10-megabase distance from the TAL-H locus at band p15.4 of human chromosome 11 (48Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the ZNF143/76 motif abolished transcriptional activity of the core TAL-H promoter. Expression of TAL-H correlated with that of ZNF143 in 21 different human tissues and both were up-regulated in lactating mouse mammary glands as compared with nonlactating controls. Overexpression of ZNF143 enhanced TAL-H promoter activity, and a dominant-negative form of ZNF143 blocked transcription from the TAL-H promoter, indicating that ZNF143 may play a key role in regulating tissue-specific expression of TAL-H. Cell Culture—HepG2 human hepatoma cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. HeLa human cervix carcinoma cells (from ATCC) and MO3.13 human oligodendroglioma cells (kindly provided by Dr. Neil Cashman, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, Canada) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml amphotericin B. HOG human oligodendroglioma cells (from Dr. Glyn Dawson, University of Chicago) were maintained in Dulbecco`s modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml amphotericin B. Jurkat human T cell leukemia cells (49Puskas F. Gergely Jr., P. Banki K. Perl A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1352-1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. All cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell culture products were purchased from Cellgro (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA). Plasmids and Oligonucleotides—Mutagenesis of TAL-H promoter constructs were generated by PCR using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit as suggested by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 25 ng of template was incubated with 125 ng of sense and antisense primers, dNTPs, and subjected to 18 PCR cycles with Pfu turbo DNA polymerase with denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 10 min. DpnI was used to digest the parental supercoiled double-stranded methylated DNA for 1 h at 37 °C. Transformations were performed in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells using DpnI-treated DNA. Plasmids were prepared using Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit Columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Introduction of mutations into the TAL-H promoter constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. AP-2 and Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). TARE-6 oligonucleotide, derived from full-length TARE-6 (42Perl A. Colombo E. Samoilova E. Butler M.C. Banki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7261-7272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was used as a nonspecific competitor in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). ZNF143/76 (50Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and SOX5 (51Denny P. Swift S. Connor F. Ashworth A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3705-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) consensus sequences were generated based on published reports. All oligonucleotides used in EMSAs and for generating TAL-H promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene constructs were synthesized by Ransom Hill Bioscience (Ramona, CA). Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—HepG2 cells were transfected with 1.6 μg of pBLCAT3-based (52Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) TAL-H promoter reporter constructs at 80% confluency in 9.5-cm2 wells using 20 μl of PLUS reagent and 4.8 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). 80% confluent HeLa cells in 3.8-cm2 wells were transfected with 0.8 μg of pBLCAT3-based TAL-H promoter vectors using 10 μl of PLUS reagent and 2.4 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. Each cell line was cotransfected with pRSVβ-gal (β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (53Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar)) using 1.6 μg for HepG2 and 0.8 μg for HeLa cells, respectively, in order to normalize transfection efficiency. In each transfection, the promoterless pBLCAT3 vector was used as a negative control. For overexpression of recombinant transcription factors ZNF76 and ZNF143, the corresponding expression vectors or pCAGGS empty vector (54Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28641-28648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with the TAL-H promoter CAT reporter plasmids and internal control pRSVβ-gal using 1 μg of each plasmid, 20 μl of PLUS reagent, and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. After 4½ h of exposure to the DNA-LipofectAMINE complex in serum- and antibiotic-free media, the DNA complex was removed, and cells were further cultured for 36 h in complete growth media. Cells were harvested in 150 μl of 250 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and solubilized by 3 rounds of freezing and thawing. For β-galactosidase assay, 30 μl of lysate was incubated with 270 μl of reaction mixture (1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, and 0.1 m NaPi, pH 7.5) at 37 °C and terminated with the addition of 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 once the reaction turned yellow. Absorbance values were measured at 420 nm and employed to adjust the quantity of cell lysates to be used in the CAT assay for normalization of transfection efficiencies. Prior to CAT assay, lysates were heated to 65 °C for 10 min to deactivate acetylases. CAT assays were performed at 37 °C in a 50-μl reaction mixture with normalized volumes of cell lysates in 250 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.4 mm acetyl coenzyme A, and 0.025 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol. Acetylated chloramphenicol was extracted with ethyl acetate and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Pellets were resuspended in ethyl acetate, spotted on a silica gel TLC plate (Analtech, Newark, DE), and resolved in an equilibrated chromatography tank containing 19:1 chloroform/methanol until the solvent front approached the top of the TLC plate. A 445 SI PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) was used to determine the ratio of acetylated to unacetylated [14C]chloramphenicol. All assays were conducted within the range of linearity of CAT activities with respect to incubation time, based on the β-galactosidase assay. Each transfection experiment was repeated at least four times. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts (NE) were prepared according to a protocol described previously (55Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) at 4 °C. Briefly, cells in log phase were harvested, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1× packed cell volume of ice-cold hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm leupeptin). Following a 15-min incubation on ice, the suspension was rapidly flushed eight times through a 25-gauge syringe to lyse cells. Homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 2/3× original packed cell volume of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 550 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm leupeptin). After constant stirring for 30 min, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant containing nuclear proteins was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). DNase I Footprinting—DNase I footprinting was carried out with modifications of an established protocol (56Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, a doublestranded gel-purified TAL-H promoter DNA fragment (np –153 to +52) from a BamHI-TaqI digestion of clone 1994 (Fig. 3) was end-labeled by incorporating 3000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) into the 3′-end of the sense strand using Sequenase version 2.0 DNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and purified through a Sephadex G-25 spin column (Shelton Scientific, Shelton, CT). Binding reactions were conducted in 50 μl of EMSA binding buffer (see below) without bovine serum albumin incubating 0.035 pmol (65,000–80,000 cpm) of TAL-H promoter probe with 40 μg of NE for 10 min at room temperature. Then the reaction was supplemented with 50 μl of 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2 and allowed to equilibrate for an additional minute at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture was treated with 1.5 units of DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 min at room temperature and terminated with the addition of 90 μl of 30 mm EDTA. Nuclear proteins were digested with 25 μg of proteinase K for 10 min at room temperature. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the aqueous phase was ethanol-precipitated overnight with 30 μg of GlycoBlue (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The DNA pellet was resuspended in 5 μl of 1:2 diluted loading dye (U. S. Biochemical Corp. Stop Solution: 95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF), denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel run at 65 watts in 1× Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer. The gel was fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min, dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h, and subjected to autoradiography at –80 °C with an intensifying screen. Control reaction consisted of 0.035 pmol of probe incubated with 0.75 units of DNase I in the absence of nuclear extract. Identification of the location of the protected regions within the TAL-H promoter was determined by alignment with a 35S-labeled sequencing ladder run alongside the footprinting reactions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides (Fig. 4) were generated by heating primer pairs to 95 °C for 5 min in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and slowly cooling to room temperature. These double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with 4,500 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at 37 °C and purified on Sephadex G-25 spin columns for use as EMSA probes. 10 μg of NE was incubated with 20 fmol (45,000–60,000 cpm) of double-strand"
https://openalex.org/W2016828213,"The mammalian SREBP family contains two genes that code for B-HLH-ZIP proteins that bind sequence-specific DNA to regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. We have designed a dominant negative (DN), termed A-SREBP-1, that inhibits the DNA binding of either SREBP protein. A-SREBP-1 consists of the dimerization domain of B-SREBP-1 and a polyglutamic acid sequence that replaces the basic region. A-SREBP-1 heterodimerizes with either B-SREBP-1 or B-SREBP-2, and both heterodimers are more stable than B-SREBP-1 bound to DNA. Circular dichroism thermal denaturation studies show that the B-SREBP-1.A-SREBP-1 heterodimer is -9.8 kcal mol(-1) dimer(-1) more stable than the B-SREBP-1 homodimer. EMSA assays demonstrate that A-SREBP-1 can inhibit the DNA binding of either B-SREBP-1 or B-SREBP-2 in an equimolar competition but does not inhibit the DNA binding of the three B-HLH-ZIP proteins MAX, USF, or MITF, even at 100 molar eq. Chimeric proteins containing the HLH domain of SREBP-1 and the leucine zipper from either MAX, USF, or MITF indicate that both the HLH and leucine zipper regions of SREBP-1 contribute to its dimerization specificity. Transient co-transfection studies demonstrate that A-SREBP-1 can inhibit the transactivation of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 but not USF. A-SREBP-1 may be useful in metabolic diseases where SREBP family members are overexpressed."
https://openalex.org/W1983850019,"Recently, novel hybrid thiol peroxidase (TPx) proteins fused with a glutaredoxin (Grx) were found from some pathogenic bacteria, cyanobacteria, and anaerobic sulfur-oxidizing phototroph. The phylogenic tree analysis that was constructed from the aligned sequences showed two major branches. Haemophilus influenzae TPx·Grx was grouped in one branch as a 1-Cys subfamily of the thiol-specific antioxident protein/AhpC family. Most TPx·Grx proteins, including Vibrio cholerae TPx·Grx, were grouped in the 2-Cys subfamily. To explain the existence of two subgroups in novel hybrid TPx proteins, we have compared the kinetics given by V. cholerae TPx·Grx, H. influenzae TPx·Grx, their separated TPx domains, and a set of mutants devoid of the redox-active cysteines. The kinetic study described here demonstrates clearly that V. cholerae TPx·Grx is a 2-Cys TPx subfamily. For the first time, we also demonstrate the lipid peroxidase activity of V. cholerae TPx·Grx fusion and suggest the in vivo function of 2-Cys TPx·Grx fusion serving as a lipid peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2075090444,"Ligand-induced down-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) comprises activation of two sequential transport steps. The first involves endocytic uptake by clathrin-coated vesicles, the second transfer of endocytosed EGFR from endosomes to lysosomes. Here we demonstrate that the second transport step requires a domain of the EGFR that encompasses residues 985–996 and was previously found to interact with actin. Deletion of domain 989–994 (Δ989–994 EGFR) did not interfere with EGFR uptake but completely abrogated its degradation. In contrast, both uptake and degradation were affected for K721A EGFR, a kinase-deficient EGFR mutant. To measure intracellular EGFR sorting, we developed a novel cell fractionation assay toward which cells were co-transfected for chicken hepatic lectin, a receptor for agialoglycoproteins. These cells were incubated with agialofetuin-coupled colloidal gold, which was targeted to lysosomes after receptor-mediated endocytosis. Compartments within the lysosomal pathway gained buoyant density because of the presence of colloidal gold and could be isolated from cell homogenates by ultracentrifugation through a high-density sucrose cushion. In contrast to endocytosed wild type EGFR, both Δ989–994 EGFR and K721A EGFR were largely not retrieved in gold-containing endocytic compartments. These results are supported with morphological data. We conclude that sorting of endocytosed EGFR into the degradation pathway requires both its kinase activity and actin-binding domain.

We conclude that sorting of endocytosed EGFR into the degradation pathway requires both its kinase activity and actin-binding domain. Receptor tyrosine kinases elicit a diversity of cellular responses, including proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and migration. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MVB, multivesicular bodies; CHL, chicken hepatic lectin; AGF, agialofetuin; AGOR, agialoorosomucoid; Tf, transferrin; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscope; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TfR, transferrin receptor. also named ErbB-1 or HER, is a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases that can, depending on the cell type and ligand, induce several of these distinct responses (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). EGFR responses are initiated by the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that activate its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. EGFR activation stimulates, in addition to several intracellular signaling cascades, its clearance from the cell surface by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. After endocytic uptake, activated EGFR first enters sorting endosomes from where it is sorted to lysosomes for proteolytic degradation. Prior to its transfer to lysosomes, however, endocytosed EGFR continues to signal, and some EGFR substrates are in fact thought to associate primarily with endosomes (2Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 3Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.J. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.

The combined sorting processes, recruitment into clathrincoated pits at the plasma membrane and sorting from endosomes to lysosomes, result in effective down-regulation of activated EGFR. EGFR down-regulation is critically important for proper tissue development as illustrated by uncontrolled growth and metastasis of cancer cells that fail to down-regulate EGFR. The molecular mechanism that regulates endocytic uptake of the EGFR is complex and still ill defined. Ligand-stimulated endocytosis requires endocytic codes within its cytoplasmic domain that are thought to be cryptic in unstimulated EGFR and exposed only upon ligand-induced EGFR autophosphorylation (5Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For example, activated EGFR binds directly and stoichio-metrically to the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-2. This interaction, however, does not seem to be essential for rapid endocytosis (6Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Nesterov A. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to AP-2, src homology 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing proteins, such as c-Cbl, Grb2, and Shc, have been proposed to participate in EGFR endocytosis (9Waterman H. Katz M.

Finally, ubiquitination of the EGFR has been implicated in its endocytosis (14Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). After endocytic uptake and incorporation into sorting endosomes, EGFR·EGF complexes are recruited to vesicles that bud into the lumen of endosomes. Endosomes that have accumulated many of such internal vesicles are referred to as multivesicular bodies (MVB). Incorporation of endocytosed EGFR into the vesicles within MVB is crucial to prevent recycling to the plasma membrane and is, like uptake, dependent on EGFR kinase activity (15Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1541-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Sorting of EGFR into MVB also requires ubiquitination of its cytoplasmic domain (18Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is performed by c-Cbl, an enzyme that associates with autophosphorylated tyrosine residue 1045 of the EGFR. In addition to its ubiquitination site, multiple other domains at its carboxyl terminus, including a dileucine motif at position 679–680 (19Kil S.J. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), residues 1022–1063 and 1063–1123 (15Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol.

Within the latter domain, a tyrosine-leucine motif (954–958) (21Jones S.M. Foreman S.K. Shank B.B. Kurten R.C. Am. J. Physiol.

Distal from this domain, residues 985–996, and more specifically residues 989–994, have been demonstrated to determine an F-actin binding site (24den Hartigh J.C. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.

Boonstra J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The actin-binding domain has homology with actin binding sites of many other actin-binding proteins and is conserved in the EGFR family members ErbB2, v-erbB, and Xmrk. EGF binding rapidly increases the fraction of cytoskeleton-associated EGFR (27van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Defize L.H. de Kroon J. van Damme H. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We anticipated that this association might serve EGFR down-regulation. In the current report we demonstrate that the actin-binding domain indeed plays a crucial role in sorting endocytosed EGFR to lysosomes. Generation and Maintenance of Cells—Stable NIH-3T3 cell lines expressing either human wild type EGFR, K721A EGFR, or Δ989–994 EGFR are described elsewhere (25van der Heyden M.A. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. de Ruiter N.

They were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen). The expression vector pCHL233 containing a cDNA clone for chicken hepatic lectin (CHL) (29Mellow T.E. Halberg D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5468-5473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. K. Drickamer (Columbia University, New York). An EcoRI fragment containing the cDNA for CHL was cloned into a single EcoRI site downstream of the SV40 origin of replication of the amplifiable expression vector pFRSV (30Horwich A.L. Fenton W.A. Firgaira F.A. Fox J.E. Kolansky D. Mellman I.S. Rosenberg L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells expressing EGFR or EGFR mutants were transfected with this construct and selected by gradually increasing the concentration of methotrexate (Pharmachemic) to 50 μm. Stable clones that express 1.2–1.4 × 106 CHL and 1.3–1.7 × 105 (mutant) EGFR/cell, as determined by Scatchard analysis of surface-bound 125I-agialoorosomucoid (AGOR) and 125I-EGF, were selected and maintained in culture medium containing both 600 μg/ml Geneticin and 50 μm methotrexate. These clones homogeneously expressed CHL and (mutant) EGFR as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and were used for all experiments, unless stated otherwise. Preparation and Labeling of Ligands—Sialic acid was removed from fetuin (Sigma) and orosomucoid (Sigma) by incubating at 80 °C for 60 min in 50 mm H2SO4. Subsequently, galactose was removed from asialofetuin and asialoorosomucoid by periodate oxidation followed by sodium borohydride reduction and mild acid hydrolysis (31Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 567-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielding agialofetuin (AGF) and AGOR. AGOR, Fe3+-saturated transferrin (Tf) (Sigma), and EGF (Invitrogen) were labeled with 125I using iodo-beads (Pierce) according to standard procedures and separated from free 125I on Sephadex PD 10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Colloidal gold (5 nm) was prepared principally as described (32Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar). The gold sol was boiled for 1 h after the addition of 0.1% H2O2. The sol was then cooled down to room temperature, the pH set at 10–11 using 0.1 m NaOH, and saturated with AGF. The pH was then lowered to 7.4 using 0.1 N HCl, after which BSA was added to 1 mg/ml. The sol was collected and washed once with 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml BSA by ultracentrifugation. For uptake studies AGF-gold was diluted to a final optical density of 10 at λ520 nm. EGF-induced Uptake and Degradation of EGFR—Cells were seeded on 6-well plates and cultured for 1 day in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, for a second day in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, and then used for experiments. To measure EGFR uptake, cells were incubated in bicarbonate-lacking DMEM supplemented with 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.5% fetal calf serum, and 100 ng/ml 125I-EGF for the time indicated at 37 °C using a water bath. The cells were then washed rapidly with phosphate-buffered saline at 0 °C to remove unbound 125I-EGF. Plasma membrane-associated 125I-EGF was dissociated during a 5-min incubation in 0.2 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml BSA. Endocytosed 125I-EGF was collected by lysing surface-stripped cells in 1 N NaOH. 125I-EGF was quantified using a γ-counter. To measure EGFR degradation, cells were incubated at 37 °C in DMEM, 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 100 ng/ml EGF for the indicated time using a water bath. The cells were then washed rapidly at 0 °C and lysed in SDS-sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were separated by 7.5% PAGE and analyzed for EGFR by Western blotting using Car5, a rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antiserum (33Renfrew C.A. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21265-21273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. A. L. Hubbard, Baltimore, MD), followed by 125I-protein A. EGFR was visualized and quantified using phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cy-3 (Biological Detection Systems, Inc. Pittsburgh, PA) was coupled to AGOR according to the manufacturer's procedures. Cells were plated on gelatin-coated coverslips and cultured as above. Depending on the experiment, either stably (see above) or transiently transfected cells were used. For transient transfections, HIH 3T3 subclone 2.2 cells were transfected with pSV2-EGFR or pSV2-EGFRΔ989–994 cDNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable and transiently transfected cells were cultured overnight in 0.5% fetal calf serum, preincubated for 30 min in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C, and incubated for 30 min with 100 ng/ml EGF-Alexa488 (Molecular Probes), 100 ng/ml EGF, 20 μg/ml transferrin-Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes), and/or Cy3-labeled AGOR as indicated. When indicated, the cells were washed and chased for 30 min in the absence of ligands. Endocytosis was stopped by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The cells were fixed with 4% form-aldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, for 30 min at 20 °C. Free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, and the cells were permeabilized and immunolabeled in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml saponin and 20 mg/ml BSA. In stably transfected cells EGFR was labeled with Car5 (see above), transferrin receptor (TfR) with the mouse monoclonal antibody H68.4 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and LAMP-1 with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against its cytoplasmic domain (generously provided by Dr. C. Hopkins, University College, London, UK). Primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy5-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (all from Jackson). Confocal sections of labeled cells were made using a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Sorting Assays—Cells were cultured on 6-cm gelatin-coated culture dishes, washed with prewarmed DMEM, 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1% BSA, and incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 5 nm AGF-gold (optical density of 10 at 520 nm; see above), 100 ng/ml 125I-EGF or 100 ng/ml EGF, and, when indicated, 2 μg/ml 125I-Tf or 2 μg/ml 125I-AGOR. After endocytosis, the cells were washed four times at 0 °C with DMEM, 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1% BSA to remove unbound ligands. Subsequently, surface-bound ligands were removed at 0 °C by washing the cells for 5 min in a low pH buffer (20 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.5, supplemented with 130 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 50 μm desferal) followed by 10 min in DMEM, 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1% BSA, 50 μm desferal. The cells were then washed with and scraped in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% NaN3, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A). Scraped cells were homogenized by passing them 20 times through a 23-gauge needle mounted on a syringe. Nuclei were removed from the homogenates by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 1 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Nuclear pellets contained less than 10% of internalized 125I-labeled ligands. 400-μl samples of the postnuclear supernatants were loaded on top of 3 ml of 0.4 or 1.3 m sucrose in 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A. The samples were centrifuged for 60 min at 50,000 rpm in a SW60 rotor using a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatants were removed and the pellets analyzed for the presence of 125I using a γ-counter. The pellet below the 0.4-m sucrose cushion contained all endocytic compartments, whereas the pellet below the 1.3-m sucrose cushion contained only those endosomal and lysosomal vacuoles that were loaded with AGF-gold. EGFR Degradation Requires Kinase Activity and Domain 989–994—NIH-3T3 subclone 2.2 cells express undetectable levels of endogenous mouse receptors. Stable cell lines transfected for either wild type or mutant human EGFR were used to determine the contribution of the kinase (K721A EGFR) and actin-binding domain (Δ989–994 EGFR) to EGFR trafficking. K721A EGFR was used as a control for which ligand-induced trafficking had already been demonstrated to be defective. Scatchard analysis indicated similar binding constants and receptor numbers (1.3–1.7 × 105/cell) for wild type and mutant receptors (data not shown). To study EGF-induced degradation of the EGFR, cells were incubated at 37 °C in medium containing EGF, lysed, and analyzed for the presence of intact EGFR by Western blotting. The amount of wild type EGFR was reduced in the presence of EGF with a t½ of ∼60 min (Fig. 1A). In contrast, both Δ989–994 EGFR and K721A EGFR were remarkably resistant to EGF-induced degradation. EGFR Endocytosis Requires Kinase Activity but Not Domain 989–994—Lack of degradation could result either from inefficient uptake or deficient transfer of endocytosed receptors to lysosomes. To discriminate between these possibilities we first measured EGFR uptake. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 125I-EGF after which cell surface-associated 125I-EGF and internalized 125I-EGF were determined (Fig. 1B). Wild type EGFR endocytosed with a t½ of ∼5 min. The initial rate of uptake for K721A EGFR was ∼30% compared with wild type EGFR, consistent with a requirement for EGFR kinase activity. In contrast, the initial rate of uptake for Δ989–994 EGFR was comparable with wild type EGFR. After 10–30 min, however, the relative amount of intracellular 125I-EGF was slightly lower for Δ989–994 EGFR as compared with wild type EGFR-expressing cells, probably as a consequence of increased recycling for Δ989–994 EGFR (see below). Combined, the data in Fig. 1, A and B suggest that although Δ989–994 EGFR was endocytosed normally, its transfer from endosomes to lysosomes may be abrogated. For K721A EGFR, degradation was affected more severely than uptake, consistent with a role for EGFR kinase activity in both uptake and sorting from endosomes to lysosomes. Sorting of Endocytosed EGFR Requires Both Kinase Activity and Domain 989–994 as Determined by CLSM—To study intracellular EGFR trafficking, the subcellular distribution of endocytosed EGFR was first analyzed by CLSM. As a marker for the lysosomal pathway we used Cy3-conjugated agialoorosomucoid (Cy3-AGOR). This ligand was efficiently endocytosed by CHL, a receptor that was stably co-transfected into EGFR-expressing cells. After receptor-mediated uptake, glycoproteins containing terminal N-acetylglucosamine, such as AGOR, dissociate from CHL because of the low pH in endosomes and are then transferred to lysosomes (29Mellow T.E. Halberg D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5468-5473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TfR was used as a marker for the recycling pathway. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with EGF in the presence or absence of Cy3-AGOR, fixed, and then immunolabeled for EGFR only or for both EGFR and TfR. Endocytosed wild type EGFR co-distributed with Cy3-AGOR rather than with TfR-containing compartments (Fig. 2), indicating transport to late endosomes and lysosomes. In contrast, both Δ989–994 EGFR and K721A EGFR co-distributed predominantly with TfR rather than with Cy3-AGOR (Fig. 3), demonstrating entry into the recycling pathway.Fig. 3Intracellular distribution of stably transfected Δ989–994 EGFR and K721A EGFR. Cells expressing CHL and either Δ989–994 EGFR or K721A EGFR were treated as described for Fig. 2. Top two rows, K721A EGFR. Bottom two rows, Δ989–994 EGFR. Both mutant receptors co-localize with TfR rather than with Cy3-AGOR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further resolve the itinerary of Δ989–994 EGFR and demonstrate that its behavior is not affected by co-expression of CHL and is not a peculiarity of the stable cell lines used above, cells transiently transfected for wild type EGFR or Δ989–994 EGFR were used. These cells were allowed to endocytose Al-exa488-EGF and Alexa546-Tf for 30 min and then chased for another 30 min at 37 °C in the absence of ligands. After fixation the cells were immunolabeled with Cy5 for LAMP-1, a membrane protein marker of late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 4). In wild type EGFR-expressing cells, EGF was pulse-chased predominantly into LAMP-1-containing compartments (Fig. 4A), whereas in Δ989–994 EGFR-expressing cells EGF was largely confined to Tf-containing recycling endosomes (Fig. 4B). Again, these data illustrate that endocytosed Δ989–994 EGFR is sorted into the recycling pathway rather than into the degradation pathway. A Novel Method to Isolate Compartments within the Degradation Pathway from the Plasma Membrane and Recycling Endosomes—To investigate intracellular EGFR trafficking further, we developed a method to isolate sorting endosomes and lysosomes from recycling endosomes. Again, we used stable NIH 3T3 cell lines that co-express (mutant) EGFR and CHL. In this case CHL was employed to endocytose AGF coupled to 5 nm gold particles. Following endocytic uptake, AGF-gold dissociated from CHL in endosomes and was targeted to lysosomes (Fig. 5A). Vacuolar sorting endosomes and lysosomes contained up to hundreds of endocytosed AGF-gold particles as demonstrated by whole-mount electron microscopy (Fig. 5B) (34Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In biochemical assays we used trace amounts of 125I-AGOR, which was, like AGF-gold, endocytosed by CHL and targeted to lysosomes. After endocytic uptake, the cells were washed at 4 °C to remove unbound ligands, followed by a treatment at pH 3.5 to strip AGF-gold and 125I-labeled ligands from the plasma membrane. Alternatively, surface-bound AGF-gold and 125I-AGOR could be removed with EDTA (data not shown), confirming the specificity of their interaction with CHL (29Mellow T.E. Halberg D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5468-5473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After cell homogenization and removal of nuclei by centrifugation, equal samples from each postnuclear supernatant were loaded on top of 0.4- and 1.3-m sucrose cushions and ultracentrifuged. All membranes pelleted through the 0.4-m sucrose cushion (total membrane fraction). In contrast, only those compartments loaded with AGF-gold were collected below the 1.3-m sucrose cushion due to their gain in buoyant density (Fig. 5C). To validate this technique, CHL-expressing cells were incubated for 120 min at 37 °C, during which 125I-AGOR was present only during the final 15 min and AGF-gold was either absent or present during the final 15, 30, 60, or 120 min (Fig. 6A). In the absence of AGF-gold (0 min) only ∼10% of vacuole-associated 125I-AGOR was recovered at the bottom of the 1.3-m sucrose cushion. In contrast, ∼60% was recovered when AGF-gold was present concomitantly (15 min) with 125I-AGOR. The efficiency of this procedure did not increase when the cells were additionally loaded with AGF-gold prior to the 15-min pulse with 125I-AGOR (30–120 min) or at higher AGF-gold concentrations (not shown). Efficient endocytosis of 125I-AGOR as well as the AGF-gold-induced density shift of endocytic compartments relied on the expression of CHL (not shown). We next studied whether different compartments encountered within the lysosomal pathway (e.g. sorting endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes) were collected with equal efficiencies. Cells were incubated with AGF-gold for 60 min, of which 125I-AGOR was present during the last 5–60 min (Fig. 6B). As expected, 125I-AGOR accumulated linearly with time, indicating progressive loading of the degradation pathway. Again, ∼60% of 125I-AGOR could be collected, irrespective of the loading time, indicating similar efficiencies for the isolation of “early” versus “late” compartments within the lysosomal pathway. The plasma membrane was stripped from AGF-gold prior to cell homogenization and thus not expected to pellet through 1.3 m sucrose. To verify this directly, AGF-gold-loaded and surface-stripped cells were biotinylated prior to cell homogenization to label plasma membrane proteins. The pellets at the bottom of 0.4- or 1.3-m sucrose cushions were extracted using TX114, and biotinylated plasma membrane proteins were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 6C). Membranes collected under the 0.4-m sucrose cushion contained many biotinylated plasma membrane proteins, whereas those pelleting through 1.3 m sucrose contained none, indicating the absence of plasma membrane in the latter fraction. In contrast to endocytosed 125I-AGOR, only ∼20% of the late-endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP-1 was collected under the 1.3-m sucrose cushion after 60 min of loading with AGF-gold, indicating that only a limited fraction of these compartments was reached by the endocytosed markers, consistent with the CLSM data in Fig. 4. In conclusion, this technique can be used to measure sorting of AGF-gold from other concomitantly endocytosed markers but not to assess the subcellular distribution of endogenous proteins.Fig. 6Validation of fractionation method using colloidal gold. A, cells expressing CHL and EGFR were incubated for 2 h, of which 125I-AGOR was present only during the last 15 min. AGF-gold was either absent (t = 0), or present (during the last 15–120 min as indicated). Cells were then stripped from ligands, homogenized, and fractionated as illustrated in Fig. 5C. The amount of 125I-AGOR that pelleted through the 1.3-m sucrose cushion is plotted as percentage of total membrane-associated 125I-AGOR (collected under the 0.4-m sucrose cushion). Maximal recovery of 125I-AGOR-containing compartments was already obtained when AGF-gold was concomitantly present during uptake (15 min). Preincubations with AGF-gold did not further increase this efficiency. B, cells expressing CHL and EGFR were incubated for 1 h with AGF-gold. During this incubation, 125I-AGOR was also present during the final 5–60 min as indicated. After endocytic uptake, the cells were stripped from cell su"

They are separated by islands of putative heterochromatin boundary regions. The SuUR protein, which is involved in the control of chromosome organization, is localized exclusively in heterochromatin and often colocalizes on chromosomes with Polycomb group proteins. To test whether the SuUR protein is associated with boundary regions, we used gel retardation assays and found that the SuUR protein binds specifically to boundary regions and that boundary regions are under-replicated. These results suggest that the regular distribution of boundary regions in chromosomes may represent the dispersion of sites designed for chromosomal silencing.

These results suggest that the regular distribution of boundary regions in chromosomes may represent the dispersion of sites designed for chromosomal silencing. Eukaryotic chromosomes are organized in two structural components, euchromatin and heterochromatin, corresponding to active (decondensed) or inactive (condensed) chromosomal states, respectively. Small regions of heterochromatin, known as intercalary heterochromatin (I-HC), 1The abbreviations used are: I-HC, intercalary heterochromatin; SuUR, protein involved in suppression of under-replication; BR, boundary region separating forum domains; PcG, Polycomb group proteins; trxG, trithorax group proteins; PHO, Pleiohomeotic protein. 1The abbreviations used are: I-HC, intercalary heterochromatin; SuUR, protein involved in suppression of under-replication; BR, boundary region separating forum domains; PcG, Polycomb group proteins; trxG, trithorax group proteins; PHO, Pleiohomeotic protein. are scattered throughout the euchromatic regions, but the function of these regions is unknown.These discrete functional chromosomal domains are formed by the coordinated action of different regulatory elements, and the key elements remain unknown. The finding that genes from euchromatic regions can become epigenetically inactivated after translocation into heterochromatic regions provided the first functional definition for heterochromatin (for review, see Ref. 1Grewal S.I.S. Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Recently, the original cytogenetic definition of heterochromatin has been supplemented by molecular and biochemical data, providing a deeper understanding of chromosomal structure and function.Both DNA sequence elements and modifications to bound proteins play a critical role in determining chromosome structure. Recently, the definition of heterochromatic regions has been augmented by the recognition that such regions are marked by the methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (2Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). Repressive chromosomal states can be created and maintained during development for the transcriptional silencing of homeotic genes (for review, see Ref. 3Kennison J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). PcG proteins are required for this type of repressive state (4Pirrotta V. Cell. 1998; 93: 333-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These proteins form at least two types of complexes with a number of different proteins. One type possesses histone deacetylase activity and blocks ATP-dependent remodeling of local chromosomal structure (5Shao Z. Raible F. Mollaaghababa R. Guyon J.R. Wu C.-T. Bender W. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 37-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 6van der Vlag J. Otte A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Recently, a connection between PcG-mediated gene silencing and the methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 has been established (7Cao. R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar, 8Muller J. Hart C.M. Francis N.J. Vargas M.L. Sengupta A. Wild B. Miller E.L. O'Connor M.B. Kingston R.E. Simon J.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Another group of proteins, trxG, is required to perpetuate the transcriptionally active state (for review, see Ref. 9Simon J.A. Tamkun J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Evidence demonstrates that both PcG and trxG proteins not only control homeotic genes but also play a role in the regulation of other genes important for development (10Gerasimova T.I. Corces V.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 11Vazquez M. Moore L. Kennison J.A. Development. 1999; 126: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both PcG and trxG proteins form complexes at specific DNA sequences, PRE (Polycomb response element) and TRE (trithorax response element), which are important for the silencing or activation of neighboring genes (12Orlando V. Jane E.P. Chinwalla V. Harte P.J. Paro R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5141-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Horard B. Tatout C. Poux S.P. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4528-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although only one DNA-binding PcG protein (Pleiohomeotic, also called PHO) and two DNA-binding trxG proteins (GAGA-factor and Zeste) have been described (9Simon J.A. Tamkun J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 15Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardia M. Espinas M.L. Bernues J. Azorin F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These complexes often form at the response elements indirectly and are recruited by other proteins; it is possible that other PcG or trxG proteins and novel repressing or activating complexes exist (9Simon J.A. Tamkun J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 16Levine S.S. Weiss A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Shao Z. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6070-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).The study of higher order chromosomal structures is hampered by both the complexity of chromosomal architecture and the lack of experimental approaches for the identification of structural components. Ten years ago we began a study of the chromosomal fragments that are released from chromosomes shortly after spontaneous degradation. It has been shown that the early fragmentation is non-random, and chromosomal domains (forum domains) consisting of 50–150 kb DNA stretches were observed in all eukaryotes examined (17Tchurikov N.A. Ponomarenko N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6751-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The boundary regions (BRs) between neighboring domains have been studied in Drosophila (18Tchurikov N.A. Krasnov A.N. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Y.B. Chernov B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3221-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and their properties led to speculation that the biochemically detected BRs could correspond to the cytologically detected I-HC regions.Recently, the SuUR protein (suppressor of under-replication) has been described (19Moshkin Y.M. Belyakin S.N. Rubtsov N.B. Kokoza E.B. Alekseyenko A.A. Volkova E.I. Belyaeva E.S. Makunin I.V. Spierer P. Zhimulev I.F. Chromosoma. 2002; 111: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). SuUR binds exclusively at I-HC regions and often co-localizes with PcG binding sites (19Moshkin Y.M. Belyakin S.N. Rubtsov N.B. Kokoza E.B. Alekseyenko A.A. Volkova E.I. Belyaeva E.S. Makunin I.V. Spierer P. Zhimulev I.F. Chromosoma. 2002; 111: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Makunin I.V. Volkova E.I. Belyaeva E.S. Nabirochkina E.N. Pirrotta V. Zhimulev I.F. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in SuUR expression dramatically alter the structure of Drosophila chromosomes, and increases in protein level lead to the formation of specific structures only in the regions of I-HC (19Moshkin Y.M. Belyakin S.N. Rubtsov N.B. Kokoza E.B. Alekseyenko A.A. Volkova E.I. Belyaeva E.S. Makunin I.V. Spierer P. Zhimulev I.F. Chromosoma. 2002; 111: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These observations led us to ask whether SuUR could bind at BRs. Here we describe results that suggest that SuUR binds to BRs in a specific way and that BRs are under-replicated. We also show that SuUR shares homology with the bromodomain of the Brahma protein, a dominant suppressor of Polycomb mutations (21Kennison J.A. Tamkun J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8136-8140Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 22Tamkun J.W. Deuring R. Scott M.P. Kissinger M. Pattaticci A.M. Kaufman T.C. Kennison J.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 561-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The data indicate that BRs correspond to small islands of I-HC that are regularly dispersed along eukaryotic chromosomes. We speculate that this chromosomal organization could be related to the mechanism of chromosomal silencing.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of DNA and Pulsed Field Gel (PFG) Electrophoresis—Preparation of forum domains was performed as described earlier (17Tchurikov N.A. Ponomarenko N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6751-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Tchurikov N.A. Krasnov A.N. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Y.B. Chernov B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3221-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Anesthetized flies were homogenized in a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 125 mm NaCl and 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 at 0 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in the same solution. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 2–3 × 107 cells per ml, gently mixed at 43 °C with an equal volume of 1% agarose-L (LKB) in the phosphate-buffered saline solution, and distributed on a mold containing 100-μl wells. The mold was incubated for 5–10 min on ice. The agarose plugs were then incubated at 50 °C for 48 h in the solution containing 0.5 m EDTA (pH 9.5), 1% sodium laurylsarcosine, and 2 mg/ml proteinase K and stored in the same solution at 4 °C. Portions of the agarose-DNA plugs containing 1–5 μg of DNA were used for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (LKB Pulsaphor system) at pulse times of 100 s as described (17Tchurikov N.A. Ponomarenko N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6751-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Cloning Procedures—The cloning of the BR from the 70C region using the supF selectable marker and the modified jumping library technique was described earlier (17Tchurikov N.A. Ponomarenko N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6751-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The BR from the 84D region was cloned using end-labeled forum DNA probes (18Tchurikov N.A. Krasnov A.N. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Y.B. Chernov B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3221-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). About 5 μg of DNA, eluted after pulsed field gel electrophoresis (see the scheme in Fig. 1B), was treated with Escherichia coli exonuclease III (Promega) under a condition that removes ∼100–300 bases. After the exonuclease III treatment, the sample was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min, dialyzed, and concentrated on solid sucrose. A fill-in reaction with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Promega) was performed in the presence of 500 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (EIMB; specific activity ∼6000 Ci/mmol) in a solution containing three unlabeled dNTPs. After alkaline fragmentation, the fraction of the DNA probe depleted in repeats (18Tchurikov N.A. Krasnov A.N. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Y.B. Chernov B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3221-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used for hybridization with the restriction fragments of λ clones comprising the 84D region. The BR-containing fragments were sequenced and subcloned using PCR with the specific primers containing the following artificial restriction sites: the A subfragment of the BR from the 84D region (5′-cccggatccTGATTATTAAAGTAATTAATATTGC-3′ and 5′-cccgaattcGTTCTGCTTTTTAAAATCTATTT-3′); the B subfragment of the BR from the 84D region (5′-gcccggatccGATTCTAATCTATTTGATACC-3′ and 5′-gcccaagcttGTTGCAGGGACATGACA-3′); the C subfragment of the BR from the 84D region (5′-gcccggatccGGGATAACAACTGTGA-3′ and 5′-gcccaagcttATTTATCTGATGCATGG-3′); the A subfragment of the BR from the 70C region (5′-cccggatccCAATATGAATGGCTGGG-3′ and 5′-cccgaattcGGTATCTGGCATTTG-3′); and the B subfragment of the BR from the 70C region (5′-cccggatccAAGCTGTCATCGTCGG-3′ and 5′-cccgaattcGAATTCTCAATTAATTTT-3′).Gel Retardation Analysis—BR DNA fragments were labeled using a 3′ fill-in reaction with avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Promega). ∼0.5 ng (2.5 fmol) of DNA was added after 5–10 min of incubation in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 4% Ficoll, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0,2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of pUC12 DNA, 5 μg of poly(dI-dC), DNA competitors (in some experiments), and 2 μl of nuclear extract. The incubation was continued for 1 h at 0 °C. 1–3 μl of SuUR antibodies were added to some samples after incubation of the mixture with [32P]DNA for 20 min. 1-mm thick and 20-cm long 4% polyacrylamide gels (38:2) in a buffer containing 0.2× TBE (17 mm Tris-HCl, 17 mm boric acid, pH 8.3, and 0.5 mm EDTA) were used after pre-electrophoresis for 2 h at 2–40 °C at 73 mA. Electrophoresis was performed for 6–8 h at 33 mA. After washing in 10% acetic acid (two times, 30 min each), the gel was dried and radioautographed. Quantitation of the results was performed using a Cyclone phosphorimaging device.Under-replication Analysis—Isolation of DNA from brains and salivary glands of third instar larvae was performed as described previously (23Moshkin Y.M. Alekseyenko A.A. Semeshin V.F. Spierer A. Spierer P. Makarevich G.F. Belyaeva E.S. Zhimulev I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Southern blots were hybridized under stringent conditions with 32P-labeled RNA probes.Computer Analysis—BLAST search of the Drosophila genome was performed through the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (Fly BLAST; www.fruitfly.org/blast/blast_form.html). Protein BLAST and BLAST 2 sequence searches on the NCBI server were performed for a study of homologous protein sequences using the default parameters (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). Accession numbers of SuUR and Brahma protein sequences are NM_080096 and P25439, respectively.RESULTSBinding of SuUR to Two BRs—To study the relationship between cytogenetically observed I-HC regions, where SuUR was detected cytogenetically, and biochemically detected BRs, we investigated the association of SuUR with BRs. Our prediction was that BRs and I-HC are the same regions in eukaryotic chromosomes that separate forum domains (18Tchurikov N.A. Krasnov A.N. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Y.B. Chernov B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3221-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Fig. 1A shows a typical separation pattern of chromosomal DNA domains, denoted forum domains. Two approaches were used for the mapping and cloning of BRs, a modified jumping library technique and mapping with end-labeled probes (17Tchurikov N.A. Ponomarenko N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6751-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Tchurikov N.A. Krasnov A.N. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Y.B. Chernov B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3221-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The scheme in Fig. 1B illustrates the procedures used for isolation of two BRs, one from the 84D region and another from the 70C region. To study the BRs, spanning regions ∼700 bp in length where DNA cleavage takes place during excision of the domains, we isolated clones corresponding to undamaged regions between individual forum domains in Drosophila melanogaster.To study the binding of SuUR we used the BRs separating different forum domains in chromosome 3R, one from region 70C and another from region 84D (18Tchurikov N.A. Krasnov A.N. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Y.B. Chernov B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3221-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The cloned regions were localized by in situ hybridization on polytene chromosomes, and the result was confirmed by the FLY BLAST search using the FlyBase/GadFly genome annotation data base. The clones corresponding to the undamaged regions were subcloned into 200–300-bp fragments using PCR. SuUR protein binding to the BRs was measured using gel retardation assays.Nuclear protein extracts were isolated from flies of three genetic backgrounds, namely Oregon RC wild-type stock, the transgenic hs-SuUR stock producing high levels of SuUR protein under the control of the hsp70 promoter, and a mutant homozygous SuUR- stock. It was shown earlier that the protein is expressed in wild-type lines at a low level (20Makunin I.V. Volkova E.I. Belyaeva E.S. Nabirochkina E.N. Pirrotta V. Zhimulev I.F. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Moshkin Y.M. Alekseyenko A.A. Semeshin V.F. Spierer A. Spierer P. Makarevich G.F. Belyaeva E.S. Zhimulev I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that the protein extract, isolated after heat shock treatment of the transgenic stock, demonstrates strong binding and retardation of 32P-labeled DNA corresponding to the 210-bp fragment from the distal part of the 84D-BR (subfragment A; see scheme in Fig. 2A). Quantitative analysis revealed that up to 30% of the DNA is present in two retarded bands. Binding with the extract from the Oregon RC stock was not detected (Fig. 2B), suggesting low levels of SuUR protein in normal stocks. The same is true for the transgenic stock without heat treatment (Fig. 2A). Apparently, the upper retarded band corresponds to homodimers or heterodimers of SuUR. Two super-shifted bands were observed after the addition of SuUR antibodies (Fig. 2B) (20Makunin I.V. Volkova E.I. Belyaeva E.S. Nabirochkina E.N. Pirrotta V. Zhimulev I.F. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They most likely correspond to the doublet of the retarded bands, and each supershifted band has a SuUR subunit. In experiments with GAGA and PHO antibodies, no change in the patterns of the retardation was detected (not shown). GAGA is a DNA-binding trxG protein (15Pagans S. Ortiz-Lombardia M. Espinas M.L. Bernues J. Azorin F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4406-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PHO is the only known PcG protein directly binding to DNA (24Brown J.L. Mucci D. Whiteley M. Dirksen M. Kassis J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This indicates that neither the BRs nor SuUR bind to these regulatory proteins under the conditions used.Fig. 2Gel retardation experiments. Nuclear protein extracts (extr.) were isolated from flies of the following stocks: Oregon RC (O); SuUR- homozygous mutant with injured SuUR gene (M); and heat shock-treated or not treated transgenic hs-SuUR line (hs+ or hs-). Shifted bands are indicated by arrows, and the super-shifted bands observed after the addition of the SuUR antibodies are shown by arrows with asterisks. Anti-SuUR antibodies (Ab) were added to some probes. Sub-fragments of both BRs are shown on the schemes below. A, retardation of BR from the 84D region. Experiments with the A subfragment are shown (see scheme below). The experiments with five different preparations of protein extracts isolated from heat shock-treated or not treated hs-SuUR flies are shown. B, retardation of BR isolated from the 84D region. Experiments with the A subfragment are shown. Cold self-competitor DNA in 10 or 100 excess (comp.) was added to two probes. C, BR from the 70C region. Experiments with the A subfragment (see scheme below) are shown. Big arrow above the 70C-BR region indicates the position of a cleavage site during spontaneous fragmentation of chromosomes (18Tchurikov N.A. Krasnov A.N. Ponomarenko N.A. Golova Y.B. Chernov B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3221-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). SuUR binding subfragments are shown by bars. GenBank™ accession numbers for the sequences are U89926 and U90540.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The 344-bp fragment from the BR, corresponding to the 70C region (subfragment A on a scheme, Fig. 2C), demonstrates a similar binding pattern in which only extracts from heat shock-treated transgenic stock lead to a shift of the BR probe, and, again, two retarded bands are observed. The subfragments B and C, corresponding to the 84D-BR (see scheme in Fig. 2, A and B), do not appear to bind SuUR under the same conditions (not shown). The same is true for the subfragment B from 70C-BR. These data point to the specificity of the binding of SuUR within particular regions of the BRs. In our experiments we used a protocol in which the addition of 32P-labeled DNA was performed after pre-incubation of the reaction mixture with an excess of pUC-12 plasmid DNA for 5–15 min. The specific character of the binding was also confirmed by self-competition experiments in which the pre-incubation was performed with an excess of the same unlabelled DNA fragment (Fig. 2B).Fig. 3 shows the results of competition experiments with excess DNA from another BR. 32P-labeled DNA of the A subfragment from 84D-BR was added to a mixture containing nuclear extract from the transgenic stock and an excess of 70C-BR (70C-BR, A subfragment). The latter was as effective a competitor as the cold 84D-BR itself (84D-BR, A fragment). Thus, 70C-BR DNA competes with the formation of the retarded complexes obtained with the 84D-BR, indicating that both BRs bind the same protein. As expected, a nonspecific competitor, the B subfragment of 84D-BR, does not prevent the binding of the SuUR protein with the labeled DNA. Some other nonspecific DNAs were also found to be incapable of preventing binding of SuUR to the BR (not shown). Nuclear extract isolated from the heat shock-treated Oregon RC stock does not reveal any binding (Fig. 3), indicating that the protein binding to the sequences is not some unknown protein induced by heat shock. It suggests that the production of SuUR in the transgenic stock occurs after heat shock treatment and that SuUR interacts with the BRs studied. The data strongly support the conclusion that BRs bind SuUR in a specific manner. There was no consensus sequence detected between two BRs tested. This may indicate that SuUR binding is not sequence-specific but structure-specific, although it could not be excluded that some degenerate sequences are involved in the specific binding.Fig. 3Competition experiments. Gel retardation experiments with a labeled A subfragment from 84D-BR are shown. The binding was tested with three different nuclear extracts from heat shock-treated flies of the Oregon RC line (O) or with the extract from the heat shock-treated transgenic line producing SuUR (S). In some probes, 100× excess of cold competitor DNAs (comp.) were incubated with the extracts before the addition of the labeled DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) as follows: B subfragment from 84D-BR (84-B, nonspecific competitor); A subfragment from 84D-BR (84-A, self-competitor); or A subfragment from 70C-BR (70-A, cross-competitor).

Barsky V.E. Electron Microscopic Map of Polytene Chromosomes from Drosophila Salivary Glands. Nauka, Moscow1985: 1-85Google Scholar, 26Zhimulev I.F. Adv. Genet. 1998; 37: 11-566Google Scholar). We compared the amount of DNA from brains (nonpolytenic organ) and salivary glands (polytenic organ) hybridizing with 32P-labeled RNA probes that were synthesized on the BR fragments. We used a set of five identical Southern blots obtained after fractionation of equal volumes of the same preparation of total DNAs from brains and glands as described earlier (19Moshkin Y.M. Belyakin S.N. Rubtsov N.B. Kokoza E.B. Alekseyenko A.A. Volkova E.I. Belyaeva E.S. Makunin I.V. Spierer P. Zhimulev I.F. Chromosoma. 2002; 111: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Subsequent hybridization experiments were performed with five blots each, using different probes. Fig. 4A shows that both of the BRs studied are indeed under-replicated. Quantitation of the autoradiographic signals was used to determine the relative levels of under-replication. The relative levels of under-replication in bands 70C and 84D are ∼5- and 2-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A). Differences of the relative level of polyteny of 2-fold or more are significant (23Moshkin Y.M. Alekseyenko A.A. Semeshin V.F. Spierer A. Spierer P. Makarevich G.F. Belyaeva E.S. Zhimulev I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Bands 70C and 84D were previously described as the regions in which visible reorganization of chromatin took place upon overexpression of the SuUR gene in the salivary glands and where the SuUR protein was localized by immunofluorescence (20Makunin I.V.

Our molecular data on SuUR binding to 70C-BR and 84D-BR are clearly consistent with these observations.Fig. 4Analysis of DNA under-replication in two BRs and their positions in the genome annotation data base of Drosophila. A, fragments from the 84D-BR and 70C-BR regions were tested. Total DNA preparations from brains (b) and salivary glands (g) were isolated from the third instar Oregon RC larvae and used for Southern hybridizations as described previously (20Makunin I.V.

The control probes corresponding to the under-replicated R270 fragment (20Makunin I.V. Volkova E.I. Belyaeva E.S. Nabirochkina E.N. Pirrotta V. Zhimulev I.F.

Belyakin S.N. Rubtsov N.B. Kokoza E.B. Alekseyenko A.A. Volkova E.I. Belyaeva E.S. Makunin I.V. Spierer P. Zhimulev I.F. Chromosoma. 2002; 111: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that the N terminus of SuUR possesses significant similarity with the N-terminal portions of the ATPase/helicase domains of the SNF2 family of transcription activators (e.g. SNF2, STH1, Brahma, and MOT1). We present additional data showing homology between the SuUR and trxG proteins. We also detected two additional regions of SuUR, which share 42% identity with the entire bromodomain of the Brahma protein (22Tamkun J.W. Deuring R. Scott M.P. Kissinger M. Pattaticci A.M. Kaufman T.C. Kennison J.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 561-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and its downstream region (Fig. 5). This is surprising, because SuUR is associated with the I-HC regions, where chromatin is condensed and transcription should be repressed. One possible explanation is that PcG- and trxG-containing complexes share some protein(s) and that this domain of SuUR interacts with other proteins during the remodeling of local chromosomal configuration regardless of transcription activation.

Repression of NF-κB by IκBα(sr) also facilitates tumor necrosis factor α-induced apoptosis in the cell. However, IκBα primarily targets RelA and c-Rel-containing complexes, leaving other NF-κB/Rel protein complexes, such as p50 and p52 homodimers, and RelB heterodimers uninhibited.

Our results suggest that p105(sr) is a broader range and effective NF-κB super repressor and can potentially be used in cells where a noncanonical NF-κB activity is dominant or multiple NF-κB activities are activated.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar). In normal physiological conditions such activation is transient, because of autoregulatory mechanisms (2Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 3Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). However, this family of transcription factors is constitutively activated in many types of cancer cell and is thought to regulate anti-apoptosis factors that aid survival of the cancer cells (4Gilmore T. Gapuzan M.E. Kalaitzidis D. Starczynowski D. Cancer Lett. 2002; 181: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev.

Chemotherapy reagents induce death of cancer cells but also activate NF-κB pathways. Therefore, activation of NF-κB is a contributing factor of chemoresistance. Introduction of an IκBα-based NF-κB super repressor (sr) into cancer cells has not only enhanced stimuli-induced apoptosis (9Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 10Wang C.Y. Cusack Jr., J.C. Liu R. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 11Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar) but also facilitated systematic identification of genes regulated by NF-κB that may contribute to the malignancy and progression of the tumor (12Hinz M. Lemke P. Anagnostopoulos I. Hacker C. Krappmann D. Mathas S. Dorken B. Zenke M. Stein H. Scheidereit C. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Activation of prototypic NF-κB requires degradation of IκBs, and the prerequisite of the process is stimuli-induced phosphorylation of IκBs by the IκB kinase-constituted signalsome (13Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). IκBα(sr) was generated by either mutating serine 32 and 36, which are the targets of the IκB kinases or deleting the N-terminal portion of IκBα that harbors these targets. IκBα(sr) suppresses stimuli-induced NF-κB activation, because the inhibitor now cannot be phosphorylated and therefore will not be subjected to immediate degradation, and the bound NF-κB subunits will not be released into the nucleus. Although in most normal and cancer cells, the NF-κB activity detected is that of prototype p50/RelA heterodimer, atypical/noncanonical NF-κB species also play significant roles in gene regulations (14Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 693-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). For example, the RelB/p52 complex plays a key role in B cell development (14Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 693-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). It has also been observed that NF-κB p50 homodimer activity is significantly elevated in certain types of cancers such as murine B cell leukemia and chemical-promoted mouse skin carcinomas, and such elevation has been linked to the survival of the cancer cells (15Budunova I.V. Perez P. Vaden V.R. Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Jorcano J.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7423-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Kurland J.F. Kodym R. Story M.D. Spurgers K.B. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45380-45386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, more than one species of NF-κB can be elevated in cancer cells (17Cogswell P.C. Guttridge D.C. Funkhouser W.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and broad inhibition of this family of proteins is pharmacologically and clinically significant. p105 has been regarded as an atypical NF-κB/Rel protein inhibitor. It binds other Rel proteins and retains them in the cytoplasm (18Hatada E.N. Nieters A. Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Meyer R. Nucifora G. McKeithan T.W. Scheidereit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2489-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Hatada E.N. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2781-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Liou H.C.

However, wild-type p105 cannot be employed as an NF-κB super repressor, because expression of the nfkb1 gene always produces both p105 and p50 in the cell, and the latter is a component of the NF-κB transcription complex (23Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, wild-type p105, like IκBα, also undergoes signal-induced complete degradation, releasing the bound NF-κB species into the nucleus (25Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Compared with IκBα, however, p105 possesses important features that make it potentially a broader range NF-κB super repressor. First, p105 interacts with all Rel proteins, including p50, p52, and RelB, with high affinity through the Rel homology domain (RHD) and IκBγ-like ankyrin repeats. Second, although both require the proteasome activity, p50 biogenesis and p105 degradation are separate processes (23Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 25Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22215-22222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The middle region of p105, which contains a glycine-rich region (29Lin L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a putative degradation signal for the proteasome (30Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israel A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is likely to be responsible for p50 generation. The C terminus of p105, which harbors the consensus sequences for the IκB kinases, the ubiquitin ligase β-transducin repeat-containing protein, and a death domain (DD), is required for signal-induced p105 degradation (26Beinke S. Belich M.P. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24162-24168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22215-22222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because none of these cis-elements overlap with the RHD or IκBγ-like ankyrin repeats, mutations within these two areas may not interfere with the dimerization and inhibitory functions of the p105 protein. The schematic structure of p105 is shown in Fig. 1A. Based on these assumptions, we have designed and generated a p105(sr) by deletion of residues 356-498 in the middle region of murine p105 and the C-terminal residues 800-971. This p105 deletion mutant no longer generates p50 and responds to stimuli to undergo degradation. We showed that p105(sr) retains its ability to interact with all five NF-κB species and inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-induced NF-κB activities effectively. Unlike IκBα(sr), which does not interact with p50 and p52 and hence does not inhibit the homodimer activities, p105(sr) interacts with both proteins, and we have shown that it effectively inhibits p50 homodimer activity. In addition, p105(sr) can serve as a potent inhibitor for RelB, which is an important player in B cell development (14Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 693-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To apply p105(sr) in a specific biological context, we also tested p105(sr) in mouse skin papilloma MT1/2 cell line (31Spiegelman V.S. Budunova I.V. Carbajal S. Slaga T.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 20: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). p50 homodimer activity is significantly elevated in MT1/2 cells, and the cells are resistant to TNFα-mediated apoptosis. We demonstrated repression of p50 homodimer activity and TNFα-mediated killing of these tumorigenic cells by p105 (sr). Our results indicate that p105(sr) is an effective NF-κB super repressor and can be used as a broader range alternative to IκBα(sr). Construction of p105(sr)—PCR was used to generate two deletions within murine nfkb1 gene (32Ghosh S. Gifford A.M. Riviere L.R. Tempst P. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Two sets of primers were used to generate deletion in the middle region first: 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCAGACGATG, and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTCCTCTTTGTCTTTGATTTC to amplify the first half of nfkb1 and 5′-GACTAGTAAGGCTCTGCAGCTCGCC and 5′-GCTCTAGACTAAATTTTGCCTTCAATAGG to amplify the second half of the gene. The DNA fragments were cloned into the expression vector pEVRF (33Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schreiber E. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), with a blunted HindIII site from the first fragment directly ligated to the uncut 5′-end of the second fragment to preserve the correct reading frame. The above plasmid was then used as the template, and the primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCAGACGATG and 5′-GGAATTCGGATCCTGGTAGTATATCATCAG were used for PCR. The PCR fragment was subsequently cloned into a modified pEVRF that attaches a 12-residue epitope tag from the bacterial phage T7 gene 10 protein (34Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) at the N terminus of the expressed protein. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells with a stably transfected human CD14 surface marker (CHO-CD14) (35Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and several mouse skin cell lines were used in the studies. HeLa and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics and CHO-CD14 cells in RPMI1640 medium with the same supplements. The cells were seeded in either 24- or 6-well plates and transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Skin papilloma cell line MT1/2, carcinoma line CH72T4 (spindle cell carcinoma), and the control keratinocyte line C50 were cultured in minimum essential Eagle's medium with Earle's balanced salt solutions supplemented with 4% (for MT1/2) or 1% (for C50 and CH72T4) fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, antibiotics, and other growth supplements (36La E. Muga S.J. Locniskar M.F. Fischer S.M. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The skin cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of Protein Concentration—A Bio-Rad protein concentration kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Immunoblotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—Transfected CHO-CD14 cells were harvested 12-24 h post-transfection, and lysed with ELB buffer (300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). For direct immunoblottings, 2-3 μg of lysates were resolved with SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blotted with antibodies, and the reactive bands were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For co-immunoprecipitations followed with immunoblottings, expression vectors carrying gp10-tagged p105(sr) or IκBα(sr) and the testing NF-κB species were co-transfected into CHO-CD14 cells, and the lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-gp10 monoclonal antibodies (Novagen) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 3 h to overnight (rotating). The protein A beads were then washed several times with ELB buffer containing 1 m NaCl and suspended in SDS gel loading buffer. After boiling, the supernatants were resolved with SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and blotted with antibodies either to gp10 or to the NF-κB species (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Pulse-Chase Metabolic Labeling—Transfected HeLa cells were preincubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine for 1 h and pulse-labeled with 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min following immunoprecipitation as described previously (23Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assay—293 or HeLa cells (105 in 24-well plate) were co-transfected with either p105(sr) or IκBα(sr) with two luciferase reporter constructs: κB-luciferase (firefly) construct and thymidine kinase-Renilla luciferase construct (Promega). The latter reporter driven by a thymidine kinase promotor provides a low level, constitutive expression of Renilla luciferase in the cell and hence serves as the internal control. 36 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were treated with TNFα (20 μg/ml) for 30 min and lysed. The lysates were then assayed with luciferase substrates provided by the Promega kit. For each experiment, lysates from three independently transfected cells were assayed, and all of the data were normalized with the readout of Renilla luciferase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—100 ng of double-stranded κB probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was labeled with 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified with MicroSpin G-50 mini columns (Amersham Biosciences). 8 μg of TNFα-treated or 2.5 μg of p50-transfected HeLa cell nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μl of labeled κB probe, and the binding buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 12.5% glycerol, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) at room temperature for 30 min before loading to 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For antibody-mediated supershift, the reaction mixture was preincubated with 1 μl of either anti-p50 or anti-RelA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature for 20 min before loading of the samples. For cold κB nucleotide competition, 20 ng of the wild-type or mutant κB nucleotides were preincubated with the reaction mixture. Cell Fractionation—Transfected CHO-CD14 cells (2 × 107) were lysed with sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were saved as the cytosolic fraction. The pellets were washed once with sucrose buffer without Nonidet P-40 and suspended in low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). An equal volume of high salt buffer (same composition as the low salt buffer except with 800 mm KCl) was added slowly. The lysates were incubated for 30-45 min at 4 °C on a rotator and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were saved as nuclear fractions. Apoptosis Assays—MT1/2 and C50 cells were treated with TNFα (20 μg/ml) for 16 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then stained with 5 μg/ml of Hoechst dye (32324, Sigma) for 10 min and examined with fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was calculated by counting apoptotic cells in eight random areas (each area contains approximate 100 cells) of each treated sample as previously reported (37Tang G. Yang J. Minemoto Y. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Tang F. Tang G. Xiang J. Dai Q. Rosner M.R. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The data represent three sets of separated experiments. Similar analyses were applied to transfected MT1/2 cells. Design and Generation of p105(sr)—Although the C-terminal portion of p105, IκBγ, has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate p50 (20Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Fujita T. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3003-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 39Inoue J. Kerr L.D. Kakizuka A. Verma I.M.

Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), its affinity to other NF-κB species and even to p50 is not as high as the N-terminal RHD. We hence chose to design a super repressor based on p105, which contains both the RHD and the ankyrin repeats. For designing a p105-based NF-κB super repressor, two conditions must first be satisfied. First, expression of the modified p105 should no longer generate p50, a component of the NF-κB transcription complex. Second, the modified p105 should not be degraded immediately upon extracellular signals, because such a process will release bound NF-κB species. Based on studies of regulation of p50/p105 homeostasis (25Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we deleted residues 356-498 in the middle region that covers from the nuclear localization signal (NLS) to the putative degradation signal in the middle of p105 to disable p50 generation (Fig. 1A). To abolish signal-induced p105 degradation, we deleted residues 800-971 of p105 that include the degradation signal in the C terminus and the DD (28Salmeron A. Janzen J. Soneji Y. Bump N. Kamens J. Allen H. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22215-22222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To test whether expression of this p105 mutant still generates p50, we expressed the p105(sr) construct in three different cell lines: 293, HeLa, and CHO-CD14. As demonstrated by immunoblotting with antibodies to the epitope tag gp10 attached at the N terminus of p105(sr), expression of this mutant gene no longer generates p50 in any of the tested cells, whereas under the same condition, the wild-type p105 generates p50 normally (Fig. 1B). We next tested whether p105(sr) responds to TNFα-induced degradation. HeLa cells were transfected with either p105(sr) or a p105 mutant, p105(Δ356-498), that carries the same middle region deletion but maintains an intact C terminus. The cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased with normal growth medium supplemented with TNFα. As shown in Fig. 1C, p105(sr) is more stable than p105(Δ356-498) upon TNFα treatment. Together, these results suggested that the designed p105(sr) can potentially function as an effective NF-κB super repressor. In addition, the results in Fig. 1C also showed clearly that the degradation signal in the C-terminal portion of p105 is critical for degradation of p105, whereas the degradation signal in the middle of p105 protein regulates p50 production. p105(sr) Maintains the Ability to Interact with Rel/NF-κB Proteins—Because p105(sr) harbors two areas of deletion, it was not clear whether it still maintains the ability to interact with Rel/NF-κB proteins. To test this aspect, we co-transfected p105(sr) with five different NF-κB species, p50, p52, RelA, c-Rel, and RelB, to CHO-CD14 cells. The transfected cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-gp10 antibodies first (co-immunoprecipitation), and the immunoprecipitants were then resolved with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies either to the gp10 tag or to the corresponding NF-κB protein. p105 maintains the ability to interact with all five NF-κB proteins (Fig. 2, left lanes). As reported previously, IκBα interacts with RelA and c-Rel only (41Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Urban M.B. Baeuerle P.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1975-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and its interactions with p50, p52, and RelB are rather weak; IκB(sr), which carries the S32A,S36A mutation (a kind gift from Dr. Warner Greene's lab) with a similar gp10 epitope tag, co-immunoprecipitates RelA and c-Rel only and does not co-immunoprecipitate p50, p52, or RelB (Fig. 2, middle lanes). Thus, p105(sr) maintains its ability to interact with all NF-κB species and hence may have a broader inhibitory range that includes p50, p52, and RelB proteins. p105(sr) Effectively Represses TNFα-induced NF-κB Activity—To test whether p105(sr) represses TNFα-induced NF-κB activity, we co-transfected p105(sr) with luciferase reporter constructs into 293 cells. The cell lysates were prepared and assayed for firefly luciferase activity, and the readouts were normalized with that of Renilla luciferase activity, which serves as the internal control. TNFα potently induced NF-κB-dependent firefly luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with the reporters and empty expression vector (Fig. 3A, column 1). Such induction was significantly repressed by either p105(sr) or IκBα(sr) (Fig. 3A, columns 2 and 3). Repression of TNFα-induced NF-κB activity by p105(sr) is dependent upon the input of p105(sr) (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained from TNFα-treated, p105(sr)-transfected HeLa cells (data not shown). To assess the inhibitory function of p105(sr) further, we also transfected HeLa cells with p105(sr) and monitored TNFα-induced NF-κB activities by EMSAs. Consistent with luciferase assay, NF-κB activity is clearly inhibited in the nuclear extracts of p105(sr)-transfected cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 2-4). Because antibodies to either p50 or RelA supershifted the detected NF-κB complex in EMSA (Fig. 3C, lanes 9 and 10), and the same complex diminished with increased input of p105(sr) or IκBα(sr) (Fig. 3C, lanes 5-7), we conclude that p105(sr) can effectively repress the prototypic NF-κB (p50/RelA) activity. p105(sr) Is a Potent Repressor to p50 Homodimer Activity—Although IκBα(sr) is a potent repressor to RelA- and c-Rel-containing NF-κB complexes, it does not inhibit activities of p50 or p52 homodimers and RelB containing complex because of the weak interactions between IκBα and these proteins. We next tested whether p105(sr) represses p50 homodimer activity by EMSAs. p50 and p105(sr) were co-transfected into HeLa cells, and nuclear extracts from the transfected cells were prepared. Nuclear extracts from p50-transfected cells exhibited high p50 homodimer activity (Fig. 4, lane 1), and such activity was repressed by the increased input of p105(sr) (Fig. 4, lanes 2-4). In contrast, the increased input of IκBα(sr) did not affect p50 homodimer activity (Fig. 4, lanes 6-8). p105(sr) Inhibits NF-κB Activity by Forming p105(sr)/Rel Protein Heterodimeric Complex in the Cytoplasm—Wild-type p105 is located exclusively in the cytoplasm (21Naumann M. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the deletions change the subcellular localization of p105(sr). To assess the mechanism of p105(sr)-mediated inhibition upon NF-κB activity, we co-transfected gp10-tagged p50 and p105(sr) into CHO-CD14 cells and fractionated the cell lysates into nuclear and cytoplasmic portions. The two portions were resolved with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-gp10 antibodies. Without p105(sr), p50 is largely located in the nucleus (Fig. 5, lane 3). However, when co-transfected with extra amounts of p105(sr), majorities of p50 were found in the cytoplasmic portion (Fig. 5, lane 6). Similar results were obtained in transfected 293 and HeLa cells (data not shown). These results suggest that p105(sr) inhibits NF-κB activity by formation of the p105(sr)/Rel protein heterodimer in the cytoplasm. p105(sr) Inhibits p50 Homodimer Activity in Skin Papilloma Cells and Facilitates TNFα-mediated Killing—Multi-stage carcinogen treatment of mouse skin results in papillomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and spindle cell carcinomas (a metastatic form of squamous cell carcinoma) (43Slaga T.J.

https://openalex.org/W2000592199,"Transcription of the telokin gene is restricted to smooth muscle cells throughout development, making this gene an excellent model for unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression in smooth muscle tissues. To identify proteins that bind to the telokin promoter, the AT-rich/CArG core of the promoter was used as a probe to perform a Southwestern screen of a mouse bladder cDNA library. Four clones corresponding to two distinct isoforms of mouse thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEFα and TEFβ) were identified from this screen. The two TEF isoforms differ from each other at their amino termini and result from alternative promoter usage. An RNase protection assay showed that both TEF isoforms are expressed at high levels in mouse lung, bladder, kidney, gut, and brain. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that purified TEF protein can specifically bind to an AT-rich region within the core of the telokin promoter. Furthermore, when overexpressed in 10T1/2 cells, TEF significantly increased the activity of a telokin promoter-reporter gene; this activation was further augmented by elevated intracellular calcium levels. In contrast, overexpression of TEF had no effect on reporter genes driven by SM22α, smooth muscle α-actin, or smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoters. Consistent with these results, overexpression of TEFα and TEFβ in A10 cells, using adenoviral vectors, increased expression of endogenous telokin without altering expression of myosin light chain 20, SM22α, smooth muscle α-actin, or calponin. These findings suggest that TEF factors contribute to the activation of the telokin promoter in smooth muscle cells in a calcium-dependent manner. These data also suggest that distinct transcription factors are required to control the expression of different smooth muscle genes in a single tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1965050406,"Activation of the heteromeric G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK) GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits gives rise to IKACh, which controls excitability in atrial tissue. Although homomeric GIRK4 channels localize to the plasma membrane and display moderate function, GIRK1 channels fail to localize to the cell surface and do not exhibit significant function as homomers. Using oocytes to express GFP-tagged GIRK1 and GIRK4 and chimeras between these two proteins, we have identified two regions, one in the proximal C terminus and another in the distal N terminus that are critical for their subcellular localization. Replacement of both of these regions in GIRK1 with corresponding regions from GIRK4 was required for efficient expression of GIRK1 on the plasma membrane. Replacement of either region by itself was ineffective. The distal N terminus and proximal C terminus have been previously suggested to play important roles in ER-export and subunit co-assembly respectively in this family of channels. Our data indicate for the first time that both of these regions need to work in concert to mediate efficient targeting of these channels to the plasma membrane."
