https://openalex.org/W2040967876,"We have determined the DNA sequence of the wild type and mutated introns as well as their flanking exons in the yeast mitochondrial gene specifying cytochrome b. The second intron (box3) encodes a trans-acting protein ""mRNA maturase"" responsible for splicing and maturation of cytochrome b mRNA. This protein is interlaced with cytochrome b exon sequences. Its biosynthesis is subject to a negative feedback which may constitute a regulatory mechanism for the expression of split genes."
https://openalex.org/W1647238192,"O6-Methylguanine residues disappear from alkylated DNA by an inducible repair process in Escherichia coli. The reaction can be studied in a cell-free system, using DNA treated with a radioactive methylating agent as substrate. The disappearance of labeled O6-methylguanine from DNA is not accompanied by release of radioactive material in an acid-soluble form. Instead, the methyl group of O6-methylguanine appears to be transferred enzymatically to a protein cysteine residue. Radioactively labeled S-methylcysteine has been identified in protein hydrolysates after incubation of the alkylated DNA with a partly purified E. coli methyltransferase activity. The radioactive amino acid residue shows properties identical with those of S-methylcysteine by automatic amino acid analysis and paper chromatography in several solvent systems. Moreover, oxidation of the compound with hydrogen peroxide yields a product which co-chromatographs with S-methylcysteine sulfone."

The analog is more active as a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist that the parent hormone, and provides evidence for a bioactive conformation containing a beta-turn."
https://openalex.org/W2006724602,"We describe the first example of a predominantly nuclear protein which during mitosis becomes part of the mitotic apparatus. This protein has been termed the nuclear-mitotic apparatus (NuMA) protein. In interphase cells NuMA protein is restricted to the nucleus and is a constituent of isolated nuclear matrices, but in mitotic cells it is observed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to be concentrated at the polar regions of the mitotic apparatus. This mitotic localization is dependent on the integrity of the spindle, since treatments which disrupt the spindle result in dispersion of NuMA protein throughout the cell. Comparison to the subcellar distribution of tubulin at different stages of the cell cycle indicates that NuMA protein is distinct from the previously identified components of the mitotic spindle. Its association with the nuclear matrix and its localization during mitosis to the site of nuclear reassembly suggest the interesting possibility that NuMA protein could be representative of a class of proteins involved in the early events of nuclear reassembly. NuMA is present in the nuclei and mitotic spindle of all types of human cells that have been examined, but proteins of similar molecular weight (300,000 daltons in dissociating solvents) or immunological specificity are not detected in cells of other species (including monkey). However, the NuMA protein is synthesized in a human/Chinese hamster hybrid cell containing a reduced number of human chromosomes. Immunofluorescence studies of this hybrid cell showed that the distribution of NuMA protein is equivalent to that in human cells. These results suggest that the human gene coding for NuMA protein, unlike other genes coding for human specific nuclear proteins, can be expressed in human/hamster hybrid cells and that the cell hybrid will be useful in further characterization of NuMA protein."

https://openalex.org/W1504839319,"We have isolated the novel amino acid, amino acid X, in elongation factor 2 (EF-2) which is ADP-ribosylated by diphtheria toxin (Robinson, E. A., Hendriksen, O., and Maxwell, E. S. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5088-5093). The pure ribosyl-amino acid was obtained in milligram quantities following sequential enzymatic degradation of yeast ADP-ribosyl-EF-2 (Van Ness, B. G., Howard, J. B., and Bodley, J. W. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 8687-8690) with an overall yield of 30 to 60%. In the course of acid hydrolysis, the ribosyl-amino acid was converted first to an intermediate compound which did not contain ribose. Further acid hydrolysis converted the intermediate to amino acid X and ammonia. Alkaline hydrolysis of the ribosyl-amino acid produced a different intermediate which contained ribose. We have isolated the two hydrolysis intermediates and on the basis of the properties of all four compounds we conclude that the ribosyl-amino acid contains an amido function which is not involved in a glycosidic linkage and a net positive charge of 2 at acid pH. We believe that the amino acid amide occurs in EF-2 and for this compound we propose the trivial name diphthamide. Acid hydrolysis of diphthamide yields amino acid X for which we propose the trivial name diphthine."

https://openalex.org/W2079966173,"In addition to catalyzing the pairing of linear single-stranded DNA with homologous duplex DNA, recA protein promotes the pairing of circular single strands with linear duplex DNA or nicked circular duplex DNA, and of gapped circular duplex DNA with superhelical DNA. RecA protein will thus produce joint molecules of DNA at a high frequency from a pair of homologous molecules if one of them is single-stranded or partially single-stranded, and if either one has a free end. The structure made from a linear single strand and duplex DNA is a D loop. The joint molecule made from circular single-stranded DNA and linear duplex DNA is a branched structure in which the circular strand has displaced a strand from one end of the duplex molecule. In these structures, the heteroduplex regions reach sizes approaching that of full-length fd DNA. When we used restriction fragments of duplex fd DNA that were approximately half-length, we found circular molecules that were half duplex and half single-stranded. Similarly, single-stranded circles displaced a strand from nicked circular duplex DNA, yielding structures related to those made with linear duplex DNA, as well as other structures. Our observations indicate that purified recA protein catalyzes a concerted strand transfer with several features of particular biological interest, including the initiation of a strand crossover (in some cases perhaps the crossing back of a strand as well) and the production of long heteroduplex joints by a kind of branch migration. While a free end permits interwinding of DNA strands and the formation of joints containing stable right-handed helices, the free end is not essential for the promotion of homologous pairing by recA protein. When we mixed phage G4 double-stranded DNA and recA protein with single-stranded circular M13 DNA containing an insert of 274 bases of G4 DNA, we observed by electron microscopy the formation of a few percent of complexes in which single-stranded circular DNA and duplex DNA were joined side by side in the region of shared sequence homology. The frequency of such complexes was twenty to thirty times greater than that observed in a control mixture of G4 duplex DNA and single-stranded circular fd DNA, molecules which do not share a region of extensive homology. We conclude that recA protein can promote homologous association of a single strand and duplex DNA without the plectonemic colling that characterizes the normal Watson-Crick structure of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1997329979,"Twenty-nine different SUP4-o tRNATyr genes with second-site mutations were transcribed in X. laevis cell-free RNA polymerase III transcription reactions, and the in vitro transcripts were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nineteen mutant genes yield normal amounts of RNA that co-electrophorese with SUP4-o gene transcripts. RNA synthesized from a mutant gene lacking a single base pair migrated slightly faster in gels, as expected. The still shorter transcripts made from seven other mutant genes suggest that several mutations alter transcription starting or stopping points. Fingerprint analyses of transcripts from the two most extreme cases showed that premature termination occurred at new tracts of T residues resulting from the mutations. Two mutations significantly enhance transcription, and two mutations which alter the invariant C within the TÏˆCG sequence dramatically reduce SUP4-o gene transcription. The regions of the SUP4-o gene that surround these mutations are partially homologous to intragenic sequences in many other eucaryotic tRNA and 5S RNA genes. We hypothesize that these homologous sequences are recognized as promoter regions during RNA polymerase III transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1486100889,"Labeled and unlabeled prostacyclin and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were infused into healthy volunteers; urine was chromatographed on different systems including high pressure liquid chromatography. The peaks obtained by the latter method were derivatized to the methoxime methyl ester trimethyl silyl ether and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. After infusion of prostacyclin the following metabolites could be identified: dinor-4-keto-7,9,13-trihydroxy-prosta-11,12-enoic acid (20.5%), dinor-4,13-diketo-7,9-dihydroxy-prostanoic acid (6.8%), dinor-4,13-diketo-7,9-dihydroxy-prostan-1,18-dioic acid (19.7%), and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (14.2%), the in vitro hydrolysis product of prostacylin. 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha infusion resulted in the same metabolites with the relative amounts of 22.4, 5.4, 7.0, and 6.8%, respectively. Additionally, 6,15-diketo,13,14-dihydro-PGF1 alpha (5.7%) could be identified. These data show that the metabolic pathway of prostacyclin involves hydrolysis to 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, subsequent beta-oxidation, dehydrogenation at C-15, reduction of the double bond between C-13 and C14, and omega-oxidation to the dicarboxyl metabolite. We conclude that dinor-4-keto-7,9,13-trihydroxy-prosta-11,12-enoic acid and dinor-4,13-diketo-7,9-dihydroxy-prostan-1,18-dioic acid represent the major urinary metabolites of prostacyclin in man. 6-keto-PGF1 alpha is a minor urinary excretory product following the administration of prostacyclin or 6-keto-PGF1 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1605058617,"Detergent-solubilized pig intestinal sucrase . isomaltase (EC 3.2.1.48-EC 3.2.1.10) was purified 40 to 100 times with a yield of 10 to 20% by a rapid immunoadsorbent technique. The purified enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by immunoelectrophoresis and was essentially free of other known brush border peptidases and disaccharidases. Intestinal sucrase . isomaltase isolated from pigs with intact pancreatic ducts consisted of two polypeptide chains with apparent molecular weights of 140,000 and 150,000, respectively. In contrast, the enzyme isolated from pigs in which the pancreas was completely disconnected from the duodenum 3 days before killing migrated in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate as a single polypeptide chain with an apparent molecular weight of 260,000. Treatment with pancreatic proteases in vitro converted the large polypeptide chain into bands with molecular weights equal to or somewhat larger than those of sucrase . isomaltase purified from normal pigs. No increase of enzymatic activity could be detected during this transformation. It is suggested that the single-chain sucrase . isomaltase represents a precursor, which is converted to the final sucrase . isomaltase in vivo by pancreatic proteolytic enzymes. This is one of the few examples in vertebrates of a single polypeptide chain carrying two enzymatically active sites. The significance of the result for the mechanism of the biosynthesis of sucrase . isomaltase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1595955822,"Stable carbon isotope ratios (13C/12C) at natural abundance levels have been determined for individual carbon atoms in each of the major phospholipid fatty acids of Escherichia coli grown on glucose as the sole carbon source. Two models were constructed for the isotope effects and carbon flow pathways which must be responsible for the observed isotopic fractionations. Both models incorporate a branch in the carbon flow at which fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) is utilized either for complex lipid synthesis or for elongation by fatty acid synthetase. Depletion of carbon 13 in the carboxyl groups of myristic and palmitoleic acids (relative to carbonyl groups in precursor acyl-ACP's) was observed to occur at this branching site. Only one of the models was consistent both with this observation and with the observation (Silbert, D. F., Ruch, F., and Vagelos, P. R. (1968) J. Bacteriol. 95, 1658-1665) that exogenous fatty acids are incorporated into phospholipids but are not elongated. The successful model has free fatty acid as the intermediate product coupling fatty acid biosynthesis to phospholipid synthesis. Essential to this pathway are those reactions catalyzed by thioesterases I and II as well as acyl-ACP synthetase, enzymes whose roles have previously been unknown in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1548292434,"Escherichia coli alanine tRNA synthetase has been purified from a strain which carries the gene on a recombinant pBR322 plasmid. Several per cent of the soluble protein can be obtained as alanine tRNA synthetase in the plasmid containing host cell. The enzyme was proven to be an alpha 4 tetramer with a Mr = 380,000 by the following criteria: i) a single band of Mr = 95,000 was found in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis; ii) gel filtration chromatography gives a single peak at a Mr = 360,000 for the native enzyme; iii) dimethyl suberimidate cross-linking indicates a tetrameric structure; iv) a single undecapeptide N-terminal sequence was found which is Ser-Lys-Ser-Thr-Ala-Glu-Ile-Arg-Gln-Ala-Phe. Limited proteolysis generates a fragment of the native enzyme. The fragment has a Mr = 48,000 (one half that of the native subunit) and, in contrast to the native enzyme, oligomerization of the fragment could be not detected either by gel filtration chromatography or by dimethyl suberimidate cross-linking. The fragment is derived from the NH2-terminal half of the native subunit as shown by their common decapeptide NH2-terminal amino acid sequences. The ATP-PPi exchange activity of 1 mol of fragment is identical with that of 1 mol of native subunit, but aminoacylation activity is absent from the fragment. Therefore, in the fragment, the aminoacyl adenylate formation activity is cleanly separated from tRNA aminoacylation and subunit association properties. These results also mean that, with respect to aminoacyl adenylate formation activity, each subunit in the native tetramer acts independently."
https://openalex.org/W2040963386,"Down regulation of the insulin receptor of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes occurs in the presence of insulin and several agents with insulin-like activity, which act through or distal to the insulin receptor. These findings indicate that the interaction of insulin with its specific binding site is not in itself sufficient to down-regulate this receptor and that one or more steps subsequent to this interaction are necessary. Thus, down regulation may be a complex biological response to insulin, and if a cell were resistant to this effect of insulin, our data may explain how target cells from a patient or animal can have a normal number of receptors in the presence of increased concentrations of circulating insulin."

L. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 414-423), were each purified to protein homogeneity. Purification involved selective solubilization of PBPs 1a, 5, and 6 from membranes by Triton X-100 at low ionic strength, covalent penicillin affinity chromatography, and CM-cellulose column chromatography. Purified PBP 5 and PBP 6 each catalyzed a D-alanine carboxypeptidase I activity using various natural and synthetic substrates including linear uncross-linked peptidoglycan. PBP 5 showed 3- to 4-fold higher specific activities toward these substrates than PBP 6. Both PBPs also catalyzed a model transpeptidase activity using glycine as a transpeptidation acceptor, and showed similar pH profiles and MgCl2 sensitivities for their D-alanine carboxypeptidase I activities. Both PBPs bound a stoichiometric amount of [14C]penicillin G at saturation. Peptide mapping by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after partial proteolysis by proteases and cyanogen bromide demonstrated that these PBPs are distinct polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1566806099,"Proteinase A (EC 3.4.23.6) was purified from commercial bakers' yeast in five steps, including hydrophobic chromatography and affinity chromatography. After the last step the enzyme appeared homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in the analytical ultracentrifuge. A molecular weight of 41,500 was determined for proteinase A. The amino acid composition includes 43% polar residues and 12% aromatic amino acids. Proteinase A is a glycoprotein containing 7.5% mannose and 1% of glucosamine and galactosamine. The temperature and the pH stability of the enzyme have been determined. At pH 6, the proteinase exhibits a remarkable stability even in 6 M urea. Proteinase A splits hemoglobin with an optimum at pH 3.0 and casein and azocasein with an optimum at pH 6.0.

The ring closure thus occurs in a retention mode at C-6 of the substrate, a finding at variance with an earlier report, but in agreement with the stereochemistry recently determined for the reaction in Streptomyces flavopersicus and with the general stereochemical mode of operation of aldolases."

The solubilized oligosaccharide transferase requires Mn2+ for activity; neither Mg2+ nor Ca2+ is an effective substitute. The pH optimum of the transfer reaction is between 6.5 and 7.5. Unlike animal systems, which utilize glucosylated oligosaccharide-lipid to a much greater extent than the unglucosylated species as a donor in the transferase rection, yeast extracts transfer more than 70% of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 from their respective oligosaccharide-lipids to proteins. However, the rate of N-glycosylation in vitro is approximately 25-fold faster with Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol than with Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. The apparent Km value for the glucosylated species is 75 nM, while that for the unglucosylated glycolipid is 55 nM."
https://openalex.org/W1983417243,The survival of Lewis rats with D-galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure was prolonged if they were given intraperitoneal injections of single-cell suspensions of liver or bone marrow cells from normal rats.

https://openalex.org/W1979787131,"Fat cells or fat cell membranes were briefly subjected to mild proteolysis under conditions where insulin receptors were either free or bound to (125)I-labeled insulin. When receptors were then affinity-labeled to visualize the effects of this treatment, it was observed that receptors that had been occupied by ligand during proteolysis exhibited greater rates of degradation than unoccupied receptors. These results demonstrate that insulin-receptor interaction induces a change in receptor structure that may be related to signal transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2049417990,"The concept that low concentrations of atmospheric oxygen and consequent unattenuated ultraviolet irradiation limited the emergence of Phanerozoic life, the Berkner-Marshall hypothesis, is no longer tenable. Anaerobic bacteria, which probably evolved far earlier than Metazoa, were irradiated in a special chamber under strictly anaerobic conditions. Both intrinsic resistance and photoreactivation by visible light were discovered in obligately and facultatively anaerobic microbes. Atmospheric scientists have shown that small amounts of oxygen would have limited pre-Phanerozoic surface ultraviolet irradiation to fluxes well below those used in the anaerobic experiments described. Since adequate ultraviolet protection mechanisms evolved early, the late Proterozoic appearance of Metazoa probably was not related to high fluxes of solar ultraviolet radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1503599975,"The C and D proteins from bacteriophage fd and fl have been purified and characterized. Since the DNA sequence is known, the amino acid composition of these purified proteins indicated that they are coded for by the phage, the C protein being the product of Gene IX and the D protein specified by Gene VI. The molecular weights of the C and D proteins were calculated from the DNA sequences to be 3,650 and 12,350, respectively. These values are close to the molecular weights observed after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Since the C and D proteins can be selectively labeled with radioactive cysteine and arginine, it was possible to estimate the number of the C and D protein molecules relative to the number of A protein molecules which had been accurately determined in previous studies. Based on these results, the average phage particle contains 5 A, 5 D, and 10 C protein molecules."

It is shown that the observed dependence of the isotope effect on oxygen concentration provides unequivocal evidence for a kinetically significant dissociation of both dopamine and oxygen from enzyme . ternary complex. This approach, which is applicable to any multisubstrate enzyme characterized by detectable kinetic isotope effects, provides an alternate to classical methods for the elucidation of kinetic order in enzyme-catalyzed reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2088139733,Comparison was made of the distribution of the insulin receptor sites on adipocyte and liver plasma membranes by using ferritin-insulin. Two-thirds of the occupied insulin receptors on adipocytes occurred in groups of two or more whereas up to two-thirds of the receptors on liver occurred as single receptors. Ferritin-insulin did not cause aggregation of the receptor sites in either tissue. The naturally occurring groups of receptors on adipocyte membranes may play a role in the greater sensitivity of adipocytes to insulin.
https://openalex.org/W2026167990,"We have utilized a cracking procedure followed by a rotary shadow technique to examine the ultrastructure of cultured ovarian granulosa cells. We have demonstrated that the structures observed are not artifacts of fixation or cracking by generating equivalent images following freezing and deep etching as well as by fixation prior to cracking. The cytoplasm of granulosa cells exhibits a complex cytoskeletal lattice composed of many 40-55 nm filaments. This filamentous network is continuous with the plasma membrane and appears to incorporate all formed elements within the cytoplasm. Filaments are organized in three ways: first, in large bundles, second, in individual filaments that are in direct association with organelles, and third, in a complex branching and anastomosing configuration. S-1 decoration revealed that the predominant filament species is action."
https://openalex.org/W1526476098,"We have analyzed subunit interactions of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase by measuring the rate of cleavage of each subunit by trypsin. We have modified a standard sodium dodecyl sulfate gel technique to include sodium tetradecyl sulfate, which results in a large separation of the beta and beta' subunits. A comparison of enzyme lacking the sigma subunit (core) with holoenzyme reveals that the presence of sigma does not alter the cleavage rates of alpha or beta, but it dramatically slows the initial cleavage of beta. Simple addition of purified sigma to core results in reconstitution of holoenzyme as measured both by glycerol gradient sedimentation and protection of beta from trypsin cleavage. However, Mg2+ is required for the beta protection but not for the binding of sigma to core. Although the enzyme reconstituted in the absence of Mg2+ and lacking the sigma-beta association is similar to holoenzyme with respect to promoter binding, it catalyzes the transition from closed to open complexes much more slowly than does enzyme reconstituted in the presence of Mg2+. Thus, the specific association between beta and sigma may be involved in the DNA melting phase of the RNA polymerase-DNA interaction. We have also examined the effects of the polyanion heparin, an RNA polymerase initiation inhibitor, on the rates of trypsin cleavage of holoenzyme subunits. Again, subunits alpha and beta' were unaffected, but heparin increased the cleavage rate of beta such that the rate was indistinguishable from the beta cleavage rate of core enzyme. Since heparin did not cause the release of sigma as measured by glycerol gradient analysis, the inhibitor may simply disrupt the sigma-beta association."
https://openalex.org/W108965118,"Extracts of Escherichia coli K12 degrade AMP to hypoxanthine, adenine, adenosine, and inosine. Degradation experiments with mutants which lack purine nucleoside phosphorylase or both purine nucleoside phosphorylase and adenosine deaminase demonstrate that hypoxanthine formation is dependent on purine nucleoside phosphorylase. These findings are consistent with an absence of adenine deaminase activity in E. coli. Adenine is formed from AMP in extracts of the E. coli mutants as well as the wild type cells. This activity is due to AMP nucleosidase. Purified, homogeneous AMP nucleosidase gives a subunit Mr = 52,000 on denaturing gel electrophoresis and an oligomer molecular weight of approximately 280,000 by comparative gel filtration. Kinetic studies with this enzyme give cooperative initial rate curves with AMP as substrate, with MgATP2- as an activator, and with Pi as an inhibitor. Phosphate inhibition is competitive with McATP2- (Ki = 0.2 mM) and reverses the activation by MgATP2-. In the absence of MgATP2-, the apparent S0.5 for AMP is 15 mM and decreases to 90 microM at saturating MgATP2-. The maximum rate of AMP hydrolysis is not affected by MgATP2-. Kinetics of MgATP2- activation give a constant for half-maximum activation varying from 120 microM in the presence of low AMP to approximately 2 microM when AMP is present at near saturation. Formycin 5'-PO4 is a powerful competitive inhibitor with respect to AMP, giving a Kis of 72 nM and a Km/Kis ratio of 1,200. Adenylate degradation experiments indicate that AMP nucleosidase is the major enzyme of AMP catabolism in E. coli. The kinetic properties of the purified enzyme indicate that regulation occurs by the intracellular MgATP2- /Pi ratio and the concentration of AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1592351862,The initial rates of functional complex formation between Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and a family of mutant lac promoters have been determined as a function of the independently varied concentration of both components. The initial rates are first order in polymerase and zero order in promoter concentration even under conditions of polymerase excess. These data suggest that the promoter site competes with nonspecific sites for formation of an unstable complex with RNA polymerase. Whether or not a final complex is formed depends on the probability of occurrence of a conformational conversion during the lifetime of this intermediate. An important role of DNA sequence in modulating promoter binding rates is suggested: sequence changes which provide additional contacts to polymerase stabilize the intermediate and thus accelerate the rate of functional complex formation.

https://openalex.org/W1533449639,"Abstract The DNA-dependent conversion of incorrect deoxynucleoside triphosphate precursors to monophosphates (turnover) by bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase was determined using either poly(dA) x (dT) or poly(dG) x (dC) homopolymer templates. Competition between correct and incorrect triphosphates for incorporation into DNA, and the use of chain-terminating dideoxynucleoside triphosphates enabled us to determine the amount of turnover occurring at the end of each strand of the homopolymer duplex (e.g. amount of turnover of dATP occurring at the 3'-OH of poly(dG) and the 3'-OH of poly(dC)). These determinations suggest that nearest neighbor interactions between incoming dNTPs and the growing strand terminal residue play a major role in the occurrence of substitution errors during DNA synthesis in vitro byDNA polymerase. When considered together with existing evidence from studies of turnover (Gillin, F. D., and Nossal, N. G. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5225-5232) and direct incorporation (Hall, Z. W., and Lehman, I. R. (1968) J. Mol. Biol. 36, 321-333) these results demonstrate that pyrimidine-pyrimidine and purine-purine as well as purine-pyrimidine oppositions have a role in error production at least during DNA replication in vitro. The implications of these results for the role of the accessory replication proteins in maintaining accuracy during the DNA biosynthetic process are discussed."

The formation of peptide shows a lag phase and has a rate constant of 0.4 S-1 under these conditions. The results of a series of experiments between 5 degrees C and 25 degrees C show that GTP hydrolysis and peptide formation have Arrhenius activation energies of 13.1 and 15.3 kcal mol-1, respectively.

Covalent attachment reached its maximum level of 8.5 to 11% of the noncovalently bound IF-3 after 60 min of irradation. Cross-linking was unaffected by the presence of the photosensitizer, acetone (5 or 10%), but was reduced to 30 to 40% of its maximum level by addition of 5 mM dithiothreitol, a free radical scavenger. Analysis of the 14C-labeled IF-3 x 30 S subunit covalent complex revealed that the IF-3 was distributed between the protein and RNA of the subunits in a 3:1 ratio. The target proteins have been identified as S7, S11, S12, S18, and S21 by immunochemical techniques."

Gel filtration of islet extracts demonstrated two major radiolabeled peptides which were immunoprecipitable with antisera against pancreatic polypeptide. One had a molecular weight similar to that of pancreatic polypeptide (4300), whereas the other had an apparent molecular weight of about 9000. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the larger labeled peptide co-migrated with a large immunoreactive form of pancreatic polypeptide which reacts in immunoassays directed towards the NH2-terminal region of pancreatic polypeptide, but not in an assay depending on the COOH-terminal tyrosine amide. Sequential Edman degradation of both immunoprecipitable labeled peptides identified [3H]leucine at position 3 and [35S]methionine at position 17, positions which align with the leucine and methionine residues in the NH2-terminal sequence of pancreatic polypeptide. In pulse-chase labeling experiments, the larger peptide appeared early and disappeared rapidly, whereas pancreatic polypeptide and an additional smaller peptide appeared later and reached a plateau as th precursor was processed. That both pancreatic polypeptide and the smaller peptide arise from the same precursor was further supported by electrophoretic mapping of the tryptic fragments from the three peptides. We conclude that pancreatic polypeptide and a peptide with a molecular weight of 2500 to 3000 are co-synthesized from a larger precursor and that the pancreatic polypeptide sequence is located at the far NH2-terminal end of the precursor form."

https://openalex.org/W1550627971,"Hybrid tetramers of lac repressor and its trypsin-resistant core protein were produced by mild proteolytic digestion and isolated by chromatography on phosphocellulose. These tetramers were used in binding studies to probe the relationship of the NH2 terminus and core domains in operator DNA binding and to explore subunit participation in both operator and nonspecific DNA binding. The purity of each tetramer was demonstrated by several lines of evidence, including physical characterization and measurement of the binding activities of the hybrid tetramer preparations. Each tetramer displayed measurable operator binding activity, and the dissociation constants of the tetramers for lambdaplac DNA and a 29 base operator fragment increase with the loss of each NH2 terminus. These studies strongly suggest that each NH2 terminus of the repressor interacts with the operator DNA, although the four NH2 termini do not appear to make equal contacts. The contributions of the NH2 terminus to operator binding do no appear to be identical with those for nonspecific DNA binding. In addition, the binding of the NH2 termini to nonspecific DNA can be described by postulating four identical, noninteracting sites. Although the rate of dissociation of the repressor-operator is increased by a factor of 2 upon removal of each NH2 terminus, calculations using the measured dissociation rate and equilibrium dissociation constant indicate that the rate of association of repressor to operator is decreased approximately 5-fold. These data suggest that the contacts made by the NH2 termini may greatly facilitate association with DNA. Competition studies of nonspecific DNA with operator DNA binding confirm the existence of two operator DNA binding sites on each tetramer and suggest that the contacts of a single NH2 terminus are not identical for the two operator binding sites."
