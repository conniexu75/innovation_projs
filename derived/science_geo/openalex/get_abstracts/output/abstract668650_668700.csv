This stage in the virus life history is currently a target for drug inhibition. De Vries et al. designed highly stable lipoprotein fusion inhibitors complementary to a conserved repeat in the C terminus of S that integrate into host cell membranes and inhibit conformational changes in S necessary for membrane fusion. The authors tested the performance of the lipoproteins as a preexposure prophylactic in a ferret-to-ferret transmission study. Intranasal administration of the peptide 2 days before cohousing with an infected ferret for 24 hours completely protected animals in contact from infection and showed efficacy against mutant viruses. Because ferrets do not get sick from SARS-CoV-2, disease prevention could not be tested in this model. Science , this issue p. 1379"
https://openalex.org/W3131334373,"The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals globally has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance, and determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding, and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq could be a potential high sensitivity assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, with an additional advantage of enabling the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2."

Attachment and entry of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 is mainly mediated by the spike glycoprotein. Here, we show that iota-carrageenan can inhibit the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus in a dose dependent manner. SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus particles were efficiently neutralized with an IC 50 value of 2.6 μg/ml iota-carrageenan. Experiments with patient isolated wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus showed an inhibition of replication in a similar range. In vitro data on iota-carrageenan against various Rhino- and endemic Coronaviruses showed similar IC 50 values and translated readily into clinical effectiveness when a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan demonstrated a reduction of severity and duration of symptoms of common cold caused by various respiratory viruses. Accordingly, our in vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus and replication competent SARS-CoV-2 suggest that administration of iota-carrageenan may be an effective and safe prophylaxis or treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections."

However, little is known about the effects of P deficiency on nutrient absorption, photosynthetic apparatus performance and antioxidant metabolism in citrus. Seedlings of ‘sour pummelo’ ( Citrus grandis ) were irrigated with a nutrient solution containing 0.2 mM (Control) or 0 mM (P deficiency) KH 2 PO 4 until saturated every other day for 16 weeks. P deficiency significantly decreased the dry weight (DW) of leaves and stems, and increased the root/shoot ratio in C . grandis but did not affect the DW of roots. The decreased DW of leaves and stems might be induced by the decreased chlorophyll (Chl) contents and CO 2 assimilation in P deficient seedlings. P deficiency heterogeneously affected the nutrient contents of leaves, stems and roots. The analysis of Chl a fluorescence transients showed that P deficiency impaired electron transport from the donor side of photosystem II (PSII) to the end acceptor side of PSI, which showed a greater impact on the performance of the donor side of PSII than that of the acceptor side of PSII and photosystem I (PSI). P deficiency increased the contents of ascorbate (ASC), H 2 O 2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and glutathione reductase (GR) in leaves. In contrast, P deficiency increased the ASC content, reduced the glutathione (GSH) content and the activities of SOD, CAT, APX and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), but did not increase H 2 O 2 production, anthocyanins and MDA content in roots. Taking these results together, we conclude that P deficiency affects nutrient absorption and lowers photosynthetic performance, leading to ROS production, which might be a crucial cause of the inhibited growth of C . grandis ."
https://openalex.org/W3130342286,"Introduction The global abrupt progression of the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt critical life-saving services such as routine immunization (RI), thus increasing the susceptibility of countries to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Being endemic to several infectious diseases, Lebanon might be at increased risk of outbreaks as the utilization of RI services might have deteriorated due to the pandemic and the country’s political unrest following the October 2019 uprising. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the utilization of RI services in both the public and private sectors following the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A self-administered cross-sectional survey was completed electronically, in April 2020, by 345 private pediatricians who are registered in professional associations of physicians in Lebanon and provide immunization services at their clinics. Means of the reported percentages of decrease in the utilization of vaccination services by pediatricians were calculated. As for the public sector, an examination of the monthly differences in the number of administered vaccine doses in addition to their respective percentages of change was performed. Adjustment for the distribution of RI services between the sectors was performed to calculate the national decrease rate. Results The utilization of vaccination services at the national level decreased by 31%. In the private sector, immunization services provision diminished by 46.9% mainly between February and April 2020. The highest decrease rates were observed for oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and hepatitis A, followed by measles and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The number of vaccine doses administered in the public sector decreased by 20%. The most prominent reductions were detected for the OPV and measles vaccines, and during October 2019 and March 2020. Conclusion The substantial decrease in the utilization of RI as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic requires public health interventions to prevent future outbreaks of VPDs."

Few data are reported on the gut microbiota in COVID-19 patients. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to reveal an altered composition of the gut microbiota in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) (i-COVID19), or in infectious disease wards (w-COVID19) as compared to controls (CTRL). i-COVID19 patients showed a decrease of Chao1 index as compared to CTRL and w-COVID19 patients indicating that patients in ICU displayed a lower microbial richness while no change was observed as for Shannon Index. At the phylum level, an increase of Proteobacteria was detected in w-COVID19 patients as compared to CTRL. A decrease of Fusobacteria and Spirochetes has been found, with the latter decreased in i-COVID19 patients as compared to CTRL. Significant changes in gut microbial communities in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with different disease severity compared to CTRL have been identified. Our preliminary data may provide valuable information and promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of the disease and, when validated in larger cohort, it could facilitate the stratification of patients based on the microbial signature."

This study aims to assess the effect of unintended delays in anti-VEGF treatment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective case series identified patients receiving regularly scheduled anti-VEGF intravitreal injections based on current procedural terminology (CPT) code at two practices in Minnesota. Diagnoses were limited to nAMD, diabetic macular edema (DME), proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and RVO. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether they maintained or delayed their follow-up visit by more than two weeks beyond the recommended treatment interval during the COVID-19 lockdown. The ‘COVID-19 lockdown’ was defined as the period after March, 28 th , 2020, when a lockdown was declared in Minnesota. We then compared the visual acuity and structural changes to the retina using ocular coherence tomography (OCT) to assess whether delayed treatment resulted in worse visual outcomes. A total of 167 eyes from 117 patients met criteria for inclusion in this study. In the delayed group, the average BCVA at the pre- and post-lockdown visits were 0.614 and 0.715 (logMAR) respectively (p = 0.007). Central subfield thickness (CST) increased from 341 to 447 in the DME delayed group (p = 0.03) while the CST increased from 301 to 314 (p = 0.4) in the nAMD delayed group. The results of this pilot study suggests that treatment delays may have a negative impact on the visual and anatomic outcomes of patients with nAMD and DME. Future studies with larger sample sizes are required for further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3133254279,"Genetic diversity and population structure assessment in crops is essential for marker trait association, marker assisted breeding and crop germplasm conservation. We analyzed a set of 285 durum wheat accessions comprising 215 Ethiopian durum wheat landraces, 10 released durum wheat varieties, 10 advanced durum wheat lines from Ethiopia, and 50 durum wheat lines from CIMMYT. We investigated the genetic diversity and population structure for the complete panel as well as for the 215 landraces, separately based on 11,919 SNP markers with known physical positions. The whole panel was clustered into two populations representing on the one hand mainly the landraces, and on the other hand mainly released, advanced and CIMMYT lines. Further population structure analysis of the landraces uncovered 4 subgroups emphasizing the high degree of genetic diversity within Ethiopian durum landraces. Population structure based AMOVA for both sets unveiled significant (P &lt; 0.001) variation between populations and within populations. Total variation within population accessions (81%, 76%) was higher than total variation between populations (19%, 24%) for both sets. Population structure analysis based genetic differentiation (FST) and gene flow (Nm) for the whole set and the Ethiopian landraces were 0.19 and 0.24, 1.04, and 0.81, respectively indicating high genetic differentiation and limited gene flow. Diversity indices verify that the landrace panel was more diverse with (I = 0.7, He = 0.46, uHe = 0.46) than the advanced lines (I = 0.6, He = 0.42, uHe = 0.42). Similarly, differences within the landrace clusters were observed. In summary a high genetic diversity within Ethiopian durum wheat landraces was detected, which may be a target for national and international wheat improvement programs to exploit valuable traits for biotic and abiotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W3131284532,"Objectives We examined key gender, interpersonal and community dynamics influencing PrEP acceptability among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and their male partners. Methods We administered 12 in-depth interviews (IDI) to partnered, or married AGYW aged 15–24 years living without HIV, and 16 IDIs to male partners living without HIV aged 18 or older, partnered or married to an AGYW in Tanzania. Card sorting, a participatory qualitative method for facilitating systematic discussion, was used to identify attitudes, values, and desires that would influence PrEP acceptability. Results Relationship distrust, partner communication about HIV risk, and need to control HIV risk were highly influential considerations for PrEP use. AGYW and male partners both wanted to discuss PrEP use amidst relationship distrust, while most male partners encouraged AGYW PrEP use for shared protective benefit. Anticipated stigma of being perceived as a person living with HIV, as a result of PrEP use, was a deterrent for both AGYW and male partners while AGYW also feared additional stigma of being considered sexually promiscuous. Conclusions Couples counseling for PrEP uptake and adherence might be a well-placed strategy for couples who are living without HIV to educate one another about the relationship benefits of using PrEP, thereby increasing its acceptance and adherence, addressing unequal power dynamics, and reducing associated relationship distrust. Community awareness and education about PrEP can help curb persistent PrEP stigma, including intersectional stigma."
https://openalex.org/W3131413392,"The legislative process before the adoption of the revised European Union renewable energy directive mobilised various actors around the forest biomass issue in Europe. Which storylines do actors use to discuss and define the sustainability of forest biomass, how are the differences between the existing storylines explained, and can distinct ‘discourse coalitions’ of actors be observed as following each storyline? These questions are addressed through a discourse analysis to critically evaluate the debate around the utilisation of forest biomass for European renewable energy to identify persistent storylines adopted by discourse coalitions as they communicate their understanding of the issue, and compete to influence the policymaking and public perception. The hypotheses are that there are more than the hypothetical binary arrangement of pro versus anti storylines, and that some actors follow multiple storylines. Locating the methodological approach on the two dimensions; text versus context and critical versus constructivist, this study pays closer attention to context rather than on individual linguistic elements of texts. Regarding the second dimension, this study builds upon constructivist epistemology, being concerned with understanding which truths these storylines produce for their speakers, and their external influences upon alternative storylines and actors. The three storylines presented here represent three competing discourses regarding forest biomass usage in European renewable energy: forestry prioritised, climate focussed and critical. Each of these are promoted by actors aiming to gain discursive hegemony on the issue, both in terms of the impact of their discourse upon EU policy making and in the eyes of the public. Despite the discursive differences created by these deeply held opposing views of what sustainability and nature are and what this means for forest biomass, there were several points where narrative elements overlapped. These can provide insight for developing a more constructive debate on the sustainability of forest biomass."
https://openalex.org/W3131317108,"Previous studies found significant modification in spatiotemporal parameters of backward walking in healthy older adults, but the age-related changes in the neuromuscular control have been considered to a lesser extent. The present study compared the intersegmental coordination, muscle activity and corresponding modifications of spinal montoneuronal output during both forward and backward walking in young and older adults. Ten older and ten young adults walked forward and backward on a treadmill at different speeds. Gait kinematics and EMG activity of 14 unilateral lower-limb muscles were recorded. As compared to young adults, the older ones used shorter steps, a more in-phase shank and foot motion, and the activity profiles of muscles innervated from the sacral segments were significantly wider in each walking condition. These findings highlight age-related changes in the neuromuscular control of both forward and backward walking. A striking feature of backward walking was the differential organization of the spinal output as compared to forward gait. In addition, the resulting spatiotemporal map patterns also characterized age-related changes of gait. Finally, modifications of the intersegmental coordination with aging were greater during backward walking. On the whole, the assessment of backward walk in addition to routine forward walk may help identifying or unmasking neuromuscular adjustments of gait to aging."
https://openalex.org/W3130329048,"The TSA Opal multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) protocol (PerkinElmer) has been used to characterize immune infiltration in human cancers. This technique allows multiple biomarkers to be simultaneously stained in a single tissue section, which helps to elucidate the spatial relationship among individual cell types. We developed and optimized two improved mIHC protocols for a 7-color panel containing 6 biomarkers (CD3, CD8, CD163, PD-L1, FoxP3, and cytokeratin (CK)) and DAPI. The only difference between these two protocols was the staining sequence of those 6 biomarkers as the first sequence is PD-L1/CD163/CD8/CK/CD3/FoxP3/DAPI and the second sequence is FoxP3/CD163/CD8/CK/CD3/PD-L1/DAPI. By comparing PD-L1/FoxP3 staining in mIHC and singleplex PD-L1/FoxP3 staining on the adjacent slide, we demonstrated that the staining sequence does not affect the staining intensity of individual biomarkers as long as a proper antigen retrieval method was used. Our study suggests that use of an antigen retrieval buffer with higher pH value (such as Tris-EDTA pH9.0) than that of the stripping buffers (such as citrate buffer pH6.0) is helpful when using this advanced mIHC method to develop panels with multiple biomarkers. Otherwise, individual biomarkers may exhibit different intensities when the staining sequence is changed. By using this protocol, we characterized immune infiltration and PD-L1 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), breast cancer (BCa), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens. We observed a statistically significant increase in CD3 + cell populations within the stroma of NSCLC as compared to BCa and increased PD-L1 + tumor cells in HNSCC as opposed to BCa."
https://openalex.org/W3130921612,"Objective In 2020, the COVID-19 appeared in Italy with an exponential transmission capacity and serious consequences for the whole population. To counter the spread of the virus, the Italian government has adopted an extensive lockdown, forcing citizens to stay at home and avoid social contact. The COVID-19 quarantine represents a unique phenomenon in the recent centuries, and its long-term consequences on people’s lives and mental health are still to be understood. This study aimed to explore significant experiences of people who did not contract the virus, yet experienced the quarantine as a potentially stressful condition. Methods Italians who did not contract the COVID-19 were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews employing the Critical Incident Technique. Interviews were designed to capture the significant experiences related to the lockdown period in Italy. Participants were asked to describe the most significant (1) negative and (2) positive critical events that they personally experienced during the ongoing quarantine. Such events were meant to provide information on their experience of the quarantine as a whole. The audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed following Critical Incident Technique’s indications. Results Twenty two participants described a total of 43 critical events, including 22 negative episodes and 21 positive events experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine. Three categories emerged from the negative episodes and four categories emerged from the positive events described by the participants. Relevant themes both positive and negative concerned mostly relationships (with partners, family, and friends), and the alteration of everyday activities, Also a specific “sensation of emergency” that the participants felt during the pandemic emerged, as an emotionally-charged response to quarantine-related external stimuli. Conclusions To our knowledge this is the first in-depth qualitative study investigating the significant negative and positive events that people experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine. Future research could employ analogous event recollection methods but focus on other populations (e.g., fragile subjects or on other national contests), in order to extend the information on the quarantine experience and its possible long-lasting effects."
https://openalex.org/W3130866895,"The 2019 emergence of, SARS-CoV-2 has tragically taken an immense toll on human life and far reaching impacts on society. There is a need to identify effective antivirals with diverse mechanisms of action in order to accelerate preclinical development. This study focused on five of the most established drug target proteins for direct acting small molecule antivirals: Nsp5 Main Protease, Nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Nsp13 Helicase, Nsp16 2’-O methyltransferase and the S2 subunit of the Spike protein. A workflow of solvent mapping and free energy calculations was used to identify and characterize favorable small-molecule binding sites for an aromatic pharmacophore (benzene). After identifying the most favorable sites, calculated ligand efficiencies were compared utilizing computational fragment screening. The most favorable sites overall were located on Nsp12 and Nsp16, whereas the most favorable sites for Nsp13 and S2 Spike had comparatively lower ligand efficiencies relative to Nsp12 and Nsp16. Utilizing fragment screening on numerous possible sites on Nsp13 helicase, we identified a favorable allosteric site on the N-terminal zinc binding domain (ZBD) that may be amenable to virtual or biophysical fragment screening efforts. Recent structural studies of the Nsp12:Nsp13 replication-transcription complex experimentally corroborates ligand binding at this site, which is revealed to be a functional Nsp8:Nsp13 protein-protein interaction site in the complex. Detailed structural analysis of Nsp13 ZBD conformations show the role of induced-fit flexibility in this ligand binding site and identify which conformational states are associated with efficient ligand binding. We hope that this map of over 200 possible small-molecule binding sites for these drug targets may be of use for ongoing discovery, design, and drug repurposing efforts. This information may be used to prioritize screening efforts or aid in the process of deciphering how a screening hit may bind to a specific target protein."
https://openalex.org/W3129511279,"In the emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, great efforts were made to quickly provide serology testing to the medical community however, these methods have been introduced into clinical practice without the complete validation usually required by the regulatory organizations. SARS-CoV-2 patient samples (n = 43) were analyzed alongside pre-pandemic control specimen (n = 50), confirmed respiratory infections (n = 50), inflammatory polyarthritis (n = 22) and positive for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (n = 30). Imprecision, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and concordance were evaluated on IgG serologic assays from EuroImmun, Epitope Diagnostics (EDI), Abbott Diagnostics and DiaSorin and a rapid IgG/IgM test from Healgen. EDI and EuroImmun imprecision was 0.02–14.0% CV. Abbott and DiaSorin imprecision (CV) ranged from 5.2%–8.1% and 8.2%–9.6% respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the assays was 100% (CI: 80–100%) for Abbott, EDI and EuroImmun and 95% (CI: 73–100%) for DiaSorin at ≥14 days post PCR. Only the Abbott assay had a diagnostic specificity of 100% (CI: 91–100%). EuroImmun cross-reacted in 3 non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections and 2 controls. The DiaSorin displayed more false negative results and cross-reacted in six cases across all conditions tested. EDI had one cross-reactive sample. The Healgen rapid test showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. Overall, concordance of the assays ranged from 76.1% to 97.9%. Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 showed good analytical performance. The head-to-head analysis of samples revealed differences in results that may be linked to the use of nucleocapsid or spike proteins.

https://openalex.org/W3129882965,"Background Intimate partner violence can lead to deaths of one or both partners and others (i.e., corollary victims). Prior studies do not enumerate the societal cost of intimate partner violence-related fatalities, exclude corollary victims from most analyses, and do not describe groups who bear the highest societal costs from intimate partner violence. Objective We examine racial/ethnic and gender-based disparities in potential years of life lost (PYLL) among intimate partners and corollary victims of intimate partner violence-related mortality. Methods We used 16 US states’ 2006–2015 National Violent Death Reporting System data to estimate PYLL among intimate partners ( n = 6,282) and corollary victims ( n = 1,634) by victims’ race/ethnicity and sex. We describe fatalities by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and victim-suspect relationships and used hierarchical linear models to examine PYLL per death differences by victims’ sex and race/ethnicity. Results Nearly 290,000 years of potential life were lost by partner and corollary victims as a result of IPV in 16 states during the decade of study. Most partner victims were female (59%); most corollary victims were male (76%). Female intimate partners died 5.1 years earlier (95% CI: 4.4., 5.9) than males, and female corollary victims died 3.6 years (1.9, 5.5) earlier than males. Racial/ethnic minorities died nine or more years earlier than their White counterparts. White males had the lowest PYLL per death of all sex/race groups. Implications Intimate partner violence-related fatalities exact a high societal cost, and the burden of that cost is disproportionately high among racial/ethnic minorities. Future interventions targeting specific sex and race/ethnic groups might help reduce disparities in intimate partner violence burden."
https://openalex.org/W3130466692,"Importance Intensity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and planning required to balance concerns of saving lives and avoiding economic collapse, could depend significantly on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission is sensitive to seasonal changes. Objective Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. Setting Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. Methods Regression was used to find the relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. Results Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R 2 = 0.610, p = 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature is on SARS-CoV-2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase is associated with a 1% decrease—and a one degree decrease could be associated with a 3.7% increase—in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. This model of the effect of decreasing temperatures can only be verified over time as the pandemic proceeds through colder months. Conclusions The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months."

The study sought to examine the association between self-reported risk factors and CVD presence among adult Nevadans, between years 2011 and 2017. Methods This is a cross-sectional, population-based study that utilized the 2011 and 2017 Nevada Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. Data were analyzed between 2019 and 2020. Results A total of 5,493 and 3,764 subjects in 2011 and 2017, respectively were included. BMI (overweight/obesity) remained the most prevalent CVD risk factor. The second most common CVD risk factor was high cholesterol, followed by hypertension. Compared to females, males were 1.64 times more likely to have reported CVD in 2011, which increased to 1.92 in 2017. Compared to non-smokers, everyday smokers were 1.96 times more likely in 2011 and 3.62 times more likely in 2017. Individuals with high cholesterol status were 2.67 times more likely to have reported CVD compared to those with normal levels in 2011. In 2011, individuals with hypertension were 3.74 times more likely to have reported CVD compared to those who did not have hypertension. This relationship increased its magnitude of risk to 6.18 times more likely in 2017. In 2011, individuals with diabetes were 2.90 times more likely to have reported CVD compared to those without the condition. Conclusions Public health and healthcare providers need to target preventable cardiovascular risk factors and develop recommendations and strategies locally, nationally, and globally."
https://openalex.org/W3130300781,"Drought is one of the most significant abiotic stresses that affects the growth and productivity of crops worldwide. Finger millet [ Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.] is a C 4 crop with high nutritional value and drought tolerance. However, the drought stress tolerance genetic mechanism of finger millet is largely unknown. In this study, transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and proteomic (iTRAQ) technologies were combined to investigate the finger millet samples treated with drought at different stages to determine drought response mechanism. A total of 80,602 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 3,009 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, respectively. An integrated analysis, which combined transcriptome and proteome data, revealed the presence of 1,305 DEPs were matched with the corresponding DEGs (named associated DEGs-DEPs) when comparing the control to samples which were treated with 19 days of drought (N1-N2 comparison group), 1,093 DEGs-DEPs between control and samples which underwent rehydration treatment for 36 hours (N1-N3 comparison group) and 607 DEGs-DEPs between samples which were treated with drought for 19 days and samples which underwent rehydration treatment for 36 hours (N2-N3 comparison group). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis identified 80 DEGs-DEPs in the N1-N2 comparison group, 49 DEGs-DEPs in the N1-N3 comparison group, and 59 DEGs-DEPs in the N2-N3 comparison group, which were associated with drought stress. The DEGs-DEPs which were drought tolerance-related were enriched in hydrolase activity, glycosyl bond formation, oxidoreductase activity, carbohydrate binding and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Co-expression network analysis revealed two candidate DEGs-DEPs which were found to be centrally involved in drought stress response. These results suggested that the coordination of the DEGs-DEPs was essential to the enhanced drought tolerance response in the finger millet."

In parallel, the local government registered the official COVID-19 cases in Ijuí, as well as the mobile social distancing index (MSDI). In this study, we demonstrate that there was a decrease in the levels of SDA, DPR and MSDI before the beginning of COVID-19 community transmission in Ijuí. Furthermore, we provide predictions for the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the city. We conclude that insufficient social distancing, as evidenced by different methods, may be related to the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Ijuí. Our study predicts an approaching outbreak of COVID-19 in Ijuí through community spread, which could be avoided or attenuated with increased levels of social distancing among the population."
https://openalex.org/W3133347799,"Since its discovery in the Hubei province of China, the global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The spread throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas has presented one of the greatest infectious disease threats in recent history and has tested the capacity of global health infrastructures. Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we suggest that this application can be adapted to other states, small countries, or regions within a country to provide decision makers with critical information necessary to best protect human health."
https://openalex.org/W3131927698,"Plankton samples have been routinely collected and preserved in formalin in many laboratories and museums for more than 100 years. Recently, attention has turned to use DNA information from formalin-fixed samples to examine changes in plankton diversity over time. However, no molecular ecological studies have evaluated the impact of formalin fixation on the genetic composition of the plankton community structure. Here, we developed a method for extracting DNA from archived formalin-preserved plankton samples to determine their community structure by a DNA metabarcoding approach. We found that a lysis solution consisting of borate-NaOH buffer (pH 11) with SDS and proteinase K effectively cleaved the cross-link formed by formalin fixation. DNA was extracted from samples preserved for decades in formalin, and the diatom community of the extracted DNA was in good agreement with the microscopy analysis. Furthermore, we stored a plankton sample for 1.5 years and demonstrated that 18S rRNA gene community structures did not change significantly from non-formalin-fixed, time-zero samples. These results indicate that our method can be used to describe the original community structure of plankton archived in formalin for years. Our approach will be useful for examining the long-term variation of plankton diversity by metabarcoding analysis of 18S rRNA gene community structure."
https://openalex.org/W3131410778,"Overcrowding in emergency departments is a serious public health issue. Recent studies have reported that overcrowding in emergency departments affects not only the quality of emergency care but also clinical decisions about admission. However, no studies have examined the characteristics of the patient groups whose admission rate is influenced by such overcrowding. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a single emergency department between January 1 and December 31, 2018. Patients over 19 years old were enrolled and divided into three groups according to the degree of overcrowding—high, low, and non—based on the total number of patients in the emergency department. An emergency triage tool (the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale) was used, which categorizes patients into five different levels. We analyzed whether the degree of change in the admission rate according to the extent of overcrowding differed for each triage group. There were 73,776 patients in this study. In the analysis of all patient groups, the admission rate increased as the degree of overcrowding rose (the adjusted odds ratio for admission was 1.281 (1.225–1.339) in the high overcrowding group versus the non-overcrowding group). The analysis of the patients in each triage level showed an increase in the admission rate associated with the overcrowding, which was greater in the patient groups with a lower triage level (adjusted odds ratios for admission in the high overcrowding group versus non-overcrowding group: Korean Triage and Acuity Scale level 3 = 1.215 [1.120–1.317], level 4 = 1.294 [1.211–1.382], and level 5 = 1.954 [1.614–2.365])."
https://openalex.org/W3133332110,"In female mammals, reproduction, and in particular lactation, is the energetically most exigent life-history phase. Reproduction is strongly controlled by body reserves and food availability, so females with better body condition or food supply are believed to have higher reproductive output. Additionally, the growth and mortality of young mammals depends on their postnatal development. Therefore, the degree of precociality affects energetic demands for both mothers and young. To study the reproductive performance of the precocial European hare ( Lepus europaeus ), we analysed relationships between six predictor variables describing maternal and environmental effects and nine response variables relating to reproduction from 217 captive females. We compared the data with those of precocial and altricial mammal species from an extensive literature search. For hares, we found: (1) Heavier females had heavier litters at birth. (2) In summer and spring, total litter mass was larger than in winter. (3) At the end of lactation, the litters of multiparous females were heavier than those of primiparous females. (4) Both older females and females giving birth for the first time had relatively high leveret mortality during lactation. Comparing our results with the literature for other mammals revealed that the body condition (i.e., body mass) of females before birth is predictive of reproductive parameters in both precocial and altricial species. In the precocial hare, female body condition is no longer predictive of reproductive parameters at the end of lactation, whereas in altricial species, female body condition remains predictive of reproduction (litter mass at the end of lactation, offspring mortality) until the end of lactation. We conclude that these effects are caused by precocial offspring feeding on solid food soon after birth and, thus, being less dependent on the mother’s body condition during lactation than altricial offspring. In line with this, precociality might have evolved as a way of buffering offspring against maternal effects."

There is a lack of studies evaluating the economic impact of oral cancer (OC). This study aims to estimate the healthcare costs of OC in Brazil from 2008 to 2016. This is a partial economic evaluation using the gross costing top-down method, considering the direct healthcare costs related to outpatients, inpatients, intensive care units, and the number of procedures, from the perspective of the public health sector. The data were extracted from the Outpatient and Inpatient Information System of the National Health System, by diagnosis according to the 10 th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, according to sites of interest: C00 to C06, C09 and C10. The values were adjusted for annual accumulated inflation and expressed in 2018 I$ (1 I$ = R$2,044). Expenditure on OC healthcare in Brazil was I$495.6 million, which was composed of 50.8% (I$251.6 million) outpatient and 49.2% (I$244.0 million) inpatient healthcare. About 177,317 admissions and 6,224,236 outpatient procedures were registered. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy comprised the largest number of procedures (88.8%) and costs (94.9%). Most of the costs were spent on people over 50 years old (72.9%) and on males (75.6%). Direct healthcare costs in Brazil for OC are substantial. Outpatient procedures were responsible for the highest total cost; however, inpatient procedures had a higher cost per procedure. Men over 50 years old consumed most of the cost and procedures for OC. The oropharynx and tongue were the sites with the highest expenditure. Further studies are needed to investigate the cost per individual, as well as direct non-medical and indirect costs of OC."
https://openalex.org/W3129946387,"Spatiotemporal prediction of the response of planted forests to a changing climate is increasingly important for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. In this study, we present a methodology for estimating spatially varying productivity in a planted forest and changes in productivity with a changing climate in Japan, with a focus on Japanese cedar ( Cryptomeria japonica D . Don ) as a representative tree species of this region. The process-based model Biome-BGC was parameterized using a plant trait database for Japanese cedar and a Bayesian optimization scheme. To compare productivity under historical (1996–2000) and future (2096–2100) climatic conditions, the climate scenarios of two representative concentration pathways (i.e., RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) were used in five global climate models (GCMs) with approximately 1-km resolution. The seasonality of modeled fluxes, namely gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem exchange, and soil respiration, improved after two steps of parameterization. The estimated net primary production (NPP) of stands aged 36–40 years under the historical climatic conditions of the five GCMs was 0.77 ± 0.10 kgC m -2 year -1 (mean ± standard deviation), in accordance with the geographical distribution of forest NPP estimated in previous studies. Under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the mean NPP of the five GCMs increased by 0.04 ± 0.07 and 0.14 ± 0.11 kgC m -2 year -1 , respectively. The increases in annual NPP were small in the southwestern region because of the decreases in summer NPP and the small increases in winter NPP under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, Japanese cedar was at risk in the southwestern region, in accordance with previous studies, and monitoring and silvicultural practices should be modified accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W3131048779,"SARS-CoV-2 has disrupted the life of billions of people around the world since the first outbreak was officially declared in China at the beginning of 2020. Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the ‘universal’ increase of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We test these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, showing a good agreement. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old might be importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar increase of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential increase of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82% in Italy, to 0.62% in China or even 0.14% in middle Africa."

The present study was conducted in Ukraine, where this risky behaviour remains a common driving practice, despite legislative bans. A total of 220 (male = 82%; mean age = 35.53; SD = 10.54) drivers completed an online survey assessing frequency of engaging in a range of mobile phone applications while driving. Four variables of the theory of planned behaviour (general attitude and intention towards phone use while driving, social norms towards mobile phone use, perceived behavioural control, the specific beliefs about being able to engage in distracting activities and drive safely), and type A behaviour pattern were also collected. The results showed that, during the last year, 65% of drivers had read a text message and 49% had written a text using mobile phone applications. Likewise, a substantial proportion of the sample reported using social media while driving, by checking (34%), sending or typing a post (25%) on social network applications. Hierarchical stepwise regressions showed that a positive attitude towards mobile phone use while driving and beliefs about being able to drive safely and write or read a text message were significantly associated with the mobile phone applications use while driving. No associations were found between the type A behaviour pattern and mobile phone applications use."
https://openalex.org/W3131387891,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent types of cancer in the world and ranks second in cancer deaths in the US. Despite the recent improvements in screening and treatment, the number of deaths associated with CRC is still very significant. The complexities involved in CRC therapy stem from multiple oncogenic mutations and crosstalk between abnormal pathways. This calls for using advanced molecular genetics to understand the underlying pathway interactions responsible for this cancer. In this paper, we construct the CRC pathway from the literature and using an existing public dataset on healthy vs tumor colon cells, we identify the genes and pathways that are mutated and are possibly responsible for the disease progression. We then introduce drugs in the CRC pathway, and using a boolean modeling technique, we deduce the drug combinations that produce maximum cell death. Our theoretical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of Cryptotanshinone, a traditional Chinese herb derivative, achieved by targeting critical oncogenic mutations and enhancing cell death. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using wet lab experiments on HT29 and HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W3131391840,"Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and medical masks are widely used to reduce the inhalation exposure of airborne particulates and biohazardous aerosols. Their protective capacity largely depends on the fraction of these that are filtered from the incoming air volume. While the performance and physics of different filter materials have been the topic of intensive study, less well understood are the effects of mask sealing. To address this, we introduce an approach to calculate the influence of face-seal leakage on filtration ratio and fit factor based on an analytical model and a finite element method (FEM) model, both of which take into account time-dependent human respiration velocities. Using these, we calculate the filtration ratio and fit factor for a range of ventilation resistance values relevant to filter materials, 500–2500 Pa∙s∙m −1 , where the filtration ratio and fit factor are calculated as a function of the mask gap dimensions, with good agreement between analytical and numerical models. The results show that the filtration ratio and fit factor are decrease markedly with even small increases in gap area. We also calculate particle filtration rates for N95 FFRs with various ventilation resistances and two commercial FFRs exemplars. Taken together, this work underscores the critical importance of forming a tight seal around the face as a factor in mask performance, where our straightforward analytical model can be readily applied to obtain estimates of mask performance."

However, data regarding PrEP interest among women is lacking, particularly in Europe. Factors associated with interest in using PrEP were assessed among women respondents to the Flash! PrEP in Europe (FPIE) survey. This community-based cross-sectional study, conducted in 12 European countries, aimed to assess PrEP knowledge and interest. “High objective risk” (HOR) was assessed using established risk criteria following EACS and CDC guidelines. Factors associated with interest in using PrEP were assessed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Among 678 women, 12.5% (n = 85) were considered at HOR, 46.8% (n = 317) indicated prior PrEP knowledge and 18.0% (n = 122) reported interest in using PrEP. Among women at HOR, 40.0% (n = 34) were interested in PrEP. Factors significantly associated with PrEP interest in the final multivariable model were: younger age (18–29 years) (aOR 1.91[95CI: 1.07; 3.41]), bad self-perceived financial status (1.84[1.09; 3.11]), migrant status (south to north) (2.87[1.05; 7.89]), single or dating relationship status (1.93[1.23; 3.03]), sexual abuse history (1.86[1.17; 2.97]), “rather high”/ “high” self-perceived HIV risk (3.21[1.32; 7.81]), and HOR (2.49[1.42; 4.35]). These results show that women at HOR and those who perceived themselves to be at high risk are interested in using PrEP. There is a critical need for targeted information and improved access to PrEP to increase uptake of this HIV prevention tool to meet PrEP interest among women."
https://openalex.org/W3132923828,"We analyze the trade-offs between health and the economy during the period of social distancing in São Paulo, the state hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. We use longitudinal data with municipal-level information and check the robustness of our estimates to several sources of bias, including spatial dependence, reverse causality, and time-variant omitted variables. We use exogenous climate shocks as instruments for social distancing since people are more likely to stay home in wetter and colder periods. Our findings suggest that the health benefits of social distancing differ by levels of municipal development and may have vanished if the COVID-19 spread was not controlled in neighboring municipalities. In turn, we did not find evidence that municipalities with tougher social distancing performed worse economically. Our results also highlight that estimates that do not account for endogeneity may largely underestimate the benefits of social distancing on reducing the spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3130052034,"Offering lower-energy food swaps to customers of online supermarkets could help to decrease energy (kcal) purchased and consumed. However, acceptance rates of such food swaps tend to be low. This study aimed to see whether framing lower-energy food swaps in terms of cost savings or social norms could improve likelihood of acceptance relative to framing swaps in terms of health benefits. Participants ( n = 900) were asked to shop from a 12-item shopping list in a simulation online supermarket. When a target high-energy food was identified in the shopping basket at check-out, one or two lower-energy foods would be suggested as an alternative (a “swap”). Participants were randomised to only see messages emphasising health benefits (fewer calories), cost benefits (lower price) or social norms (others preferred this product). Data were analysed for 713 participants after exclusions. Participants were offered a mean of 3.17 swaps ( SD = 1.50), and 12.91% of swaps were accepted (health = 14.31%, cost = 11.49%, social norms = 13.18%). Swap acceptance was not influenced by the specific swap frame used (all p &gt; .170). Age was significantly and positively associated with swap acceptance ( b = 0.02, SE = 0.00, p &lt; .001), but was also associated with smaller decreases in energy change ( b = 0.46, SE = .19, p = .014). Overall, offering swaps reduced both energy (kcal) per product ( b = -9.69, SE = 4.07, p = .017) and energy (kcal) per shopping basket ( t 712 = 11.09, p &lt; .001) from pre- to post-intervention. Offering lower-energy food swaps could be a successful strategy for reducing energy purchased by customers of online supermarkets. Future research should explore alternative solutions for increasing acceptance rates of such swaps."

The task of calculating semantic similarity is usually presented in the form of datasets which contain word pairs and a human-assigned similarity score. Algorithms are then evaluated by their ability to approximate the gold standard similarity scores. Many such datasets, with different characteristics, have been created for English language. Recently, four of those were transformed to Thai language versions, namely WordSim-353, SimLex-999, SemEval-2017-500, and R&amp;G-65. Given those four datasets, in this work we aim to improve the previous baseline evaluations for Thai semantic similarity and solve challenges of unsegmented Asian languages (particularly the high fraction of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) dataset terms). To this end we apply and integrate different strategies to compute similarity, including traditional word-level embeddings, subword-unit embeddings, and ontological or hybrid sources like WordNet and ConceptNet. With our best model, which combines self-trained fastText subword embeddings with ConceptNet Numberbatch, we managed to raise the state-of-the-art, measured with the harmonic mean of Pearson on Spearman ρ , by a large margin from 0.356 to 0.688 for TH-WordSim-353, from 0.286 to 0.769 for TH-SemEval-500, from 0.397 to 0.717 for TH-SimLex-999, and from 0.505 to 0.901 for TWS-65."
https://openalex.org/W3131645963,"The MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic viruses that can cause severe pneumonic diseases in humans. Unfortunately, there is a non-available effective treatment to combat these viruses. Domain-motif interactions (DMIs) are an essential means by which viruses mimic and hijack the biological processes of host cells. To disentangle how viruses achieve this process can help to develop new rational therapies. Data mining was performed to obtain DMIs stored as regular expressions (regexp) in 3DID and ELM databases. The mined regexp information was mapped on the coronaviruses’ proteomes. Most motifs on viral protein that could interact with human proteins are shared across the coronavirus species, indicating that molecular mimicry is a common strategy for coronavirus infection. Enrichment ontology analysis for protein domains showed a shared biological process and molecular function terms related to carbon source utilization and potassium channel regulation. Some of the mapped motifs were nested on B, and T cell epitopes, suggesting that it could be as an alternative way for reverse vaccinology.

Materials and methods A link to a self-administered questionnaire was emailed to Ontario dentists. Dentists’ readiness and its determinants were assessed based on Transtheoretical Model’s ‘stages’ and ‘processes’ of change, respectively. Based on their current practices, dentists were either assigned to ‘pre-action’ or ‘action+’ stages. Results Of the 9,975 dentists contacted, 932 completed the survey; 51.9% participants were in action stage to assess the history of HPV infections and 20.5% to recommend immunization. Internationally-trained and those whose office’s physical layout was not a concern to discuss patients’ sexual history were more likely to assess the history. Dentists with higher knowledge about HPV vaccines, not concerned about the HPV vaccine safety, comfortable discussing sex-related topics with patients, or willing to exceed their scope of practice were more ready to recommend HPV immunization to their patients. Conclusion Improving Ontario dentists’ knowledge and communication skills and changing their self-perceived role regarding HPV infections and vaccination can increase their capacity to minimize the burden of HPV infections."

https://openalex.org/W3130312065,"Restoring fire regimes is a major goal of biodiversity conservation efforts in fire-prone ecosystems from which fire has been excluded. In the southeastern U.S.A., nearly a century of fire exclusion in pine savannas has led to significant biodiversity declines in one of the most species-rich ecosystems of North America. In these savannas, frequent fires that support biodiversity are driven by vegetation-fire feedbacks. Understory grasses are key components of these feedbacks, fueling the spread of fires that keep tree density low and maintain a high-light environment. When fire is reintroduced to long-unburned sites, however, remnant populations of bunchgrasses might experience high mortality from fuel accumulation during periods of fire exclusion. Our objective was to quantify fire effects on wiregrass ( Aristida beyrichiana ), a key component of vegetation-fire feedbacks, following 16 years without fire in a dry pine savanna typically considered to burn every 1–3 years. We examined how wiregrass size and fuel (duff depth and presence of pinecones) affected post-fire survival, inflorescence and seed production, and seed germination. Wiregrass exhibited high survival regardless of size or fuels. Probability of flowering and inflorescence number per plant were unaffected by fuel treatments but increased significantly with plant size (p = 0.016). Germination of filled seeds was consistent (29–43%) regardless of fuels, although plants in low duff produced the greatest proportion of filled seeds. The ability of bunchgrasses to persist and reproduce following fire exclusion could jumpstart efforts to reinstate frequent-fire regimes and facilitate biodiversity restoration where remnant bunchgrass populations remain."

To address these aims, we recruited a self-selecting, community-based sample of individuals working in the performing arts and invited them to complete an online survey. A total of 1,427 respondents took part. We collected responses on participants’ backgrounds, including diagnostic history as well as measures assessing their level of autistic traits, perceived occupational self-efficacy, quality of life, and mental health. They were also asked open-ended questions about support needed, received, or desired in their workplace. Eleven of the 1,427 professionals (1%) reported a clinical diagnosis of autism. Correlational analyses demonstrated that higher levels of autistic traits were significantly associated with lower levels of quality of life, lower levels of occupational self-efficacy and greater severity of mental health conditions. Almost half the sample of professionals (N = 621; 44%) reported a desire for more employment-based support, and autistic traits were significantly higher in those participants who wanted greater support. Within the community of those working in the performing arts, there are a minority of individuals who are autistic or who have high levels of autistic traits.

The main objectives of this study were to assess the long-term variability of SDMA in healthy dogs and examine the influence of an increased body fat percentage on the level of SDMA. Sixteen lean Beagles were randomly assigned to the control group or weight-change group in age- and gender-matched pairs. The energy intake of the control group (n = 8) was strictly regulated to maintain an ideal body weight for 83 weeks, while the weight-change group (n = 8) was fed to induce weight gain (week 0–47), to maintain stable excessive body weight (week 47–56) and to lose weight (week 56–83), consecutively. At 8 specified time points, the body condition score, body composition, glomerular filtration rate, serum concentration of SDMA and creatinine were analyzed. In the control group, the within-subject coefficient of variation, between-subject coefficient of variation, reference change value (type I error = 5%) and index of individuality were 0.16, 0.22, 0.43 and 0.73, respectively. The control group and weight-change group did not differ significantly in SDMA concentration. SDMA showed a significant negative association (coefficient = -0.07) with body fat percentage (p&lt;0.01) in the weight-change group and a significant positive association (coefficient = 7.79) with serum creatinine (p&lt;0.01) in the entire study population. In conclusion, SDMA concentration has high long-term stability in healthy adult dogs. For the evaluation of SDMA concentrations, subject-specific reference values are preferred over a population-based reference value seen their higher sensitivity. Moreover, an increased body fat percentage does seem to affect the serum SDMA concentration of otherwise healthy dogs, but its clinical relevance has to be clarified in further research."

Diverse body shapes and cell sizes were observed among 46 dinoflagellate genera and 37 diatom genera. Nano-cells of dinoflagellates (68% &lt;20 μm) and micro-cells of diatoms (77% 20–200 μm, mostly 50–75 μm) were predominant. According to this cell-size structure, on average, diatoms contained 40% more carbon per cell than dinoflagellates. Contrasting carbon content estimates were observed within the genera of both microalgae. Large carbon averages (&gt;10,000 pg C cell -1 ) were attributed to Gonyaulacal and some occasional genera of dinoflagellates (e.g., Pyrocystis and Noctiluca ) and centric diatoms. In contrast, values up to 3 orders of magnitude lower were found for Peridinial and Gymnodinial dinoflagellates and pennate diatoms. Based on these carbon content estimates, which can be considered representative for most of this oceanic ecosystem, seasonal and regional differences were found in the biomass assessments conducted for these functional groups. Overall, dinoflagellates (mostly low-carbon Gymnodinales) had larger depth-integrated biomass than diatoms (mainly rich-carbon centric forms) within the euphotic zone. An exception to it was the late-summer cruise at the Coatzacoalcos region when a surface bloom of centric diatoms was observed in stations influenced by river runoff. This work contributes useful reference information for future ecological studies and models for understanding the biogeochemical functioning of this open-ocean ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3131355017,"Pre-clinical murine models are critical for translating drug candidates from the bench to the bedside. There is interest in better understanding how anti-human CD3 therapy works based on recent longitudinal studies of short-term administration. Although several models have been created in this pursuit, each have their own advantages and disadvantages in Type-1 diabetes. In this study, we report a murine genetic knock-in model which expresses both a murine and a humanized-CD3ε-exon, rendering it sensitive to manipulation with anti-human CD3. These huCD3ε HET mice are viable and display no gross abnormalities. Specifically, thymocyte development and T cell peripheral homeostasis is unaffected. We tested immune functionality of these mice by immunizing them with T cell-dependent antigens and no differences in antibody titers compared to wild type mice were recorded. Finally, we performed a graft-vs-host disease model that is driven by effector T cell responses and observed a wasting disease upon transfer of huCD3ε HET T cells. Our results show a viable humanized CD3 murine model that develops normally, is functionally engaged by anti-human CD3 and can instruct on pre-clinical tests of anti-human CD3 antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3132562907,"Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, phosphoribosylaminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase ( PAICS ) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes de novo purine biosynthesis. Although PAICS has been implicated as a potential therapeutic target in several cancers, its clinical and prognostic significance in colorectal cancer (CRC) is not fully understood. To elucidate the roles of PAICS in CRC, we investigated PAICS expression in four cohorts consisting of a total of 1659 samples based on quantitative RT-PCR, microarray and RNA-seq analysis. Despite upregulated PAICS levels in tumor compared to those of normal mucosa, we found a decreasing trend of PAICS expression during tumor progression and metastasis. We conducted immunohistochemistry on 252 specimens, showing that PAICS protein was strongly expressed in the majority of CRCs, but not in adjacent mucosa. Notably, 29.0% of tumors lacked PAICS staining, and PAICS-negative expression in tumor had significant prognostic impact on poor cancer-specific survival in stage III CRC. Correspondingly, decreased levels of PAICS transcript were also correlated with poor relapse-free survival particularly in stage III patients, and this finding was robustly confirmed in three microarray datasets of a total of 802 stage II-III patients. Bioinformatics analysis of CRC tissues and cell lines consistently indicated a correlation between decreased PAICS expression and copy number loss of chromosome arm 4q. In conclusion, our results suggest that PAICS expression is downregulated during tumor progression due to genetic deletion of chromosome 4q in microsatellite stable but chromosomally unstable tumors. Furthermore, decreased expression of PAICS transcript or loss of PAICS protein may provide prognostic stratification for postoperative patients with stage III CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3131133668,"Background Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) of HIV and timely initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality of HIV infected infants. Despite the benefits of early infant testing, the coverage of EID of HIV services is still low in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana. Objectives To ascertain the factors that facilitate or hinder the delivery and uptake of EID of HIV services. Methods The study is a cross-sectional exploratory qualitative research conducted in two health facilities in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Respondents (n = 50) comprising health workers (n = 20) and HIV positive mothers (n = 30) were purposively sampled and engaged in in-depth interviews. The Nvivo 11 software and the Braun and Clarke’s stages of thematic analysis were used in coding data and data analysis respectively. Results The study found that health system factors such as inadequate Staff with sample collection skills, unavailability of vehicles to convey samples to the reference laboratory for analysis, the long turnaround time for receipt of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) results, inadequate and frequent breakdown of PCR machine hindered EID service delivery. On the other hand, adequate knowledge of health workers on EID, availability of Dried Blood Spot (DBS) cards and the adoption of task shifting strategies facilitated EID service delivery. Factors such as the denial of HIV status, non-completion of the EID process due to frustrations encountered whiles accessing service and delay in receipt of PCR results served as barriers to mother’s utilisation of EID services for their exposed infants. The study also identified that adequate knowledge of EID, perceived importance of EID, financial stability as well as financial support from others and the positive attitudes of health workers facilitated HIV positive mother’s uptake of EID services for their exposed infants. Conclusion The factors attributing to the low coverage of EID of HIV services must be promptly addressed to improve service delivery and uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3131251056,"Most insurance policies include a deductible, so that a part of the claim is paid by the insured. In order to get full coverage of the claim, the insured has two options: purchase a Zero Deductible Insurance Policy or purchase an insurance policy with deductible together with Refundable Deductible Insurance. The objective of this paper is to analyze these two options and compare the premium paid by each. We define dif ( P ) as the difference between the premiums paid. This function depends on the parameters of the deductible applied, and we focus our attention on the sign of this difference and the calculation of the optimal deductible, that is, the values of the parameters of the deductible that allow us to obtain the greatest reduction in the premium."
https://openalex.org/W3131804375,"Background Trait-based approaches have been used to demonstrate the responses of plant functional traits to environmental change may manifest both among- and/or within-species. However, how community-level foliar stoichiometric characteristic variations respond to aridity and salinity is still not well-known. Methods We calculated community weighted means (CWMs) and non-weighted means (CMs) of foliar C, N, and P concentrations (and their ratios) in a dryland plant community respond to high (HSW) and low soil moisture and salinity (LSW). Based on a sum of squares decomposition method, we determined the relative contributions of intraspecific variation and species turnover in both HSW and LSW habitats. Results The CWMs of foliar C, C:N and C:P, and CM of N in the HSW habitat were significantly greater than those in the LSW habitat. The trait variations in two habitats were mainly driven by intraspecific variation, and its contribution to trait variation mostly declined with the decrease of soil moisture and salinity. The CWMs of foliar C-related stoichiometric characteristics were mainly dominated by species turnover in both habitats. Moreover, the contribution of species turnover to C and C:P variations showed an increasing trend in the LSW habitat. For CWMs, negative covariations between intraspecific variation and turnover occurred in HSW and positive covariations (except N:P) occurred in LSW; however, CMs were generally positively correlated in both habitats. Conclusions The intraspecific variation declined as drought stress intensified, which indicates that the adaptability of desert plants declined when the stress changed from salinity to aridity. The total variation of C-related traits in both habitats were mainly dominated by species turnover. These findings highlight the importance of intraspecific variation in driving desert plant response of community functional composition to salt stress, and the joint role of intraspecific variation and species turnover in resisting drought stress."
https://openalex.org/W3130460770,"Background Tuberculin skin test (TST) for guiding initiation of tuberculosis preventive therapy poses major challenges in high tuberculosis burden settings. Methods At a primary care clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa, 278 HIV-positive adults self-read their TST by reporting if they felt a bump (any induration) at the TST placement site. TST reading (in mm) was fast-tracked to reduce patient wait time and task-shifted to delegate tasks to lower cadre healthcare workers, and result was compared to TST reading by high cadre research staff. TST reading and placement cost to the health system and patients were estimated. Simulations of health system costs were performed for 5 countries (USA, Germany, Brazil, India, Russia) to evaluate generalizability. Results Almost all participants (269 of 278, 97%) correctly self-identified the presence or absence of any induration [sensitivity 89% (95% CI 80,95) and specificity 99.5% (95% CI 97,100)]. For detection of a positive TST (induration ≥ 5mm), sensitivity was 90% (95% CI 81,96) and specificity 99% (95% CI 97,100). TST reading agreement between low and high cadre staff was high (kappa 0.97, 95% CI 0.94, 1.00). Total TST cost was 2066 I$ (95% UI 594, 5243) per 100 patients, 87% (95% UI 53, 95) of which were patient costs. Combining fast-track and task-shifting, reduced total costs to 1736 I$ (95% UI 497, 4300) per 100 patients, with 31% (95% UI 15, 42) saving in health system costs. Combining fast-tracking, task-shifting and self-reading, lowered the TST health system costs from 16% (95% UI 8, 26) in Russia to 40% (95% UI 18, 54) in the USA. Conclusion A TST strategy where only patients with any self-read induration are asked to return for fast-tracked TST reading by lower cadre healthcare workers is a promising strategy that could be effective and cost-saving, but real-life cost-effectiveness should be further examined."
