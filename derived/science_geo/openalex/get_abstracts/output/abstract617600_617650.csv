https://openalex.org/W2742305379,"Nighttime lights, calculated from weather satellite recordings, are increasingly used by social scientists as a proxy for economic activity or economic development in subnational regions of developing countries where disaggregated data from statistical offices are not available. However, so far, our understanding of what nighttime lights capture in these countries is limited. We use geo-referenced Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from 29 African countries to construct indicators of household wealth, education and health for DHS cluster locations as well as for grid cells of roughly 50 × 50 km. We show that nighttime lights are positively associated with these location-specific indicators of human development, and that the variation in nighttime lights can explain a substantial share in the variation in these indicators. We conclude that nighttime lights are a good proxy for human development at the local level."
https://openalex.org/W2891834734,"Background Pharmacogenetics practice has been successfully implemented in many developed countries to enhance personalized medicine and improve clinical and economic outcomes. An understanding of healthcare providers’ knowledge, perceptions, confidence towards pharmacogenetics, and their active enrollment with pharmacogenetic testing is essential for test acceptance and utilization. This study was designed to assess physicians’ and pharmacists’ knowledge, perceptions, and confidence towards pharmacogenetics, determine the preferred learning format for their future education in pharmacogenetics, and identify the barriers to its application in their practice settings. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a pretested self-administered questionnaire on a sample of 629 randomly selected physicians and pharmacists. Descriptive and comparative analyses were used in data analysis. Results The response rate was 98.1%. Less than one-tenth of respondents were exposed to pharmacogenetics education or training (8.9%), applied pharmacogenetics testing in their practice (9.4%), or provided patient counselling on the results of the pharmacogenetic testing (9.1%), and over 90% of them were physicians. The overall respondents’ mean (SD) total knowledge score percentage was low [45.0% (24)] and there was no significant difference between the physicians and pharmacists scores (p>0.05). Only 16.0% of participants indicated that they felt confident in applying pharmacogenetics in their practice settings. Despite these low levels of knowledge and self-confidence, 70.2% of participants expressed overall positive perceptions towards pharmacogenetics and its clinical implications. These positive overall perceptions were found to be significantly more common among pharmacists compared to physicians (p<0.05). The top two perceived barriers facing the implementation of pharmacogenetics in Kuwait were lack of education or training and clinical guidelines. Conclusions These findings highlight important concerns and will aid in the assessment of current pharmacogenetics practice. Also, they will provide further insight in designing future targeted multifaceted interventions to promote the adoption and utilization of pharmacogenetics testing in Kuwait."
https://openalex.org/W2891524256,"The earliest evidence for cheese production in the Mediterranean is revealed by stable carbon isotope analyses of individual fatty acids in pottery residues from the Dalmatian coast of Croatia. Lipid residue data indicate the presence of milk in the earliest pottery, Impressed Ware, by 5700 cal. BCE (7700 BP). In contrast, by 5200 cal BCE (7200 BP), milk was common in refined Figulina pottery, meat was mostly associated with Danilo ware, cheese occurred in Rhyta, and sieves contained fermented dairy, representing strong links between specific function and stylistically distinctive pottery vessels. Genetic data indicate the prevalence of lactose intolerance among early farming populations. However, young children are lactase persistent until after weaning and could consume milk as a relatively pathogen-free and nutrient rich food source, enhancing their chances of survival into adulthood. Fermentation of milk into yogurt and cheese decreases lactose content. The evidence for fermented dairy products by 5200 cal BCE indicates a larger proportion of the population was able to consume dairy products and benefit from their significant nutritional advantages. We suggest that milk and cheese production among Europe’s early farmers reduced infant mortality and helped stimulate demographic shifts that propelled farming communities to expand to northern latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2891974718,"The influence of early language and communication experiences on lifelong health outcomes is receiving increased public health attention. Most deaf children have non-signing hearing parents, and are at risk for not experiencing fully accessible language environments, a possible factor underlying known deaf population health disparities. Childhood indirect family communication–such as spontaneous conversations and listening in the routine family environment (e.g. family meals, recreation, car rides)–is an important source of health-related contextual learning opportunities. The goal of this study was to assess the influence of parental hearing status on deaf people’s recalled access to childhood indirect family communication. We analyzed data from the Rochester Deaf Health Survey–2013 (n = 211 deaf adults) for associations between sociodemographic factors including parental hearing status, and recalled access to childhood indirect family communication. Parental hearing status predicted deaf adults’ recalled access to childhood indirect family communication (χ2 = 31.939, p < .001). The likelihood of deaf adults reporting “sometimes to never” for recalled comprehension of childhood family indirect communication increased by 17.6 times for those with hearing parents. No other sociodemographic or deaf-specific factors in this study predicted deaf adults’ access to childhood indirect family communication. This study finds that deaf people who have hearing parents were more likely to report limited access to contextual learning opportunities during childhood. Parental hearing status and early childhood language experiences, therefore, require further investigation as possible social determinants of health to develop interventions that improve lifelong health and social outcomes of the underserved deaf population."

We analyse how gender norms interact with family deprivation and dynamics to result in girls dropping out of school; we identify the main facilitators of school retention and changes to gender socialisation.Longitudinal qualitative case studies with 36 girls were nested within a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the Samata intervention targeting adolescent girls in Bagalkote and Vijayapura districts in northern Karnataka. We used two rounds of in-depth interviews, conducted in 2014 at a time when respondents were in 8th standard at the age of 13 to 14 and sixteen months later. We combined thematic and narrative analyses.Our study found that poverty and socioeconomic realities at the household level strongly affect conformity with discriminatory gender practices such as restricting girls' mobility. The value placed on education by parents clearly differentiates the regular school goers from those frequently absent and others who dropped out. With active encouragement of the girls' educational and career aspirations, parents engendered the girl's agency to communicate openly both at home and at school, allowing subtle changes to gender performance while resisting the pressure of social sanctions. In contrast, where educational aspirations were weak, parents invested more intensely in enforcing correct performance of gender, prioritising her well-being by aiming to secure her future in a good marriage. Among poorer families, girls' domestic duties came at the cost of schooling with concerns about protecting her sexual purity predominating.In contexts where a strong gender ideology of virginity before marriage rules, subtle shifts in harmful gender practices are possible. Interventions aiming to improve education need to target the most deprived families, focussing on trust building through open communication."
https://openalex.org/W2889761677,"Effective ecosystem-based management requires estimates of abundance and population trends of species of interest. Trend analyses are often limited due to sparse or short-term abundance estimates for populations that can be logistically difficult to monitor over time. Therefore it is critical to assess regularly the quality of the metrics in long-term monitoring programs. For a monitoring program to provide meaningful data and remain relevant, it needs to incorporate technological improvements and the changing requirements of stakeholders, while maintaining the integrity of the data. In this paper we critically examine the monitoring program for the Australian fur seal (AFS) Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus as an example of an ad-hoc monitoring program that was co-ordinated across multiple stakeholders as a range-wide census of live pups in the Austral summers of 2002, 2007 and 2013. This 5-yearly census, combined with historic counts at individual sites, successfully tracked increasing population trends as signs of population recovery up to 2007. The 2013 census identified the first reduction in AFS pup numbers (14,248 live pups, -4.2% change per annum since 2007), however we have limited information to understand this change. We analyse the trends at breeding colonies and perform a power analysis to critically examine the reliability of those trends. We then assess the gaps in the monitoring program and discuss how we may transition this surveillance style program to an adaptive monitoring program than can evolve over time and achieve its goals. The census results are used for ecosystem-based modelling for fisheries management and emergency response planning. The ultimate goal for this program is to obtain the data we need with minimal cost, effort and impact on the fur seals. In conclusion we identify the importance of power analyses for interpreting trends, the value of regularly assessing long-term monitoring programs and proper design so that adaptive monitoring principles can be applied."
https://openalex.org/W2890722022,"Background The time a patient spends with blood pressure at target level is an intuitive measure of successful BP management, but population studies on its effectiveness are as yet unavailable. Method We identified a population-based cohort of 169,082 individuals with newly identified high blood pressure who were free of cardiovascular disease from January 1997 to March 2010. We used 1.64 million clinical blood pressure readings to calculate the TIme at TaRgEt (TITRE) based on current target blood pressure levels. Result The median (Inter-quartile range) TITRE among all patients was 2.8 (0.3, 5.6) months per year, only 1077 (0.6%) patients had a TITRE ≥11 months. Compared to people with a 0% TITRE, patients with a TITRE of 3–5.9 months, and 6–8.9 months had 75% and 78% lower odds of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke (adjusted odds ratios, 0.25 (95% confidence interval: 0.21, 0.31) and 0.22 (0.17, 0.27), respectively). These associations were consistent for heart failure and any cardiovascular disease and death (comparing a 3–5.9 month to 0% TITRE, 63% and 60% lower in odds, respectively), among people who did or did not have blood pressure ‘controlled’ on a single occasion during the first year of follow-up, and across groups defined by number of follow-up BP measure categories. Conclusion Based on the current frequency of measurement of blood pressure this study suggests that few newly hypertensive patients sustained a complete, year-round on target blood pressure over time. The inverse associations between a higher TITRE and lower risk of incident cardiovascular diseases were independent of widely-used blood pressure ‘control’ indicators. Randomized trials are required to evaluate interventions to increase a person’s time spent at blood pressure target."
https://openalex.org/W2891566240,"Individuals often differ in competitive ability, which can lead to the formation of a dominance hierarchy that governs differential access to resources. Previous studies of dominance have predominently focussed on within-species interactions, while the drivers of between-species competitive hierarchies are poorly understood. The increasing prevalence of predictable anthropogenic food subsidies, such as that provided by garden bird feeders, is likely to intensify between-species competition. However, the consequences for resource acquisition await detailed study, and in particular, whether competitive interactions are influenced by food quality is not known. Here, we examine competitive interactions amongst ten passerine species of birds utilising supplementary food sources of differing quality. We show that dominance rank is strongly predicted by body mass across species. Socially dominant, heavier species monopolised access to a food that had a relatively short handling time (sunflower hearts), spent longer on supplementary feeders, and pecked at lower rates. In contrast subordinate, lighter species were constrained to feed on a food that had a relatively long handling time (sunflower seeds with the hull intact). Our findings suggest that differences in body mass may result in between-species dominance hierarchies that place the heaviest species in the greatest control of supplementary feeding sites, gaining superior access to higher value foods. This may have important implications for the use of supplementary feeding as a conservation tool."
https://openalex.org/W2892117723,"Surgical site infections have a remarkable impact on morbidity, extended hospitalization and mortality. Sutures strongly contribute to development of surgical site infections as they are considered foreign material in the human body. Sutures serve as excellent surfaces for microbial adherence and subsequent colonization, biofilm formation and infection on the site of a surgery. Various antimicrobial sutures have been developed to prevent suture-mediated surgical site infection. However, depending on the site of surgery, antimicrobial sutures may remain ineffective, and antimicrobial agents on them might have drawbacks. Plasma, defined as the fourth state of matter, composed of ionized gas, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, free radical and neutrals, draws attention for the control and prevention of hospital-acquired infections due to its excellent antimicrobial activities. In the present study, the efficacy of non-thermal atmospheric plasma treatment for prevention of surgical site infections was investigated. First, contaminated poly (glycolic-co-lactic acid), polyglycolic acid, polydioxanone and poly (glycolic acid-co-caprolactone) sutures were treated with non-thermal atmospheric plasma to eradicate contaminating bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Moreover, sutures were pre-treated with non-thermal atmospheric plasma and then exposed to S. aureus and E. coli. Our results revealed that non-thermal atmospheric plasma treatment effectively eradicates contaminating bacteria on sutures, and non-thermal atmospheric plasma pre-treatment effectively prevents bacterial colonization on sutures without altering their mechanical properties. Chemical characterization of sutures was performed with FT-IR and XPS and results showed that non-thermal atmospheric plasma treatment substantially increased the hydrophilicity of sutures which might be the primary mechanism for the prevention of bacterial colonization. In conclusion, plasma-treated sutures could be considered as novel alternative materials for the control and prevention of surgical site infections."
https://openalex.org/W2890533681,"Prenatal health care interventions are effective ways to improve maternal and neonatal health. There have been few large investigations conducted on the inequalities in maternal health services utilization in Shaanxi Province of west China since the health care reform in 2009. This study examined the inequalities and determinants of maternal health services utilization in Shaanxi Province. A household survey was conducted from August to November in 2013. By using a multistage sampling method, local women aged 15-49 who had given birth in the preceding three years were recruited. Information including social-demographic characteristics and maternal health services utilization was collected through a face-to-face interview. A concentration index approach was used to measure inequalities in maternal health services utilization. A logistic regression model was employed to investigate the determinants of maternal health services utilization. There were 8,488 women from urban areas and 18,724 women from rural areas enrolled in this study. The concentration index for all the indicators of maternal health services utilization showed significance in these two areas. In urban areas, the concentration index of having 5 or more prenatal visits, receiving the first prenatal visit within 12 weeks, delivering at secondary- or higher-level health facilities and delivering by C-section were 0.0356, 0.0166, 0.0177 and 0.0591, respectively, while in rural areas, the corresponding figures were 0.0385, 0.0183, 0.0334 and 0.0566, respectively. The determinants related to maternal health services utilization were women's age at delivery, educational level, employment status, parity, health problems during pregnancy and household income. Inequalities in maternal health services utilization still exist in Shaanxi Province. Providing maternal health services for younger, less educated, unemployed, high parity and poorer women, especially in rural areas, is expected to reduce the inequalities in maternal health services utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2890864626,"Uremic pruritus is a common and frustrating symptom among patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). This study aimed to examine the prognostic importance of uremic pruritus and to identify the determinants for higher pruritus intensity in PD patients.We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients receiving maintenance PD. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score was used to measure the intensity of uremic pruritus. The composite endpoint of PD technique failure or all-cause death was assessed using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. The determinants for the VAS score of uremic pruritus was assessed using a multivariable linear regression model.Among the 85 PD patients, 24 (28%) had uremic pruritus. During a median follow-up of 28.0 months, 12 patients experienced technique failure, and 7 died. We found that a higher VAS score of pruritus intensity was an independent risk factor for technique failure or death (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.18 to 2.28; P = 0.003) after adjusting for a variety of confounding factors. We also found that a weekly total Kt/V of less than 1.88, a longer duration of dialysis, a higher dietary protein intake, and higher blood levels of intact parathyroid hormone and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were independent determinants of higher VAS scores of pruritus intensity.Our results show that uremic pruritus is an independent risk factor of technique failure and death in patients receiving PD. We also found that a weekly total Kt/V < 1.88 is associated with higher intensity of uremic pruritus in PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2889905243,"On the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the high-altitudinal gradients can negatively affect plant distribution and limit plant growth and reproduction. Leymus secalinus (Georgi) Tzvel. is an important forage crop on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and has an excellent ability to fix sand and improve soil. To evaluate the effect of altitude on the physiological characteristics of L. secalinus on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we measured the lipid peroxidation; chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), total carotenoid (Car), soluble protein, proline and soluble sugar contents; and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) in leaves from eight different altitudes in Minhe County and Huangzhong County. The leaves were collected at the initial bloom stage, and the average vertical distance between two adjacent collection sites was approximately 100 meters. The reduction in Chl a and Chl b contents and the increase in Car contents can allow plants to weaken their light absorption and avoid photodamage to the chloroplast. The decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) content associated with lower lipid peroxidation, and the changes of CAT, SOD and POD activities reflect a higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity in high-altitude plants. The increase in proline and soluble sugar contents with elevation suggests that proline and soluble sugar may play a key role in the osmotic adjustment of plants in alpine regions. The results suggested that altitudinal gradients negatively affect L. secalinus on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and that the adaptation mechanism and survival strategies of L. secalinus were attributed to the combined effects of multiple protective strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2890909893,"Wound healing involves multiple interrelated processes required to lead to successful healing outcomes. Phagocytosis, inflammation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, energy production, and collagen synthesis are all directly or indirectly dependent on oxygen. Along with other critical factors, such as nutrition and comorbidities, availability of oxygen is a key determinant of healing success. Previously, we have presented a novel oxygenated hydrogel material that can be made into dressings for continuous localized oxygen delivery to wounds. In this study, an acute porcine wound model was used to test the healing benefits of these oxygenated MACF (MACF + O2) hydrogel dressings compared to controls, which included commercial Derma-GelTM hydrogel dressings. Wound closure and histological analyses were performed to assess re-epithelialization, collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and keratinocyte maturation. Results from these assays revealed that wounds treated with MACF + O2 hydrogel dressings closed faster as compared to Derma-Gel (p<0.05). Targeted metabolomics via liquid chromatography separation and mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) and a biochemical assay determined the concentration of hydroxyproline in wound samples at days 14 and 21, showing that MACF + O2 hydrogel dressings improved wound healing via an upregulated collagen synthesis pathway as compared to Derma-Gel (p<0.05). Histological evidence showed that MACF + O2 hydrogel dressings improve new blood vessel formation and keratinocyte maturation over all other treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2890158490,"In our research, we examined the efficacy of an Internet-based stress management program. Our interest in evaluating this type of intervention is based on the increasing accessibility of the Internet today, the growth of Internet-based interventions for various psychopathological problems, and the observation that despite the prevalence of stress among university students, only a fraction of students ever seek professional help.""I'm managing my stress"" (""Je gère mon stresse""), an Internet-based self-help program composed of four sessions, was examined in this study. The aforementioned program is based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and was inspired by the ""Funambule"" program in Quebec. Four questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Scale of Satisfaction in Studies, and General Health Questionnaire) uploaded online were answered thrice: during ""preintervention"", ""postintervention"", and ""follow-up"" stages, the latter of which occurred three months after the intervention. The sample comprised 128 university students, with the majority being women (81.25%). The subjects were divided randomly into two groups (an experimental group and a control group that did not follow the program).The self-esteem scores of the control group were significantly higher than those of the experimental group at the preintervention stage, but this difference disappeared at the postintervention and follow-up stages. There were also significantly lower scores on the General Health Questionnaire subfactors of somatic symptoms and anxiety/insomnia in the experimental group than in the control group during the postintervention stage, though no differences were observed before the intervention. These differences no longer remained after three months. ANOVA revealed significant effects of the intervention over time in the experimental group. Effects were observed at both the postintervention and follow-up stages for self-esteem, perceived stress, satisfaction in studies, and in the somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia and severe depression aspects of the General Health Questionnaire (Cohen's d = 0.38 to 4.58). In contrast, no effects were observed in the control group.This type of Internet-based program has the ability to reach a large number of students due to its rather short format and accessibility. It has already shown improvements in terms of the levels of perceived stress, psychological distress and satisfaction with studies. The option of online interventions could appeal specifically to students who do not seek professional help. However, even though these results are promising at the postintervention stage, they are limited, as indicated by the lack of significant differences between the two groups after the initial three months of follow-up. We still, specifically, need to improve this intervention program and, generally, need more research to address the methodological problems raised by this type of intervention.ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN13709272."
https://openalex.org/W2890706458,"Despite its widespread recognition as a successful model of participatory forest management, the community forestry program in Nepal is often criticized for its protection-oriented emphasis. Recognizing the need for more active timber management, the government of Nepal recently adopted a scientific forest management (SFM) policy in the lowland tropical region. In this study, strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat analytical hierarchical process criteria were employed to understand stakeholder perceptions concerning SFM implementation in Nepal. The overall perception was prioritized in the order of strengths (35%), threats (28%), opportunities (22%), and weaknesses (16%). The study results suggest that there is agreement among stakeholders regarding the need for active management of forests in the tropical lowland region. However, the perceptions of academic researchers and non-government organization professionals differed from those of the other stakeholders in that those two groups were more concerned about potential corruption and uncertainties surrounding policy and legal issues. The findings suggest that the long-term success of SFM may depend on the ability of the government to develop a mechanism that is transparent and capable of ensuring equitable benefit sharing among stakeholders. While the stakeholder perception analysis performed in this study was focused on SFM implementation in Nepal, the results could have implications for other countries that practice the participatory model of forest governance as well."
https://openalex.org/W2891397201,"Quinoline-3-carboxamides (Q substances) are small molecule compounds with anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we used one of these substances, Paquinimod, to treat a novel model for chronic liver inflammation and liver fibrosis, the NOD-Inflammation Fibrosis (N-IF) mouse. We show that treatment of N-IF mice significantly reduced inflammation and resulted in the regression of fibrosis, even when the treatment was initiated after onset of disease. The reduced disease phenotype was associated with a systemic decrease in the number and reduced activation of disease-promoting transgenic natural killer T (NKT)-II cells and their type 2-cytokine expression profile. Paquinimod treatment also led to a reduction of CD115+ Ly6Chi monocytes and CD11b+ F4/80+ CD206+ macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2891954475,"Insulin resistance is a well-known physiological adaptation to prolonged fasting in healthy skeletal muscle. Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility in skeletal muscle, and a pronounced increase in the risk of metabolic complications. Under the hypothesis that the metabolic traits of insulin resistance associated with prolonged fasting are different from insulin resistance associated with obesity, we examined nine obese and nine lean participants during 12 and 72h of fasting, respectively. Insulin resistance in obese participants was associated with impaired insulin signaling, and reduced levels of glucose-6-phosphate and TCA-cycle intermediates. 72h of fasting in lean participants reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake to levels similar to obese participants fasted for 12h. This was associated with increased lipid oxidation, but not accumulation of diacylglycerol or acylcarnitines and impairment of insulin signaling. Prolonged fasting was associated with pronounced increases in β-hydroxybutyrate and β- hydroxybutyrylcarnitine levels in skeletal muscle suggesting augmented ketone body metabolism. Fasting induced insulin resistance may be a consequence of substrate competition. The underlying mechanism behind insulin resistance in obesity is thus not comparable to the physiological adaptations in skeletal muscle induced by prolonged fasting in lean participants."
https://openalex.org/W2890130118,"An animal’s welfare depends on an individual’s capacity to adapt to the environment in which it lives. This adaptation is directly associated with the quality of the environment and to the possibility of expressing natural behaviours. Horses kept in stables often display a range of abnormal behaviours related to lack of control over their environment, which can lead to behavioural and health problems. An individual’s personality also plays an important role in its susceptibility and resilience to the development of diseases and abnormal behaviour; thus, an evaluation of horses’ personalities could be crucial to selecting individuals best able to cope with different work activities. This study aimed to assess the well-being of police horses maintained in a semi-confinement regime in Brazil by associating their personalities to the occurrence of abnormal behaviours and disease. Using a non-invasive approach, different tests were performed to investigate the horses’ behaviour, personality and welfare. A frustration test and a novel object test were conducted with 46 horses and the individuals’ personalities were assessed using questionnaires and behaviour tests. In addition, we evaluated their physical health through a survey of their veterinary records. The data for horses were evaluated individually. The results demonstrated the occurrence of multiple abnormal behaviours motivated by factors such as diet and lack of social contact. Moreover, the personality tests indicated this is an important component when evaluating welfare, since correlations were found between personality traits and abnormal behaviour expression, and between personality traits and health problems. According to our results, passive, stubborn, and confident horses are better suited to be selected as police horses. The ability to classify horses according to their personalities could help in selecting horses most suitable for patrolling, thereby helping to reduce behavioural problems and increasing animal well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2892151731,"Recent insights have shown subjective status to impact health and health behavior. It is however unclear how this exactly happens. In this study we explore two mechanisms: this of a direct, mediating effect of subjective status explaining the impact of material class on health outcomes and behavior and an indirect, moderating impact on the relationship between material class and health outcomes and behavior. To test this empirically we conduct two studies, focusing on Great-Britain, using survey-data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (N: 2709–3448) and the Whitehall II-study (N: 6275–6467). Our linear and logistic regression analyses show subjective status has a mainly direct impact on health outcomes and has both a direct, mediating and indirect, moderating impact on health behavior. In the conclusion of our article we reflect on the theoretical reasons why subjective status has a direct impact in certain cases, while playing an indirect role in other cases."
https://openalex.org/W2889870391,"During the 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, supportive care was the only non-experimental treatment option for patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD). However, providing care that would otherwise be routine for most clinical settings in the context of a highly contagious and lethal pathogen is much more challenging. The objective of this study was to document and deepen understanding of barriers to provision of supportive care in Ebola treatment units (ETUs) as perceived by those involved in care delivery during the outbreak.This qualitative study consisted of 29 in-depth semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (decision-makers, physicians, nurses) involved in patient care delivery during the outbreak. Analysis consisted of interview debriefing and team-based transcript coding in NVivo10 software using thematic analysis.Participants emphasized three interconnected barriers to providing high-quality supportive care during the outbreak: 1) lack of material and human resources in ETUs; 2) ETU organizational structure limiting the provision of supportive clinical care; and 3) delayed and poorly coordinated policies limiting the effectiveness of global and national responses. Participants also noted the ethical complexities of defining and enacting best clinical practices in low-income countries. They noted tension between, on one hand, scaling up minimal care and investing in clinical care preparedness to a level sustainable in West Africa and, on the other, providing a higher level of supportive care, which in low-resource health systems would require important investments.Our findings identified potentially modifiable barriers to the delivery of supportive care to patients with EVD in West Africa. Addressing these in the inter-outbreak period will be useful to improve patient care and outcomes during inevitable future outbreaks. Promoting community trust and engagement through long-term capacity building of the healthcare workforce and infrastructure would increase both health system resilience and ability to handle other outbreaks of emerging diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2891206949,"In this paper we propose a criterion to balance the processing time and the solution quality of k-means cluster algorithms when applied to instances where the number n of objects is big. The majority of the known strategies aimed to improve the performance of k-means algorithms are related to the initialization or classification steps. In contrast, our criterion applies in the convergence step, namely, the process stops whenever the number of objects that change their assigned cluster at any iteration is lower than a given threshold. Through computer experimentation with synthetic and real instances, we found that a threshold close to 0.03n involves a decrease in computing time of about a factor 4/100, yielding solutions whose quality reduces by less than two percent. These findings naturally suggest the usefulness of our criterion in Big Data realms."
https://openalex.org/W2890736058,"Management of wild fisheries resources requires accurate knowledge on which species are being routinely exploited, but it can be hard to identify fishes to species level, especially in speciose fish groups where colour patterns vary with age. Snappers of the genus Lutjanus represent one such group, where fishes can be hard to identify and as a result fisheries statistics fail to capture species-level taxonomic information. This study employs traditional morphological and DNA barcoding approaches to identify adult and juvenile Lutjanus species harvested in Malaysian waters. Our results reveal a suite of species that differs markedly from those that have previously been considered important in the Malaysian wild-capture fishery and show that official fisheries statistics do not relate to exploitation at the species level. Furthermore, DNA barcoding uncovered two divergent groups of bigeye snapper ('Lutjanus lutjanus') distributed on either side of the Malay Peninsula, displaying a biogeographical pattern similar to distributions observed for many co-occurring reef-distributed fish groups. One of these bigeye snapper groups almost certainly represents an unrecognized species in need of taxonomic description. The study demonstrates the utility of DNA barcoding in uncovering overlooked diversity and for assessing species catch composition in a complicated but economically important taxonomic group."
https://openalex.org/W2890944752,"Mexican sunflower, Tithonia diversifolia (Asteraceae), is an invasive tropical plant species native to Central America. It has spread in more than 70 countries across Asia, Africa and Australia. In Africa, this species is known to disturb native crops and plant communities, but its negative impacts remain underestimated. Moreover, its potential invasion risk has not been investigated so far. A fundamental aspect in the identification and prediction of habitats susceptible to biological invasions lies in the ability of an organism to conserve or change its ecological niche as part of the invasion process. Here, we compared the realised climatic niche of T. diversifolia between its Central American and African ranges. In addition, reciprocal distribution models were calibrated on its native and invaded ranges. Models were combined and projected to current and future climatic conditions in Africa to estimate the potential distribution of this species. Niche overlap given by Schoner's D index was low (0.23), equivalency and similarity tests suggested that the climatic niche of T. diversifolia is not similar in both ranges. However the low expansion (U = 0.09) and very high stability (S = 0.92) indices support climatic niche conservatism for this species in Africa, although it has not filled its entire niche so far. Our combined reciprocal models highlight highly suitable areas for this species in humid regions throughout East, Central and West Africa, then in some parts of South Africa and Madagascar. Future projections indicated that the distribution of climatically suitable habitats will likely remain stable."

Students were taught about ACLS in either a traditional lecture-based classroom (control condition) or a flipped classroom (experimental condition); then, simulation training with ACLS scenarios was carried out. Finally, each student was rated on performance using a rating form developed in advance.ACLS simulation scores of the students in the flipped classroom were 70.9±10.9, which was higher than those of the students in the traditional classroom (67.1±11.3); however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.339). In addition, the difference in student satisfaction as measured on a survey was statistically insignificant (p = 0.655).Competency assessment after simulation-based training in ACLS undergone by senior medical students randomly assigned to flipped and traditional classrooms showed no statistical difference in competency between the two groups."
https://openalex.org/W2892296702,"The idea of mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions by increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) is notable. However, the estimation of the net ecosystem carbon balance after conversion from conventional tillage to conservational tillage has been poorly quantified for the Loess Plateau in China. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to estimate the agroecosystem carbon balance of a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system using a full carbon cycle analysis. The results showed that a positive net ecosystem carbon balance value in the cases of rotary tillage with straw incorporation, chisel plow tillage with straw incorporation, and no tillage with straw mulching treatments. Note that a negative value was detected for the conventional moldboard plowing tillage without crop straw treatment. The conversion from conventional tillage to conservational tillage substantially enhanced the carbon sink potential from 0.84 t C ha-1 yr-1 to 2.69 t C ha-1 yr-1 in both years. Our findings suggest that the expansion of conservational tillage could enhance the potential carbon sink of the rain-fed land in China."
https://openalex.org/W2891674727,"We assembled three complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes), two of Solanum lycopersicum and one of Solanum pennellii, and analyzed their intra- and interspecific variations. The mitogenomes were 423,596-446,257 bp in length. Despite numerous rearrangements between the S. lycopersicum and S. pennellii mitogenomes, over 97% of the mitogenomes were similar to each other. These mitogenomes were compared with plastid and nuclear genomes to investigate genetic material transfers among DNA-containing organelles in tomato. In all mitogenomes, 9,598 bp of plastome sequences were found. Numerous nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA (NUMTs) and plastid DNA (NUPTs) were observed in the S. lycopersicum and S. pennellii nuclear genomes. Several long organellar DNA fragments were tightly clustered in the nuclear genome; however, the NUMT and NUPT locations differed between the two species. Our results demonstrate the recent occurrence of frequent endosymbiotic gene transfers in tomato genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2889789500,"Few species are adapted to high latitudes, and many over-winter in milder climates with migrations involving extensive barrier crossings. By escaping extreme conditions for the majority of the year, physiological and behavioural adaptations presumably need to be less pronounced. The snow bunting Plectrophenax nivalis is the most northerly breeding passerine. We tracked the Svalbard population using geolocators to reveal that these individuals not only breed in environmental extremes, but also spend the winters in the severe cold and highly stochastic weather conditions of the Siberian steppe. Migratory strategies appeared to be flexible between individuals and years. However, common wintering grounds in the Asian Western Steppe were identified, where birds could utilise vast crop- and grasslands while enduring low ambient temperatures. The timing of significant long distance movements was consistent among individuals, and the autumn routing of the >1000 km open water flight to Novaya Zemlya incurred favourable wind assistance and lower risk of precipitation, compared to the shorter route between Svalbard and Norway used in spring. Presumably, Svalbard snow buntings are physiologically well-adapted to extreme conditions and their migration, rather being a retreat from physiologically demanding conditions, allows utilisation of an abundance of resources in the Asian Steppe."
https://openalex.org/W2891564043,"Polianthes tuberosa is a popular ornamental plant. Its floral scent volatiles mainly consist of terpenes and benzenoids that emit a charming fragrance. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for the floral scent of P. tuberosa is limited. Using transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly, a total of 228,706,703 high-quality reads were obtained, which resulted in the identification of 96,906 unigenes (SRA Accession Number SRP126470, TSA Acc. No. GGEA00000000). Approximately 41.85% of the unigenes were functionally annotated using public databases. A total of 4,694 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)were discovered during flowering. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the majority of the volatiles comprised benzenoids and small amounts of terpenes. Homology analysis identified 13 and 17 candidate genes associated with terpene and benzenoid biosynthesis, respectively. Among these, PtTPS1, PtDAHPSs, PtPAL1, and PtBCMT2 might play important roles in regulating the formation of floral volatiles. The data generated by transcriptome sequencing provide a critical resource for exploring concrete characteristics as well as for supporting functional genomics studies. The results of the present study also lay the foundation for the elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of floral scents in monocots."
https://openalex.org/W2892235718,"Nephotettix cincticeps, a prevalent rice pest, injects gelling and watery saliva into plant tissues during the sucking process. Certain components within the saliva are believed to interact with plant cellular constituents and play important roles in overcoming host plant defense responses. Based on our previous analysis of the salivary gland transcriptome and secreted saliva proteome of N. cincticeps, in this study, we analyzed the biological functions of salivary protein, NcSP75 (N. cincticeps salivary protein 75 kD). NcSP75, a salivary glands-specific gene, showed low similarities to any previously reported sequences. Knockdown of NcSP75 by RNA interference (RNAi) reduced the longevity of treated nymphs to approximately half of the longevity of controls and caused severe developmental retardation. Furthermore, the knockdown of NcSP75 decreased the survival rate of adults, and reduced the number of deposited eggs and hatched nymphs. Thus, the adverse effects caused by the knockdown of NcSP75 were observed throughout the lifetime of N. cincticeps, when feeding on rice plants. In contrast, no reduction was observed in the survival rate of the knockdown of NcSP75 adults fed on an artificial diet. Electrical penetration graph measurements taken from adult females feeding on rice plants showed a significantly shorter duration of phloem ingestion associated with the knockdown of NcSP75 than the knockdown of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Furthermore, the total sugar content of the honeydew was lower when NcSP75 was knocked down. These results suggest that the NcSP75 protein contribute to successful and sustainable ingestion from the sieve elements of rice plants. The NcSP75 protein of N. cincticeps can, accordingly, be considered as a key effector for establishing compatible interaction with rice plants and could be a potential target for controlling this species."
https://openalex.org/W2890705217,"Proposal This paper investigates a novel screening tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which aims at efficient population-wide monitoring. To this end, we introduce SASscore which provides better OSAS prediction specificity while maintaining a high sensitivity. Methods We process a cohort of 2595 patients from 4 sleep laboratories in Western Romania, by recording over 100 sleep, breathing, and anthropometric measurements per patient; using this data, we compare our SASscore with state of the art scores STOP-Bang and NoSAS through area under curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). We also evaluate the performance of SASscore by considering different Apnea–Hypopnea Index (AHI) diagnosis cut-off points and show that custom refinements are possible by changing the score’s threshold. Results SASscore takes decimal values within the interval (2, 7) and varies linearly with AHI; it is based on standardized measures for BMI, neck circumference, systolic blood pressure and Epworth score. By applying the STOP-Bang and NoSAS questionnaires, as well as the SASscore on the patient cohort, we respectively obtain the AUC values of 0.69 (95% CI 0.66-0.73, p < 0.001), 0.66 (95% CI 0.63-0.68, p < 0.001), and 0.73 (95% CI 0.71-0.75, p < 0.001), with sensitivities values of 0.968, 0.901, 0.829, and specificity values of 0.149, 0.294, 0.359, respectively. Additionally, we cross-validate our score with a second independent cohort of 231 patients confirming the high specificity and good sensitivity of our score. When raising SASscore’s diagnosis cut-off point from 3 to 3.7, both sensitivity and specificity become roughly 0.6. Conclusions In comparison with the existing scores, SASscore is a more appropriate screening tool for monitoring large populations, due to its improved specificity. Our score can be tailored to increase either sensitivity or specificity, while balancing the AUC value."

Polymorphic variants in these DNA repair pathway genes such as Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP1) have been associated with susceptibility of several types of cancer including thyroid. Many studies have been published on PARP1 gene polymorphisms and carcinogenesis with inconsistent results. The present study was designed to explore the link between the PARP1 polymorphisms and thyroid cancer risk. This case-control study was comprised of 456 thyroid cancer patients and 400 healthy controls. Three SNPs of PARP1 gene; rs1136410, rs1805414 and rs1805404 were analyzed using ARMS-PCR. The combined genotype and haplotype analysis were performed using haploview software 4.2. Major allele homozygote (CC) of rs1136410 and combined genotype (TT+TC) of rs180414 showed a significant association with thyroid cancer risk (OR = 1.30; 95% CI 0.99-1.77; P = 0.05) and (OR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.27-0.67; P = 0.03). Histological subtype analysis showed the significant association of selected PARP1 SNPs with papillary, follicular and anaplastic subtypes in thyroid cancer patients. Haplotype analysis showed that TCT (p = 0.01), CTT (p = 0.02) and CTC (p = 0.03) were significantly higher in controls when compared to cases. However, TTC (p = 0.05) and TCC (p = 0.01) haplotype frequency was significantly higher in cases compared to controls. Global haplotype analysis showed that there was an overall significant difference between cases and controls (p = 0.001). Identification of these genetic risk markers may provide evidence for exploring insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis and subsequently aid in developing novel therapeutic strategies for thyroid cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2891581741,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous in natural waters and plays a central role in the biogeochemistry in riverine, estuarine and marine environments. This study quantifies and characterizes solid-phase extractable DOM and trace element complexation at different salinities in the Weser and Elbe River, northern Germany, and the North Sea. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), Co and Cu concentrations were analyzed in original water samples. Solid-phase extracted (SPE) water samples were analyzed for DOC (DOCSPE), dissolved organic nitrogen (DONSPE), sulfur (DOSSPE) and trace metal (51V, 52Cr, 59Co, 60Ni, 63Cu, 75As) concentrations. Additionally, different pre-treatment conditions (acidification vs. non-acidification prior to SPE) were tested. In agreement with previous studies, acidification led to generally higher recoveries for DOM and trace metals. Overall, higher DOM and trace metal concentrations and subsequently higher complexation of trace metals with carbon and sulfur-containing organic complexes were found in riverine compared to marine samples. With increasing salinity, the concentrations of DOM decreased due to estuarine mixing. However, the slightly lower relative decrease of both, DOCSPE and DONSPE (~77%) compared to DOSSPE (~86%) suggests slightly faster removal processes for DOSSPE. A similar distribution of trace metal and carbon and sulfur containing DOM concentrations with salinity indicates complexation of trace metals with organic ligands. This is further supported by an increase in Co and Cu concentration after oxidation of organic complexes by UV treatment. Additionally, the complexation of metals with organic ligands (analyzed by comparing metal/DOCSPE and metal/DOSSPE ratios) decreased in the order Cu > As > Ni > Cr > Co and thus followed the Irving-Williams order. Differences in riverine and marine trace metal containing DOMSPE are summarized by their average molar ratios of (C107N4P0.013S1)1000V0.05Cr0.33Co0.19Ni0.39Cu3.41As0.47 in the riverine endmember and (C163N7P0.055S1)1000V0.05Cr0.47Co0.16Ni0.07Cu4.05As0.58 in the marine endmember."
https://openalex.org/W2891601548,"Social organization is a key factor influencing a species' foraging and reproduction, which may ultimately affect their survival and ability to recover from catastrophic disturbance. Severe weather events such as cyclones can have devastating impacts to the physical structure of coral reefs and on the abundance and distribution of its faunal communities. Despite the importance of social organization to a species' survival, relatively little is known about how major disturbances such as tropical cyclones may affect social structures or how different social strategies affect a species' ability to cope with disturbance. We sampled group sizes and coral sizes of group-forming and pair-forming species of the Gobiid genus Gobiodon at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, before and after two successive category 4 tropical cyclones. Group sizes of group-forming species decreased after each cyclone, but showed signs of recovery four months after the first cyclone. A similar increase in group sizes was not evident in group-forming species after the second cyclone. There was no change in mean pair-forming group size after either cyclone. Coral sizes inhabited by both group- and pair-forming species decreased throughout the study, meaning that group-forming species were forced to occupy smaller corals on average than before cyclone activity. This may reduce their capacity to maintain larger group sizes through multiple processes. We discuss these patterns in light of two non-exclusive hypotheses regarding the drivers of sociality in Gobiodon, suggesting that benefits of philopatry with regards to habitat quality may underpin the formation of social groups in this genus."
https://openalex.org/W2892039749,"Selye defined stress as the nonspecific response of the body to any demand and thus an inherent element of all diseases. He reported that rats show adrenal hypertrophy, thymicolymphatic atrophy, and gastrointestinal ulceration, referred to as the stress triad, upon repeated exposure to nocuous agents. However, Selye’s stress triad as well as its extended version including reduced body weight gain, increased plasma glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations, and GC resistance of target cells do not represent reliable discriminatory biomarkers for chronic stress. To address this, we collected multivariate biological data from male mice exposed either to the preclinically validated chronic subordinate colony housing (CSC) paradigm or to single-housed control (SHC) condition. We then used principal component analysis (PCA), top scoring pairs (tsp) and support vector machines (SVM) analyses to identify markers that discriminate between chronically stressed and non-stressed mice. PCA segregated stressed and non-stressed mice, with high loading for some of Selye’s stress triad parameters. The tsp analysis, a simple and highly interpretable statistical approach, identified left adrenal weight and relative thymus weight as the pair with the highest discrimination score and prediction accuracy validated by a blinded dataset (92% p-value < 0.0001; SVM model = 83% accuracy and p-value < 0.0001). This finding clearly shows that simultaneous consideration of these two parameters can be used as a reliable biomarker of chronic stress status. Furthermore, our analysis highlights that the tsp approach is a very powerful method whose application extends beyond what has previously been reported."
https://openalex.org/W2951279922,"Pseudogymnoascus destructans is the fungal pathogen responsible for White-nose Syndrome (WNS), a disease that has killed millions of bats in North America over the last decade. A major obstacle to research on P. destructans has been the lack of a tractable infection model for monitoring virulence. Here, we establish a high-throughput model of infection using larvae of Galleria mellonella, an invertebrate used to study host-pathogen interactions for a wide range of microbial species. We demonstrate that P. destructans can kill G. mellonella larvae in an inoculum-dependent manner when infected larvae are housed at 13°C or 18°C. Larval killing is an active process, as heat-killed P. destructans spores caused significantly decreased levels of larval death compared to live spores. We also show that fungal spores that were germinated prior to inoculation were able to kill larvae 3-4 times faster than non-germinated spores. Lastly, we identified chemical inhibitors of P. destructans and used G. mellonella to evaluate these inhibitors for their ability to reduce virulence. We demonstrate that amphotericin B can effectively block larval killing by P. destructans and thereby establish that this infection model can be used to screen biocontrol agents against this fungal pathogen."

In the present study, we expand these findings to width and depth estimates. We presented stereoscopic full-scale room simulations on a head-mounted display and varied the luminance of the side walls, rear wall, and ceiling independently of each other. Participants judged the width and depth of the simulated rooms. Our results show that the perceived spatial layout of a given room is significantly influenced by the luminance of the direct bounding surfaces (e.g., the side walls when judging perceived width) but less affected by the luminance of the other surfaces. In the discussion, we provide an overall picture of effects of surface luminance on the perceived layout of interior spaces and discuss the conclusions in the context of existing interior-design guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2892196239,"Centrifugation is the primary preparation step for isolating red blood cells (RBCs) from whole blood, including for use in studies focused on transduction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an important vasodilatory signaling molecule. Despite the wide use of centrifugation, little work has focused on how the centrifugation itself affects release of ATP from RBCs prior to subsequent experimentation. Here we report that both the centrifugation force and duration have a pronounced impact on the concentration of ATP present in the packed RBCs following centrifugation. Multiple subsequent centrifugations yield extracellular ATP concentrations comparable to the amount released during the initial centrifugation, suggesting this effect is cumulative. Pairwise measurements of hemoglobin and ATP suggest the presence of ATP is primarily due to an increase in centrifugation-induced hemolysis. These results indicate that common centrifugation parameters, within the ranges explored here, can release ATP in quantities comparable to the low end of the range of values measured in typical ATP transduction experiments, potentially complicating experimental interpretation of those results."
https://openalex.org/W2890253514,"Latina women in the U.S. have relatively low breast cancer incidence compared to Non-Latina White (NLW) or African American women but are more likely to be diagnosed with the more aggressive ""triple negative"" breast cancer (TNBC). Latinos in the U.S. are a heterogeneous group originating from different countries with different cultural and ancestral backgrounds. Little is known about the distribution of tumor subtypes in Latin American regions. Clinical records of 303 female Peruvian patients, from the Peruvian National Cancer Institute, were analyzed. Participants were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2010 and 2015 and were identified as residing in either the Selva or Sierra region. We used Fisher's exact test for proportions and multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards Models to compare overall survival between regions. Women from the Selva region were more likely to be diagnosed with TNBC than women from the Sierra region (31% vs. 14%, p = 0.01). In the unadjusted Cox model, the hazard of mortality was 1.7 times higher in women from the Selva than the Sierra (p = 0.025); this survival difference appeared to be largely explained by differences in the prevalence of TNBC. Our results suggest that the distribution of breast cancer subtypes differs between highly Indigenous American women from two regions of Peru. Disentangling the factors that contribute to this difference will add valuable information to better target prevention and treatment efforts in Peru and improve our understanding of TNBC among all women. This study demonstrates the need for larger datasets of Latin American patients to address differences between Latino subpopulations and optimize targeted prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2891616364,"Background Anticoagulant therapy is recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but remains underused. The proper use of anticoagulants has been encouraged in guidelines frequently published over the past two decades. Materials and methods In this study, we used insurance claims data collected from 2005 to 2014 to investigate the prevalence and incidence of non-valvular AF (NVAF) patients aged 20 to 74 years standardized to the Japanese population in 2012 and subdivided by stroke prevention drug type. We estimated the frequency of coagulation monitoring in patients with incident NVAF undergoing warfarin therapy in 2011 and later. Results From 2005 to 2014, the standardized prevalence of NVAF increased from 117/100,000 to 278/100,000 and the proportion of anticoagulant users increased from 38.4% to 58.0%, while that of antiplatelet monotherapy decreased from 32.3% to 12.0%. The standardized incidence of NVAF was stable at ~40/100,000 patient-years. The proportion of those patients who started anticoagulant soon after the initial diagnosis increased from 19.9% to 49.1% from 2006 to 2013. Among patients who started warfarin, switchers to DOAC had more frequent coagulation monitoring than non-switchers. Conclusion The use of anticoagulant therapy has gradually increased in patients with NVAF in Japan during the study period from 2005 to 2014."
https://openalex.org/W2892242865,"During the neonatal period, the ability to generate immune effector and memory responses to vaccines or pathogens is often questioned. This study was undertaken to obtain a global view of the natural differences in the expression of immune genes early in life. Our hypothesis was that transcriptome analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of foals (on day 1 and day 42 after birth) and adult horses would show differential gene expression profiles that characterize natural immune processes. Gene ontology enrichment analysis provided assessment of biological processes affected by age, and a list of 897 genes with ≥2 fold higher (p<0.01) expression in day 42 when compared to day 1 foal samples. Up-regulated genes included B cell and T cell receptor diversity genes; DNA replication enzymes; natural killer cell receptors; granzyme B and perforin; complement receptors; immunomodulatory receptors; cell adhesion molecules; and cytokines/chemokines and their receptors. The list of 1,383 genes that had higher (p<0.01) expression on day 1 when compared to day 42 foal samples was populated by genes with roles in innate immunity such as antimicrobial proteins; pathogen recognition receptors; cytokines/chemokines and their receptors; cell adhesion molecules; co-stimulatory molecules; and T cell receptor delta chain. Within the 742 genes with increased expression between day 42 foal and adult samples, B cell immunity was the main biological process (p = 2.4E-04). Novel data on markedly low (p<0.0001) TLR3 gene expression, and high (p≤0.01) expression of IL27, IL13RA1, IREM-1, SIRL-1, and SIRPα on day 1 compared to day 42 foal samples point out potential mechanisms of increased susceptibility to pathogens in early life. The results portray a progression from innate immune gene expression predominance early in life to adaptive immune gene expression increasing with age with a putative overlay of immune suppressing genes in the neonatal phase. These results provide insight to the unique attributes of the equine neonatal and young immune system, and offer many avenues of future investigation."

Extracellular matrix remodelling associated with fibrogenesis may be affected by systemic inflammation induced by bacterial translocation. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of rifaximin-α, an antibiotic with effect on gut bacteria, on sCD163, sMR, and collagen metabolites. Methods Fifty-four clinically stable patients with decompensated cirrhosis were randomized to 4 weeks treatment with rifaximin-α (n = 36) or placebo (n = 18). Macrophage markers sCD163, sMR and markers of collagen fibrogenesis (C3M and C4M) and formation (PRO-C3 and P4NPS7) were analysed in plasma before and after treatment. Results sCD163 and sMR levels were associated with liver disease severity (MELD score, sCD163 rho = 0.47, p<0.001 and sMR rho = 0.37, p = 0.005). There was no effect of Rifaximin-α on sCD163 levels (median (range) sCD163 5.64(2.02 to 10.8) at baseline versus 4.42(1.98 to 8.92) at follow-up in the rifaximin-α group and 4.85 (2.29 to 12.1) at baseline versus 4.32 (1.98 to 12.4) at follow-up in the placebo-group), p = 0.34); nor sMR levels, p = 0.34. Also in patients with elevated lipopolysaccharide binding protein (> 5.9 μg/ml, 38 patients) there was no effect of rifaximin-α on sCD163 (p = 0.49) or sMR levels (p = 0.32). Conclusion We confirmed that macrophage activation markers sCD163 and sMR are directly associated to liver disease severity (MELD score). However, rifaximin-α has no effect on sCD163, sMR or collagen markers in decompensated cirrhosis and does therefore not seem to interfere with macrophage activation or fibrogenesis."

There are no studies demonstrating TB infection in native Brazilians, and the history and epidemiological scenario of TB in Brazil is still unknown. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of TB infection among the native Tenetehara-Guajajara population from Maranhão State, Brazil, 210 ± 40 years ago. A Tenetehara-Guajajara skeleton collection was submitted to paleopathological analysis, and rib bone samples (n = 17) were used for paleogenetic analysis based on Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) targets. Porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia were found in 10 and 13 individuals, respectively. Maternal ancestry analysis revealed Native American mtDNA haplogroups A and C1 in three individuals. Three samples showed osteological evidence suggestive of TB. katG and mtp40 sequences were detected in three individuals, indicating probable TB infection by two MTC lineages. Tuberculosis infection in the Tenetehara-Guajajara population since the 18th century points to a panorama of the disease resulting, most probably, from European contact. However, the important contribution of African slaves in the population of Maranhão State, could be also considered as a source of the disease.

The aim of this study was to investigate the dosimetric superiority in IMRT plans with jaw tracking technique for whole esophagus radiotherapy. Methods and materials Thirty-two patients with esophageal cancer were subjected to IMRT treatment plans using Eclipse treatment planning system. For every patient, four different plans were generated with six gantry angles: six large fields IMRT plans with fixed jaw (6F-IMRT), six large fields IMRT plans with jaw tracking technique (6F-IMRT-T), twelve small fields IMRT plans with fixed jaw (12F-IMRT), and twelve small fields IMRT plans with jaw tracking technique (12F-IMRT-T). Dosimetric evaluation was assessed for all plans. Results For every technique, there were no differences in planning target volume (PTV) coverage and conformity. 6F-IMRT-T plans could significantly reduce lung irradiation with 7.9% (P<0.001) reduction in V5lung and 2.5% (P<0.001) reduction in V20 lung respectively compared to 6F-IMRT plans. 12F-IMRT-T plans resulted in superior plans compared to 12-IMRT plans with a reduction of 2.9% (P<0.001) in V5lung and 0.9% (P<0.001) in V20 lung, respectively. For heart irradiation, 6F-IMRT-T and 12F-IMRT-T plans were slightly superior to 6F-IMRT and 12-IMRT plans respectively with a reduction of 1.1 Gy and 0.5 Gy in the respective mean doses. Conclusions By the use of jaw tracking technique, the IMRT plans resulted in further lung and heart sparing compared to fixed jaw plans for radiotherapy in esophageal cancer."

How do listeners use this auditory and visual information to judge performance quality? Both musicians and laypeople report a belief that sound should trump sight in the judgment of music performance, but surprisingly, their actual judgments reflect the opposite pattern. In a recent study, when presented with 6-second videos of music competition performers, listeners accurately guessed the winners only when the videos were muted. Here, we successfully replicate this finding in a highly-powered sample but then demonstrate that the sight-over-sound effect holds only under limited conditions. When using different videos from comparable performances, in a forced-choice task, listeners' judgments were at or below chance. And when differences in performance quality were made clearer, listeners' judgments were most accurate when they could hear the music-without audio, performance was at chance. Sight therefore does not necessarily trump sound in the judgment of music performance."

In our previous work we have identified several hit compounds targeting the MtTopo-I by in silico docking. Here we expand the scope of the compounds around three scaffolds associated with potent MtTopo-I inhibition. In addition to measuring the effect of newly generated compounds on MtTopo-I activity, we characterized the compounds’ antimicrobial activity, toxicity in human cells, and interactions with human multidrug transporters. Some of the newly developed MtTopo-I inhibitors have strong antimicrobial activity and do not harm mammalian cells. Moreover, our studies revealed significant human ABC drug transporter interactions for several MtTopo-I compounds that may modify their ADME-Tox parameters and cellular effects.

The analyses were conducted using the same basic topology, which we obtained by constructing a metatree with two recent phylogenies, both morphology and molecular-based. This topology was also used to obtain time divergence estimates in BEAST, using more outgroups than for the metatree in order to get more accurate estimates. The S-DIVA analysis based on the metatree found 25 vicariance events, 20 dispersals and two extinctions; the S-DIVA analysis based on the BEAST tree yielded 30 vicariance events, 42 dispersal events and five extinctions, and the BBM analysis yielded 63 dispersal events, 28 vicariance events and 1 extinction event. According to the metatree analysis, the ancestral area for Phymaturus covers northern Payunia and southern Central Monte. A vicariant event fragmented the ancestral distribution of the genus, resulting in northern Payunia and southern Central Monte as ancestral area for the P. palluma group, and southern Payunia for the P. patagonicus group. The analysis based on the BEAST tree showed a more complex reconstruction, with several dispersal and extinction events in the ancestral node. The Spatial Analysis of Vicariance identified 41 disjunct sister nodes and removed 10 nodes. The barrier that separates the P. palluma group from the P. patagonicus group is roughly congruent with the southern limit of the P. palluma group. The ancestral range for the genus occupies a central position relative to the distribution of the group, which implies that the species must have migrated to the north (P. palluma group) and to the south (P. patagonicus group). To answer questions related to the specific timing of the events, a molecular clock for Phymaturus was obtained, using a Liolaemus fossil for calibration. The present contribution provides a hypothetical framework for the events that modeled the distribution of Phymaturus."
https://openalex.org/W2891873405,"Analyzing and predicting the trend of price fluctuation has been receiving more and more attention, as price risk has become the focus of risk control research in heating oil futures market. A novel time series prediction model combined with the complex network method is put forward in the paper. First of all, this paper counts the cumulative time interval of different nodes in the network, and fits its growth trend with the Fourier model. Then a novel price fluctuation prediction model is established based on the effective information such as some topology properties extracted from the network. The results show that the Fourier model can predict the emergence time of new nodes in the next stage, and the established price fluctuation prediction model can infer the names of nodes in the prediction interval, so as to determine the forward-looking behavior of price evolution. Besides, liken to the NAR neural network, the prediction results obtained by the proposed method also show superiority, which has important theoretical value and academic significance for early warning and prediction of price behavior in the heating oil futures market."
https://openalex.org/W2892017355,"Insects may develop different behavioral phenotypes in response to heterogeneous environments (e.g., host plants), but the plasticity of their feeding behaviors has been rarely explored. In order to address the issue, clones of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), were collected from wheat, and their probing behaviors were recorded on three plants. Our results demonstrated that S. avenae individuals on the alternative plants (i.e., barley and oat) tended to have higher frequency of non-probing (Np), increased duration of the pathway phase, increased phloem salivation, and decreased phloem ingestion (E2), compared to those on the source plant (i.e., wheat), showing the resistance of barley and oat to this aphid's feeding. This aphid showed apparently high extents of plasticity for all test probing behaviors on barley or oat. Positive selection for higher extents of plasticity in E2 duration was identified on barley and oat. The factor 'clone' alone explained 30.6% to 70.1% of the total variance for each behavioral plasticity, suggesting that the divergence of probing behavior plasticity in S. avenae had a genetic basis. This aphid's fitness correlated positively with the plasticity of Np frequency and E2 frequency. Some behaviors and their corresponding plasticities (e.g., the frequency of xylem ingestion and its plasticity) were found to be correlated characters, probably reflecting the limits for the evolution of higher extents of behavioral plasticity in this aphid. The differential probing behaviors and their plasticity in S. avenae can have significant implications for the adaptation and management of aphids on different plants."
https://openalex.org/W2892342591,"We propose a convolutional sparse coding (CSC) for super resolution (CSC-SR) algorithm with a joint Bayesian learning strategy. Due to the unknown parameters in solving CSC-SR, the performance of the algorithm depends on the choice of the parameter. To this end, a coupled Beta-Bernoulli process is employed to infer appropriate filters and sparse coding maps (SCM) for both low resolution (LR) image and high resolution (HR) image. The filters and the SCMs are learned in a joint inference. The experimental results validate the advantages of the proposed approach over the previous CSC-SR and other state-of-the-art SR methods."
