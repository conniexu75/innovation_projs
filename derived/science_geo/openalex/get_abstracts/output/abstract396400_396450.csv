https://openalex.org/W2014459126,"Upon mitochondrial depolarization, Parkin, a Parkinson disease-related E3 ubiquitin ligase, translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria and promotes their degradation by mitophagy, a selective type of autophagy. Here, we report that in addition to mitophagy, Parkin mediates proteasome-dependent degradation of outer membrane proteins such as Tom20, Tom40, Tom70, and Omp25 of depolarized mitochondria. By contrast, degradation of the inner membrane and matrix proteins largely depends on mitophagy. Furthermore, Parkin induces rupture of the outer membrane of depolarized mitochondria, which also depends on proteasomal activity. Upon induction of mitochondrial depolarization, proteasomes are recruited to mitochondria in the perinuclear region. Neither proteasome-dependent degradation of outer membrane proteins nor outer membrane rupture is required for mitophagy. These results suggest that Parkin regulates degradation of outer and inner mitochondrial membrane proteins differently through proteasome- and mitophagy-dependent pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2103484524,"Aberrant signaling of ErbB family members human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is implicated in many human cancers, and HER2 expression is predictive of human disease recurrence and prognosis. Small molecule kinase inhibitors of EGFR and of both HER2 and EGFR have received approval for the treatment of cancer. We present the first high resolution crystal structure of the kinase domain of HER2 in complex with a selective inhibitor to understand protein activation, inhibition, and function at the molecular level. HER2 kinase domain crystallizes as a dimer and suggests evidence for an allosteric mechanism of activation comparable with previously reported activation mechanisms for EGFR and HER4. A unique Gly-rich region in HER2 following the α-helix C is responsible for increased conformational flexibility within the active site and could explain the low intrinsic catalytic activity previously reported for HER2. In addition, we solved the crystal structure of the kinase domain of EGFR in complex with a HER2/EGFR dual inhibitor (TAK-285). Comparison with previously reported inactive and active EGFR kinase domain structures gave insight into the mechanism of HER2 and EGFR inhibition and may help guide the design and development of new cancer drugs with improved potency and selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2085407582,"Monoglyceride lipase (MGL) influences energy metabolism by at least two mechanisms. First, it hydrolyzes monoacylglycerols (MG) into fatty acids and glycerol. These products can be used for energy production or synthetic reactions. Second, MGL degrades 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), the most abundant endogenous ligand of cannabinoid receptors (CBR). Activation of CBR affects energy homeostasis by central orexigenic stimuli, by promoting lipid storage, and by reducing energy expenditure. To characterize the metabolic role of MGL in vivo, we generated an MGL-deficient mouse model (MGL-ko). These mice exhibit a reduction in MG hydrolase activity and a concomitant increase in MG levels in adipose tissue, brain, and liver. In adipose tissue, the lack of MGL activity is partially compensated by hormone-sensitive lipase. Nonetheless, fasted MGL-ko mice exhibit reduced plasma glycerol and triacylglycerol, as well as liver triacylglycerol levels indicative for impaired lipolysis. Despite a strong elevation of 2-AG levels, MGL-ko mice exhibit normal food intake, fat mass, and energy expenditure. Yet mice lacking MGL show a pharmacological tolerance to the CBR agonist CP 55,940 suggesting that the elevated 2-AG levels are functionally antagonized by desensitization of CBR. Interestingly, however, MGL-ko mice receiving a high fat diet exhibit significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in comparison with wild-type controls despite equal weight gain. In conclusion, our observations implicate that MGL deficiency impairs lipolysis and attenuates diet-induced insulin resistance. Defective degradation of 2-AG does not provoke cannabinoid-like effects on feeding behavior, lipid storage, and energy expenditure, which may be explained by desensitization of CBR."
https://openalex.org/W2045821670,"The induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; Hmox1) by inflammation, for instance in sepsis, is associated both with an anti-inflammatory response and with mitochondrial biogenesis. Here, we tested the idea that HO-1, acting through the Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) transcription factor, links anti-inflammatory cytokine expression to activation of mitochondrial biogenesis. HO-1 induction after LPS stimulated anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) expression in mouse liver, human HepG2 cells, and mouse J774.1 macrophages but blunted tumor necrosis factor-α expression. This was accompanied by nuclear Nfe2l2 accumulation and led us to identify abundant Nfe2l2 and other mitochondrial biogenesis transcription factor binding sites in the promoter regions of IL10 and IL1Ra compared with pro-inflammatory genes regulated by NF-κΒ. Mechanistically, HO-1, through its CO product, enabled these transcription factors to bind the core IL10 and IL1Ra promoters, which for IL10 included Nfe2l2, nuclear respiratory factor (NRF)-2 (Gabpa), and MEF2, and for IL1Ra, included NRF-1 and MEF2. In cells, Hmox1 or Nfe2l2 RNA silencing prevented IL-10 and IL-1Ra up-regulation, and HO-1 induction failed post-LPS in Nfe2l2-silenced cells and post-sepsis in Nfe2l2−/− mice. Nfe2l2−/− mice compared with WT mice, showed more liver damage, higher mortality, and ineffective CO rescue in sepsis. Nfe2l2−/− mice in sepsis also generated higher hepatic TNF-α mRNA levels, lower NRF-1 and PGC-1α mRNA levels, and no enhancement of anti-inflammatory Il10, Socs3, or bcl-xL gene expression. These findings disclose a highly structured transcriptional network that couples mitochondrial biogenesis to counter-inflammation with major implications for immune suppression in sepsis.

These findings suggest the hypothesis that HO-1/CO, acting through Nfe2l2, links anti-inflammatory gene expression to the transcriptional program for mitochondrial biogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated HO-1 and Nfe2l2 regulation and causal activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and anti-inflammation in cells challenged with LPS and in mice challenged with Escherichia coli sepsis. We also specifically investigated IL-10 and sIL-1Ra gene regulation by Nfe2l2 and other transcription factors of mitochondrial biogenesis, and in mice in sepsis, we also measured hepatic anti-inflammatory Socs3 and bcl-xL genes to check for their association with the mitochondrial biogenesis program. Evidence of an expanded network would signify the coupling of mitochondrial biogenesis to immune counter-regulation and implicate the genetic response to mitochondrial damage/repair as a factor in the apparent immune paralysis encountered in sepsis. Primary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology unless otherwise specified; secondary antibodies, including antibodies for fluorescence microscopy, were from Invitrogen. siRNA oligonucleotides were from Ambion. Mouse recombinant TNF-α, IL-10, E. coli LPS, and dichloromethane (DCM) were from Sigma. Human HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in 5% CO2 in RMPI 1640 (Hyclone) containing 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Studies were conducted in murine J774.1 macrophages (ATCC) at 85% confluence in RPMI 1640 supplemented with FCS. Both cell lines were exposed to LPS at 15 ng/ml and exposed to CO using the CO-producing molecule dichloromethane (DCM/CO; 50–100 μm), which generates CO through the cytochrome P450 system. Cells were transfected with scrambled (negative control) or targeted siRNA using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) to achieve efficiencies of >70%. The studies were approved by the Duke Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. WT male C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory) and Nfe2l2−/− mice (RIKEN) on a C57BL/6 background were used at 12–16 weeks of age. They were inoculated with 107 or 108 CFU live E. coli (serotype 086a:K61, ATCC, Rockville, MD) by peritoneal fibrin clot implantation followed by 1.5 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl. This model activates hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis (37Suliman H.B. Welty-Wolf K.E. Carraway M.S. Schwartz D.A. Hollingsworth J.W. Piantadosi C.A.

At the appropriate times, mice were killed by isofluorane, and the livers were harvested and frozen at −80 °C. Fresh livers were flushed with 0.9% cold NaCl, perfusion-fixed with 10% formalin, and divided into lobes. After 24 h, the livers were transferred to 70% ethanol and stored at 4 °C. The lobes were block-cut and embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm sections were randomly cut and stained with H&E and photographed at 200×. Mouse and human IL10 promoter loci were aligned, and DNA sequence homology was computed with the web-based Regulatory Visualization Tools for Alignment (rVISTA; www.gsd.lbl.gov/vista) (44Loots G.G.

Promoter analysis was performed with consensus transcription factor binding sequences located with DNASIS (Hitachi Software; Alameda, CA) and confirmed with MatInspector (Genomatix Software; München, Germany). Predicted binding sites for Nfe2l2/Nrf2 (accession no. NM_006164 (human); accession no. NM_010902 (mouse)), MEF2A (myocyte enhancer factor 2A, accession no. NM_001130926 (human); accession no.

Transcriptional activation of Nfe2l2 and MEF2A was measured using the TRANS-AM kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). ChIP assays were performed with ChIP-IT and Re-ChIP-IT kits (Active Motif) following the manufacturer's protocol (42Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Ali A.S. Reynolds C.M. Welty-Wolf K.E. Piantadosi C.A.

Reactions were stopped in 0.125 m glycine, the samples were centrifuged twice, and the final pellet was suspended in ChIP buffer. Genomic DNA was sheared by sonication, and lysates were tumbled overnight at 4 °C with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose and anti-RNA polymerase II (Re-ChIP-IT), anti-MEF2, anti-Nfe2l2, and anti-NRF-1 (Cell Signaling) or normal rabbit IgG. Complexes were precipitated, washed, and eluted with 1% SDS and 100 mm NaHCO3. After reversal of protein/DNA cross-linking, DNA was purified and amplified across the IL10 and IL1Ra promoter regions of interest. ChIP samples were normalized to input chromatin (ΔCt) and enrichment defined as change in Ct in treated versus untreated samples (ΔCt), relative to IgG controls. Liver homogenate, cell lysate, and nuclear extract proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were performed. After the transfer, primary and secondary antibodies were applied, and the signals were developed using ECL. Blots were quantified in the mid-dynamic range, and the protein density was expressed relative to stable reference proteins. For immunochemistry, cells were grown in one-well chamber slides to ∼70% confluence. After reagent additions, the cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and washed with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were labeled with primary antibodies to HO-1 (1:1000) and MEF2 (catalog no. sc-55500; 1:800). Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Nikon H550S microscope (46Suliman H.B. Sweeney T.E. Withers C.M. Piantadosi C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 2565-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We performed qRT-PCR on an ABI PRISM 7000 system with TaqMan gene expression and premix assays (Applied Biosystems). 18 S rRNA served as an endogenous control. Quantification of gene expression was determined using the comparative threshold cycle CT and RQ method. The mt DNA copy number was determined by quantitative PCR using SYBR Green and the ABI system (42Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Ali A.S. Reynolds C.M. Welty-Wolf K.E. Piantadosi C.A. J. Clin.

Grouped data are expressed as means ± S.E. for replicates of four to six. Significance was tested by an unpaired t test or with two-way analysis of variance using commercial software unless indicated otherwise. Statistical significance required p < 0.05. HO-1 induction does not invariably stimulate IL10, so we confirmed that its CO product increases IL-10 mRNA levels in mouse liver, HepG2 cells, and J774.1 macrophages. In C57/BL/6 mice, 1 h of CO breathing (250 or 500 ppm) increased hepatic IL-10 mRNA levels by ∼60% at 24 h (Fig. 1A). In HepG2 cells, DCM/CO at low μm levels doubled IL-10 mRNA content by 24 h (Fig. 1B). Comparably, LPS stimulated IL-10 production, and LPS + DCM/CO produced an additive effect. In J774.1 cells, IL-10 mRNA levels followed the same patterns, including after LPS + DCM/CO (data not shown). Dose- and time-dependent increases in hepatic IL-10 and HO-1 protein levels after CO administration were documented by Western blot (Fig. 1, C and D). In an E. coli peritonitis model in mice, hepatic HO-1 protein levels were also significantly up-regulated at 24 h (Fig. 1E). IL-10 was constitutive and strongly up-regulated in sepsis but well after TNF-α production. In HepG2 cells, DCM/CO or LPS challenge up-regulated HO-1 and IL-10 protein expression by 1–6 h. Peak responses for both occurred 24 h after these exposures (Fig. 2A). LPS + DCM/CO significantly enhanced HO-1 and IL-10 induction compared with either alone, whereas IL-10 up-regulation was blocked by Hmox1 RNA silencing (Fig. 2A). HO-1 was thus required for increased IL-10 expression by DCM/CO and LPS. IL-10 (10 ng/ml) also induced cellular HO-1 expression within 6 h (Fig. 2A). To show that LPS and CO up-regulate the transcriptional program of mitochondrial biogenesis in HepG2 cells, we measured protein for NRF-1 and the mitochondrial transcription factor A (Fig. 2B). Both proteins responded to both stimuli in a pattern similar to that of IL-10. IL-10 administration in HepG2 cells inhibited the LPS induction of TNF-α and nitric oxide synthase-2, but IL-10 suppression of TNF-α and nitric oxide synthase-2 was reduced markedly by Hmox1 RNA silencing (Fig. 2C). The same result was obtained in J774.1 cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that HO-1/CO is required for IL-10 to inhibit the LPS response. In macrophages, IL-10 is associated with the anti-inflammatory molecule sIL-1Ra (15Lai C.F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Jurlander J. Hawley T.S. Carson W.E. Kordula T. Caligiuri M.A. Hawley R.G. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13968-13975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which could also connect counter-inflammation to mitochondrial biogenesis. We assessed hepatic sIL-1Ra mRNA levels in mice 24 h after CO exposure (250 or 500 ppm for 1 h) and demonstrated a pattern of induction similar to that of IL-10 (Fig. 3A). In the liver (90), sIL-1Ra protein levels after CO exposure corroborated the mRNA data; the protein increased significantly compared with controls (Fig. 3A). In HepG2 and in J774.1 cells, sIL-1Ra protein increased in response to LPS and to DCM/CO with a greater effect of LPS in J774.1 cells and DCM/CO in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). The use of both agents had additive effects in both cell lines. Hmox1 or Nfe2l2 RNA silencing diminished the sIL-1Ra responses to the stimuli equally (Fig. 3, B and C). These results imply that CO and LPS elicit anti-inflammatory cytokine expression through multiple and overlapping but not identical transcriptional elements. A common induction pattern for IL-10 transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis by CO and LPS raised the prospect of a common regulatory pathway, for instance through Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) signaling (42Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Ali A.S. Reynolds C.M. Welty-Wolf K.E. Piantadosi C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3730-3741PubMed Google Scholar), which increases both HO-1 (48Piantadosi C.A. Carraway M.S. Suliman H.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and IL-10 expression. We used multiple approaches to examine the role of Nfe2l2 as well as other transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis in IL10 and IL1Ra gene regulation. A computer analysis of the human and mouse promoters using MatInspector and the TRANSFAC database (Genomatix Software) detected putative binding sites for Nfe2l2 and at least three other relevant transcription factors: NRF-1, nuclear respiratory factor-2 (NRF-2), and MEF2. We aligned the IL10 promoter sequences with DNA Block Aligner (DNAsis software) to identify species-conserved regions that are most likely to represent functional elements (supplemental Fig. S1A). Putative binding sites for Nfe2l2, NRF-2 (Gabpa), and MEF2 were identified in the first 500 bp after the TATA box with >90% canonical consensus and >85% conservation scores. Using the same stringency, we identified putative binding sites on the IL1Ra promoter for NRF-1 and MEF2 (supplemental Fig. S1B). MEF2 has been associated with IL-10 expression, but HO-1/CO is not known to activate MEF2 genes. In the liver, MEF2A and -2D regulate cell activity and growth, e.g. in stellate cells (49Wang X. Tang X. Gong X. Albanis E. Friedman S.L. Mao Z. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1174-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and MEF2A is a target of NRF-1, which is activated by HO-1/CO (50Czubryt M.P. McAnally J. Fishman G.I. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although HO-1/CO activates Nfe2l2 (51Lee B.S. Heo J. Kim Y.M. Shim S.M. Pae H.O. Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), nothing addresses whether IL-10 expression depends on the other transcription factors. Preliminary studies indicated that hepatic nuclear Nfe2l2, MEF2, and NRF-2α (Gabpa) protein increase after CO breathing in mice; 1 h of CO increased all three nuclear proteins by 6 h (Fig. 4A). The peak effect was at 250 ppm, which we used subsequently. In HepG2 cells, DCM/CO also increased nuclear MEF2, Nfe2l2, and NRF-2 levels and was additive to the LPS effect (Fig. 4B). Hmox1 RNA silencing decreased nuclear Nfe2l2 and NRF-2 levels but only modestly decreased nuclear MEF2 levels (Fig. 4B). Nfe2l2 RNA silencing, however, sharply decreased nuclear MEF2 and slightly decreased NRF-2 levels (Fig. 4B). In J774.1 macrophages, Hmox1 silencing had a smaller effect than in HepG2 cells, whereas Nfe2l2 silencing had a similar effect in both cell lines (Fig. 4C). Replicate studies confirmed that Nfe2l2 silencing produced more attenuation of nuclear MEF and NRF-2 accumulation than did Hmox1 silencing. Transcription factor binding activities were measured in nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells for the Nfe2l2 and MEF2 sequences on the human IL10 promoter. These assays showed increased binding activity for both transcription factors after DCM/CO exposure (Fig. 5, A and B). The LPS-stimulated binding activity for both proteins was comparatively modest; by implication, LPS induction of IL-10 involves not only HO-1, but also other elements, e.g. NF-κΒ. Nfe2l2 and MEF2A nuclear translocation depends on phosphorylation, which is regulated, for instance, by Akt/PKB and p38 MAPK. NRF-1 translocation is also regulated by Akt/PKB. We evaluated the influence of p38 and Akt on the CO response in HepG2 cells with inhibition of p38 (SB203580; SB20) or PI-3K/Akt (LY294002; LY29). Activation of Nfe2l2 by DCM/CO was partly blocked by p38 inhibition, but fully abrogated by Akt inhibition. The effect of DCM/CO on MEF2 activation was blocked by inhibiting either kinase (Fig. 5, A and B). To determine how HO-1/CO promotes IL-10 transcription, we generated cross-linked nuclear lysates from HepG2 cells after a 60-min exposure to DCM/CO, LPS, or both. Sequential ChIP assay (ChIP-ReChIP) was performed on genomic DNA with anti-RNA polymerase II or with control IgG (data not shown) and probed for interactions with Nfe2l2, MEF2, and NRF-2 (Gabpa) at the human IL10 promoter. In control nuclei, almost no polymerase II signal was detected at the IL10 promoter, but the signal was increased by DCM/CO and LPS (Fig. 5C). The largest increases occurred after LPS + DCM/CO consistent with the changes in IL-10 mRNA expression. Chromatin IP assays were performed to evaluate IL10 promoter binding to MEF2, Nfe2l2, and NRF-2 using validated antibodies and primer sets for these sites. We also checked the IL1Ra promoter for NRF-1 and MEF2 binding at our predicted binding sites. IL10 promoter DNA did not co-precipitate with control IgG (Fig. 5D). ChIP assays for Nfe2l2 detected no transcription factor binding at the IL10 promoter in control or LPS-stimulated cells, but Nfe2l2 binding was detectable after DCM/CO (Fig. 5D). MEF2 and NRF-2 occupancy was minimal in control HepG2 nuclei, after DCM/CO and LPS, both factors were bound, and DCM +LPS produced stronger binding (Fig. 5D). IL1Ra promoter DNA did not precipitate with control IgG, and nonstimulated nuclei showed no MEF2 or NRF-1 binding, but both transcription factors bou"

Here, we report that expression of miR-205 is significantly suppressed in melanoma specimens when compared with nevi and is correlated inversely with melanoma progression. miRNA target databases predicted E2F1 and E2F5 as putative targets. The expression levels of E2F1 and E2F5 were correlated inversely with that of miR-205 in melanoma cell lines. miR-205 significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of reporter plasmids containing the 3'-UTR sequences complementary to either E2F1 or E2F5. Overexpression of miR-205 in melanoma cells reduced E2F1 and E2F5 protein levels. The proliferative capacity of melanoma cells was suppressed by miR-205 and mediated by E2F-regulated AKT phosphorylation. miR-205 overexpression resulted in induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by increased cleaved caspase-3, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and cytochrome c release. Stable overexpression of miR-205 suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor cell growth in vivo and induced a senescence phenotype accompanied by elevated expression of p16INK4A and other markers for senescence. E2F1 overexpression in miR-205-expressing cells partially reversed the effects on melanoma cell growth and senescence. These results demonstrate a novel role for miR-205 as a tumor suppressor in melanoma."

Misfolding of a protein molecule often leads to its insoluble aggregation, and the fibrillar aggregates rich in β-sheet structures are called amyloid, in particular (1Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Although some amyloid-like aggregates exhibit physiological functions such as synthesis of melanin (2Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V.

Indeed, genetic as well as proteomic analyses on human diseases have revealed increasing numbers of proteins that form inclusions in the affected tissues (for example, Ref. 5Aguzzi A. O'Connor T.

In the pathological inclusions, TDP-43 proteins form bundles of straight filaments (12Hasegawa M. Arai T. Nonaka T. Kametani F. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y. Beach T.G. Buratti E. Baralle F. Morita M.

Lee V.M. Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, however, simple overexpression of recombinant TDP-43 proteins did not produce sarkosyl-insoluble TDP-43 even with ALS-causing mutations, artificial mutations disturbing nuclear localization of TDP-43, or proteasomal inhibition (14Nonaka T. Arai T. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Akiyama H. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). C-terminal fragments of TDP-43 have been reported to form sarkosyl-insoluble aggregates in the cell, which is, however, observed only in the presence of a GFP tag (15Nonaka T. Kametani F. Arai T. Akiyama H. Hasegawa M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have found that HA-tagged C-terminal fragments of TDP-43 form inclusions in mouse neuroblastoma cells, Neuro2a, but those are sarkosyl-soluble. 4Y. Furukawa and N. Nukina, unpublished data. Although the pathogenic roles of TDP-43 aggregation in diseases remain obscure, no cultured cell models are currently available in which sarkosyl-insoluble TDP-43 aggregates are reproduced. In vitro TDP-43 is intrinsically aggregation-prone and is shown to form fibrillar aggregates (16Johnson B.S. Snead D. Lee J.J. McCaffery J.M. Shorter J. Gitler A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20329-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), whereas detergent solubility of the fibrils has not been fully examined. It is notable that in many proteins that can form insoluble fibrils in a test tube, simple overexpression in cells did not lead to the formation of aggregates. Formation of amyloid-like fibrils has often been compared with a crystallization process, in which preformed fibrils or “seeds” trigger fibrillar aggregation (17Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). In other words, a preformed fibril functions as a structural template to facilitate the recruitment of soluble proteins into insoluble fibrils. Indeed, in vitro aggregation of purified proteins usually arises after initial lag time during which no detectable aggregation occurs, but the lag time is dramatically reduced when seeds are included in the solution. Although there are significant amounts of amyloid-forming proteins overexpressed, the cultured cells may stay in the lag phase within a timescale of ordinary cell experiments. The protein aggregation in the cell would, therefore, be efficiently reproduced by introducing preformed fibrils into the cell as seeds. Actually, α-synuclein, which is a fibril-forming protein causative for Parkinson disease, did not form any inclusions in cultured cells, but intracellular α-synuclein aggregates appeared when α-synuclein fibrils in vitro are transduced into the cell (18Luk K.C. Song C. O'Brien P. Stieber A. Branch J.R. Brunden K.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20051-20056Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). It is hence possible that intracellular seeding reproduces and facilitates the formation of highly insoluble TDP-43 aggregates inside the cell. Here, we have first prepared a soluble and functional TDP-43 protein from its bacterial inclusions and then revealed that amyloid-like fibrillation of a full-length TDP-43 protein occurs through sarkosyl-resistant interactions in its C-terminal regions. We have further found that transduction of in vitro sarkosyl-insoluble TDP-43 fibrils in cultured cells triggers the aggregation of intracellular TDP-43 proteins; that is, a seeding reaction of TDP-43 occurs inside the cell. More importantly, intracellular TDP-43 aggregates produced by this seeding reaction were sarkosyl-insoluble and ubiquitinated, which reproduces the pathological changes of TDP-43. We thus propose that a seeding reaction of TDP-43 fibrils plays a key role in constructing experimental models to describe the pathological changes of TDP-43 molecules in neurodegenerative disorders. For preparation of TDP-43 proteins with an N-terminal His tag, cDNA of TDP-43 was cloned in a multiple cloning site (XhoI and BamHI) of a plasmid vector, pET15b (Novagen). After transfection of the plasmids in Escherichia coli (Rosetta), expression of His-tagged TDP-43 proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Following incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, all TDP-43 proteins in this study were obtained as inclusion bodies, which were redissolved in PBS containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and then purified with Ni2+ affinity chromatography using the Proteus IMAC Midi kit (Pro-Chem Inc.). The bound TDP-43 proteins were washed with a wash buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, and 6 m GdnHCl and then eluted from a spin column with an elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 125 mm imidazole, 6 m GdnHCl, pH 8.0). For preparation of soluble and refolded TDP-43, TDP-43 proteins unfolded in the elution buffer (400 μm) were 40-fold diluted with a buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm Na-Pi, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol (buffer A), which, however, produced significant amounts of precipitates. These insoluble materials were removed by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 30 min, and we thus recovered the soluble TDP-43 proteins in a supernatant fraction. Protein concentration was spectroscopically determined from the absorbance at 280 nm by using the following extinction coefficients: 44,920 cm−1 m−1, TDP-43FL; 26,930 cm−1 m−1, TDP-43N; 17,990 cm−1 m−1, TDP-43C; 25,440 cm−1 m−1, TDP-43N-1; 19,480 cm−1 m−1, TDP-432-C. TG- or AC-repeated DNA was modified with a biotin at the 5′-end (Operon Biotechnologies, Tokyo). To reduce retention of free single-stranded DNA, a nitrocellulose membrane (PROTRAN, 0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) was presoaked for 10 min in 0.4 m KOH, rinsed in H2O, and then equilibrated in buffer A for an hour before use (19Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The biotin-labeled TG- or AC-repeated DNA (biotin-(TG)12 or biotin-(AC)12, 0.1 μm) was incubated with soluble TDP-43 proteins (0.1–1.0 μm) in buffer A. After an hour at 37 °C, the mixture was filtered through a pretreated nitrocellulose membrane overlaid on a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, 0.45 μm, Amersham Biosciences) in a 96-well slot-blot apparatus. After extensive washing of membranes with buffer A, the bound DNAs were cross-linked to the membranes by shortwave ultraviolet radiation (UV Stratalinker, Stratagene). Followed by blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with streptavidin-HRP (Promega), and the biotin-labeled DNAs on the membranes were developed with the SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). To examine aggregation of TDP-43 proteins, 1 μm soluble TDP-43 protein in buffer A was set in a 96-well plate and shaken at 37 °C at 1,200 rpm (BioShaker MBR-024, TAITEC). Turbidity was monitored at every 30 min in a plate reader (ARVO MX, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by measuring absorbance around 405 nm. After agitation for 27 h, 25 μm thioflavin T was then added to the reaction mixture, and the fluorescence intensity was recorded by using a plate reader (ARVO MX) with a CW lamp filter (440 nm cutoff) and an emission filter (486 nm cutoff). Thioflavin T fluorescence before sample agitation was also examined. Final TDP-43 aggregates were obtained as a pellet fraction after ultracentrifugation of the reaction mixtures at 110,000 × g for 30 min. For a seeding reaction, TDP-43 aggregates were resuspended in H2O, sheared with ultrasonication, and then added to a solution of 3 μm soluble TDP-43 proteins in buffer A containing 25 μm thioflavin T. The fluorescence was monitored by using SpectraMax M2 (Molecular Devices) at intervals of 2 min with 442 and 485 nm of excitation and emission wavelength, respectively. No plate shaking was performed during the reactions. For morphological analysis, TDP-43 aggregates were first adsorbed on 400-mesh grids coated by a glow-charged supporting membrane. After washing with pure water, negative staining with 1% uranyl acetate was performed, and then images were obtained using an electron microscope (1200EX, JEOL). 22.5 μg of TDP-43 aggregates were first resuspended in 100 μl of a buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 and mixed with 5 μg of Pronase (Calbiochem). After incubation at 37 °C for an hour, the mixture was ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fraction was discarded. The pellets were washed once with 150 μl of 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 and redissolved in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 6 m GdnHCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, pH 8.0. After desalting by using NuTip C-18 (Glygen Corp.), samples were mixed with a matrix, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and MALDI-MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired using a 4800 Plus MALDI-TOF/TOF analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Identification of peptides based upon the observed m/z values was performed using MS-NonSpecific. All plasmids for expression of TDP-43 proteins in cultured cells were constructed using pIRESneo3 (Clontech). Namely, cDNAs of full-length TDP-43 (TDP-43FL) and a C-terminal truncate of TDP-43 (TDP-432-C) that were fused with a C-terminal HA tag were cloned in a multiple cloning site using AgeI and BamHI sites. Transduction of protein aggregates into cultured cells was performed by using the BioPORTER protein delivery reagent (Genlantis). On day 1, 1.2 × 105 cells of human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293T, in DMEM, 10% FBS were seeded on each well of a 12-well plate coated with polyethyleneimine and incubated at 37 °C. On the next day (day 2), 1.6 μg of plasmids was transfected per each well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 4 h of transfection, a culture medium was replaced with fresh DMEM, 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C. On day 3, a culture medium was changed to Opti-MEM 1 h before aggregate transduction. A dried film of BioPORTER was first dissolved with 50 μl of PBS containing 10 μm protein aggregates and then mixed with 450 μl of Opti-MEM. By using this aggregate/BioPORTER-containing Opti-MEM, the transfected cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The culture medium was then changed to DMEM, 0.5% FBS and again incubated at 37 °C overnight. On day 4, cells were harvested by PBS containing 1% sarkosyl with a protease inhibitor mixture, Complete, EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics). Following lysis with ultrasonication, lysates were ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min to separate into supernatant (a soluble fraction) and pellets (an insoluble fraction). The pellets were redissolved in a 2% SDS-containing PBS with the same volume with that of the corresponding supernatant. The protein concentration in supernatant was determined by BCA assay using BSA as a standard. Each of a soluble fraction containing 3 μg of total proteins and an insoluble fraction (10× volume of the corresponding soluble fraction) was mixed with an SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and loaded on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel (PAGEL, ATTO) after boiling for 5 min. Following electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted on a 0.2-μm PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-His probe (H-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin (DAKO, 1:1,000), or mouse anti-TDP-43 phospho-Ser-409/410 antibody (Cosmo Bio, 1:1,000). Corresponding secondary antibodies that are conjugated with HRP were used as follows: anti-rabbit (1:5,000) and anti-mouse (1:1,000) antibodies. Blots were developed with the SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and images were obtained using LAS1000 (Fujifilm). For immunostaining of HA-tagged TDP-43 proteins, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.12 m sucrose in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with anti-HA-fluorescein, high affinity (3F10) (1:100 dilution, Roche Diagnostics) in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for an hour, washed once with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washed twice with 0.1% BSA in PBS. For detection of ubiquitin, rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin mouse polyclonal ubiquitin (DAKO, 1:300) and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, 1:1,000) were used. Cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, 1:3,000 dilution) in PBS for 15 min and then washed twice with PBS and mounted onto glass slides. For visualization of TDP-432-C seeds added to cells, TDP-432-C aggregates were incubated in the presence of 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine with 1 mm Alexa Fluor 555 maleimide (Invitrogen) for an hour at room temperature. Modified aggregates were washed three times with PBS by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 30 min and used for transduction experiments. When modified aggregates were resolubilized in PBS containing 2% SDS and loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel, a red fluorescent band with a molecular weight corresponding to that of TDP-432-C was found (data not shown), which confirms the successful modification. Confocal images with a slice thickness of ∼1 μm were obtained by a laser scanning microscope of LSM5 Exciter system (Carl Zeiss, Germany) using a 40× objective lens. Obtained images were processed and analyzed by LSM image examiner (Carl Zeiss). Overexpression of recombinant human full-length TDP-43 (TDP-43FL) in E. coli has led to the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies, which can then be resolubilized in a buffer containing 6 m GdnHCl. Following 40-fold dilution and ultracentrifugation of resolubilized TDP-43FL in a GdnHCl-free buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”), we obtained at most a 2 μm solution of soluble TDP-43FL. To test whether our soluble TDP-43FL retains its physiological functions, the DNA binding ability of TDP-43FL was examined by filter binding assays (20Kuo P.H. Doudeva L.G. Wang Y.T. Shen C.K. Yuan H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) with some modifications (Fig. 1A). It has been known that TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein and preferentially recognizes TG/UG repeats of single-stranded DNA/RNA (21Buratti E. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36337-36343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts (0.1–1.0 μm) of soluble TDP-43FL were first mixed with either 0.1 μm biotin-labeled TG (biotin-(TG)12) or 0.1 μm biotin-labeled AC (biotin-(AC)12) repeats. Following incubation at 37 °C for an hour, the mixture was then filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane overlaid on a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+). In this assay method, free proteins and protein-DNA complexes are trapped on a nitrocellulose membrane, whereas free unbound DNAs flow through a nitrocellulose membrane but are trapped on a nylon membrane (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, increasing amounts of TDP-43FL shifted biotin-(TG)12 from a nylon to a nitrocellulose membrane, supporting the complex formation between TDP-43FL and biotin-(TG)12. In contrast, biotin-(AC)12 was detected only on a nylon membrane even in the highest TDP-43FL concentration (1 μm) among those tested, which is consistent with the fact that AC repeats are not the physiological target of TDP-43. It is also notable that no drastic changes of DNA binding were observed in TDP-43FL with ALS mutations (M337V and A382T). Based upon the intensities of blots, equal fractions of free and protein-bound TG repeats are expected between 0.1 and 0.5 μm TDP-43 (Fig. 1B). The dissociation constant of TDP-43FL with TG repeats can hence be roughly estimated as several hundred nm, which is comparable with that previously reported between truncated mouse TDP-43 and single-stranded (TG)6 repeats (∼100 nm) (20Kuo P.H. Doudeva L.G. Wang Y.T. Shen C.K. Yuan H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Taking these results together, our soluble WT as well as ALS mutant TDP-43FL proteins are functional to the extent that TDP-43FL selectively recognizes and binds a physiological substrate, TG-repeated DNA. Given that TDP-43 constitutes pathological inclusions observed in ALS patients (6Arai T. Hasegawa M. Akiyama H. Ikeda K. Nonaka T. Mori H. Mann D. Tsuchiya K. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y. Oda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 7Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. Feiden W. Kretzschmar H.A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar), we have next examined in vitro aggregation propensities of soluble WT as well as ALS mutant (M337V and A382T) TDP-43FL proteins. Constant agitation (shaking at 1,200 rpm) of a solution containing TDP-43FL increased its turbidity without a discernable lag phase (Fig. 2A), showing aggregation of TDP-43FL. Although effects of ALS mutations on TDP-43 aggregation are still controversial (16Johnson B.S. Snead D. Lee J.J. McCaffery J.M. Shorter J. Gitler A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20329-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), mutational differences could not be confirmed in the in vitro aggregation kinetics of TDP-43FL in our experimental conditions (Fig. 2A). After the turbidity change reached plateau, sample solutions were separated by ultracentrifugation into supernatant and pellets. As shown in Fig. 2B, WT as well as ALS mutant TDP-43FL proteins were detected only in the pellet fraction; furthermore, these TDP-43FL aggregates exhibited limited solubility in the presence of a detergent, sarkosyl. Soluble and functional TDP-43FL molecules are hence converted into sarkosyl-insoluble aggregates after constant agitation. We have further found that not soluble but aggregated TDP-43FL increases the fluorescence intensity of thioflavin T (ThT) (Fig. 2C). Although ThT becomes fluorescent upon binding to amyloid-like fibrillar structures (22LeVine 3rd, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar), the increase in its fluorescence intensity seems much smaller in TDP-43FL aggregates than those in the other protein aggregates such as SOD1 (23Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Yamanaka K. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22221-22231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This would confirm the previous observation that pathological TDP-43 inclusions are not well stained by amyloid binding dyes (24Kerman A. Liu H.N. Croul S. Bilbao J. Rogaeva E. Zinman L. Robertson J. Chakrabartty A. Acta Neuropathol. 2010; 119: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), although their morphology is expected to be fibrillar. Indeed, we have confirmed fibrillar morphologies of in vitro TDP-43FL aggregates by electron microscopic observation, where thin fibers appear to stack together and form big bundles (Fig. 2, D–F). There were no major differences in the aggregate morphologies between WT and ALS mutant (M337V and A382T) TDP-43FL. These data thus show that soluble and functional TDP-43FL forms insoluble amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates. In general, structures of fibrillar aggregates are composed of a protease-resistant core(s) and the associated “fuzzy coat” that is susceptible to proteolysis (23Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Yamanaka K. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22221-22231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Wischik C.M. Novak M. Thøgersen H.C. Edwards P.C. Runswick M.J. Jakes R. Walker J.E. Milstein C. Roth M. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 4506-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). To get structural insight into TDP-43 aggregates, we have attempted to identify a core region(s) of TDP-43FL aggregates. For that purpose, TDP-43FL aggregates were first treated with a nonspecific protease, Pronase, to remove the fuzzy coat regions. Then, resultant insoluble materials, which contain protease-resistant core(s) of TDP-43FL aggregates, were collected by ultracentrifugation, resolubilized with 6 m GdnHCl, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S1). TDP-43 is a multidomain protein with two central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal domains; based upon the observed mass with MS/MS analysis, the identified peptides are found to be mapped on a half of a TDP-43FL primary sequence from the end of the first RRM to the C terminus (Fig. 3A, supplemental Table S1). Although this is consistent with previous studies suggesting a role of the C-terminal auxiliary domain in TDP-43 aggregation in vitro (16Johnson B.S. Snead D. Lee J.J. McCaffery J.M. Shorter J. Gitler A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20329-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), these results suggest that a protease-resistant core in TDP-43FL aggregates extends to the region containing the second RRM domain. To further examine a primary role of a C-terminal half of TDP-43 in the aggregate formation, we have examined in vitro aggregation propensities of the following four TDP-43 truncates (Fig. 3A): TDP-43N, Met1–Lys251; TDP-43C, Gly252–His416; TDP-43N-1, Met1–Lys192; TDP-432-C, Val193–His416. As shown in Fig. 3B, all truncates except TDP-43N-1 become insoluble pellets after shaking at 1,200 rpm for 21 h, whereas TDP-43N-1 remains completely soluble. It is notable that a region between the first and second RRMs is found to be a part of the protease-resistant core of in vitro TDP-43FL aggregates (Fig. 3A); nonetheless, no aggregation of TDP-43N-1 (Fig. 3B), which covers a region between the first and second RRMs, suggests a limited role of this region in the aggregate formation. Instead, efficient aggregation of TDP-43N (Fig. 3B) supports our notion that, in addition to a C-terminal auxiliary domain, the second RRM is also involved in the aggregate formation of TDP-43FL. Indeed, TDP-432-C covering both the second RRM and a C-terminal domain can reproduce the aggregation behavior of TDP-43FL. Namely, a similar aggregation kinetics was observed between TDP-43FL (Fig. 2A) and TDP-432-C (supplemental Fig. S2A), both of which became completely insoluble and exhibited limited solubility in a sarkosyl-containing buffer at the end of the reaction (supplemental Fig. S2B). As in TDP-43FL, any mutational effects were also not evident on the aggregation kinetics of TDP-432-C. Aggregates of TDP-432-C (WT and ALS mutants) increased the intensity of ThT fluorescence, although its intensity was much higher (∼10-fold) than that of TDP-43FL aggregates (supplemental Fig. S2C). Aggregates of TDP-43FL and TDP-432-C, however, resemble each other in their morphologies; thin fibers are stacked to form big bundles (supplemental Fig. S2, D–F). A C-terminal half of TDP-43 (i.e. TDP-432-C) th"

Stroke. 2009; 40: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Other than ATP production, mitochondria participate in diverse cell signaling events and are essential organelles for cell survival. The oxidative phosphorylation machinery is composed of five complexes (complexes I–V). From Krebs cycle intermediates (NADH and FADH2), electrons feed into complex I or II and are transferred to complex III and then to complex IV and finally to the oxygen molecules. Energy released during the electron transfer is utilized to actively pump out proton from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, generating the electrochemical gradient of proton across the inner membrane, which is ultimately utilized by complex V to produce ATP (5Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). However, a small portion of electrons leaking from the electron transport chain (ETC), mostly at complex I and complex III, react with the oxygen molecule and yield superoxide anion, which can be converted into other reactive oxygen species (ROS). When ROS production overwhelms the endogenous antioxidant systems, they can potentially damage various cellular components, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. ROS is implicated in aging and various pathological processes and has been proposed as the key culprit for many neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, mitochondrial targeting strategies, such as free radical scavengers, mitochondrial signaling regulation, and ETC component supplementation, have been extensively studied (6Chaturvedi R.K. Beal M.F. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1147: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Galluzzi L. Blomgren K. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Disappointingly, none of these neuroprotective strategies has been proven successful in any neurological diseases in clinical trials (8O'Collins V.E. Macleod M.R. Donnan G.A. Horky L.L. van der Worp B.H. Howells D.W. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 9Olanow C.W. Kieburtz K. Schapira A.H. Ann. Neurol. 2008; 64: S101-S110PubMed Google Scholar).Methylene blue (MB) is a heterocyclic aromatic compound that has many biological and medical applications. It is an FDA-approved drug for methemoglobinemia and an antidote to cyanide poisoning. Previous publications have suggested that MB improves mitochondrial function (10Atamna H. Nguyen A. Schultz C. Boyle K. Newberry J. Kato H. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 11Tokumitsu Y. Ui M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 310-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that MB functions as an alternative electron carrier that efficiently shuttles electrons between NADH and cytochrome c (cyt c). This process reroutes electron transfer upon complex I and III inhibition, reduces electron leakage, and attenuates ROS overproduction. MB is protective in a rotenone-induced animal model of Parkinsonism and an animal model of ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion.DISCUSSIONNeuroprotection is a therapeutic approach that aims to prevent or attenuate neuronal degeneration and loss of function in neurological diseases. Neuroprotective strategies, including but not limited to free radical scavengers, ion channel modulators, and anti-inflammatory agents, have been extensively explored in the last 2 decades (19Ginsberg M.D. Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 363-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, despite promising results from preclinical studies, outcomes of clinical neuroprotection trials have been repeatedly disappointing (8O'Collins V.E. Macleod M.R. Donnan G.A. Horky L.L. van der Worp B.H. Howells D.W. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 20Löhle M. Reichmann H. J. Neurol. Sci. 2010; 289: 104-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction is a common pathological mechanism that underlines many neuropathological conditions. Endogenous ETC component supplementation, such as with coenzyme Q10, was explored for their neuroprotective effects (21Storch A. Jost W.H. Vieregge P. Spiegel J. Greulich W. Durner J. Müller T. Kupsch A. Henningsen H. Oertel W.H. Fuchs G. Kuhn W. Niklowitz P. Koch R. Herting B. Reichmann H. Arch. Neurol. 2007; 64: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Yang L. Calingasan N.Y. Wille E.J. Cormier K. Smith K. Ferrante R.J. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition, other identified neuroprotectants, such as estrogen, have been found to increase gene expression for many key components of the ETC complexes (23O'Lone R. Knorr K. Jaffe I.Z. Schaffer M.E. Martini P.G. Karas R.H. Bienkowska J. Mendelsohn M.E. Hansen U. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1281-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the consistent failure of all of these approaches has cast doubt on the current neuroprotective strategies. In the present study, we identified alternative mitochondrial electron transfer as a novel neuroprotective strategy. The alternative electron transfer through MB redox cycle bypasses the inhibition of ETC complex I and III and avoids overproduction of free radical, hence providing neuroprotection in both chronic and acute neurological diseases.Current evidence suggests that it is not the mitochondrial energy defect per se but rather the overproduction of ROS induced by blockage of mitochondrial complexes that accounts for the neurodegeneration in many neuropathological conditions (24Fukui H. Moraes C.T. Trends Neurosci. 2008; 31: 251-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Cassarino D.S. Fall C.P. Swerdlow R.H. Smith T.S. Halvorsen E.M. Miller S.W.

Genet. 2005; 14: 2749-2755Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In fact, cells can survive via many alternative mechanisms other than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, such as anaerobic glycolysis and autophagy. In our observation, complex IV (KCN) or complex V (oligomycin) inhibition reduces cell growth but does not convey direct cytotoxicity. Previous studies indicate that neither complex IV nor complex V is involved in electron leakage and ROS production (27Ladiges W. Wanagat J. Preston B. Loeb L. Rabinovitch P. Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Ganguly A. Basu S. Chakraborty P. Chatterjee S. Sarkar A. Chatterjee M. Choudhuri S.K. PloS One. 2010; 5: e11253Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We found that inhibition of complex IV or V induced anaerobic glycolytic activity and lactate production, which compensated for the decrease of ATP production (data not shown). On the other hand, complex I/III blockage directly cause the leakage of electrons, which react oxygen molecules, lead to ROS generation, and induce cytotoxicity. Thus, an alternative electron transfer pathway can bypass complex I/III blockage, avoid ROS production, and provide neuroprotection.MB has a very low redox potential of 11 mV and is very efficient cycling between oxidized and reduced forms (10Atamna H. Nguyen A. Schultz C. Boyle K. Newberry J. Kato H. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the current study, we determined the action of MB in ETC complex activities. Our results demonstrated that MB functions as an alternative electron carrier similar to the endogenous coenzyme Qs in mitochondrial ETC. On the other hand, MB-mediated electron transfer is insensitive to either rotenone or antimycin A inhibition, suggesting that MB provides an alternative route for electron transfer. Upon the completion of the redox cycle (MB → MBH2 → MB), electrons from NADH are delivered to cyt c in an alternate route that is insensitive to complex I and III blockage. Such a mechanism is further confirmed by a de novo synthesized MB derivative with the disabled redox center by N-acetylation. Acetyl-MB completely lost its ability to enhance electron transfer between complex I and III. The alternative electron transfer through MB prevents the “electron leakage” induced by complex I/III inhibition and avoids the massive ROS production during complex I/III inhibition (Fig. 10).In cell cultures, MB provides protection against mitochondrial inhibition-induced ROS overproduction, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytotoxicity. Given the high enzymatic efficacy and potency, the alternative electron transfer strategy requires much lower concentrations for neuroprotection as compared with the traditional free radical scavengers. Consistently, the neuroprotective effects of MB occur at very low concentrations with an EC50 of 0.1762 nm against glutamate toxicity in HT22 cells. Therefore, the alternative electron transfer strategy is fundamentally different from traditional free radical scavenger approach. Rather, it avoids the production of ROS by rerouting electron transfer and bypasses complex I/III inhibition. Indeed, MB failed to provide protection against direct hydrogen peroxide insult even with much higher concentrations.We further determined the effects of this novel neuroprotective strategy in animal models of PD and ischemic stroke. From both epidemiological (29Dhillon A.S. Tarbutton G.L. Levin J.L. Plotkin G.M. Lowry L.K. Nalbone J.T. Shepherd S. J.

Moreover, two genetic causes of PD, mutations in Parkin and PINK1, have been associated with defective complex I activity (1Liu W. Vives-Bauza C. Acín-Peréz R. Yamamoto A. Tan Y. Li Y. Magrané J.

Consistently, overexpression of NDI1, a yeast gene encoding a single subunit rotenone-insensitive NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, in rodents could prevent respiratory deficiencies and attenuate Parkinson-like symptoms in animals treated with rotenone or MPTP (36Seo B.B.

Our in vivo studies indicated that MB attenuates complex I inhibition-induced neurodegeneration in dopaminergic neurons and provides protection against rotenone-induced Parkinson-like behavioral, neurochemical, and neuropathological features.The role of ROS in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury is well known. Reperfusion produces a burst in ROS formation after cerebral ischemia and has been known as one of the major mechanisms by which reperfusion worsens ischemic damage (37Schaller B. Graf R. J Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2004; 24: 351-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Antioxidant has been viewed as one of the most promising neuroprotective strategies for the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, the failure of the SAINT II trial has raised concerns regarding the traditional free radical trapping strategy (38Diener H.C. Lees K.R. Lyden P. Grotta J. Davalos A. Davis S.M. Shuaib A. Ashwood T. Wasiewski W. Alderfer V. Hårdemark H.G. Rodichok L. Stroke. 2008; 39: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Instead of neutralizing the free radical, the alternative electron transfer strategy blocked the overproduction of ROS generated by the inhibition of ETC complex I and III. In addition, our study demonstrated that MB increases the oxygen consumption rate and decreases the extracellular acidification rate, which could potentially prevent the superoxide production derived from the excessive oxygen supply during the reperfusion. Consistently, our in vivo study demonstrated that MB, as an alternative electron carrier, significantly decreased the cerebral ischemia reperfusion damage induced by transient focal cerebral ischemia.There are other considerations for the role of alternative electron transfer in mitochondrial functions. The mitochondrial ETC removes electrons from an electron donor (NADH or FADH2) and passes them to a terminal electron acceptor (O2) via a series of redox reactions. These reactions are coupled to the creation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which functions as the direct driving force for ATP synthesis. In ETC, complexes I, III, and IV function as the proton pumps. An alternate route to ETC could bypass the proton pump function in these complexes and might reduce the efficiency of ATP production. However, our study demonstrated that MB could enhance ATP production, suggesting that MB does not comprise the function of complexes I, III, and IV as proton pumps.In addition to the capacity as an alternative electron carrier, many other functions of MB have previously been described. It was shown that MB can delay senescence and extend the life span of human IMR90 fibroblasts in tissue culture (10Atamna H. Nguyen A. Schultz C. Boyle K. Newberry J. Kato H. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has also been indicated that MB can penetrate the blood brain barrier, increase cyt c oxidase (complex IV) activity, improve cognitive function in rats (39Callaway N.L. Riha P.D. Bruchey A.K. Munshi Z. Gonzalez-Lima F. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2004; 77: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and protect against methylmalonate-induced seizures (40Furian A.F. Fighera M.R.

As a century-old drug, MB has been in medical use for many years in various pathological conditions (41Naylor G.J. Martin B. Hopwood S.E. Watson Y. Biol.

Res. 1999; 25: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, MB was reported to attenuate Tau aggregation, and it is currently in phase II clinical trials for treatment of Alzheimer disease. Many other activities have also been demonstrated with MB, including inhibition of nitric-oxide synthase (49Marczin N. Ryan U.S. Catravas J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 170-179PubMed Google Scholar, 50Mayer B. Brunner F. Schmidt K. Eur. Heart J. 1993; 14: 22-26PubMed Google Scholar) and monoamine oxidase A (51Ramsay R.R. Dunford C. Gillman P.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which may also contribute to the illustrated neuroprotective action. However, some of these functions might be secondary to the currently described mitochondrial mechanism and warrant further investigation.In summary, we have identified a novel neuroprotective strategy represented by MB in the present study. We have demonstrated that MB could function as an electron carrier and provide an alternative electron transfer along ETC, avoid ROS overproduction induced by ETC blockage, and maintain mitochondrial function. We have tested this novel neuroprotective strategy in two animal models of neurological diseases. In an animal model of Parkinsonism, MB was able to attenuate rotenone-induced motor deficits and nigral-dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. In an ischemic stroke model, MB significantly reduced cerebral ischemia reperfusion damage. Considering that MB has been in clinical use for over a century with few known side effects, the identified novel neuroprotective strategy of alternative electron transfer is now ready for testing in clinical settings and might lead to the discovery of promising treatments for the mitochondria dysfunction-related neurological diseases, such as PD and stroke. IntroductionMitochondria are the powerhouses and the major source of free radicals in almost all cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in numerous neuropathological diseases, including Parkinson disease (PD) 2The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; AD, Alzheimer disease; MB, methylene blue; MBH2, leucomethylene blue; ETC, electron transport chain; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ICA, internal carotid artery; DCFH2, 2,7-dichlorofluorescin; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; OCR, oxygen consumption rate; ECAR, extracellular acidification rate; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; cyt c, cytochrome c; Veh/Sal, vehicle/saline; ROT/Sal, rotenone/saline; ROT/MB, rotenone/MB; ICA, internal carotid artery; ANOVA, analysis of variance; DOPAC, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; VTA, ventral tegmental area; SNC, substantia nigra pars compacta.

Stroke. 2009; 40: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Other than ATP production, mitochondria participate in diverse cell signaling events and are essential organelles for cell survival. The oxidative phosphorylation machinery is composed of five complexes (complexes I–V). From Krebs cycle intermediates (NADH and FADH2), electrons feed into complex I or II and are transferred to complex III and then to complex IV and finally to the oxygen molecules. Energy released during the electron transfer is utilized to actively pump out proton from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, generating the electrochemical gradient of proton across the inner membrane, which is ultimately utilized by complex V to produce ATP (5Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). However, a small portion of electrons leaking from the electron transport chain (ETC), mostly at complex I and complex III, react with the oxygen molecule and yield superoxide anion, which can be converted into other reactive oxygen species (ROS). When ROS production overwhelms the endogenous antioxidant systems, they can potentially damage various cellular components, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. ROS is implicated in aging and various pathological processes and has been proposed as the key culprit for many neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, mitochondrial targeting strategies, such as free radical scavengers, mitochondrial signaling regulation, and ETC component supplementation, have been extensively studied (6Chaturvedi R.K. Beal M.F. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1147: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Galluzzi L. Blomgren K. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Disappointingly, none of these neuroprotective strategies has been proven successful in any neurological diseases in clinical trials (8O'Collins V.E. Macleod M.R. Donnan G.A.

It is an FDA-approved drug for methemoglobinemia and an antidote to cyanide poisoning. Previous publications have suggested that MB improves mitochondrial function (10Atamna H. Nguyen A. Schultz C. Boyle K. Newberry J. Kato H. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 11Tokumitsu Y. Ui M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 310-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that MB functions as an alternative electron carrier that efficiently shuttles electrons between NADH and cytochrome c (cyt c). This process reroutes electron transfer upon complex I and III inhibition, reduces electron leakage, and attenuates ROS overproduction. MB is protective in a rotenone-induced animal model of Parkinsonism and an animal model of ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion."

We measured the binding of NMO autoantibodies to AQP4 in human astrocyte-derived U87MG cells expressing M1 and/or M23 AQP4, or M23 mutants that do not form orthogonal array of particles (OAPs). Binding affinity was quantified by two-color fluorescence ratio imaging of cells stained with NMO serum or a recombinant monoclonal NMO autoantibody (NMO-rAb), together with a C terminus anti-AQP4 antibody. NMO-rAb titrations showed binding with dissociation constants down to 44 ± 7 nm. Different NMO-rAbs and NMO patient sera showed a wide variation in NMO-IgG binding to M1 versus M23 AQP4. Differences in binding affinity rather than stoichiometry accounted for M1 versus M23 binding specificity, with consistently greater affinity of NMO-IgG binding to M23 than M1 AQP4. Binding and OAP measurements in cells expressing different M1:M23 ratios or AQP4 mutants indicated that the differential binding of NMO-IgG to M1 versus M23 was due to OAP assembly rather than to differences in the M1 versus M23 N termini. Purified Fab fragments of NMO-IgG showed similar patterns of AQP4 isoform binding, indicating that structural changes in the AQP4 epitope upon array assembly, and not bivalent cross-linking of whole IgG, result in the greater binding affinity to OAPs.

https://openalex.org/W2032947455,"The JNK signaling cascade is critical for cellular responses to a variety of environmental and cellular stimuli. Although gene expression aspects of JNK signal transduction are well studied, there are minimal data on the physiological impact of JNK signaling. To bridge this gap, we investigated how JNK impacted physiology in HeLa cells. We observed that inhibition of JNK activity and JNK silencing with siRNA reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during anisomycin-induced stress in HeLa cells. Silencing p38 had no significant impact on ROS generation under anisomycin stress. Moreover, JNK signaling mediated amplification of ROS production during stress. Mitochondrial superoxide production was shown to be the source of JNK-induced ROS amplification, as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor demonstrated little impact on JNK-mediated ROS generation. Using mitochondrial isolation from JNK null fibroblasts and targeting the mitochondrial scaffold of JNK, Sab, we demonstrated that mitochondrial JNK signaling was responsible for mitochondrial superoxide amplification. These results suggest that cellular stress altered mitochondria, causing JNK to translocate to the mitochondria and amplify up to 80% of the ROS generated largely by Complex I. This work demonstrates that a sequence of events exist for JNK mitochondrial signaling whereby ROS activates JNK, thereby affecting mitochondrial physiology, which can have effects on cell survival and death."

https://openalex.org/W2048898883,"P4-ATPases have been implicated in the transport of lipids across cellular membranes. Some P4-ATPases are known to associate with members of the CDC50 protein family. Previously, we have shown that the P4-ATPase ATP8A2 purified from photoreceptor membranes and reconstituted into liposomes catalyzes the active transport of phosphatidylserine across membranes. However, it was unclear whether ATP8A2 functioned alone or as a complex with a CDC50 protein. Here, we show by mass spectrometry and Western blotting using newly generated anti-CDC50A antibodies that CDC50A is associated with ATP8A2 purified from photoreceptor membranes. ATP8A2 expressed in HEK293T cells assembles with endogenous or expressed CDC50A, but not CDC50B, to generate a heteromeric complex that actively transports phosphatidylserine and to a lesser extent phosphatidylethanolamine across membranes. Chimera CDC50 proteins in which various domains of CDC50B were replaced with the corresponding domains of CDC50A were used to identify domains important in the formation of a functional ATP8A2-CDC50 complex. These studies indicate that both the transmembrane and exocytoplasmic domains of CDC50A are required to generate a functionally active complex. The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CDC50A appears to play a direct role in the reaction cycle. Mutagenesis studies further indicate that the N-linked oligosaccharide chains of CDC50A are required for stable expression of an active ATP8A2-CDC50A lipid transport complex. Together, our studies indicate that CDC50A is the β-subunit of ATP8A2 and is crucial for the correct folding, stable expression, export from endoplasmic reticulum, and phosphatidylserine flippase activity of ATP8A2.

Several cellular studies indicate that CDC50 proteins play a crucial role in the export of specific P4-ATPases from the ER of cells (14Saito K. Fujimura-Kamada K. Furuta N. Kato U. Umeda M. Tanaka K.

CDC50 proteins also have been suggested to play a direct role in the reaction cycle of P4-ATPases (20Lenoir G. Williamson P. Puts C.F. Holthuis J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17956-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Bryde S. Hennrich H. Verhulst P.M. Devaux P.F. Lenoir G. Holthuis J.C. J. Biol.

In yeast, the P4-ATPase Drs2p requires Cdc50p for phosphorylation of the key aspartate residue involved in the ATPase catalytic reaction. The affinity of Drs2p for Cdc50p was also found to change during the transport cycle. Additionally, phosphorylation of the catalytically important aspartate residue of the human P4-ATPases, ATP8B1 and ATP8B2, was dependent on the CDC50 subunit. On the basis of these studies, it has been proposed that the CDC50 proteins serve as the β-subunit of P4-ATPases akin to the β-subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase (9Puts C.F. Holthuis J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, although an association between the catalytic subunit of P4-ATPases and CDC50 proteins has been observed in heterologous cell expression systems, their direct association in mammalian tissues has not been demonstrated, and the domains of CDC50 proteins responsible for their interaction with P4-ATPases have yet to be determined. Recently, we have purified, localized, and characterized the functional properties of mammalian ATP8A2, a member of the P4-ATPase family that shares a 67% amino acid sequence identity with ATP8A1, the founding member of mammalian P4-ATPases (5Coleman J.A. Kwok M.C. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32670-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). ATP8A2 expression was detected in the retina, testes, and brain (5Coleman J.A. Kwok M.C. Molday R.S. J. Biol.

In the retina, ATP8A2 is localized in the outer segment compartment of rod and cone photoreceptors where it functions in the transport of PS 3The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; ROS, rod outer segments; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl; NBD-PS, 1-oleoyl-2-{6-[7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl}-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine; NBD-PE, 1-oleoyl-2-{6-[7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl}-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; NBD-PC, 1-oleoyl-2-{6-[7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl}-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; AMP-PNP, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TM, transmembrane; ECD, exocytoplasmic domain. and to a lesser extent PE across the photoreceptor disc membrane (5Coleman J.A. Kwok M.C. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32670-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In a proteomic study, unique peptides belonging to CDC50A were detected in photoreceptor outer segment preparations (22Kwok M.C. Holopainen J.M. Molday L.L. Foster L.J. Molday R.S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1053-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but the possible association of CDC50A with ATP8A2 was not investigated. In this study, we show that ATP8A2 is present as a heteromeric complex with CDC50A in photoreceptor outer segments as well as HEK293T cells expressing ATP8A2. Co-expression of ATP8A2 with CDC50A, but not CDC50B, not only promotes the translocation of ATP8A2 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi but also significantly enhances the yield of a functional ATP8A2-CDC50A aminophospholipid transporter. Chimera proteins in which various domains of CDC50B have been replaced with corresponding domains of CDC50A have been used to define regions of CDC50A that are required for the formation of a functionally active ATP8A2-CDC50A complex. Finally, we have investigated the effect of N-linked glycosylation of CDC50A on the stable expression, subunit association, and functional properties of the ATP8A2-CDC50A complex. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-ethanolamine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine, l-α-phosphatidylcholine (egg, chicken), C6 NBD-PS, C6 NBD-PE, and C6 NBD-PC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). ATP, AMP-PNP, sodium orthovanadate, and n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside were purchased from Sigma, dithionite was from Fisher (Waltham, MA), CHAPS was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH), and the synthetic 6C11 and 7F4 peptides, Ac-RDRLLKRLS and Ac-AKDEVDGGP, respectively, were purchased from Biomatik (Cambridge, Canada). Complete inhibitor was from Roche Applied Science. The Rho 1D4 antibody was obtained from UBC-UILO (Vancouver, Canada), and the 1D4 peptide was from the Nucleic Acid Protein Service Unit (Vancouver, Canada). The restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). The primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The compositions of the buffers were as follows: Buffer A: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mg/ml egg PC, complete inhibitor; Buffer B: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mg/ml egg PC; Buffer C, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.75% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.5 mg/ml egg PC; Buffer D: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CHAPS, and 1 mm DTT; Buffer E: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 5 mg/ml egg PC, 10% sucrose; Buffer F: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% sucrose; and PBS: 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl. Bovine Atp8a2 containing a 1D4 tag in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was described previously (5Coleman J.A. Kwok M.C. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32670-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This construct was used as a PCR template to generate each Atp8a2 construct described. The cDNA of bovine Cdc50a (IMAGE: 8284976) and human Cdc50b (IMAGE: 8322611) were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Restriction sites and epitope tags were introduced by PCR. Full-length Atp8a2 without a tag was PCR-amplified and cloned into pcDNA3 using BamHI and NotI restriction sites. Full-length Cdc50a with a 1D4 or Myc tag was cloned into pcDNA3 using the HindIII and XhoI restrictions sites. Cdc50b with a 1D4 tag was also cloned into pcDNA3 using HindIII and XhoI sites. The 1D4-tagged constructs contained a 9-amino acid C-terminal tag (TETSQVAPA). The Myc-tagged constructs contained a 10-amino acid C-terminal tag (EQKLISEEDL). Chimeras of Cdc50a and Cdc50b were constructed from a 1D4-tagged Cdc50b construct that had been cloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector by EcoRI and NotI. Silent restriction sites were inserted into Cdc50b by mutagenesis to facilitate cloning of individual domains. The ECD chimera contained amino acids 1–57 and 301–351 of CDC50B and amino acids 73–308 of CDC50A. The ECD/TM chimera contained amino acids 1–33 and 341–351 of CDC50B and amino acids 49–348 of CDC50A. The ECD/TM/C chimera contained amino acids 1–33 of CDC50B and amino acids 49–361 of CDC50A. The N-terminal chimera contained amino acids 1–47 of CDC50A and amino acids 33–351 of CDC50B. The M1 chimera contained amino acids 1–33 and 55–351 of CDC50B and amino acids 49–69 of CDC50A. The M2 chimera contained amino acids 1–301 and 341–351 of CDC50B and amino acids 310–348 of CDC50A. The M1/M2 chimera contained amino acids 1–33, 55–301, and 341–351 of CDC50B and amino acids 49–69 and 310–348 of CDC50A. GST fusion constructs containing amino acids 1–40 and 194–283 of CDC50A were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare) using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Site-directed mutations were created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon, Huntsville, AL). RNA was isolated from tissues of 6-month-old C57/B6 mice and HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) using the guanidinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform method (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). Random primed cDNA was made using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare). Cdc50a, Cdc50b, and Cdc50c gene expression was measured using gene specific primers. GapdH was used as a loading control. GapdH PCRs were run for 25 cycles. The cdc50 genes were amplified for 25 cycles, and then 2 μl of the reaction was removed and reamplified for an additional 25 cycles. Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used for amplification, and the primers were annealed at 55 °C. Primer sequences are available (supplemental Table S1). Fragments of bovine CDC50A (amino acids 1–40 and 194–283) were cloned in frame with GST and expressed and purified from Escherichia coli BL21 on a glutathione-Sepharose-4B column (GE Healthcare). Hybridoma cell lines were generated from Swiss Webster mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) immunized with a mixture of the GST fusion proteins as previously described (24MacKenzie D. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7100-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were identified by screening for immunoreactivity against purified 1D4-tagged CDC50A protein expressed in HEK293T cells by ELISA. Immunoreactivity was confirmed on Western blots of bovine ROS. The epitope for the Cdc50–7F4 antibody was identified by measuring the reactivity of the antibody to a series of overlapping 9-amino acid N-terminal peptides using the SPOTs kit (Sigma). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1.25 μg/ml fungizone. HEK293T cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected at 30% confluence with 10 μg of pcDNA3 containing either Atp8a2 or Cdc50a by the calcium phosphate method (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar) and harvested 48 h later. In some cases, the cells were co-transfected with both Atp8a2 and Cdc50a by mixing 10 μg of each plasmid together followed by calcium phosphate precipitation. The membranes from HEK293T cells were prepared as described (26Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cos-7 cells (American Type Tissue Collection) were transfected in six-well plates containing polylysine-treated coverslips with 2.5 μg of each plasmid. Cryosections of bovine retina tissue were prepared by fixing bovine eyes in 4% paraformaldehyde, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h. Cryosections (10 μm) were cut followed by blocking and permeabilization with 10% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffer for 30 min. The sections were then labeled overnight at room temperature with Atp2F6 hybridoma supernatant diluted 2:3 in phosphate buffer containing 2.5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 or purified Cdc50–7F4 antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. In control studies, Cdc50–7F4 antibody labeling was blocked by preabsorption with 7F4 peptide at a concentration of 0.2 μg/μl for 30 min. Cos-7 cells transfected with 1D4-tagged Atp8a2 or Myc-tagged Cdc50a were labeled with either Rho-1D4 hybridoma culture fluid (1:500) or Myc antibody diluted 1:200 (ab10910; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The cells were also labeled with antibodies against calnexin (Abcam, ab13504) or GM130 (Sigma; G7295) diluted 1:200 and 1:300, respectively. Cos-7 cells transfected with untagged Atp8a2 and 1D4 tagged CDC50A chimeras were labeled with Atp2F6 and GM130 antibodies. The samples were washed with phosphate buffer and labeled for 1 h with Cy3- or Alexa-488 tagged goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000) and counterstained with DAPI. Double labeling studies were performed with anti-mouse secondary and Alexa 568 goat anti-rat Ig, Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit Ig, or Alexa 488 anti-rabbit (diluted 1:1000). The samples were examined on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal scanning microscope. ROS were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation (27Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The Rho-1D4, Atp6C11, and Cdc50–7F4 immunoaffinity columns were prepared as previously described (28Molday L.L. Cook N.J. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18690-18695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of ATP8A2 was performed as described earlier (5Coleman J.A. Kwok M.C. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32670-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3.5 mg of ROS or a 10-cm dish of HEK293T cells were lysed in 1 ml of Buffer A for 30 min with stirring at 4 °C. Following solubilization, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The detergent-solubilized fraction was added to ∼30 μl of packed immunoaffinity matrix that had been pre-equilibrated in Buffer A. After a 2-h incubation, the matrix was washed six times with 500 μl of Buffer B and eluted twice for 30 min in 25 μl of Buffer B containing 0.2 mg/ml 1D4 or 6C11 peptides where appropriate. Protein was eluted from the Cdc50–7F4 column in Buffer B containing 2% SDS instead of 10 mm CHAPS. For reconstitution experiments, the columns were washed and eluted in Buffer C with the appropriate amount of peptide. ATPase activity was measured as described (5Coleman J.A. Kwok M.C. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32670-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped with 6% SDS. The amount of phosphate release was measured by the colorimetric method (29González-Romo P. Sánchez-Nieto S. Gavilanes-Ruíz M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, ATP8A2 was assayed in the presence of 2.5 mg/ml lipid containing 100% PC, 10% PS, and 90% PC or 40% PE and 60% PC (w/w) in Buffer D with 5 mm ATP. Reconstitution was performed as described (5Coleman J.A. Kwok M.C. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32670-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5 μg of purified ATP8A2-CDC50A in 150 μl of Buffer C was mixed 1:1 with Buffer E containing either 2.5% (w/w) NBD-PC, NBD-PE, or NBD-PS followed by dialysis overnight against 1 liter of Buffer F to remove the detergent. Flippase assays were performed as described (5Coleman J.A. Kwok M.C. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32670-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30McIntyre J.C. Sleight R.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11819-11827Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 31Romsicki Y. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6937-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Reconstituted ATP8A2 in 30 μl was mixed with either ATP or AMP-PNP to a final concentration of 0.5 mm with 50 μl of Buffer F and incubated at 23 °C for 2.5 min. Following incubation, 0.95 ml of Buffer F was added, and the sample was transferred to a cuvette (path length, 1 cm) and read in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 478 and 540 nm, respectively. After 2.5 min, sodium dithionite in 1 m Tris buffer, pH 10, was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. After 10 min, a stable base line was reached. Triton X-100 was added to final concentration of 1%, and the sample was read for an additional 1.5 min. The percentage of NBD lipid on the outside of the proteoliposomes was calculated using the following formula, %NBDout=[(FT−FD)/(FT−F0)]×100(Eq. 1) where FT is the total fluorescence of the sample before dithionite treatment, FD is the fluorescence of the sample after dithionite treatment, and F0 is the fluorescence after detergent solubilization. The percentage of flipped lipid was calculated from the difference between the transbilayer distribution of NBD lipids with ATP and AMP-PNP treatment. Approximately 50 μg of ROS were denatured at room temperature and subjected to PNGase F treatment at 37 °C for 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). The same amount of solubilized ROS in 10 mm CHAPS and 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 5.0, was treated with neuraminidase (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h followed by O-glycosidase (Sigma) for 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane topology prediction was made using the TMHMM server, version 2.0 (32Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8982) Google Scholar). Prediction of N-linked and O-linked glycosylation was made using NetNGlyc 1.0 and NetOGlyc 3.1 servers, respectively (33Gupta R. Brunak S. Pac Symp Biocomput. 2002; 7: 310-322Google Scholar, 34Julenius K. Mølgaard A. Gupta R. Brunak S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis on 9% polyacrylamide gels and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred onto Immobilon FL membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol. Immobilon membranes were blocked with 1% milk in PBS for 30 min; incubated with antibody supernatant typically diluted 1:100 for the Rho 1D4, 1:25 for Cdc50–9C9 and Atp6C11, and 1:10 for Cdc50–7F4 in PBS for 40 min; washed thoroughly with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20); incubated for 40 min with secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse conjugated with IR dye 680, or IR dye 800 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) diluted 1:20,000 in PBST containing 0.5% milk; and washed with PBST prior to data collection on a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system. The relative amounts of ATP8A2 were quantified on Western blots by LI-COR densitometry measurements and normalized to β-actin (Abcam, ab1801). Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels using known amounts of bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE gels were divided into several equal slices and digested with trypsin according to established protocol (35Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7784) Google Scholar). Peptides were concentrated using C18 stop and go extraction (STAGE) tips. The peptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS as described (22Kwok M.C. Holopainen J.M. Molday L.L. Foster L.J. Molday R.S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1053-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using an LTQ-Orbitrap system (ThermoFisher, Bremen, Germany). The peptides were identified using the Mascot search program (36Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6732) Google Scholar). In previous studies, immunoaffinity-purified ATP8A2 from bovine ROSs was observed to migrate as a single 130-kDa protein on SDS gels stained with Coomassie Blue (5Coleman J.A. Kwok M.C. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32670-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, a number of P4-ATPases are known to associate with members of the Cdc50 protein family (14Saito K. Fujimura-Kamada K. Furuta N. Kato U. Umeda M. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3418-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 15Paulusma C.C. Folmer D.E. Ho-Mok K.S. de Waart D.R. Hilarius P.M. Verhoeven A.J. Oude Elferink R.P.

Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CDC50A was identified as a protein present in photoreceptor outer segment preparations in a recent proteomic study (22Kwok M.C. Holopainen J.M. Molday L.L. Foster L.J. Molday R.S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1053-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On this basis, we speculated that CDC50A may be associated with ATP8A2 but was undetectable in our purified ATP8A2 preparations by conventional protein staining techniques because of its highly glycosylated extracellular domain. To test this hypothesis, we digested immunoaffinity-purified ATP8A2 from photoreceptor membranes with trypsin for analysis by mass spectrometry. Tryptic peptides from both ATP8A2 and CDC50A were identified with a high level of confidence as shown in supplemental Table S2. Several proteins known to be highly abundant in outer segment preparations were also present including rhodopsin and tubulin. However, these proteins are commonly detected in immunoprecipitated protein samples from photoreceptor outer segments and therefore may represent residual contaminants in the preparation. Because highly specific antibodies to CDC50A are not commercially available, we generated anti-Cdc50a monoclonal antibodies for use as probes to study the biochemical properties and localization of CDC5"
https://openalex.org/W1997103493,"C8 is one of five complement proteins that assemble on bacterial membranes to form the lethal pore-like “membrane attack complex” (MAC) of complement. The MAC consists of one C5b, C6, C7, and C8 and 12–18 molecules of C9. C8 is composed of three genetically distinct subunits, C8α, C8β, and C8γ. The C6, C7, C8α, C8β, and C9 proteins are homologous and together comprise the MAC family of proteins. All contain N- and C-terminal modules and a central 40-kDa membrane attack complex perforin (MACPF) domain that has a key role in forming the MAC pore. Here, we report the 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of human C8 purified from blood. This is the first structure of a MAC family member and of a human MACPF-containing protein. The structure shows the modules in C8α and C8β are located on the periphery of C8 and not likely to interact with the target membrane. The C8γ subunit, a member of the lipocalin family of proteins that bind and transport small lipophilic molecules, shows no occupancy of its putative ligand-binding site. C8α and C8β are related by a rotation of ∼22° with only a small translational component along the rotation axis. Evolutionary arguments suggest the geometry of binding between these two subunits is similar to the arrangement of C9 molecules within the MAC pore. This leads to a model of the MAC that explains how C8-C9 and C9-C9 interactions could facilitate refolding and insertion of putative MACPF transmembrane β-hairpins to form a circular pore. C8 is one of five complement proteins that assemble on bacterial membranes to form the lethal pore-like “membrane attack complex” (MAC) of complement. The MAC consists of one C5b, C6, C7, and C8 and 12–18 molecules of C9. C8 is composed of three genetically distinct subunits, C8α, C8β, and C8γ. The C6, C7, C8α, C8β, and C9 proteins are homologous and together comprise the MAC family of proteins. All contain N- and C-terminal modules and a central 40-kDa membrane attack complex perforin (MACPF) domain that has a key role in forming the MAC pore. Here, we report the 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of human C8 purified from blood. This is the first structure of a MAC family member and of a human MACPF-containing protein. The structure shows the modules in C8α and C8β are located on the periphery of C8 and not likely to interact with the target membrane. The C8γ subunit, a member of the lipocalin family of proteins that bind and transport small lipophilic molecules, shows no occupancy of its putative ligand-binding site. C8α and C8β are related by a rotation of ∼22° with only a small translational component along the rotation axis. Evolutionary arguments suggest the geometry of binding between these two subunits is similar to the arrangement of C9 molecules within the MAC pore. This leads to a model of the MAC that explains how C8-C9 and C9-C9 interactions could facilitate refolding and insertion of putative MACPF transmembrane β-hairpins to form a circular pore.

Association of the first four components produces a membrane-bound tetrameric C5b-8 complex, which then initiates the recruitment and sequential binding of 12–18 C9 molecules to form a cylindrical transmembrane pore (supplemental Fig. S1).

The sequence of interactions leading to MAC formation is well defined; however, the mechanism by which the MAC disrupts membrane organization is poorly understood. C6, C7, the C8α and C8β subunits, and C9 are homologous and together comprise the “MAC family” of proteins (4Plumb M.E. Sodetz J.M. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 119-148Google Scholar, 5Lebioda L. Sodetz J.M. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. Structural Biology of the Complement System. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2005: 233-250Google Scholar). Until now, structures have not been determined for any of these proteins. All contain N- and C-terminal modules and a central 40-kDa “membrane attack complex/perforin” (MACPF) domain. The MACPF domain was named as such because of sequence similarity between the MAC family proteins and perforin. The modules range in number from three to eight; all are small domains of 40–60 amino acids that contain multiple disulfide bonds (supplemental Fig. S2). One type of module, thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1), contains several mannosylated tryptophans (6Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several hundred MACPF-containing proteins have been identified; however, functions are known for only a few. MACPF proteins exhibit limited sequence similarity, but all contain the MACPF signature motif ((Y/W)G(T/S)H(F/Y)X6GG) (7Ponting C.P. Curr.

Nature. 2010; 468: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) revealed a fold similar to the bacterial pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs). Thus, the MACPF domain may also be referred to as the “MACPF/CDC” domain. The mechanism of pore formation by CDCs is well understood (13Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6199-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). 30–50 CDC monomers self-polymerize on target membrane surfaces forming a circular pre-pore, which upon completion inserts into the membrane as a functional pore. This process involves a concerted major conformational change whereby two regions of each CDC monomer, which are in an α-helical conformation in the pre-pore state (14Rossjohn J. Polekhina G. Feil S.C. Morton C.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), refold into an extended conformation and insert into the bilayer as two transmembrane β-hairpins (TMH). TMHs from neighboring molecules “share edges” of their β-hairpins to form a hydrogen-bonded β-barrel. Structural similarity between complement MACPF proteins and the CDCs suggests that complement uses a CDC-like mechanism for pore formation. Conservation of several key glycine residues known to be important for CDC refolding and pore formation supports this hypothesis (11Slade D.J. Lovelace L.L. Chruszcz M. Minor W. Lebioda L. Sodetz J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6199-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). C8 is unique among the MAC components and other MACPF proteins in that it is a heterotrimer composed of three genetically distinct subunits (15Ng S.C. Rao A.G. Howard O.M. Sodetz J.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5229-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Strong noncovalent interactions mediate binding between the MACPF-containing C8α (NP_000553.1) and C8β (NP_000057.1) subunits, whereas the lipocalin-like C8γ (NP_000597.2) subunit is associated via a disulfide link to C8α. This arrangement differs from the recently characterized bacterial MACPF proteins and perforin which, like the CDCs, are monomers. In this report, we describe the structure of human C8 determined at 2.5 Å resolution. This is the first complete structure of a MAC family protein and of a protein containing two tightly associated MACPF domains. The unusual geometric arrangement of the C8α and C8β subunits provides new insight into how MAC components may interact to form a circular pore. C8 was purified from human plasma Cohn fraction III (Bayer Corp., Clayton, NC) (16Steckel E.W. York R.G. Monahan J.B. Sodetz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11997-12005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Linked oligosaccharides were removed using peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Released oligosaccharides and peptide:N-glycosidase F were removed by gel filtration. Hemolytic activity of deglycosylated C8 (DC8) was measured as described previously and is shown in supplemental Fig. S3 (17Schreck S.F. Plumb M.E. Platteborze P.L. Kaufman K.M. Michelotti G.A. Letson C.S. Sodetz J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar). Initial crystallization conditions were determined by surveying results from the high throughput screening facility at Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, Inc. (Buffalo, NY) (18Luft J.R. Collins R.J. Fehrman N.A. Lauricella A.M. Veatch C.K. DeTitta G.T. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). DC8 was concentrated to 4–6 mg/ml in 25 mm imidazole, 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and crystallized at 23 °C by hanging-drop vapor diffusion using 14–16% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.10 m TAPS, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm SrCl2, pH 9.0, as the precipitant solution. Crystals were flash-frozen at 100 K in a mixture of 16% (v/v) ethylene glycol and 84% (v/v) precipitant solution. Data were collected at 100 K on beamline 22-ID of the SER CAT at the APS, Argonne National Laboratory, and processed with HKL-2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38241) Google Scholar). Crystals were prone to decay, and a strategy to cover the asymmetric part of the reciprocal space with minimum exposure was used. The initial model was obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser software (20McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13872) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite of programs (21Collaborative Computational Project No 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19664) Google Scholar). The following fragments were fitted in this sequence: 1) the MACPF domain of C8α; 2) C8γ; and 3) homology model of the upper subdomain of C8β. These fragments were derived from the αMACPF-γ structure (Protein Data Bank entry 2RD7) (11Slade D.J. Lovelace L.L. Chruszcz M. Minor W. Lebioda L. Sodetz J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This model constituted about 60% of the scattering power. An extensive search for heavy atom derivatives was not successful. Therefore, the remaining residues were built to electron density maps phased with partial structures in an iterative process using Turbo (22Roussel A. Cambillau C. Turbo Frodo, Silicon Graphics Geometry. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) and Coot (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallog. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13707) Google Scholar) for crystallographic refinements. Previous high resolution analysis of C8γ showed internal water molecules in the lipocalin cavity (26Ortlund E. Parker C.L. Schreck S.F. Ginell S. Minor W. Sodetz J.M. Lebioda L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7030-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These molecules were observed in C8 electron density maps but only at 0.6 σ level. Thus, it appears that the noise level in the final maps is quite high, and therefore no solvent structure was included. The final model reports 1149 residues out of 1274. Relevant statistics are in Table 1. The initial homology model for the upper part of C8β and the homology model of C9 were constructed using Turbo (22Roussel A. Cambillau C. Turbo Frodo, Silicon Graphics Geometry. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar). Superpositions were calculated using Lsqkab software (27Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. A: Found. Crystallogr. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). Accessible surface calculations were carried out with PISA website (28Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6481) Google Scholar). Ribbon representations were generated using Molscript (29Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

The model was generated assuming that the binding mode between C8α and C8β MACPF domains is conserved for C6, C7, and C9. A, view of the modeled C8-C9 complex. Colors correspond to C8α (red), C8β (blue), C8γ (green), and C9 (gold). The putative CD59-binding site in C8α is circled in pink. The nearby position of phosphorylated C8β Thr364 is also shown. A more detailed view of these features is available in supplemental Fig. S7. B, partial model of the MAC. View is of the side facing the membrane. Proteins are colored C6 (cyan), C7 (pink), C8β (blue), C8α (red), C8γ (green), and C9 (gold). Absent are C5b, the CCP and FIM modules of C6 and C7, and the additional N-terminal TSP1 module in C6, the locations of which could not be predicted. Current evidence suggests C5b binds to the C7 FIMs (41Thai C.T. Ogata R.T. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4547-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); it is assumed the other missing components do not interfere with circular packing of the MACPF domains. The inner diameter of the ring is 110 Å with 80 Å between the protruding loops. The outer diameter is ∼220 Å and the height is 90 Å. This agrees well with EM images of pores formed by poly-C9, which generally have dimensions of ∼100 and 210 Å for the inner and outer diameters, respectively (42DiScipio R.G. Berlin C. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). C, molecular envelope of the model shown in B with modules in red and MACPF domains in gold. View is of the side facing away from the membrane. The modules account for a substantial fraction of the surface. It can be speculated that they may partially protect the MACPF domains from proteolytic factors at sites of inflammation as they contain multiple disulfides and carbohydrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 2Features of the C8α and C8β MACPF domains. Surface of the C8 molecule is shown. β-sheets of the C8α (red) and C8β (blue) MACPF domains are shown as stick models. This view shows “fanning out” of the MACPF subdomains. The upper part likely forms the outer or extracellular part of the pore. The lower part spreads out making the base wider. A stereo version is available online (supplemental Fig. S4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The C8 structure is shown in Fig. 1A. C8α and C8β have similar folds as predicted by 32% amino acid sequence identity. The sequence of C9 is 27 and 26% identical to the corresponding regions of C8α and C8β, respectively; thus, C9 likely has a similar fold. The central parts of the C8α and C8β MACPF domains are large, four-stranded, antiparallel β-sheets with a bend and twist in the middle, which gives them a “Γ” shape (Fig. 1B). Their lower part is flanked by two α-helical bundles that are predicted to refold and form two TMHs during MAC formation. Together with another helix, they form the “lower” MACPF subdomain. The upper part of the sheet and helices surrounding it forms the “upper” subdomain, which makes contacts with the modules, and most likely with other MAC proteins. The relative positions of the C8α and C8β MACPF domains differ as a result of a different bend and twist in their central β-sheets. The upper MACPF subdomains form very thin tabular structures tightly packed together with the β-sheets facing one another (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4). These interactions are likely responsible for the strong binding between C8α and C8β. The lower subdomains differ in that the sheets are not facing one another but are nearly coplanar; a small gap between them shows no edge sharing. Separation of the lower subdomains could facilitate refolding of the TMHs during insertion into membranes. The tightly packed upper subdomains are unlikely to change their relative position and may have a role in directing and maintaining the circular shape of the pore. In CDCs, during transition from pre-pore to pore, the bend in the central β-sheet is reduced, and the sheet changes from the “Γ” shape to a “(” shape, and the TMHs refold from an α-helical to an extended conformation, thus elongating the central β-sheet and allowing insertion of THMs into the membrane (13Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6199-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This transition requires a large movement between the upper and lower subdomains and is thought to be facilitated by four glycines located at the bend of the central β-sheets (Fig. 3). These residues are conserved in C8α and C8β and likely have a similar role in refolding of the MACPF domains. C8α and C8β each contain four modules. These are not essential for C8 activity as the C8α MACPF domain alone can bind C8β, C8γ, and C9 to form a MAC that has reduced but significant lytic activity (32Slade D.J. Chiswell B. Sodetz J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5290-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The C8β MACPF domain likewise can bind C8α-γ and express C8 activity (33Brannen C.L. Sodetz J.M. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 960-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The modules constitute about a third of the length of C8α and C8β and are located on the periphery of the structure. The N-terminal TSP1 modules of C8α and C8β form three-stranded antiparallel domains that are similar to one another and to homologous modules found in other proteins. In C8α, the central part of the module forms a ladder-like array of side chains Leu11–Arg31–Trp14–Arg29–Trp17–Lys27 clamped by two disulfides. In C8β, the array is Leu13–Ala33–Trp16–Arg31–Trp19–Arg29. Replacement of the first arginine with an alanine creates a fairly large hydrophobic cavity enclosed by Leu13, Trp16, and Phe48. An electron density feature within the cavity indicates the presence of a bound ligand (supplemental Fig. S5). The pattern of disulfide bridges is the same in C8α and C8β and is analogous to that reported for F-spondin (34Paakkonen K. Tossavainen H. Permi P. Rakkolainen H. Rauvala H. Raulo E. Kilpelainen I. Guntert P. Protein Struct. Funct. Bioinformatics. 2006; 64: 1268-1277Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this pattern (9–44, 20–54, and 28–60 in C8α; 11–46, 22–56, and 25–62 in C8β) is different from that reported for C9 (35Lengweiler S. Schaller J. Rickli E.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The four cysteines with altered disulfide bond connectivity are conserved between C8α, C8β, and C9; however, they are fairly close to one another, and the connectivity proposed for C9 may not require an unlikely change of the overall TSP1 fold. The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLRA) domains are located on the top of C8α and C8β (Fig. 1). They make contact with each other but not with the other modules. Each has a tightly wound Ca2+-binding site with the metal ion in a regular octahedral coordination, as found in homologous domains in other proteins. In the structure of LDL-receptor-associated protein complex (Protein Data Bank code 2FCW), there are also two LDLRA domains in contact with each other, but their mode of interaction is entirely different. Similarity of the C8α and C8β EGF domains to the EGF protein is the lowest among the modules. The differences are greatest near the first disulfide where the position of the cysteine residues is not conserved, and the loops are quite different (supplemental Fig. S6). The EGF domains appear to be more compact and less flexible in C8 than in EGF, as judged by a greater similarity between C8α and C8β EGF domains (root mean square displacement of 1.7 Å, based on Cα atoms of 30 residues) than between two copies of EGF proteins in the unit cell in their crystal structure (root mean square displacement of 3.3 Å; based on Cα atoms of 24 residues) (36Lu H.S. Chai J.J. Li M. Huang B.R. He C.H. Bi R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34913-34917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The pattern of disulfide bonds agrees with those in C9 with an additional bond present between Cys467 and Cys514 in C8α and Cys449 and Cys498 in C8β. The C-terminal TSP1 domains, which are on the periphery of C8, have relatively poor density, especially in C8α. There are only two pairs of intradomain disulfide bonds; their pattern could not be positively established due to disorder, but in C8β the connection Cys503–Cys536 (and by default Cys514–Cys526) appears likely because of the proximity of the residues. An infrequent modification of proteins is the covalent attachment of a mannopyranosyl moiety to Cδ1 of tryptophan via a C–C bond. NMR studies of a peptide derived from mannosylated human RNase indicated that an α-mannopyranose is attached (37de Beer T. Vliegenthart J.F. Löffler A. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11785-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, thus far there is no reported crystal structure of a peptide or protein containing a mannosyl tryptophan. All TSP1 domains present in C6, C7, C8, and C9 have some tryptophan residues mannosylated (6Hofsteenge J. Blommers M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In C8α, the N- and C-terminal TSP1 domains have 1 and 3 tryptophans modified, respectively, whereas the C8β domains each have 2. Electron density maps confirmed the presence of mannopyranosyl moieties at the expected positions. The mannosyl tryptophan residues from both modules cluster together (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, one of the corresponding densities is excellent and shows that a better fit can be obtained using a β- rather than α-mannosyl substituent (Fig. 4B). A previously identified single phosphorylation site on C8β Thr364 is located at the end of the TMH2 region (38Tang L.Y. Deng N. Wang L.S. Dai J. Wang Z.L. Jiang X.S. Li S.J. Li L. Sheng Q.H. Wu D.Q. Li L. Zeng R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1952-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The N-linked carbohydrates in C8 used for crystallization were enzymatically removed. Potential glycosylation sites are all on the surface, and electron density maps suggest that removal was complete. The structure of C8γ within C8 is very similar to that determined for C8γ alone (26Ortlund E. Parker C.L. Schreck S.F. Ginell S. Minor W. Sodetz J.M. Lebioda L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7030-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In C8α, the binding site for C8γ includes a 19-residue insertion (indel) within the MACPF domain. This segment also contains C8α Cys164 that covalently links to C8γ Cys40 (39Plumb M.E. Sodetz J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13078-13083Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). C8γ is a member of the lipocalin family of proteins that display a β-barrel fold that forms a binding pocket for a small, generally hydrophobic ligand (40Flower D.R. North A.C. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The existence of a natural small molecule ligand for C8γ has not been established, and inspection of the binding cavity in C8 does not show electron density for a ligand. Also, the entrance to the cavity is covered by the tightly bound “indel” portion of C8α making it unlikely that a ligand was removed during the purification process. Because C8 was purified from blood, it appears that C8γ does not normally carry a physiologically relevant small molecule. Analysis of contacts between subunits indicates that residues buried upon C8α-C8β dimer formation constitute 10% of the surface of each subunit. Trimer formation buries an additional 4% of C8α surface and 12% of C8γ surface. There is no contact between C8β and C8γ. Almost all contacts between C8γ and C8α are through the indel. When contacts are defined as distances <4.0 Å for hydrophobic side chains and <3.5 Å for hydrophilic side chains, 30 residues from C8α form contacts with 28 residues from C8β. The interface is quite hydrophilic with 27 residues charged, 21 polar and 10 hydrophobic. The most evolutionary distant sequence is for C8α from the nurse shark. This protein is 44% identical to human C8α with 50% of the contact residues conserved. Three contact residues are identical in human C8α, C8β, and C9; an additional 14 are conserved in two of the three proteins. Although the structure of C8 is of a pair of MACPF proteins in a “non-pore” state, the unusual geometrical relationship between the C8α and C8β subunits has important functional implications regarding MAC assembly. Most frequently, homodimeric proteins are related by a 180° rotation. In contrast, C8α and C8β are related by a rotation of 22°, and the translation between their centers is almost perpendicular to the rotation axis, resulting in only a small (1.6 Å) translational component parallel to the rotation axis. It is well established that C8 mediates the binding and incorporation of C9 into the MAC and that this involves a specific C9-binding site located within the C8α MACPF domain (32Slade D.J. Chiswell B. Sodetz J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5290-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Assuming the modes of binding between C9 and C8α and between C9 and C9 are similar to that b"

Bacterial levansucrases (glycoside hydrolase family 68) synthesize high molecular weight, β-(2,6)-linked levan from sucrose by transfer of fructosyl units. The kinetic and biochemical characterization of Bacillus megaterium levansucrase SacB variants Y247A, Y247W, N252A, D257A, and K373A reveal novel surface motifs remote from the sucrose binding site with distinct influence on the polysaccharide product spectrum. The wild type activity (kcat) and substrate affinity (Km) are maintained. The structures of the SacB variants reveal clearly distinguishable subsites for polysaccharide synthesis as well as an intact active site architecture. These results lead to a new understanding of polysaccharide synthesis mechanisms. The identified surface motifs are discussed in the context of related glycosyltransferases.

Carbohydrates represent one of the three major classes of biological macromolecules along with proteins and nucleic acids. They play a functional role in numerous biological recognition processes, including bacterial or viral infection, inflammation, and innate/adaptive immunity (1Dwek R.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 683-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2833) Google Scholar, 2Wong C.H. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 70: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a great interest in glycans for developing new potential therapeutic agents, such as vaccines; glycoprotein therapeutics, such as antibodies; and glycosylated drugs (4Wong C.-H. Carbohydrate-based Drug Discovery. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2003Crossref Google Scholar). Their chemical synthesis is often expensive and laborious or not possible at all. Chemo-enzymatic glycoconjugate synthesis methods are on the rise to overcome these drawbacks (5Homann A. Seibel J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2009; 26: 1555-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Poly- and oligosaccharides are synthesized by the linkage of activated monosaccharides and have remarkable structural variations. Their biological function depends on the degree of polymerization, the linkage type, and the branching of the saccharide chain (6Varki A. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of fructosyl polymers (fructan) is catalyzed by the action of enzymes called fructansucrases, also commonly referred to as fructosyltransferases. There are two types of fructansucrases known, levansucrases and inulosucrases. Levansucrases (EC 2.4.1.10) mainly form levan with β-(2,6)-linked fructosyl residues (7Chambert R. Treboul G. Dedonder R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Meng G. Fütterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Inulosucrases (EC 2.4.1.9) synthesize fructans containing primarily β-(2,1)-linked fructosyl units, which are referred to as inulins (9Ozimek L.K. Kralj S. van der Maarel M.J. Dijkhuizen L. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10van Hijum S.A. van der Maarel M.J. Dijkhuizen L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These enzymes cleave the glycosidic bond of their substrate sucrose and catalyze the transfer of a fructosyl unit from sucrose to a growing fructan chain (polysaccharide formation) or to water (hydrolysis) (11Avigad G. Feingold D.S. Hestrin S. Biochem. J. 1956; 64: 351-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Avigad G. Feingold D.S. Hestrin S. Biochem.

Rev. 2006; 70: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Besides synthesizing high molecular weight polysaccharides, fructansucrases are also capable of forming short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides in the presence of suitable acceptors or by mutagenesis in the sucrose binding site (14Kralj S. van Leeuwen S.S. Valk V. Eeuwema W. Kamerling J.P. Dijkhuizen L. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 6002-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Beine R. Moraru R. Nimtz M. Na'amnieh S. Pawlowski A. Buchholz K. Seibel J.

Each fructansucrase mainly forms one type of linkage in the synthesized fructo-oligosacharides. According to the data base of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZY) (18Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), bacterial fructansucrases are members of family 68 of the glycoside hydrolases (GHs). 4The abbreviations used are: GHglycoside hydrolaseHPAEChigh performance anion exchange chromatography. Clan GH-J comprises bacterial fructansucrases of GH 68 and the enzymes of family GH 32, which occur mainly in plants and fungi. These members share a β-propeller fold consisting of four antiparallel β-strands and a central negatively charged cavity, first discovered in tachylectin-2 (19Beisel H.G. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2313-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently, it was discovered that the mutation of an amino acid not located in the active site of the fructosyltransferase SacB from Bacillus megaterium (Asn252) eliminates its polysaccharide synthesis (20Homann A. Biedendieck R. Götze S. Jahn D. Seibel J. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of the homologous Bacillus subtilis levansucrase in complex with sucrose (Protein Data Bank code 1PT2) and raffinose (Protein Data Bank code 3BYN) provided insights into the functional role of Asn252 (8Meng G. Fütterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Meng G. Fütterer K. BMC Struct. Biol. 2008; 8: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it remained unclear if structural elements on the enzyme's surface outside the active site take part in the transfructosylation process. glycoside hydrolase high performance anion exchange chromatography. In this work, an extensive mutagenesis study combined with biochemical analyses and structural information of the GH 68 levansucrase SacB from B. megaterium was performed. Novel variants of amino acid residues located on the enzyme's surface remote from the active site were rationally chosen, characterized, and crystallized. The five structures of SacB variants (Y247A, Y247W, N252A, D257A, and K373A) obtained at resolutions between 2.0 and 1.75 Å support a surface-modulated transfructosylation mechanism. The Escherichia coli expression vector pRBEc1, harboring the sacB gene, was described previously (20Homann A. Biedendieck R. Götze S. Jahn D. Seibel J. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The plasmid was employed as a template to generate variants of sacB by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange®, Stratagene). All introduced mutations and the integrity of the residual sacB gene were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of each variant were performed as described previously (20Homann A. Biedendieck R. Götze S. Jahn D. Seibel J. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For crystallization, SacB variants were additionally purified using a hydroxyapatite column, eluting with a linear gradient of phosphate buffer with increasing phosphate concentration. Eluted protein was applied to a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium chloride and 10 mm MES, pH 6.0. The purified SacB variants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and concentrated by centrifugal filtration in protein concentrators (VivaSpin). The protein concentrations of the fractions were measured photometrically at 280 nm (NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-100, peqLab Biotechnology). All crystallization experiments were performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals grew under two different crystallization conditions; the first condition contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate/citrate, pH 4.1, 0.1 m magnesium sulfate, 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 (condition A). The second condition was composed of 0.1 m sodium phosphate/citrate, pH 4.1, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m calcium dichloride, and 20% PEG 1000 (condition B). Using purified protein at a final concentration of 8.5 mg/ml, small crystals grew at 20 °C over a period of 2 weeks. Crystals of SacB D257A were obtained from condition A, whereas variants Y247A, Y247W, N252A, and K373A showed the best crystallization results under condition B. Initial crystals were used for microseeding with a decreased protein concentration between 5.0 and 6.0 mg/ml, resulting in diffraction quality crystals. The cryoprotectant solution consists of reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol. Crystals grown under condition A were not supplied with additional cryoprotectant. An x-ray data set of SacB D257A was collected on beamline BM16 at ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). Data for variants K373A, N252A, Y247A, and Y247W were recorded at BESSY (Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung, Berlin, Germany) either on beamline BL 14.1 or 14.2. Indexing and processing of the intensity data were carried out with the XDS program package (22Kabsch W. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11052) Google Scholar). Scaling was performed using SCALA from the CCP4 package (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of SacB D257A in space group P212121 was determined by the molecular replacement method using the program MolRep in the CCP4 suite. Coordinates of homologue SacB from B. subtilis (Protein Data Bank code 1OYG) served as the search model. The results showed a clear solution for one molecule in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 43%. Crystals of variants K373A, N252A, Y247A, and Y247W belong to space group P21. The atomic coordinates of variant D257A were used as the starting model to solve the structures of SacB variants in space group P21 by molecular replacement. The asymmetric units of these variants contained four copies of the enzyme with a solvent content of about 43%. The final structures were modeled after iterative cycles of manual model building and refinement using COOT (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23004) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13815) Google Scholar), respectively. All five final models include amino acid residues 34–481. The quality of the final structures was validated with the MOLPROBITY server (26Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W375-W383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar) and SFCHECK from the CCP4 package (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar). The determination of the kinetic parameters was performed with purified enzyme under optimized reaction conditions (7.36 mg/liter SacB at a pH of 6.6 and 37 °C). Substrate concentrations of 500 to 1 mm were investigated (500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5, and 1 mm). After 1 h, the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. Spontaneous heat-mediated sucrose hydrolysis was excluded by the analysis of inactive SacB variants. Here, no glucose or fructose was detected using heat inactivation of the enzyme. The glucose content was determined using conditions A (Table 1, top) by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) (Dionex; precolumn, CarboPac PA1, 4 × 50 mm; main column, CarboPac PA1, 4 × 250 mm Dionex; conductivity detector PAD-2, at 1 ml/min). The specific glucose formation activity (units/mg) and the substrate concentration (S) were plotted. The resulting Km and Vmax values were determined by regression according to the Michaelis-Menten equation.TABLE 1HPAEC protocol for carbohydrate analysistEluentmin%Mono- and disaccharides0–505–300–5030–355035–40To 040–600Oligosaccharides0–505–100–3010–403040–4530–045–600 Open table in a new tab The wild type and variant polysaccharide synthesis process was monitored in 50 mm Sorenson's phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) at 37 °C, 500 mm sucrose, and 7.36 mg/liter enzyme concentration by thin layer chromatography (supplemental Fig. 1). 3 μl of the reaction mixture was separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC; silica-coated aluminum plate, isopropyl alcohol (60%), ethyl acetate (30%), water (10%)). TLC staining was performed by N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylene diamine dihydrochloride (2.5% (w/v) in 5% sulfuric acid and methanol) and subsequent heating (160 °C) for 5 min. For the wild type SacB, additional samples were taken after 10 and 30 min and after 1, 6, 24, and 72 h and analyzed by HPAEC under conditions A (Table 1, top, and supplemental Fig. 2). To determine the polysaccharide synthesis kinetics of the variants, the 24 and 72 h samples were analyzed by HPAEC to determine the sucrose consumption (supplemental Fig. 3). The ethanol-precipitated oligo- and polysaccharides of the 72 h sample of the wild type and the variants were further analyzed using HPAEC without sodium acetate gradient (conditions B, Table 1 (bottom), Fig. 4, and supplemental Fig. 4). Thus, oligosaccharide peaks were separated as opposed to conditions A (Table 1, top). For the determination of the hydrolysis versus transfer activity of the wild type SacB and its variants, the polysaccharide synthesis reaction was performed at pH 6.6, 37 °C, 7.36 mg/liter SacB, and 500 mm sucrose for 72 h. The glucose and fructose content of the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPAEC according to conditions A (Table 1, top). The structures of levansucrase SacB variants Y247A, Y247W, N252A, D257A, and K373A have been refined at resolutions between 1.75 and 2.0 Å. Crystals of variants D257A and Y247A, respectively, were grown together, crystals resulting in multiple diffraction patterns. This may explain the relatively high values of Rmerge (Table 2). Furthermore, the analysis of data sets Y247A, Y247W, and N252A revealed slightly pseudomerohedral twinning (twinning fractions of 8.5–10%). For each variant, amino acid residues 34–481 are well resolved in the electron density. The SacB variants contain a single globular domain with a 5-fold β-propeller motif, as described for all known structures of clan GH J enzymes (8Meng G. Fütterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 13van Hijum S.A. Kralj S. Ozimek L.K. Dijkhuizen L. van Geel-Schutten I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Each blade of the 5-fold β-propeller consists of four antiparallel β-strands showing the classical “W” topology. The highly conserved sequence motifs of GH 68, including the motifs 94WD95, 172WSGS175, 256RDP258, 349DXXER353, and 421YSH423, which form the central framework of the β-propeller, were identified. The active site is located at the bottom of the central cavity of the propeller. A funnel-like opening provides access to the deep negatively charged pocket toward the molecular surface (Fig. 1). The active site contains the catalytic amino acid residues Asp95/Asp257/Glu352. Glu352 acts as acid/base catalyst, and Asp95 is the catalytic nucleophile supported by previous mutagenesis studies of SacB from B. megaterium (20Homann A. Biedendieck R. Götze S. Jahn D. Seibel J. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Asp257 has been shown to interact with the 3- and 4-OH of the fructosyl moiety in the active site (9Ozimek L.K. Kralj S. van der Maarel M.J. Dijkhuizen L. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10van Hijum S.A. van der Maarel M.J. Dijkhuizen L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and stabilizes the transition state. Arginine in position 370 is analogous to the previously described Arg360 of SacB from B. subtilis, which influences the polysaccharide synthesis in subsite +1 (8Meng G. Fütterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Meng G. Fütterer K. BMC Struct. Biol. 2008; 8: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Structure refinement reveals a continuous stretch of electron density within the active site cavity of all variants except for D257A. Fragments of PEG molecules sized between 100 and 300 Da and used as precipitants during crystallization best fit in the elongated density. The PEG molecules are located between residues Trp172, Leu118, Trp94, and Pro414. (Fig. 2). Except for proline, these amino acid residues were already part of a mutagenesis studied previously published (20Homann A. Biedendieck R. Götze S. Jahn D. Seibel J. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

Biedendieck R. Götze S. Jahn D. Seibel J. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SacB variant N252A does not form any polysaccharide but instead forms short-chain oligosaccharides of up to three fructosyl units (nystose) (20Homann A. Biedendieck R. Götze S. Jahn D. Seibel J. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In SacB from B. megaterium, Asn252 is not located in the sucrose binding site analogous to Asn242 of the levansucrase from B. subtilis co-crystallized with raffinose (Protein Data Bank code 3BYN (21Meng G. Fütterer K. BMC Struct. Biol. 2008; 8: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). The crucial question arises of whether the residue Asn252 is involved in interactions with the fructan chain or if alternative effects, perhaps toward amino acid residues located in the catalytic site, are responsible for the observed termination of polymer formation. In order to answer this question, SacB variant N252A was crystallized, and the structure of this variant was solved at a resolution of 2.0 Å. The structure of SacB variant N252A shows an intact active site compared with D257A and K373A (Fig. 3). None of the catalytic amino acid residues changes its conformation. Thus, conformational effects of N252A on the fructosyl transfer mechanism are excluded. Lys373 located outside the sucrose binding site was exchanged to alanine in order to examine its role in the polysaccharide synthesis process. Regarding variant K373A, the formation of tri- and tetrasaccharides is lowered, whereas the synthesis of penta- and hexasaccharides (containing four or five fructosyl units, respectively) is slightly enhanced (Fig. 4). Oligosaccharides exceeding six units are not observed. Consistent with the eliminated polysaccharide synthesis, K373A has an increased hydrolytic activity of almost 33% (Fig. 5). Superposition of SacB variant K373A (1.75 Å) with the structures of variants D257A and N252A shows an intact active site (Fig. 3). We further investigated the role of tyrosine in position 247. We anticipated a potential protein-carbohydrate π-π stacking mechanism in this location. The characterization of the oligo- and polysaccharide products point toward the role of Tyr247 and Lys373 in the transfructosylation mechanism. Tyr247 is not located in the active site of SacB but has a strong influence on its polymer formation activity. The exchange of tyrosine in position 247 to alanine leads to the formation of short oligosaccharides (Fig. 4). The amount of octa- and nonasaccharides is slightly enhanced, and the transfructosylation is totally eliminated after nine fructosyl units (decasaccharides; Fig. 4). In contrast, the exchange of tyrosine to tryptophan results in the same oligosaccharide pattern as the wild type SacB (Fig. 4). Consistent with the kinetic parameters (Km = 2.1 mm, kcat = 2653 s−1; Table 3), variant Y247W maintains the wild type activity and substrate affinity. The hydrolysis activity of variant Y247A is enhanced by 10% (mol/mol), whereas the hydrolysis products of Y247W are only slightly increased compared with the wild type SacB (5%; Fig. 4). Again, the structures of the SacB variants Y247A and Y247W (2.0 and 1.9 Å, respectively) point out that the wild type active site architecture is maintained (Fig. 3). Km and kcat of Y247A, which are similar to the wild type SacB, support this structural observation (Table 3).TABLE 3Kinetic parameters of the WT and variants of SacB from B. megateriumVariantKmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1mm−1 s−1WTaData previously published (20).6.57 ± 1.12272 ± 134254Y247A8.98 ± 1.61505 ± 57168Y247I11.4 ± 3.02030 ± 121178Y247W2.13 ± 1.32653 ± 2841243N252AaData previously published (20).4.1 ± 1.71480361N312A10.8 ± 3.0776 ± 4872K315A5.28 ± 2.02415 ± 175457K315R9.46 ± 3.62122 ± 142224R370AaData previously published (20).29.2 ± 11.61796S372A7.54 ± 2.42617 ± 175347K373A3.50 ± 1.4699 ± 48200K373R11.0 ± 4.21708 ± 145155Q381A9.46 ± 1.93295 ± 142348Y421AaData previously published (20).51.9 ± 16.33357a Data previously published (20Homann A.

Open table in a new tab To further investigate structural elements on the surface of SacB, amino acid residues in the vicinity of Asn252, Tyr247, and Lys373 were chosen for mutagenesis studies. On the basis of structural alignments with the levansucrases SacB from B. subtilis and the related LsdA from Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus (27Martínez-Fleites C. Ortíz-Lombardía M. Pons T. Tarbouriech N. Taylor E.J. Arrieta J.G. Hernández L. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), six additional amino acid residues with a potential impact on the polysaccharide synthesis mechanism of SacB are identified. The amino acid functionality of the new SacB variants (Y247A, Y247I, Y247W, N312A, K315A, K315R, S372A, K373A, K373R, and Q381A) is eliminated by an exchange to alanine or partially maintained by the exchange to functionally similar amino acid residues (Table 3). In order to elucidate the conformation and substrate affinity of the active site of the new SacB variants, their kinetic parameters and product spectra were determined and analyzed by HPAEC. All SacB variants have a Michaelis-Menten constant comparable with the wild type. The Km of the variants ranges between 2.1 (Y247W) and 11.4 mm (Y247I), which is less than a 50% difference from the Km of the wild type. The intact active site architecture of the variants is indicated by their substrate affinity in the wild type range. Moreover, the turnover numbers of all variants are comparable with the wild type SacB, except for two variants, K373A and N312A. These have a kcat 3-fold lower than the wild type. However, this observed activity is still in the high range compared with fructosyltransferases from other organisms (Table 4). The other variants do not differ more than 40% from the wild type SacB turnover number. This indicates the integrity of the polysaccharide synthesis machinery.TABLE 4Kinetic data of Clan J sucrose-active enzymes from GH 32 (A. awamori) and GH 68 (all other entries)OrganismReaction conditionsKmkcatmms−1B. megaterium (20Homann A.

The amount of glucose released, indicating hydrolysis, is compared with the amount of free fructose. The difference must correspond to transfer products. The variant with significantly enhanced transfer activity is K315A (22%; Fig. 5). Variants K315R and N312A show a hydrolysis versus transfer activity similar to the wild type. All other variants have an increased hydrolysis rate of up to 33% (K373A) (Fig. 5). In order to elucidate the composition of the oligosaccharides formed by SacB, the precipitated reaction products were analyzed by HPAEC. On the basis of a carbohydrate standard, the HPAEC peaks were assigned to the corresponding number of fructosyl units. The hydrolysis activity of the variants is enhanced compared with the wild type except for K315A (Fig. 5). According to its strongly increased transfructosylation activity of 22% (mol/mol), K315A forms significantly more oligosaccharides. The Km and kcat of the variants are similar to those of the wild type SacB. The exchange of lysine in position 315 to arginine retains the wild type hydrolysis and transfructosylation activity and does not have any kinetic effect that differs significantly from any wild type parameter. Despite rigorous studies during the recent years with numerous solved structures of enzymes acting on sucrose, their polysaccharide synthesis mechanism remains elusive (13van Hijum S.A. Kralj S. Ozimek L.K. Dijkhuizen L. van Geel-Schutten I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Even successful co-crystallizations with di- and trisaccharides did not lead to a detailed explanation of the transfructosylation process regarding oligo- and polysaccharide synthesis (8Meng G. Fütterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Meng G. Fütterer K. BMC Struct. Biol. 2008; 8: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The previously described amino acids with an impact on β-(2,6)-linked levan or β-(2,1)-linked inulin formation were located in the sucrose binding site. They interact with sucrose, either catalyzing the cleavage of the glycosidic bond (Asp95, Asp257, and Glu352), generating the enzyme-fructosyl complex (Asp95), or stabilizing sucrose in the active site (Trp94, Trp173, Arg256, Glu350, and Arg370) (13van Hijum S.A. Kralj S. Ozimek L.K. Dijkhuizen L. van Geel-Schutten I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recently, an asparagine residue in position 252 outside the sucrose binding site was described as crucial for polysaccharide synthesis (20Homann A. Biedendieck R. Götze S. Jahn D. Seibel J. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hence, the following questions arise. First, does a mutation of Asn252 have an impact on the active site conformation? Second, are there other surface motifs influencing the polysaccharide synthesis, and does their mutation influence the active site architecture? In this work, it is shown for the first time that amino acids outside the active site of a polysaccharide-forming enzyme have a well defined and rationally explainable effect on the polymer formation activity. Indirect effects on the position of other amino acids can be excluded due to the extensive structural data of SacB variants Y247A, Y247W, N252A, and K373A. The structural data are consistent with the kinetic and biochemical analyses. Conformational analyses of variants Y247A, Y247W, N252A, and K373A reveal retained active site architecture (Fig. 3). Supporting the crystallographic data, the kinetic parameters of these variants are not significantly different compared with wild type SacB (Table 3). Moreover, the structural data point toward a possible surface arrangement for the binding of an acceptor fructosyl chain. Residues Asn252, Lys373, and Tyr247 form a platform for a possible stabilization of the acceptor fructan chain. Clear subsites can be assigned to every exchanged amino acid (Fig. 4). The biochemical data along with the structural data show that Asn252 is located close to the sucrose binding site, whereas Lys373 and Tyr247 are clearly apart from the sucrose binding cavity of SacB. All exchanged amino acid residues are located on the surface of SacB. HPAEC analyses of the variant's oligofructoside synthesis patterns show definite terminations of the polymerization process, depending on the location of the mutated amino acid residue. Variants K373A, N252A, and Y247A synthesize unique mixtures of oligosaccharides with clearly distinguishable chain lengths, correlating to their location on the surface of SacB. We examined further the exchange of lysine in position 373 to arginine, leading to longer oligofructosides (9 fructosyl units) than its exchange to alanine (4–5 fructosyl units) (Fig. 4). Interactions between the functional amino groups of arginine in position 373 and the amino acid network as well as carbohydrate units are still possible, although the interactions are reduced compared with the wild type. This leads to an eliminated polymer formation. We further investigated the role of Tyr247. SacB variants Y247A and Y247I form oligosaccharides consisting of up to nine fructosyl units, whereas variant Y247W forms the whole range of oligosaccharides compared with the wild type spectrum. These results indicate that an unpolar favored π-π-stacking mechanism is possible with tyrosine as well as tryptophan in this location but not with alanine or isoleucine. Superposition of Y247W with D257A confirms the key supporting role of Tyr247 in the oligo- and polysaccharide-forming “assembly line.” A structural comparison of the levansucrases SacB from B. megaterium and LsdA from G. diazotrophicus (27Martínez-Fleites C. Ortíz-Lombardía M. Pons T. Tarbouriech N. Taylor E.J. Arrieta J.G. Hernández L. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) enables insights into the functional role of Tyr247. LsdA forms mainly the β-(2,1)-linked trisaccharide 1-kestose, whereas the wild type SacB forms mainly polysaccharides. In LsdA, the conformation of Phe304 might block the interaction of an oligofructosyl acceptor chain (Fig. 6). Thus, one structural element on the surface of both levansucrases might influence this difference in oligo- versus polysaccharide synthesis. These results may lead to the implication of surface-dependent polysaccharide synthesis modulation on other enzymes of the structurally related clan GH-J and beyond. Enzymes of clan GH-J include fungal and plant enzymes that act on sucrose or exhibit an exclusively hydrolysis mechanism like the exo-inulinase from Aspergillus awamori (EC 3.2.1.80) (28Kulminskaya A.A.

J. 2006; 395: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It remains to be investigated if similar surface structures influencing polysaccharide synthesis exist in these enzymes. One further indication suggesting hydrolysis versus polysaccharide surface-dependent synthesis mechanisms is the narrow and unpolar catalytic site architecture of the GH 68-related domain of the exo-inulinase from A. awamori, which does not bind any acceptor oligofructosides (28Kulminskaya A.A.

Besides other factors, such as substrate concentration and reaction kinetics, the surface architecture of a polysaccharide-synthesizing glycosyltransferase is clearly the key to its product spectrum.

Here we report that the intracellular trafficking of apoE4 is impaired in Neuro-2a cells and primary neurons, as shown by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. In Neuro-2a cells, more apoE4 than apoE3 molecules remained immobilized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, and the lateral motility of apoE4 was significantly lower in the Golgi apparatus (but not in the ER) than that of apoE3. Likewise, the immobile fraction was larger, and the lateral motility was lower for apoE4 than apoE3 in mouse primary hippocampal neurons. ApoE4 with the R61T mutation, which abolishes apoE4 domain interaction, was less immobilized, and its lateral motility was comparable with that of apoE3. The trafficking impairment of apoE4 was also rescued by disrupting domain interaction with the small-molecule structure correctors GIND25 and PH002. PH002 also rescued apoE4-induced impairments of neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells and dendritic spine development in primary neurons. ApoE4 did not affect trafficking of amyloid precursor protein, another AD-related protein, through the secretory pathway. Thus, domain interaction renders more newly synthesized apoE4 molecules immobile and slows their trafficking along the secretory pathway.

Two biophysical properties that distinguish apoE4 from the other isoforms likely hold the key to a mechanistic understanding of its association with AD. First, apoE4 is more unstable and tends to form a molten globule state (7Morrow J.A. Hatters D.M. Lu B. Hochtl P. Oberg K.A. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

Second, the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–191) of apoE4 interacts with its carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 223–299) (9Dong L.M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W.

This domain interaction occurs predominantly in apoE4, in which positively charged Arg-112 repels the side chain of Arg-61 in the amino-terminal domain, allowing the formation of a salt bridge between Arg-61 and the negatively charged Glu-255 in the carboxyl-terminal domain (9Dong L.M.

Neuronal production of apoE4 in response to stress or injury may be important in mediating its detrimental effects in AD pathogenesis (14Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Huang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

ApoE is a secreted protein, and its production and transit through the secretory pathway in neurons could be affected by many factors, including its folding status, as demonstrated for other secreted proteins (27Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 28Römisch K. Traffic. 2004; 5: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Anelli T. Sitia R.

We hypothesized that the biophysical characteristics of apoE4, notably domain interaction, affect its folding and, thus, its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Golgi apparatus to the cell membrane. To test this hypothesis, we transfected Neuro-2a cells and mouse primary hippocampal neurons with cDNA constructs encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged apoE proteins (apoE3, apoE4, and apoE4-R61T) as a noninvasive probe to measure fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), a powerful technology that can monitor intracellular trafficking of cargo proteins (32Diliberto Jr., E.J. Axelrod J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here we report that apoE3 and apoE4 have different intracellular trafficking profiles in neuronal cells, as domain interaction causes more apoE4 than apoE3 molecules to be retained in the ER and Golgi and to move more slowly along the secretory pathway. cDNAs of apoE3 and apoE4 were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vectors in-frame with the amino-terminal apoE signal sequence followed by EGFP and apoE with a stop codon to generate EGFP-apoE3 and EGFP-apoE4. EGFP-apoE4-R61T was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of EGFP-apoE4 (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). EGFP-apoE3, EGFP-apoE4, and EGFP-apoE4-R61T were also subcloned into a Sindbis viral vector for transduction of mouse primary hippocampal neurons. Red fluorescent protein (RFP) ER marker (RFP-ER) was from Invitrogen. An amyloid precursor protein (APP)-EGFP construct was a gift from Lennart Mucke (Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease). Wild type Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells (CCL-131 ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% sodium pyruvate (100 mm, Invitrogen), and 1% l-glutamine (200 mm, Invitrogen) in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were subcultured twice weekly (dilution 1:4) and dislodged from the flask with trypsin solution. Neuro-2a cells stably expressing human apoE3 or apoE4 at similar levels were generated in our laboratory (24Harris F.M. Tesseur I. Brecht W.J. Xu Q. Mullendorff K. Chang S. Wyss-Coray T. Mahley R.W.

Neuro-2a cells were transfected with EGFP-apoE3, EGFP-apoE4, and EGFP-apoE4-R61T using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with 400 μg/ml neomycin (Invitrogen) for 4 weeks. Colonies with green fluorescence were picked for further enrichment. Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared on postnatal day 0 pups of apoE knock-out mice as reported (33Li G. Bien-Ly N.

Hippocampi were isolated, and dissociated cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides with a coverglass bottom (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) coated with PL-lysine (Sigma) at 20,000 cells/well in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At 13 days in vitro (DIV) culture, primary neurons were transduced with Sindbis virus expressing EGFP-apoE3, EGFP-apoE4, or EGFP-apoE4-R61T. At 14 DIV, the intracellular trafficking of different forms of EGFP-apoE was analyzed. Two small-molecule structure correctors were used in the current study. One, GIND25, disrupts apoE4 domain interaction (Ye et al. (36Ye S. Huang Y. Müllendorff K. Dong L. Giedt G. Meng E.C. Cohen F.E. Kuntz I.D. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The other is a newly identified phthalazinone derivative, 4-{4-[2-(3-methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-phthalazin-1-yl)-acetylamino]-benzyl}-piperazine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (PH002, Merck) that disrupts apoE4 domain interaction more potently than GIND25. For FRAP measurements, cells were plated 2 days before the experiment in eight-well chamber slides with a coverglass bottom (Nunc) coated with PL-lysine (Sigma) at 5000 cells/well. Recordings were obtained with an inverted Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and a 63× oil objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4; cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Recording parameters were chosen to minimize light exposure to 1 milliwatt outside of the 20-milliwatt high-intensity laser bleaches with an argon laser at 488 nm for 1.2 s. A stable base line ensured that the EGFP fluorophore was not photo-damaged during pre-bleach base line and post-bleach recovery plateau recordings. Morphologic identification of the ER and Golgi apparatus was confirmed by cotransfection of RFP-ER in Neuro-2a cells. Fluorescence intensity values were exported into Excel. Fluorescence levels were normalized to their pre-bleach base lines, and the extent of recovery was determined (32Diliberto Jr., E.J. Axelrod J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The mobile fraction (%) was defined as the post-bleach recovery plateau; the immobile fraction (%) was calculated as the pre-bleach base line minus the post-bleach recovery plateau. To determine half-maximal recovery times, post-bleach fluorescence values were normalized to the values of the post-bleach recovery plateau, and the time of the 50% recovery value was determined. The diffusion coefficient D was calculated for a circular beam, assuming Gaussian diffusion from the equation D = (w2/4τ½) γD, where w is the radius of the laser beam, τ½ is the time required for the bleached spot to recover half of its initial integrated intensity, and γD is the bleach factor (32Diliberto Jr., E.J. Axelrod J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Neuro-2a cells stably expressing apoE3 or apoE4 were seeded at 7500–8000 cells/well on PL-lysine-coated 24-well plates containing Opti-MEM with either 0.03% DMSO (control) or DMSO plus compound PH002 (100 nm). Cells were grown for 72 h at 37 °C to induce neurite outgrowth. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, cells were washed with PBS, stained with a SimplyBlue Safe Stain kit (Invitrogen) for 2 h, and washed again with PBS. Bright-field images were obtained with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope (equipped with a motorized stage) and Volocity software. For each well, eight images were automatically taken from the same fields. Images were analyzed with NIH Image J to determine the total cell count per image and to identify cells with neurites longer than the cell body diameter. Hippocampal primary neurons were cultured from P0 pups of NSE-apoE3 and NSE-apoE4 transgenic mice (33Li G. Bien-Ly N. Andrews-Zwilling Y. Xu Q. Bernardo A. Ring K. Halabisky B. Deng C. Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 634-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). At 5 DIV, primary neurons were transiently transfected with EGFP-β-actin to highlight dendritic spines (34Brodbeck J. Balestra M.E. Saunders A.M. Roses A.D. Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At 11 DIV, some of the primary neurons expressing apoE3 or apoE4 were treated with PH002 (100 nm for 3 days). At 14 DIV, all cells were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) and mounted on microscope slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Digital images of EGFP were collected on a laser-scanning confocal microscope with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 scanhead mounted on an Optiphot-2 microscope (Nikon) with a 60× oil objective lens. The dendritic spine densities were quantified as described (34Brodbeck J. Balestra M.E. Saunders A.M. Roses A.D. Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism. Differences between means were assessed by t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or one-factor analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Neuro-2a cells stably expressing EGFP-tagged apoE3 or apoE4 were established by transfection of cDNAs encoding the respective fusion protein starting with the signal peptide of apoE. Stably transfected cells were selected for neomycin resistance. Expression of the EGFP-apoE fusion proteins was confirmed visually by their green fluorescence and biochemically by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with polyclonal anti-apoE, giving rise to a band of the expected size of ∼65 kDa with comparable intensity for both expressed apoE isoforms. Examination of the cell lines by confocal microscopy revealed EGFP-apoE throughout the cell in a reticulate structure that co-localized with RFP-ER (Fig. 1). Concentrations of the fusion proteins were highest in the perinuclear region with the characteristic morphology of the Golgi apparatus, which was negative for RFP-ER (Fig. 1). No obvious distribution differences were apparent between the expressed EGFP-apoE3 and EGFP-apoE4 (Fig. 1). Thus, the EGFP-tagged apoE isoforms have a normal intracellular distribution pattern in Neuro-2a cells, as reported for wild type apoE3 and apoE4 (13Xu Q. Brecht W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W.

To assess isoform-specific differences in apoE trafficking within the secretory pathway, we conducted FRAP measurements in Neuro-2a cells stably expressing EGFP-apoE3 or EGFP-apoE4 (Fig. 2). Base-line fluorescence was recorded for 10 s at 12.5 frames/s and low- intensity illumination (1 milliwatt) (Fig. 2, Aa and Ba). A 20-milliwatt high-energy circular argon laser beam (diameter, 5 μm; wavelength, 488 nm) was focused for ∼1.2 s on the ER or Golgi apparatus of individual Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 2, Ab and Bb). In both compartments, the fluorescence of EGFP molecules was reduced to ∼40% of base-line levels. The extent of bleaching was similar for both apoE isoforms (Fig. 3, A and B). During continuous recording at low-intensity illumination (1 milliwatt) after bleaching, unbleached molecules outside the bleached area, driven by active transport or diffusion, replaced mobile bleached molecules within the bleached area. This recovery of fluorescence intensity reached a plateau within 60 s (Fig. 2, Ac and 2Bc and Fig. 3, A and B).FIGURE 3ApoE4 decreases fluorescence recovery in the ER and Golgi apparatus and slows fluorescence recovery in the Golgi apparatus of Neuro-2a cells. A and B, FRAP measurements of EGFP-apoE3 and EGFP-apoE4 in the ER (A) and Golgi apparatus (B) are shown. The fluorescence recovery plateau of EGFP-apoE4 in the ER and Golgi apparatus is 14% lower than that of EGFP-apoE3. C, in the ER and Golgi apparatus, the immobile fraction of EGFP-apoE4 is ∼100% higher than that of EGFP-apoE3. D and E, shown are fluorescence recovery kinetics of EGFP-apoE3 and EGFP-apoE4 in the ER (D) and Golgi apparatus (E) after photobleaching. F, apoE4 has a prolonged half-maximal fluorescence recovery time in the Golgi apparatus. EGFP-apoE3, n = 15 experiments (98 cells) for ER; n = 16 experiments (102 cells) for Golgi apparatus; EGFP-apoE4, n = 15 experiments (97 cells) for ER; n = 16 experiments (110 cells) for Golgi apparatus. Values are the mean ± S.D. *, p < 0.001 versus apoE3 (two-tailed t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extent of the fluorescence recovery (i.e. the mobile fraction) in the ER and Golgi apparatus was significantly lower in EGFP-apoE4-expressing cells than in EGFP-apoE3-expressing cells, reaching 73.3 ± 3.7 and 71.7 ± 4.4% and reaching 86.1 ± 5.7 and 85.7 ± 2.8% of base-line fluorescence, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). The fluorescence intensity of the recovery plateau was lower than the pre-bleach base line, as some molecules were retained in the bleached area and are, therefore, not replaced by unbleached molecules during the experiment. Thus, the difference in fluorescence intensity between the pre-bleach base line and the recovery plateau-level reflects the immobile fraction (32Diliberto Jr., E.J. Axelrod J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The immobile fraction of apoE4 was about 100% higher than that of apoE3 in both the ER (26.7 ± 3.7% versus 13.9 ± 5.7%) and Golgi apparatus (28.3 ± 4.4% versus 14.3 ± 2.8%) (Fig. 3C). To measure the mobility of EGFP-apoE molecules along the secretory pathway, we determined the half-maximal fluorescence recovery times in the ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3, D and E). In the Golgi apparatus, EGFP-apoE4 molecules reached half-maximal recovery more slowly than EGFP-apoE3 molecules (8.9 ± 2 versus 4.7 ± 1.1 s); however, in the ER, half-maximal recovery times did not differ significantly between EGFP-apoE3 (6.9 ± 1.1 s) and EGFP-apoE4 (7.6 ± 2.1 s) (Fig. 3F). These findings suggest differences in the trafficking of apoE3 and apoE4 within the secretory pathway that specifically affect their transition through the Golgi apparatus. The transit time of protein cargoes through the secretory pathway is determined by several quality-control steps and is dependent on protein structure and proper folding (27Sitia R. Braakman I.

We hypothesized that domain interaction was responsible for the impaired intracellular trafficking of apoE4. To test this, we conducted FRAP measurements in Neuro-2a cells stably expressing EGFP-apoE4 fusion proteins carrying the R61T point mutation, which abolishes domain interaction (9Dong L.M. Wilson C.

The fluorescence recovery plateau of EGFP-apoE4-R61T was significantly higher than that of EGFP-apoE4 and comparable with that of EGFP-apoE3 in both the ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4, A and B). EGFP-apoE4-R61T reached recovery plateau levels of 83.8 ± 3.2% in the ER and 82.5 ± 5.1% in the Golgi apparatus; these values were similar to those of EGFP-apoE3 (86.1 ± 5.7 and 85.7 ± 2.8%) and differed significantly from those of EGFP-apoE4 (73.3 ± 3.7 and 71.7 ± 4.4%). Correspondingly, the immobile fraction of EGFP-apoE4-R61T in the ER (16.2 ± 3.2%) and Golgi apparatus (17.4 ± 5.1%) was about 60% that of EGFP-apoE4 (Fig. 4C); these values were comparable with those of EGFP-apoE3. Consistent with the similarity of the immobile fraction, the recovery kinetics of EGFP-apoE4-R61T and EGFP-apoE3 were similar in the ER (4.9 ± 2.1 versus 5.9 ± 1.1 s, respectively) and Golgi apparatus (4.1 ± 1.1 versus 4.7 ± 1.1 s) (Fig. 4, D–F). Like EGFP-apoE3, EGFP-apoE4-R61T had significantly faster recovery kinetics in the Golgi apparatus than EGFP-apoE4 (4.1 ± 1.1 versus 8.9 ± 2 s) (Fig. 4F). Thus, the lower mobility of EGFP-apoE4 molecules in the Golgi apparatus appears to be dependent on domain interaction. Next, we incubated EGFP-apoE4-expressing cells with 1 μm GIND25 (36Ye S. Huang Y. Müllendorff K. Dong L. Giedt G. Meng E.C. Cohen F.E. Kuntz I.D. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In cells treated for 72 h with GIND25, the fluorescence recovery plateau of EGFP-apoE4 (ER: 76.7 ± 7.6%, Golgi apparatus: 81.9 ± 5.5%) was similar to that of EGFP-apoE3 (ER, 79.4 ± 8.6%; Golgi apparatus, 81.5 ± 5.9%) and EGFP-apoE4-R61T (ER, 77.8 ± 7.3%; Golgi apparatus, 79.9 ± 3.8%) (Fig. 5, A and B). Likewise, after PH002 treatment, all three forms of apoE had similar fluorescence recovery plateaus (EGFP-apoE4: ER, 79.3 ± 3.9%; Golgi apparatus, 79.9 ± 3%; EGFP-apoE3: ER, 79.8 ± 2.9%; Golgi apparatus, 80.7 ± 3.2%; EGFP-apoE4-R61T: ER, 82.8 ± 2.11%; Golgi apparatus, 81.1 ± 5.8%) (Fig. 5, D and E). Accordingly, the immobile fractions in the ER and Golgi apparatus of apoE-expressing Neuro-2a cells treated with the compounds were indistinguishable (Fig. 5, C and F). The fact that treatment with small molecule structure correctors did not alter the extent of fluorescence recovery in EGFP-apoE3- and EGFP-apoE4-R61T-expressing cells indicates that both GIND25 and PH002 specifically affect apoE"
https://openalex.org/W2115953103,"Cellulose, a very abundant extracellular polysaccharide, is synthesized in a finely tuned process that involves the activity of glycosyl-transferases and hydrolases. The cellulose microfibril consists of bundles of linear β-1,4-glucan chains that are synthesized inside the cell; however, the mechanism by which these polymers traverse the cell membrane is currently unknown. In Gram-negative bacteria, the cellulose synthase complex forms a trans-envelope complex consisting of at least four subunits. Although three of these subunits account for the synthesis and translocation of the polysaccharide, the fourth subunit, BcsZ, is a periplasmic protein with endo-β-1,4-glucanase activity. BcsZ belongs to family eight of glycosyl-hydrolases, and its activity is required for optimal synthesis and membrane translocation of cellulose. In this study we report two crystal structures of BcsZ from Escherichia coli. One structure shows the wild-type enzyme in its apo form, and the second structure is for a catalytically inactive mutant of BcsZ in complex with the substrate cellopentaose. The structures demonstrate that BcsZ adopts an (α/α)(6)-barrel fold and that it binds four glucan moieties of cellopentaose via highly conserved residues exclusively on the nonreducing side of its catalytic center. Thus, the BcsZ-cellopentaose structure most likely represents a posthydrolysis state in which the newly formed nonreducing end has already left the substrate binding pocket while the enzyme remains attached to the truncated polysaccharide chain. We further show that BcsZ efficiently degrades β-1,4-glucans in in vitro cellulase assays with carboxymethyl-cellulose as substrate."

A key component of cellulase action on cellulose is product inhibition from monosaccharide and disaccharides in the product site of cellulase tunnel. The absolute binding free energy of cellobiose and glucose to the product site of the catalytic tunnel of the Family 7 cellobiohydrolase (Cel7A) of Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) was calculated using two different approaches: steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations and alchemical free energy perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations. For the SMD approach, three methods based on Jarzynski's equality were used to construct the potential of mean force from multiple pulling trajectories. The calculated binding free energies, −14.4 kcal/mol using SMD and −11.2 kcal/mol using FEP/MD, are in good qualitative agreement. Analysis of the SMD pulling trajectories suggests that several protein residues (Arg-251, Asp-259, Asp-262, Trp-376, and Tyr-381) play key roles in cellobiose and glucose binding to the catalytic tunnel. Five mutations (R251A, D259A, D262A, W376A, and Y381A) were made computationally to measure the changes in free energy during the product expulsion process. The absolute binding free energies of cellobiose to the catalytic tunnel of these five mutants are −13.1, −6.0, −11.5, −7.5, and −8.8 kcal/mol, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1977630813,"Mutations in the type II transmembrane serine protease 3 (TMPRSS3) gene cause non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (DFNB8/10), characterized by congenital or childhood onset bilateral profound hearing loss. In order to explore the physiopathology of TMPRSS3 related deafness, we have generated an ethyl-nitrosourea-induced mutant mouse carrying a protein-truncating nonsense mutation in Tmprss3 (Y260X) and characterized the functional and histological consequences of Tmprss3 deficiency. Auditory brainstem response revealed that wild type and heterozygous mice have normal hearing thresholds up to 5 months of age, whereas Tmprss3(Y260X) homozygous mutant mice exhibit severe deafness. Histological examination showed degeneration of the organ of Corti in adult mutant mice. Cochlear hair cell degeneration starts at the onset of hearing, postnatal day 12, in the basal turn and progresses very rapidly toward the apex, reaching completion within 2 days. Given that auditory and vestibular deficits often co-exist, we evaluated the balancing abilities of Tmprss3(Y260X) mice by using rotating rod and vestibular behavioral tests. Tmprss3(Y260X) mice effectively displayed mild vestibular syndrome that correlated histologically with a slow degeneration of saccular hair cells. In situ hybridization in the developing inner ear showed that Tmprss3 mRNA is localized in sensory hair cells in the cochlea and the vestibule. Our results show that Tmprss3 acts as a permissive factor for cochlear hair cells survival and activation at the onset of hearing and is required for saccular hair cell survival. This mouse model will certainly help to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying DFNB8/10 deafness and cochlear function."
https://openalex.org/W2129120827,"Class I fungal hydrophobins form amphipathic monolayers composed of amyloid rodlets. This is a remarkable case of functional amyloid formation in that a hydrophobic:hydrophilic interface is required to trigger the self-assembly of the proteins. The mechanism of rodlet formation and the role of the interface in this process have not been well understood. Here, we have studied the effect of a range of additives, including ionic liquids, alcohols, and detergents, on rodlet formation by two class I hydrophobins, EAS and DewA. Although the conformation of the hydrophobins in these different solutions is not altered, we observe that the rate of rodlet formation is slowed as the surface tension of the solution is decreased, regardless of the nature of the additive. These results suggest that interface properties are of critical importance for the recruitment, alignment, and structural rearrangement of the amphipathic hydrophobin monomers. This work gives insight into the forces that drive macromolecular assembly of this unique family of proteins and allows us to propose a three-stage model for the interface-driven formation of rodlets."

Decreased activities of key tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle enzymes may underlie this abnormality and are highly correlated to the clinical state of the patient. The activity of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC), an arguably rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle, declines with AD, but the mechanism of inactivation and whether it can be reversed remains unknown. KGDHC consists of multiple copies of three subunits. KGDHC is sensitive to oxidative stress, which is pervasive in AD brain. The present studies tested the mechanism for the peroxynitrite-induced inactivation and subsequent reactivation of purified and cellular KGDHC. Peroxynitrite inhibited purified KGDHC activity in a dose-dependent manner and reduced subunit immunoreactivity and increased nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. Nano-LC-MS/MS showed that the inactivation was related to nitration of specific tyrosine residues in the three subunits. GSH diminished the nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity of peroxynitrite-treated KGDHC, restored the activity and the immunoreactivity for KGDHC. Nano-LC-MS/MS showed this was related to de-nitration of specific tyrosine residues, suggesting KGDHC may have a denitrase activity. Treatment of N2a cells with peroxynitrite for 5 min followed by recovery of cells for 24 h reduced KGDHC activity and increased nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. Increasing cellular GSH in peroxynitrite-treated cells rescued KGDHC activity to the control level. The results suggest that restoring KGDHC activity is possible and may be a useful therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative diseases.

Oxidants that are increased in neurodegenerative diseases have been shown to regulate the TCA cycle enzymes at multiple levels. For example, oxidants modulate expression of genes in the TCA cycle (1Au H.C. Scheffler I.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 2Miranda S. Foncea R.

The current studies focus on the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) because it is reduced in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and is sensitive to a variety of oxidants. KGDHC is arguably the rate controlling enzyme complex in the TCA cycle. KGDHC consists of multiple copies of three subunits: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1k, EC 1.2.4.2), dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (E2k, EC 2.3.1.61), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3, EC 1.6.4.3). In Escherichia coli, multiple copies of E1k (12 dimers) and E3 (6 dimers) are arranged along the edges and faces, respectively, of an octahedral E2k core (24 subunits) to form a multienzyme complex with a molecular weight of around 5 × 106 dalton (9Pettit F.H. Hamilton L. Munk P. Namihira G. Eley M.H. Willms C.R. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5282-5290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise molecular weight and subunit composition of KGDHC and how it may vary with function in mammalian systems remains unknown. The mechanism of the inactivation of KGDHC in disease is unknown. Diminished activity of KGDHC occurs in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including AD (10Butterworth R.F. Besnard A.M. Metab.

The relations are most extensively studied in AD in which impaired glucose metabolism and enhanced oxidative stress exist (15Benson D.F. Kuhl D.E. Hawkins R.A. Phelps M.E. Cummings J.L. Tsai S.Y.

Raina A.K. Perry G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). In AD patients, the diminished activities of KGDHC and other TCA cycle enzymes are highly correlated to the clinical dementia rating score before the patients died (20Bubber P. Haroutunian V. Fisch G. Blass J.P. Gibson G.E. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This suggests that these TCA cycle enzymes may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD. Thus, understanding the mechanism by which these enzymes are altered in these diseases would contribute to the knowledge of the disease pathology. The current studies focus on one of these enzymes, KGDHC. One subunit of the KGDH complex, E3, is shared with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). Post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. A commonly found oxidative modification in neurodegenerative diseases is the nitration of tyrosines, which is mainly induced by peroxynitrite (21Abello N. Kerstjens H.A. Postma D.S. Bischoff R. J. Proteome. Res. 2009; 8: 3222-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Excessive nitration occurs in brains of patients that died with AD. Peroxynitrite is a reactive nitrogen species (RNS) formed by the near diffusion-limited reaction of superoxide with nitric oxide (22Nauser T. Merkofer M. Kissner R. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Padmaja S. Huie R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Superoxide can be generated from the mitochondrial electron chain and KGDHC. Nitric oxide is produced by the three isoforms of the nitric-oxide synthase. KGDHC is inactivated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (6Gibson G.E. Huang H.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For example, hydrogen peroxide inactivates KGDHC activity in intact cardiac mitochondria, fibroblasts, and N2a cells (4Chinopoulos C. Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 5Gibson G.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Jeitner T.M. Xu H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23357-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite reduces KGDHC activity and selectively alters immunoreactivity of E1k and E2k (24Park L.C. Zhang H. Sheu K.F. Calingasan N.Y. Kristal B.S. Lindsay J.G. Gibson G.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1948-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory mechanism of KGDHC by peroxynitrite including possible post-translational modification has not been reported. This could be due to the complexity and low abundance of KGDHC in brain, which has made identification of exact modification sites of KGDHC by mass spectrometry very difficult. We focused these studies on nitration because it is stable over a long time of period compared with other labile modifications such as S-nitrosation or glutathionylation. Nitration is likely to be reversed as growing evidence supports the denitration of proteins in many biological systems including tissue homogenates, activated macrophages and crude extracts from different organs (25Bian K.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10498-10505Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the molecular identity of the denitrase activity is still unknown. The large molecular weight and complex structure of KGDHC makes investigation of its oxidative modifications difficult. Thus, the current experiments employed multiple approaches. Clear- or Blue-Native gel has the advantage of allowing the study of protein complexes with molecular weight up to 10 MDa and preserving enzyme activity after electrophoresis (31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). By combining proteomic tools including denaturing and native gel electrophoresis and a nano-LC-MS/MS system, the current studies tested whether distinct nitration sites underlie the oxidant induced deficits in KGDHC and whether the resulting nitration could be reversed. KGDHC (200 μl; Cat No. K1502; Sigma) was further purified by loading the protein onto a 2% ABT agarose column (0.7 × 50 cm) (Agarose Bead Technologies, Tampa, FL) to remove bovine serum albumin. The five fractions with the highest KGDHC activity from four column purifications were pooled and treated with 0, 1, or 10 μm peroxynitrite (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were then concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit 100 (Millipore; Billerica, MA). The concentrated samples were immediately processed for KGDHC activity measurement, SDS gel, Clear- or Blue-native gel electrophoresis and Western blotting detection. In experiments testing the reversal of nitration by GSH, purified KGDHC was treated with 0 and 10 μm peroxynitrite at 37 °C for 15 min (two identical reactions were included for the 10 μm peroxynitrite treatment). Then, 5 mm GSH was added to one of the peroxynitrite-treated samples. All samples including 0, 10 μm peroxynitrite, and 10 μm peroxynitrite + 5 mm GSH were incubated for another 15 min at 37 °C. All samples were then processed as described in the previous paragraph. N2a neuroblastoma cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas; VA). The cells in 100-mm dish were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 and 95% air in the complete medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). Cells were treated with peroxynitrite as described previously with slight modification (32Ye Y. Quijano C. Robinson K.M. Ricart K.C. Strayer A.L. Sahawneh M.A. Shacka J.J. Kirk M. Barnes S. Accavitti-Loper M.A. Radi R. Beckman J.S. Estévez A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6324-6337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) Cells were treated with different concentrations of peroxynitrite (0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mm) for 5 min and allowed to recover in normal medium or medium containing 1 mm NAC for 24 h. Cells were harvested and the KGDHC activity was measured in cell lysates. Detailed methods are described in supplemental Method S1. After treatment, cell pellets were processed differently for different measurements (see detailed procedures in each section below). KGDHC catalyzes the following reaction: α-ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA → succinyl CoA + CO2 + NADH. Two independent, well established assays were used to measure KGDHC activities. Both methods use the specific substrate α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to distinguish NADH production from KGDHC to that from other enzymes (i.e. substrate specificity). One method assays activity in purified enzyme or cell lysates whereas the other assesses the activity of the enzyme in a clear native gel. Purified enzyme samples were used directly for KGDHC activity measurements. Cell pellets were immediately resuspended with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm DTT) for 30 min with shaking at 4 °C. After the 30-min incubation, cell lysates were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle for 12 times on ice. KGDHC activity was assayed as described previously (11Gibson G.E. Sheu K.F. Blass J.P. Baker A. Carlson K.C. Harding B. Perrino P. Arch. Neurol. 1988; 45: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The basis of the in-gel activity staining is very similar to the lysis method except that the reducing equivalents are coupled to nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) (33Park L.C. Calingasan N.Y. Sheu K.F. Gibson G.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The specificity again depends upon the substrate. Equal amount of samples (10 μg) were loaded to clear native gels. After electrophoresis, the clear native gel was washed once with the reaction mixture (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6; 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3 mm TPP, 5 μg/ml rotenone in ethanol, and 3.5% polyvinylalcohol). Then 10 ml of assay mix (3 mm β-NAD, 1 mm CoA, 3 mm α-KG, 0.75 mm NBT, 0.05 mm phenazine methosulfate (PMS) in reaction mixture) was added to the gel to stain the KGDHC activity. An assay mix without CoA and α-KG was added to a duplicate gel and used as the blank. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by washing the gel with distilled water. For SDS-PAGE, a 5× SDS-sample loading dye (50% glycerol, 250 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10 mm EDTA, 10% SDS, and 0.04% bromphenol blue) was added to either purified enzyme or cell lysates to achieve 1× final concentration. Electrophoresis was done with a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using 120 volts for 2.5 h. For Blue-native gel electrophoresis, NativePAGETM Sample buffer (4×) was added to samples to make 1× final concentration. About 6 μg of protein was loaded into each well, and the electrophoresis was done with a NativePAGETM Novex® 3–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) using 50 volts for overnight according to the manufacturer's instruction. Unlike Blue-native gel electrophoresis, the cathode buffer for clear native gel electrophoresis contains no NativePAGETM 20X Cathode Buffer Additive (0.4% Coomassie® G-250). Western blotting was performed as described in supplemental Method S2. The protein gel bands were excised from the SDS or Blue-Native gels. The gel bands were reduced with 10 mm of DTT and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide, and then digested with Sequence Grade Modified Trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer at 37 °C overnight. The digestion products were extracted twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile and 1.0% trifluoroacetic acid, respectively. The extracted mixture was dried by SpeedVac and dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% tri-fluoroacetic acid. Half of the extracts were injected for LC-MS/MS analysis. For LC-MS/MS analysis, each digestion product was separated by a 60-min gradient elution with the Dionex U3000 capillary/nano-HPLC system (Dionex; Sunnyvale, CA) at a flow rate of 0.250 μl/min that is directly interfaced with the Thermo-Fisher LTQ-Obritrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, California) operated in data-dependent scan mode. The analytical column was a home-made fused silica capillary column (75 μm ID, 100 mm length; Upchurch, Oak Harbor, Washington) packed with C-18 resin (300 A, 5 μm, Varian, Palo Alto, California). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The 60 min gradients with 250 nl/min flow rate for B solvent went from 0 to 55% in 34 min and then in 4 min to 80%. The B solvent stayed at 80% for another 8 min and then decreased to 5% in 8 min. Another 6 min was used for equilibration, loading and washing. The mass acquisition method was one FT-MS scan followed by 6 subsequent MS/MS scan in the ion trap. The FT-MS scan was acquired at resolution 30,000 in the Orbi-trap. The six most intense peaks from the FT full scan were selected in the ion trap for MS/MS. Data were analyzed using the MASCOT software search algorithm and manual inspection. Nitrated peptides and un-nitrated peptides are chemically similar to one another, and it is reasonable to expect that they exhibited similar ionization efficiencies. The relative quantification of nitrated tyrosines and un-nitrated tyrosines was accomplished by comparing the peak intensity of the corresponding nitrated peptides and unnitrated peptides. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Mitochondria were isolated from N2a cells by modification of a previous method (34Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. Chinopoulos C. Lorenzo B.J. Browne S.E. Patel M.S. Beal M.F. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7779-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Detailed methods are described in supplemental Method S3. Mitoplast preparation (35Hansson Petersen C.A. Alikhani N. Behbahani H. Wiehager B. Pavlov P.F. Alafuzoff I. Leinonen V. Ito A. Winblad B. Glaser E. Ankarcrona M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13145-13150Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and KGHDC purifications are described in supplemental Method S4. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was utilized to pull down nitrated KGDHC from N2a cells treated with peroxynitrite. Cell pellets (see “Cell Culture and Treatment”) were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Then cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. Cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were saved, and the pellets were resuspended with 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer and subjected to above steps to re-extract cellular proteins. Supernatants combined from two centrifugations were precleared by adding 1.0 μg of normal mouse IgG and 20 μl of resuspended protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (1.2 ml) were transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube and 12.5 μl of nitrotyrosine antibody (Abcam; Cambridge, MA, 0.25 μg/μl) was added. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, 20 μl of resuspended protein A/G PLUS-agarose was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C on a rocking platform overnight. Immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer by incubating the resuspension for 10 min with gently rocking in the cold room followed by centrifugation (1,000 × g/5 min). After the final wash, the pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of 1× electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses. Total RNA was isolated from cell pellets by an RNesay Plus Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the isolated total RNA using a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) with anchored oligo(dT)18 as primer. Real-time PCR of E1k, E2k, and E3 was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system with pre-designed Taqman® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by modification of a published method (36Shi Q. Karuppagounder S.S. Xu H. Pechman D. Chen H. Gibson G.E. Neurochem. Int. 2007; 50: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as described in supplemental Method S5. Treatment of purified KGDHC with peroxynitrite inhibited KGDHC activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Peroxynitrite, as low as 1 μm, diminished KGDHC activity by 40% (Fig. 1A). Similarly, 1 μm peroxynitrite reduced KGDHC activity by 42% as measured by in gel activity staining (Fig. 1B). Whether peroxynitrite induces nitration of KGDHC was determined by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting using an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2A). The lower concentration of peroxynitrite (1 μm) significantly reduced the immunoreactivity of E1k only (Fig. 2B). While the immunoreactivities of E1k, E2k, and E3 were all decreased significantly in response to the higher concentration of peroxynitrite (10 μm) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the immunoreactivity of nitrotyrosine increased with increasing concentration of peroxynitrite (Fig. 2, A and B). Western blotting following blue-native gel electrophoresis was also utilized to determine the nitration of KGDHC. Higher shifted bands occurred in all three subunits of KGDHC that were treated with peroxynitrite as compared with untreated ones (Fig. 3). Multiple up shifted bands (greater than the 1263-kDa band) were mainly observed in 10 μm peroxynitrite-treated KGDHC. They are likely the up-shifted subunits that are nitrated by peroxynitrite. Similarly, the immunoreactivity of nitrotyrosine increased with increasing concentration of peroxynitrite. The modification sites in KGDHC were further investigated by nano-LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. Purified KGDHC was incubated with peroxynitrite and then processed for SDS and/or Blue native gel electrophoresis. The bands were cut and analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. The tyrosine in positions Tyr-175 and Tyr-556 in E1k of KGDHC were nitrated by peroxynitrite as determined by both MS and MS/MS analysis. For example, the mass of a peptide ion at m/z 758.85 matches to the mass of the nitrated 172LGFY*GLDESDLDK184, in which the peptide mass has the 45 dalton mass increase corresponding to the incorporation of a -NO2 group in the peptide. The MS/MS spectrum of this peptide ion at 758.85 allowed us to determine that Tyr-175 was nitrated as shown in Fig. 4. Following a similar procedure, the residue Tyr-313 in E2k (supplemental Fig. S1A) and the residues Tyr-352 and Tyr-416 (supplemental Fig. S1B) in the E3 subunit of KGDHC were also found to be nitrated by peroxynitrite. Furthermore, the percent nitrated tyrosine in the three subunits of KGDHC was calculated by using a relative quantitative method (see “Experimental Procedures”). MS-identified nitration sites and the percentage of nitrated tyrosine in each subunit are summarized in Table 1. The percent of nitration in Tyr-175 and Tyr-556 of E1k is 19 and 23%, respectively. The percent of nitration in Tyr-313 of E2k is 39%. The percent nitration in Tyr-352 and Tyr-416 in E3 is 13 and 46%, respectively.TABLE 1Summary of peroxynitrite-induced modification in purified KGDHCSubunitModificationaa% NitrationType of Gel/digestionE1kNitrationY17519SDS gel/Blue-native gel/trypsinY55623SDS gel/Blue-native gel/trypsinE2kNitrationY31339SDS-gel/Blue-native gel/trypsinE3NitrationY35213SDS gel/trypsinY41646SDS gel/trypsin Open table in a new tab If the nitration serves as a signal, then it should be reversible. KGDHC that is inactivated by H2O2 or oxidant can be reactivated with glutathione (8Nulton-Persson A.C. Szweda L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23357-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, reduced glutathione (GSH) was added after treatment of KGDHC with peroxynitrite to determine whether glutathione would alter the nitration. The consequences on KGDHC were assessed by measuring the change in KGDHC activity and by Western blotting with the anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. Peroxynitrite (10 μm) reduced KGDHC activity by 74% (Fig. 5A). Addition of GSH after incubation of KGDHC with peroxynitrite restored the activity to levels comparable to those of the untreated KGDHC (Fig. 5A). Incubation of peroxynitrite-treated KGDHC with GSH reduced the immunoreactivity of nitrotyrosine (Fig. 5, B and C). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed very specific changes in the reversal of nitration following incubation with GSH. Peroxynitrite induced a 13 and 46% nitration in the Tyr-352 and Tyr-416, respectively, in E3 (Table 2). The percent nitration in these two tyrosine residues was reduced to zero following GSH incubation (Table 2). While the nitration of E2k (34%) was reduced by about half after subsequent GSH incubation (15%) (Table 2).TABLE 2Denitration of KGDHC by GSH following peroxynitrite demonstrated by LC-MS/MSSubunitUntreatedPeroxynitriteGSH following peroxynitriteE2kEVVY(313)REVVY(313)REVVY(313)R% nitration0%34%15%E3IPNIY(352)AIGDIPNIY(352)AIGDIPNIY(352)AIGD% nitration0%13%0%SEEQLKEEGIEY(416)KSEEQLKEEGIEY(416)KSEEQLKEEGIEY(416)K% nitration0%46%0% Open table in a new tab Peroxynitrite decreased KGDHC activity in a dose-dependent manner in N2a cells.

The purity of KGDHC was demonstrated by its significantly higher specific activity (>59 fold) than the starting homogenate (cell lysate). Immunoprecipitation (IP) of cells after peroxynitrite treatment with a nitrotyrosine antibody further confirmed the colocalization of KGDHC with nitrotyrosine (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7Colocalization of KGDHC and nitrotyrosine following treatment of N2a cells with peroxynitrite.

Here we isolated a novel extracellular polysaccharide from the biofilm of Thermus aquaticus YT-1 and evaluated its structure and immunomodulatory effects. The size of this polysaccharide, TA-1, was deduced by size-exclusion chromatography as 500 kDa. GC-MS, high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection, electrospray ionization-MS/MS, and NMR revealed the novel structure of TA-1. The polysaccharide is composed of tetrasaccharide-repeating units of galactofuranose, galactopyranose, and N-acetylgalactosamine (1:1:2) and lacked acidic sugars. TA-1 stimulated macrophage cells to produce the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Screening of Toll-like receptors and antibody-blocking experiments indicated that the natural receptor of TA-1 in its immunoactivity is TLR2. Recognition of TA-1 by TLR2 was confirmed by TA-1 induction of IL-6 production in peritoneal macrophages from wild-type mice but not from TLR2(-/-) mice. TA-1, as a TLR2 agonist, could possibly be used as an adjuvant and could enhance cytokine release, which increases the immune response. Furthermore, TA-1 induced cytokine release is dependent on MyD88/TIRAP."
https://openalex.org/W2004778652,"Estrogen receptor is a nuclear receptor superfamily member of transcriptional activators that regulate gene expression by recruiting diverese transcriptional coregulators. The Mediator complex is a central transcriptional coactivator complex that acts as a bridge between transcriptional activators and RNA polymerase II. MED1 (Mediator subunit 1) is the key Mediator subunit that directly interacts with estrogen receptor to mediate its functions both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, our previous biochemical analyses indicated that MED1 exists only in a subpopulation of the Mediator complex that is enriched with a number of distinct Mediator subunits and RNA polymerase II. Here, we report ARGLU1 as a MED1/Mediator-associated protein. We found that ARGLU1 (arginine and glutamate rich 1) not only colocalizes with MED1 in the nucleus, but also directly interacts with a far C-terminal region of MED1. Reporter assays indicate that ARGLU1 is able to cooperate with MED1 to regulate estrogen receptor-mediated gene transcription. Importantly, ARGLU1 is recruited, in a ligand-dependent manner, to endogenous estrogen receptor target gene promoters and is required for their expression. Furthermore, by ChIP-reChIP assay, we confirm that ARGLU1 and MED1 colocalize on the same estrogen receptor target gene promoter upon estrogen induction. Moreover, we found that depletion of ARGLU1 significantly impairs the growth, as well as anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation of breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results establish ARGLU1 as a new MED1-interacting protein required for estrogen-dependent gene transcription and breast cancer cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2034917756,"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) has been recently described as the cause for most human Merkel cell carcinomas. MCV is similar to simian virus 40 (SV40) and encodes a nuclear large T (LT) oncoprotein that is usually mutated to eliminate viral replication among tumor-derived MCV. We identified the hVam6p cytoplasmic protein involved in lysosomal processing as a novel interactor with MCV LT but not SV40 LT. hVam6p binds through its clathrin heavy chain homology domain to a unique region of MCV LT adjacent to the retinoblastoma binding site. MCV LT translocates hVam6p to the nucleus, sequestering it from involvement in lysosomal trafficking. A naturally occurring, tumor-derived mutant LT (MCV350) lacking a nuclear localization signal binds hVam6p but fails to inhibit hVam6p-induced lysosomal clustering. MCV has evolved a novel mechanism to target hVam6p that may contribute to viral uncoating or egress through lysosomal processing during virus replication."

However, the G15L/G18L/G25L triple mutant exhibited reductions in cell surface homo-oligomerization (>10-fold) and the rate of selective lipid uptake (∼2-fold). Gly18 and Gly25 were necessary for normal lipid uptake activity of SR-BI and the SR-BI/croquemort chimera. The lipid uptake activity of the glycine motif-deficient SR-BI/LIMP II chimera was low but could be increased by introducing glycines at positions 18 and 25.

Plk1 localizes to specific subcellular structures through the targeting activity of the C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD). Disruption of the PBD function results in improper bipolar spindle formation, chromosome missegregation, and cytokinesis defect that ultimately lead to the generation of aneuploidy. It has been shown that Plk1 recruits itself to centromeres by phosphorylating and binding to a centromere scaffold, PBIP1 (also called MLF1IP and CENP-U[50]) through its PBD. However, how PBIP1 itself is targeted to centromeres and what roles it plays in the regulation of Plk1-dependent mitotic events remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that PBIP1 directly interacts with CENP-Q, and this interaction was mutually required not only for their stability but also for their centromere localization. Plk1 did not appear to interact with CENP-Q directly. However, Plk1 formed a ternary complex with PBIP1 and CENP-Q through a self-generated p-T78 motif on PBIP1.

Among them, Plk1 has been most extensively studied not only because of its essential role during M-phase progression but also because of its strongly conserved function from budding yeast to human.It has been shown that Plk1 localizes to centrosomes and centromeres/kinetochores at the late stage of the cell cycle, and remains at these locations until telophase. Plk1 localization to centrosomes is important to promote proper centrosome maturation and centrosome-based microtubule nucleation (11Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J.

Although the physiological significance of PBIP1-dependent self-recruitment of Plk1 to interphase and mitotic centromeres is yet to be further determined, the importance of PBIP1 in this event suggests that PBIP1 serves as a crucial scaffold for Plk1-dependent mitotic regulation at this site. However, how PBIP1 itself is targeted to centromeres and whether PBIP1-bound Plk1 regulates the localization and delocalization of PBIP1 and its binding target(s) to and from the centromere are not known. Data obtained from the affinity purification of CENP-A-containing nucleosomes from human cultured cells suggest that PBIP1 is a component of the CENP-A nucleosome-associated complex (NAC) (13Foltz D.R.

Other studies show that PBIP1 closely interacts with a set of proteins called CENP-O class proteins, namely CENP-O, CENP-P, and CENP-Q (20Hori T. Okada M. Maenaka K. Fukagawa T. Mol. Biol.

Yates 3rd, J.R. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the interactions between PBIP1 and its binding targets at kinetochores are likely complex.In this study, we demonstrated that a CENP-A NAC component, PBIP1, forms a binary complex with a CAD component, CENP-Q, to promote their mutual stability and subcellular localization to interphase and mitotic centromeres. We further showed that Plk1 forms a ternary complex with PBIP1 and CENP-Q by generating and binding to the p-T78 motif on PBIP1. This step was crucially required for Plk1 to phosphorylate PBIP1-bound CENP-Q and to induce delocalization of the complex from mitotic centromeres. This study reveals the first example of how a scaffold mediates Plk1-dependent phosphorylation onto a third protein and sheds light on the mechanism of how Plk1 interacts with the PBIP1-CENP-Q complex and regulates its dissociation from mitotic kinetochores.

In anaphase, a fraction of Plk1 localizes to the spindle midzone (later, it becomes midbody) (16Golsteyn R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J.

Moulaei T. Lim D. Bang J.K. Park J.E. Shenoy S.R. Liu F. Kang Y.H. Liao C. Soung N.K. Lee S. Yoon D.Y. Lim Y. Lee D.H. Otaka A. Appella E. McMahon J.B. Nicklaus M.C. Burke Jr., T.R. Yaffe M.B.

Although the physiological significance of PBIP1-dependent self-recruitment of Plk1 to interphase and mitotic centromeres is yet to be further determined, the importance of PBIP1 in this event suggests that PBIP1 serves as a crucial scaffold for Plk1-dependent mitotic regulation at this site. However, how PBIP1 itself is targeted to centromeres and whether PBIP1-bound Plk1 regulates the localization and delocalization of PBIP1 and its binding target(s) to and from the centromere are not known. Data obtained from the affinity purification of CENP-A-containing nucleosomes from human cultured cells suggest that PBIP1 is a component of the CENP-A nucleosome-associated complex (NAC) (13Foltz D.R. Jansen L.E. Black B.E. Bailey A.O. Yates 3rd, J.R. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Other studies show that PBIP1 closely interacts with a set of proteins called CENP-O class proteins, namely CENP-O, CENP-P, and CENP-Q (20Hori T. Okada M. Maenaka K. Fukagawa T. Mol. Biol.

These observations suggest that the interactions between PBIP1 and its binding targets at kinetochores are likely complex.In this study, we demonstrated that a CENP-A NAC component, PBIP1, forms a binary complex with a CAD component, CENP-Q, to promote their mutual stability and subcellular localization to interphase and mitotic centromeres. We further showed that Plk1 forms a ternary complex with PBIP1 and CENP-Q by generating and binding to the p-T78 motif on PBIP1. This step was crucially required for Plk1 to phosphorylate PBIP1-bound CENP-Q and to induce delocalization of the complex from mitotic centromeres. This study reveals the first example of how a scaffold mediates Plk1-dependent phosphorylation onto a third protein and sheds light on the mechanism of how Plk1 interacts with the PBIP1-CENP-Q complex and regulates its dissociation from mitotic kinetochores."
https://openalex.org/W2044636054,"Ligand-induced disorder-to-order transition plays a key role in the biological functions of many proteins that contain intrinsically disordered regions. This trait is exhibited by so-called RTX (repeat-in-toxin) motifs found in many virulence factors secreted by numerous gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: RTX proteins are natively disordered in the absence of calcium but fold upon calcium binding. The adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) produced by Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, contains ∼40 RTX motifs organized in five successive blocks separated by non-RTX flanking regions. This RTX domain mediates toxin binding to its eukaryotic cell receptor. We previously showed that the last block of the RTX domain, block V, which is critical for CyaA toxicity, exhibits the hallmarks of intrinsically disordered proteins in the absence of calcium. Moreover, the C-terminal flanking region of CyaA block V is required for its calcium-induced folding. Here, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the hydrodynamic and electrophoretic properties of several block V RTX polypeptides that differ in the presence and/or length of the flanking regions. Our results indicate that the length of the C-terminal flanking region not only controls the calcium-induced folding but also the calcium-induced multimerization of the RTX polypeptides. Moreover, we showed that calcium binding is accompanied by a strong reduction of the net charge of the RTX polypeptides. These data indicate that the disorder-to-order transition in RTX proteins is controlled by a calcium-induced change of the polypeptide charges and stabilized by multimerization."

Previous studies of pyranose 2-oxidase (P2O), an enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of pyranoses using oxygen as an electron acceptor to generate oxidized sugars and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), have shown that C4a-hydroperoxyflavin forms in P2O reactions before it eliminates H2O2 as a product (Sucharitakul, J., Prongjit, M., Haltrich, D., and Chaiyen, P. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 8485–8490). In this report, the solvent kinetic isotope effects (SKIE) on the reaction of reduced P2O with oxygen were investigated using transient kinetics. Our results showed that D2O has a negligible effect on the formation of C4a-hydroperoxyflavin. The ensuing step of H2O2 elimination from C4a-hydroperoxyflavin was shown to be modulated by an SKIE of 2.8 ± 0.2, and a proton inventory analysis of this step indicates a linear plot. These data suggest that a single-proton transfer process causes SKIE at the H2O2 elimination step. Double and single mixing stopped-flow experiments performed in H2O buffer revealed that reduced flavin specifically labeled with deuterium at the flavin N5 position generated kinetic isotope effects similar to those found with experiments performed with the enzyme pre-equilibrated in D2O buffer. This suggests that the proton at the flavin N5 position is responsible for the SKIE and is the proton-in-flight that is transferred during the transition state. The mechanism of H2O2 elimination from C4a-hydroperoxyflavin is consistent with a single proton transfer from the flavin N5 to the peroxide leaving group, possibly via the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bridge.

https://openalex.org/W2143392718,"Complete lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency uniformly results in a profound HDL deficiency. We recently reported unexpected enhanced insulin sensitivity in LCAT knock-out mice in the LDL receptor knock-out background (Ldlr(-/-)×Lcat(-/-); double knock-out (DKO)), when compared with their Ldlr(-/-)×Lcat(+/+) (single knock-out (SKO)) controls. Here, we report that LCAT-deficient mice (DKO and Lcat(-/-)) are protected against high fat high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced obesity without hypophagia in a gender-specific manner compared with their respective (SKO and WT) controls. The metabolic phenotypes are more pronounced in the females. Changes in endoplasmic reticulum stress were examined as a possible mechanism for the metabolic protection. The female DKO mice developed attenuated HFHS-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress as evidenced by a lack of increase in mRNA levels of the hepatic unfolded protein response (UPR) markers Grp78 and CHOP compared with SKO controls. The DKO female mice were also protected against diet-induced insulin resistance. In white adipose tissue of chow-fed DKO mice, we also observed a reduction in UPR, gene markers for adipogenesis, and markers for activation of Wnt signaling. In skeletal muscles of female DKO mice, we observed an unexpected increase in UCP1 in association with increase in phospho-AMPKα, PGC1α, and UCP3 expressions. This increase in UCP1 was associated with ectopic islands of brown adipocytes between skeletal muscle fibers. Our findings suggest that LCAT deficiency confers gender-specific protection against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance at least in part through regulation in UPR, white adipose tissue adipogenesis, and brown adipocyte partitioning."

CETP almost completely restored the abnormal HDL-C distribution in SR-BI-deficient mice. However, it did not normalize the elevated plasma free to total cholesterol ratio characteristic of hepatic SR-BI deficiency. Red blood cell and platelet count abnormalities observed in mice liver deficient for SR-BI were partially restored by CETP, but the elevated erythrocyte cholesterol to phopholipid ratio remained unchanged. Complete deletion of SR-BI was associated with diminished adrenal cholesterol stores, whereas hepatic SR-BI deficiency resulted in a significant increase in adrenal gland cholesterol content. In both mouse models, CETP had no impact on adrenal cholesterol metabolism. In diet-induced atherosclerosis studies, hepatic SR-BI deficiency accelerated aortic lipid lesion formation in both CETP-expressing (4-fold) and non-CETP-expressing (8-fold) mice when compared with controls. Impaired macrophage to feces reverse cholesterol transport in mice deficient for SR-BI in liver, which was not corrected by CETP, most likely contributed by such an increase in atherosclerosis susceptibility. Finally, comparison of the atherosclerosis burden in SR-BI liver-deficient and fully deficient mice demonstrated that SR-BI exerted an atheroprotective activity in extra-hepatic tissues whether CETP was present or not.

We characterized the ATP hydrolysis mechanism of CDC-48.1, a p97 homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans. The ATPase activity of the N-terminal AAA domain was very low at physiological temperature, whereas the C-terminal AAA domain showed high ATPase activity in a coordinated fashion with positive cooperativity. The cooperativity and coordination are generated by different mechanisms because a noncooperative mutant still showed the coordination. Interestingly, the growth speed of yeast cells strongly related to the positive cooperativity rather than the ATPase activity itself, suggesting that the positive cooperativity is critical for the essential functions of p97."
https://openalex.org/W1987198028,"The N-terminal six-transmembrane domain (TM) bundle of lactose permease of Escherichia coli is uniformly inverted when assembled in membranes lacking phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Inversion is dependent on the net charge of cytoplasmically exposed protein domains containing positive and negative residues, net charge of the membrane surface, and low hydrophobicity of TM VII acting as a molecular hinge between the two halves of lactose permease (Bogdanov, M., Xie, J., Heacock, P., and Dowhan, W. (2008) J. Cell Biol. 182, 925-935). Net neutral lipids suppress the membrane translocation potential of negatively charged amino acids, thus increasing the cytoplasmic retention potential of positively charged amino acids. Herein, TM organization of sucrose permease (CscB) and phenylalanine permease (PheP) as a function of membrane lipid composition was investigated to extend these principles to other proteins. For CscB, topological dependence on PE only becomes evident after a significant increase in the net negative charge of the cytoplasmic surface of the N-terminal TM bundle. High negative charge is required to overcome the thermodynamic block to inversion due to the high hydrophobicity of TM VII. Increasing the positive charge of the cytoplasmic surface of the N-terminal TM hairpin of PheP, which is misoriented in PE-lacking cells, favors native orientation in the absence of PE. PheP and CscB also display co-existing dual topologies dependent on changes in the charge balance between protein domains and the membrane lipids. Therefore, the topology of both permeases is dependent on PE. However, CscB topology is governed by thermodynamic balance between opposing lipid-dependent electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions."

Using the bacterial enzyme, here we show that a conserved Tyr residue of the cytochrome b subunit of cytochrome bc1 is critical for this process. Substitution of this residue with other amino acids decreases cytochrome bc1 activity and enhances ROS production. Moreover, the Tyr to Cys mutation cross-links together the cytochrome b and iron-sulfur subunits and renders the bacterial enzyme sensitive to O2 by oxidative disruption of its catalytic [2Fe-2S] cluster. Hence, this Tyr residue is essential in controlling unproductive encounters between O2 and catalytic intermediates at the quinol oxidation site of cytochrome bc1 to prevent ROS generation.

https://openalex.org/W2145809457,"The myeloid inhibitory receptor LILRB4 (also called ILT3, LIR-5, CD85k), a member of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs/LIRs), is an important mediator of immune tolerance. Up-regulated on tolerogenic dendritic cells, it has been shown to modulate immune responses via induction of T cell anergy and differentiation of CD8(+) T suppressor cells and may play a role in establishing immune tolerance in cancer. Consequently, characterizing the molecular mechanisms involved in LILRB4 function and in particular its structure and ligands is a key aim but has remained elusive to date. Here we describe the production, crystallization, and structure of the LILRB4 ectodomain to 1.7 Å using an expression strategy involving engineering of an additional disulfide bond in the D2 domain to enhance protein stability. LILRB4 comprises two immunoglobulin domains similar in structure to other LILRs; however, the D2 domain, which is most closely related to the D4 domains of other family members, contains 3(10) helices not previously observed. At the D1-D2 interface, reduced interdomain contacts resulted in an obtuse interdomain angle of ∼107°. Comparison with MHC class I binding Group 1 LILRs suggests LILRB4 is both conformationally and electrostatically unsuited to MHC ligation, consistent with LILRB4 status as a Group 2 LILR likely to bind novel non-MHC class I ligands. Finally, examination of the LILRB4 surface highlighted distinctive surface patches on the D1 domain and D1D2 hinge region, which may be involved in ligand binding. These findings will facilitate our attempts to precisely define the role of LILRB4 in the regulation of immune tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1970181404,"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are involved in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The well known pathogen-associated molecular patterns include LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria. In this work, the crystal structures of two complexes of the short form of camel PGRP (CPGRP-S) with LPS and LTA determined at 1.7- and 2.1-Å resolutions, respectively, are reported. Both compounds were held firmly inside the complex formed with four CPGRP-S molecules designated A, B, C, and D. The binding cleft is located at the interface of molecules C and D, which is extendable to the interface of molecules A and C. The interface of molecules A and B is tightly packed, whereas that of molecules B and D forms a wide channel. The hydrophilic moieties of these compounds occupy a common region, whereas hydrophobic chains interact with distinct regions in the binding site. The binding studies showed that CPGRP-S binds to LPS and LTA with affinities of 1.6 × 10−9 and 2.4 × 10−8 m, respectively. The flow cytometric studies showed that both LPS- and LTA-induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 was inhibited by CPGRP-S.

IntroductionThe innate immune system in animals provides the first line of defense against microbial infections (1Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). It works by an early sensing of the invading microorganisms through the recognition of molecular patterns present on the cell surface of bacteria that are absent in the host (2Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Initially, the recognition was considered to be based on the binding of well known bacterial cell-surface molecules, peptidoglycans, by a class of innate immunity molecules. As a result, these proteins were called peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). 3The abbreviations used are: PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition protein; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; CPGRP-S, camel PGRP-short; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; HPGRP-S, human PGRP-S. However, other commonly occurring pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as LPS from Gram-negative bacteria (3Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria, were subsequently identified and included among the most commonly occurring PAMPs (4Ginsburg I. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 171-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Fortunately, these molecular patterns are not present on mammalian cell surfaces (5Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The defense responses are generally activated when the microbial components are recognized by PGRPs, the pathogen sensors such as Toll-like receptors, Nod-like receptors, and double-stranded RNA sensors (6Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Both LPS and LTA are glycol-lipids that are composed of an amphipathic lipid component and a hydrophilic polysaccharide core (7Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 8Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar). The excessive response to endotoxic LPS and LTA can lead to severe sepsis, which is a rapidly progressing inflammatory disease (9Angus D.C. Linde-Zwirble W.T. Lidicker J. Clermont G. Carcillo J. Pinsky M.R. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (6566) Google Scholar). The PGRPs are highly conserved protein molecules that may detect PAMPs from either Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria or both. The short form of PGRP isolated from the secretions of camel mammary glands (CPGRP-S) has been found to act potently against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (10Kappeler S.R. Heuberger C. Farah Z. Puhan Z. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2660-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We report here binding studies performed with CPGRP-S and two commonly occurring PAMPs, LPS and LTA, as well as detailed analyses of the three-dimensional structures of the two complexes of CPGRP-S with LPS (structure X) and with LTA (structure Y) determined at high resolutions. Real-time solution studies on the binding of LPS and LTA to CPGRP-S were carried out by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which showed affinities at nanomolar concentrations for both compounds. The crystal structures of the complexes of CPGRP-S with LPS and LTA revealed the tight binding of both ligands. Studies were also carried out to determine the effects of CPGRP-S on LPS- and LTA-activated cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy human volunteers using flow cytometry. The results indicate considerable reductions in the LPS- and LTA-induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 when CPGRP-S was added. Studies were further extended to evaluate the LPS- and LTA-induced effects in mouse models, in which the recoveries after introducing CPGRP-S were found to be significant.DISCUSSIONAlthough the C-terminal domain of ∼165 amino acid residues known as the PGRP domain is conserved in various PGRPs (21Pauling L.

Science. 2006; 311: 1761-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), structural comparison shows a significant structural diversity, indicating a considerable functional variability. Because the capacity for the recognition of a variety of PAMPs is dependent on the versatility of the binding site, the novelty in the formation of binding sites in various PGRPs is of particular significance. The crystal structures of PGRP-LB, PGRP-SA, PGRP-LC, and PGRP-LE from Drosophila and the C-terminal peptidoglycan-binding domain of PGRP-IαC and PGRP-IβC and cloned truncated PGRP-S from human represent different structural units of PGRPs. The first complete crystal structure of a mammalian PGRP belonging to the S class is that of CPGRP-S (11Sharma P. Singh N. Sinha M. Sharma S. Perbandt M. Betzel C. Kaur P. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of CPGRP-S and HPGRP-S shows an overall sequence identity of ∼75%, whereas the segment with the first 30 residues from the N terminus shows <50% sequence identity. HPGRP-S has three extra residues (Gln-1–Glu-2–Thr-3) on the N terminus with an extra cysteine at position 8, which corresponds to Ala-5 in CPGRP-S. The reported structure of HPGRP-S is as a monomer in which the first nine residues, including Cys-8, were not observed. However, it has been reported in the literature that HPGRP-S forms a disulfide-linked dimer through Cys-8 (29Zhang Y. van der Fits L. Voerman J.S. Melief M.J. Laman J.D. Wang M. Wang H. Wang M. Li X.

Chem. 2006; 281: 5895-5907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast, CPGRP-S forms a noncovalent association with four molecules, resulting in the formation of a novel PAMP-binding site that is situated deep inside the asymmetric homotetramer. In contrast, in HPGRP-S, due to the indicated covalent linkage and additional incompatible residues at the corresponding faces of molecules C and D, the structure is unlikely to be a tetramer, which is similar to CPGRP-S. Thus, CPGRP-S is the only structure determined so far in which a tetrameric complex giving rise to a versatile binding site has been observed. It has been found to be capable of binding to a wide range of PAMPs with high specificities and potencies. The structures of the complexes of CPGRP-S with two important PAMPs, LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and LTA from Gram-positive, have clearly shown the potential of the binding site, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of microorganisms. The solution studies using fluorescence spectroscopy and observations with SPR showed that CPGRP-S binds to both LPS and LTA with nearly similar affinities as indicated by Kd values of 1.6 × 10−9 and 2.4 × 10−8 m, respectively. As revealed by the structures of two complexes of CPGRP-S with LPS and LTA, the hydrophilic moieties of the two ligands occupy an overlapping space as well as distinct non-overlapping regions to accommodate their non-similar moieties. This happens because the binding cleft offers a variety of features. As observed from the structure of CPGRP-S·LPS, the distinct interactions with the hydrophilic moiety of LPS are provided by Lys-C90, Ala-C92, Asn-C99, and Arg-A170, whereas the residues that interact with LTA are Thr-D97, Asn-C99, Gln-D150, and Asn-A140. In both cases, the interactions are optimally achieved, but the residues involved in the interactions are not identical. The predominant interactions with LPS are provided by molecule C, whereas molecule D is the major contributor for the interactions with LTA. Similarly, parts of the hydrocarbon chains of LPS and LTA are placed in identical regions, whereas other parts are aligned differently but with nearly similar numbers of attractive van der Waals contacts. In the structure of CPGRP-S·LPS, one of the two hydrocarbon arms is adjusted in the remaining space at the C-D interface, where van der Waals interactions are provided by Trp-D66, Ala-D92, His-D93, Gly-D95, Pro-C96, Gln-C150, and Pro-C151. The second hydrophobic arm of LPS lies in the B-D interface along the surface of molecule D. This moiety of LPS is stabilized by a number of van der Waals contacts provided by Trp-D98, Asp-D148, Val-D149, and Glu-D150.In the case of LTA, neither of its two hydrocarbon arms could be accommodated in the cleft at the C-D interface due to stereochemical incompatibilities. Instead, both chains are placed outside the C-D interface at the junction near the core of the tetrameric complex. One chain is stabilized in the A-C interface through van der Waals contacts provided by Arg-A31, Glu-A142, Lys-A144, Arg-A170, Glu-C24, Cys-C67, Lys-C90, and Ala-C92. The interface of molecules A and C is empty in the structure of CPGRP-S·LPS. The second chain of LTA is placed in the opposite direction into the B-D interface along molecule D. This is stabilized by van der Waals interactions provided by Thr-D97, Trp-D98, Val-D149, and Ala-D171. Thus, the two chemically and structurally distinct PAMPs, LPS and LTA, from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively, are recognized equally well by CPGRP-S. The formation of such a versatile binding site is the result of the association of four molecules of CPGRP-S, which is the only example among the proteins of the PGRP-S family. The flow cytometric studies confirmed that CPGRP-S suppressed the LPS- and LTA-induced biosynthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 by >90% in both T lymphocytes and monocytes. The in vivo experiments carried out using mouse models showed that lethal doses of LPS led to the death of all mice in 24 h. However, if CPGRP-S was injected soon after the administration of LPS, a survival rate of >80% was observed.In general, the specific binding clefts on protein surfaces are present to interact with compounds having stereochemically favorable features. Because the structures of various PAMPs differ considerably, it is unlikely that a single binding site could accommodate them with such high affinities and specificities. If a single binding site has to perform such diverse binding roles, it could do so only at moderate potencies. To produce high potencies for a variety of ligands, the binding site must be equipped with multiple features that are hard to generate in a single protein molecule. On the other hand, binding studies have shown that CPGRP-S binds to various PAMPs with high affinities. The structure showed that it is because of the formation of the tetrameric complex of CPGRP-S, which allowed the construction of a versatile ligand-binding site. The observed binding site at the interface of four protein molecules with multiple features specific to different PAMPs makes the structure of CPGRP-S a potent binder. The interaction site is buried deep inside the tetramer, which is connected through a broad and long channel with favorable features to attract the PAMPs. Indeed, this is an excellent example of designing a highly potent binding site by using multimeric complexes of protein molecules. Evolutionarily, it appears to be of utmost significance in the case of camels because of the extreme conditions of their habitat as well as their unusual body metabolism. It is also well known that their immunological makeup with single-chain IgG molecules carries a compromised immune system. Furthermore, unlike in other species, the other supporting antibacterial proteins, such as lactoperoxidase and lysozyme C, are available only at very low concentrations in the mammary secretions of camels (10Kappeler S.R. Heuberger C. Farah Z. Puhan Z. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2660-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, these very useful properties of CPGRP-S may be of great therapeutic value as an antibiotic to protect mammary glands and newborns from bacterial infection. It should also be mentioned that mastitis, a rampant infection in domesticated milking animals, is rarely reported in camels. This useful antibacterial property of CPGRP-S can also be exploited as a common antibiotic agent for humans. This is particularly significant as there is an alarming rise in the incidence of bacterial resistance to known antibiotics. This also brings the amino acid sequence of CPGRP-S into focus, particularly the presence of Pro-96 and Pro-151 at one of the interfaces and the absence of three N-terminal residues and Cys-8 compared with HPGRP-S. In the PGRP-S family, such a homotetrameric complex has been observed only for CPGRP-S. IntroductionThe innate immune system in animals provides the first line of defense against microbial infections (1Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). It works by an early sensing of the invading microorganisms through the recognition of molecular patterns present on the cell surface of bacteria that are absent in the host (2Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Initially, the recognition was considered to be based on the binding of well known bacterial cell-surface molecules, peptidoglycans, by a class of innate immunity molecules. As a result, these proteins were called peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). 3The abbreviations used are: PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition protein; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; CPGRP-S, camel PGRP-short; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; HPGRP-S, human PGRP-S. However, other commonly occurring pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as LPS from Gram-negative bacteria (3Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria, were subsequently identified and included among the most commonly occurring PAMPs (4Ginsburg I. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 171-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Fortunately, these molecular patterns are not present on mammalian cell surfaces (5Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The defense responses are generally activated when the microbial components are recognized by PGRPs, the pathogen sensors such as Toll-like receptors, Nod-like receptors, and double-stranded RNA sensors (6Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Both LPS and LTA are glycol-lipids that are composed of an amphipathic lipid component and a hydrophilic polysaccharide core (7Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 8Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar). The excessive response to endotoxic LPS and LTA can lead to severe sepsis, which is a rapidly progressing inflammatory disease (9Angus D.C. Linde-Zwirble W.T. Lidicker J. Clermont G. Carcillo J. Pinsky M.R. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (6566) Google Scholar). The PGRPs are highly conserved protein molecules that may detect PAMPs from either Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria or both. The short form of PGRP isolated from the secretions of camel mammary glands (CPGRP-S) has been found to act potently against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (10Kappeler S.R. Heuberger C. Farah Z. Puhan Z. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2660-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We report here binding studies performed with CPGRP-S and two commonly occurring PAMPs, LPS and LTA, as well as detailed analyses of the three-dimensional structures of the two complexes of CPGRP-S with LPS (structure X) and with LTA (structure Y) determined at high resolutions. Real-time solution studies on the binding of LPS and LTA to CPGRP-S were carried out by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which showed affinities at nanomolar concentrations for both compounds. The crystal structures of the complexes of CPGRP-S with LPS and LTA revealed the tight binding of both ligands. Studies were also carried out to determine the effects of CPGRP-S on LPS- and LTA-activated cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy human volunteers using flow cytometry. The results indicate considerable reductions in the LPS- and LTA-induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 when CPGRP-S was added. Studies were further extended to evaluate the LPS- and LTA-induced effects in mouse models, in which the recoveries after introducing CPGRP-S were found to be significant."

The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Here, we report that GLP-1 augments glucose-dependent rises in NAD(P)H autofluorescence in both βTC3 insulinoma cells and islets in a manner consistent with post-translational activation of glucokinase (GCK). GLP-1 treatment increased GCK activity and enhanced GCK <i>S</i>-nitrosylation in βTC3 cells. A 2-fold increase in <i>S</i>-nitrosylated GCK was also observed in mouse islets. Furthermore, GLP-1 activated a FRET-based GCK reporter in living cells. Activation of this reporter was sensitive to inhibition of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), and incorporating the <i>S</i>-nitrosylation-blocking V367M mutation into this sensor prevented activation by GLP-1. GLP-1 potentiation of the glucose-dependent increase in islet NAD(P)H autofluorescence was also sensitive to a NOS inhibitor, whereas NOS inhibition did not affect the response to glucose alone. Expression of the GCK(V367M) mutant also blocked GLP-1 potentiation of the NAD(P)H response to glucose in βTC3 cells, but did not significantly affect metabolism of glucose in the absence of GLP-1. Co-expression of WT or mutant GCK proteins with a sensor for insulin secretory granule fusion also revealed that blockade of post-translational GCK <i>S</i>-nitrosylation diminished the effects of GLP-1 on granule exocytosis by ∼40% in βTC3 cells. These results suggest that post-translational activation of GCK is an important mechanism for mediating the insulinotropic effects of GLP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2052833185,"Birch-allergic patients often experience oral allergy syndrome upon ingestion of vegetables and fruits, most prominently apple, that is caused by antibody cross-reactivity of the IgE antibodies in patients to proteins sharing molecular surface structures with the major birch pollen group 1 allergen from Betula verrucosa (Bet v 1). Still, to what extent two molecular surfaces need to be similar for clinically relevant antibody cross-reactivity to occur is unknown. Here, we describe the grafting of a defined conformational antibody epitope from Bet v 1 onto the surface of the homologous apple allergen Malus domestica group 1 (Mal d 1). Engineering of the epitope was accomplished by genetic engineering substituting amino acid residues in Mal d 1 differing between Bet v 1 and Mal d 1 within the epitope defined by the mAb BV16. The kinetic parameters characterizing the antibody binding interaction to Bet v 1 and to the mutated Mal d 1 variant, respectively, were assessed by Biacore experiments demonstrating indistinguishable binding kinetics. This demonstrates that a conformational epitope defined by a high affinity antibody-allergen interaction can successfully be grafted onto a homologous scaffold molecule without loss of epitope functionality. Furthermore, we show that increasing surface similarity to Bet v 1 of Mal d 1 variants by substitution of 6-8 residues increased the ability to trigger basophil histamine release with blood from birch-allergic patients not responding to natural Mal d 1. Conversely, reducing surface similarity to Bet v 1 of a Mal d 1 variant by substitution of three residues abolished histamine release in one patient reacting to Mal d 1."
https://openalex.org/W2057654390,"Survivin is a multifunctional protein with essential roles in cell division and inhibition of apoptosis, but the molecular underpinnings of its cytoprotective properties are poorly understood. Here we show that homozygous deletion of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP), a survivin-associated immunophilin, causes embryonic lethality in mice by embryonic day 13.5-14, increased apoptosis of Ter119(-)/CD71(-) early erythropoietic progenitors, and loss of survivin expression in its cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments in vivo. In import assays using recombinant proteins, AIP directly mediated the import of survivin to mitochondria, thus enabling its anti-apoptotic function, whereas a survivin 1-141 mutant that does not bind AIP was not imported to mitochondria and failed to inhibit apoptosis. AIP-directed mitochondrial import of survivin did not affect cell division, was independent of the organelle transmembrane potential, did not require the chaperone Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90), and was inhibited by cytosolic factor(s) present in normal cells. shRNA knockdown of the mitochondrial import receptor Tom20 abolished mitochondrial import of survivin and sensitized tumor cells to apoptosis, whereas silencing of Tom70 had no effect. Therefore, an AIP-Tom20 recognition contributes to cell survival in development and cancer by mediating the mitochondrial import of survivin."
https://openalex.org/W2020251428,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) plays a central role in cardiovascular regulation. eNOS function is critically modulated by Ca2+ and protein phosphorylation, but the interrelationship between intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and eNOS phosphorylation is poorly understood. Here we show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release activates eNOS by selectively promoting its Ser-635/633 (bovine/human) phosphorylation. With bovine endothelial cells, thapsigargin-induced ER Ca2+ release caused a dose-dependent increase in eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation, leading to elevated NO production. ER Ca2+ release also promoted eNOS Ser-633 phosphorylation in mouse vessels in vivo. This effect was independent of extracellular Ca2+ and selective to Ser-635 because the phosphorylation status of other eNOS sites, including Ser-1179 or Thr-497, was unaffected in thapsigargin-treated cells. Blocking ERK1/2 abolished ER Ca2+ release-induced eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation, whereas inhibiting protein kinase A or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II had no effect. Protein phosphorylation assay confirmed that ERK1/2 directly phosphorylated the eNOS Ser-635 residue in vitro. Further studies demonstrated that ER Ca2+ release-induced ERK1/2 activation mediated the enhancing action of purine or bradykinin receptor stimulation on eNOS Ser-635/633 phosphorylation in bovine/human endothelial cells. Mutating the Ser-635 to nonphosphorylatable alanine prevented ATP from activating eNOS in cells. Taken together, these studies reveal that ER Ca2+ release enhances eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation and function via ERK1/2 activation. Because ER Ca2+ is commonly mobilized by agonists or physicochemical stimuli, the identified ER Ca2+-ERK1/2-eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation pathway may have a broad role in the regulation of endothelial function.

IntroductionNO is a chief signaling molecule in cardiovascular regulation. In addition to relaxing vascular tone, NO regulates cardiac contractility, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis, and vascular smooth muscle proliferation (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dudzinski D.M. Michel T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, physiological NO formation is essential for cardiovascular homeostasis. Abnormalities of NO production, on the other hand, are found in almost all cardiovascular diseases. In endothelial cells, NO is primarily produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). 3The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TG, thapsigargin; PKA, protein kinase A; CaM, calmodulin; CaMKII, Ca2+-CaM-dependent protein kinase II; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N‘,N‘-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester); HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell. Because NO is a diffusible gas and cannot be stored in an intracellular compartment, the onset of NO signaling is triggered by eNOS activation (2Dudzinski D.M. Michel T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). The intensity and time span of NO signaling are largely dictated by the functional status of eNOS. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of eNOS activation and regulation has been the focus of cardiovascular NO research.eNOS is activated by the binding of calmodulin (CaM) (4Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a classic view, the binding between eNOS and CaM is initiated by the increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. A canonical eNOS activation process begins with the bindings between agonists and their respective receptors. Activation of these receptors results in the increases of intracellular free Ca2+. The increases of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations elicited by some agonists, including acetylcholine, are dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (6Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). In other cases, such as the activation of purine receptors (P2Y) by ATP, Ca2+ is primarily released from the intracellular Ca2+ repertoire: endoplasmic reticulum (ER), although the refill of ER Ca2+ relies on extracellular Ca2+ supply (7Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar, 8Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Roderick H.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R563-R565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Increased cytosolic Ca2+ binds with CaM, forming a Ca2+-CaM complex, which subsequently binds with eNOS. Binding with CaM induces changes in eNOS conformation (4Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enables the electron transfer from the eNOS reductase domain to the oxygenase domain, where l-arginine, oxygen, and NADPH are converted to NO and l-citrulline.In addition to Ca2+, eNOS is also regulated by protein phosphorylation (9Mount P.F. Kemp B.E. Power D.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 42: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). eNOS is known to be phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues. The first site where phosphorylation was found to significantly influence eNOS function is the serine 1179/1177 (bovine/human and mouse) (10Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 11Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3011) Google Scholar). eNOS Ser-1179 was initially reported to be phosphorylated by Akt. Subsequent studies showed that other kinases, such as AMP-activated protein kinase, protein kinase G, and CaMKII, also phosphorylate eNOS Ser-1179. Ser-1179 phosphorylation enhances eNOS function. Various extracellular stimuli influence eNOS activity by modulating its Ser-1179 phosphorylation (2Dudzinski D.M. Michel T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). eNOS is also phosphorylated at residue Ser-635 (12Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42344-42351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Ser-635 phosphorylation augments eNOS activity, and this has been shown to be important in the response of endothelial cells to shear stress (13Boo Y.C. Hwang J. Sykes M. Michell B.J. Kemp B.E. Lum H. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1819-H1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). So far, studies suggest that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates eNOS Ser-635 (8Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Roderick H.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R563-R565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42344-42351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast to the stimulating effect of Ser-1179 and Ser-635 phosphorylation, Thr-497 phosphorylation inhibits eNOS activity (14Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Beyond Ser-1179, Ser-635, and Thr-497, eNOS has been reported to be phosphorylated at residues Ser-116 and Ser-617. Compared with the extensively studied roles of eNOS Ser-1179, Ser-635, and Thr-497 phosphorylation in endothelial regulation and diseases, the in vivo significance of eNOS Ser-116 and Ser-617 phosphorylation remains to be established (2Dudzinski D.M. Michel T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 8Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Roderick H.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R563-R565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Although both Ca2+ and protein phosphorylation play crucial roles in eNOS regulation, the interrelationship between Ca2+ mobilization and eNOS phosphorylation is understood in much less detail. Nevertheless, recent studies show that although CaM binding remains essential for eNOS activation, whether or not the binding between CaM and eNOS requires the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ is heavily affected by the phosphorylation status of eNOS. For example, phosphorylation of Ser-1179 or Ser-635 was reported to render eNOS activation in resting intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (10Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 11Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3011) Google Scholar, 15Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. Bauer P.M. Fulton D. Kemp B.E. Harrison D.G. Sessa W.C. Jo H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is apparently because phosphorylation of these two sites enhances the binding affinity of eNOS with CaM (16McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). On the other hand, how intracellular Ca2+ mobilization affects eNOS phosphorylation is largely unclear. In the present study, we report that discharging Ca2+ from the ER results in a selective up-regulation of eNOS phosphorylation at residue Ser-635. Our studies further identify ERK1/2 as the kinase that mediates the action of ER Ca2+ release on eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation. Moreover, we demonstrate that ER Ca2+ release-elicited ERK1/2 activation and subsequent Ser-635 phosphorylation account for the regulation of ATP and bradykinin on eNOS in endothelial cells.DISCUSSIONThe key finding in the current study is that ER Ca2+ release triggers eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation. In the conventional paradigm, Ca2+ has always been thought to activate eNOS by facilitating CaM binding. The present findings extended the role of Ca2+ in eNOS regulation. In addition to facilitating CaM binding to eNOS, Ca2+ release from the ER also promotes eNOS phosphorylation. This appears to be a selective action on Ser-635 because the status of other major eNOS phosphorylation sites, including Ser-1179 and Thr-497, remains largely unchanged. The augmenting effect of ER Ca2+ release on eNOS Ser-633 phosphorylation was also seen in mouse vessels in vivo. The finding that ER Ca2+ release promotes eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation may shed new light on a prior puzzle regarding the discrepancy between intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and the time course of NO production in endothelial cells (23Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C628-C636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ayajiki K. Kindermann M. Hecker M. Fleming I. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the stimulating effects of agonists or shear stress on intracellular Ca2+ levels are transient, but the NO production lasts much longer (25Yamamoto K. Korenaga R. Kamiya A. Qi Z. Sokabe M. Ando J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H285-H292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Toma I. Bansal E. Meer E.J. Kang J.J. Vargas S.L. Peti-Peterdi J. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1769-R1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Indeed, we also observed that discharging ER Ca2+ only results in a transitory elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ (less than 5 min); however, the increases of eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation sustain for hours. Because Ser-635-phosphorylated eNOS is capable of producing NO at resting intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (15Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. Bauer P.M. Fulton D. Kemp B.E. Harrison D.G. Sessa W.C. Jo H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the persistent Ser-635 phosphorylation may provide a plausible explanation for the continuous NO production by eNOS even after the increases of Ca2+ are sequestered. Thus, after the transient Ca2+ elevation, increased Ser-635 phosphorylation is likely the major mechanism that governs NO production from eNOS.The increases of Ca2+ levels in the cytosol involve both ER and extracellular Ca2+. It has been well established that in nonexcitable cells, such as endothelial cells, agonist-induced Ca2+ increases consist of a quick burst followed by a plateau phase (6Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 7Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar, 8Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Roderick H.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R563-R565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The burst of Ca2+ is derived from the ER and independent of extracellular Ca2+. However, the plateau phase of Ca2+ release relies on the refill of external Ca2+ through the store-operated channels (19Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rew. 2002; 85: 757-810Google Scholar, 27Tiruppathi C. Minshall R.D. Paria B.C. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We found that ER Ca2+ release-induced eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation was not affected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. These results suggest that the burst of Ca2+ release is sufficient to initiate eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation. Moreover, ER Ca2+ release-induced eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation lasts for hours. The time course of eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation was not affected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). These results indicate that ER Ca2+, rather than external Ca2+, plays a dominant role in promoting eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation in endothelial cells.It was reported that overexpression of a constitutively active catalytic subunit of PKA resulted in eNOS Ser-635 and Ser-1179 phosphorylation in BAECs (15Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. Bauer P.M. Fulton D. Kemp B.E. Harrison D.G. Sessa W.C. Jo H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Early studies using pharmacological inhibitors also suggested that PKA might phosphorylate eNOS Ser-635 in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress (12Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42344-42351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Boo Y.C. Hwang J. Sykes M. Michell B.J. Kemp B.E. Lum H. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1819-H1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence demonstrating that shear stress activates PKA remains lacking. We found that PKA inhibition had no significant effect on ER Ca2+ release-elicited eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation. The lack of involvement of PKA in ER Ca2+ release-induced eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation is probably not a surprise. Studies showed that, at least in pulmonary endothelial cells, cytosolic Ca2+ elevation actually inhibits cAMP formation (28Moore T.M. Chetham P.M. Kelly J.J. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L203-L222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PKA could be suppressed when ER Ca2+ was discharged into the cytosol. Interestingly, blocking CaMKII, a Ca2+-sensitive kinase, also did not affect eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation in TG-stimulated cells. On the other hand, inhibiting ERK1/2 prevented ER Ca2+ release from activating eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation, indicating a major contribution of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 activation was indeed seen in cells after ER Ca2+ was released. The in vitro protein phosphorylation assay further proved that ERK1/2 can phosphorylate eNOS Ser-635. Because the protein phosphorylation experiments were carried out with purified eNOS and ERK2, these findings also suggest that ERK1/2 can phosphorylate the eNOS Ser-635 residue directly.To establish the significance of ER Ca2+ release-induced eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation in a physiological setting, we studied the effect of ATP on eNOS phosphorylation and function in endothelial cells. ATP is known to stimulate P2Y receptors leading to phospholipase C activation and phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation (2Dudzinski D.M. Michel T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binds with its receptors on the ER and discharges Ca2+. We thus predicted that ATP may modulate eNOS function through the ER Ca2+-ERK1/2-Ser-635 phosphorylation cascade. Consistent with such a prediction, ATP induces eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation. More importantly, the effect of ATP on eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation was completely blocked by either intracellular Ca2+ quenching or ERK1/2 inhibition, suggesting that ATP induces eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation by ER Ca2+ release-induced ERK1/2 activation. We noticed that in a recent study with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, ATP was reported to activate eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation via PKC (29da Silva C.G. Specht A. Wegiel B. Ferran C. Kaczmarek E. Circulation. 2009; 119: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The present study showed that ATP primarily affects eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation in BAECs. Moreover, the loss-of-function experiments showed that a single mutation of Ser-635 to Ala abolished the stimulating effects of ATP on eNOS activity. This result strongly indicates the predominant role of Ser-635 phosphorylation in the regulation of eNOS by ATP. Although the present study focuses on ATP, we speculate that the ER Ca2+-ERK1/2-eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation pathway may function in the actions of other agonists. Indeed, as an example, we demonstrated that ER Ca2+ release-induced ERK1/2 activation also mediated the effect of bradykinin on eNOS Ser-633 phosphorylation in human endothelial cells.The findings in the present study also suggest that Ca2+ and protein phosphorylation may play sequential roles in the course of eNOS regulation. In the initial response to agonists, cytosolic Ca2+ levels control the activation of eNOS. Subsequently, Ca2+-initiated protein phosphorylation likely plays a major role in regulating eNOS function. The change from Ca2+ control to phosphorylation modulation may offer several advantages. First, Ca2+ is one of the most multifaceted intracellular messengers. Besides eNOS, various signaling processes depend on the mobilization of ER Ca2+ (30Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). Disengaging the dependence on Ca2+ concentrations will allow the ER to be refilled and ready for other signaling pathways. Second, long-term elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ may induce detrimental effects because Ca2+ overload is a common cause of cell death (31Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). Prolonged Ca2+ elevation must be avoided. An alternative mechanism is needed to sustain eNOS activity if continuous NO formation is required. Ser-635 phosphorylation renders eNOS activity in resting Ca2+ concentrations, thus fulfilling such a requirement. Finally a phosphorylation-based mechanism may enhance the versatility of eNOS regulation. ERK1/2 interacts with many other signaling pathways. Through the networks, eNOS function can be modulated by a variety of means under physiological conditions.In summary, the present study revealed a novel relationship between intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and eNOS phosphorylation in endothelial cells. ER Ca2+ release selectively enhances eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation and function via ERK1/2 activation. Because ER Ca2+ mobilization occurs commonly upon agonist or physicochemical stimulation, the identified ER Ca2+-ERK1/2-eNOS Ser-635 phosphorylation pathway may have a broad role in the regulation of endothelial function. IntroductionNO is a chief signaling molecule in cardiovascular regulation. In addition to relaxing vascular tone, NO regulates cardiac contractility, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis, and vascular smooth muscle proliferation (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dudzinski D.M. Michel T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, physiological NO formation is essential for cardiovascular homeostasis. Abnormalities of NO production, on the other hand, are found in almost all cardiovascular diseases. In endothelial cells, NO is primarily produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). 3The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TG, thapsigargin; PKA, protein kinase A; CaM, calmodulin; CaMKII, Ca2+-CaM-dependent protein kinase II; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N‘,N‘-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester); HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell. Because NO is a diffusible gas and cannot be stored in an intracellular compartment, the onset of NO signaling is triggered by eNOS activation (2Dudzinski D.M. Michel T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). The intensity and time span of NO signaling are largely dictated by the functional status of eNOS. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of eNOS activation and regulation has been the focus of cardiovascular NO research.eNOS is activated by the binding of calmodulin (CaM) (4Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a classic view, the binding between eNOS and CaM is initiated by the increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. A canonical eNOS activation process begins with the bindings between agonists and their respective receptors. Activation of these receptors results in the increases of intracellular free Ca2+. The increases of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations elicited by some agonists, including acetylcholine, are dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (6Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). In other cases, such as the activation of purine receptors (P2Y) by ATP, Ca2+ is primarily released from the intracellular Ca2+ repertoire: endoplasmic reticulum (ER), although the refill of ER Ca2+ relies on extracellular Ca2+ supply (7Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar, 8Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Roderick H.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R563-R565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Increased cytosolic Ca2+ binds with CaM, forming a Ca2+-CaM complex, which subsequently binds with eNOS. Binding with CaM induces changes in eNOS conformation (4Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enables the electron transfer from the eNOS reductase domain to the oxygenase domain, where l-arginine, oxygen, and NADPH are converted to NO and l-citrulline.In addition to Ca2+, eNOS is also regulated by protein phosphorylation (9Mount P.F. Kemp B.E. Power D.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 42: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). eNOS is known to be phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues. The first site where phosphorylation was found to significantly influence eNOS function is the serine 1179/1177 (bovine/human and mouse) (10Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 11Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3011) Google Scholar). eNOS Ser-1179 was initially reported to be phosphorylated by Akt. Subsequent studies showed that other kinases, such as AMP-activated protein kinase, protein kinase G, and CaMKII, also phosphorylate eNOS Ser-1179. Ser-1179 phosphorylation enhances eNOS function. Various extracellular stimuli influence eNOS activity by modulating its Ser-1179 phosphorylation (2Dudzinski D.M. Michel T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). eNOS is also phosphorylated at residue Ser-635 (12Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42344-42351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Ser-635 phosphorylation augments eNOS activity, and this has been shown to be important in the response of endothelial cells to shear stress (13Boo Y.C. Hwang J. Sykes M. Michell B.J. Kemp B.E. Lum H. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1819-H1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). So far, studies suggest that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates eNOS Ser-635 (8Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Roderick H.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R563-R565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42344-42351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast to the stimulating effect of Ser-1179 and Ser-635 phosphorylation, Thr-497 phosphorylation inhibits eNOS activity (14Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Beyond Ser-1179, Ser-635, and Thr-497, eNOS has been reported to be phosphorylated at residues Ser-116 and Ser-617. Compared with the extensively studied roles of eNOS Ser-1179, Ser-635, and Thr-497 phosphorylation in endothelial regulation and diseases, the in vivo significance of eNOS Ser-116 and Ser-617 phosphorylation remains to be established (2Dudzinski D.M. Michel T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 8Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Roderick H.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R563-R565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Although both Ca2+ and protein phosphorylation play crucial roles in eNOS regulation, the interrelationship between Ca2+ mobilization and eNOS phosphorylation is understood in much less detail. Nevertheless, recent studies show that although CaM binding remains essential for eNOS activation, whether or not the binding between CaM and eNOS requires the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ is heavily affected by the phosphorylation status of eNOS. For example, phosphorylation of Ser-1179 or Ser-635 was reported to render eNOS activation in resting intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (10Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y.

Ferraro et al. (Ferraro, P., Nicolosi, L., Bernardi, P., Reichard, P., and Bianchi, V. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 18586-18591) have challenged these findings, based upon their studies of mouse liver mitochondria. Moreover, they have identified a potential artifact in the DNA polymerase-based assay for dNTPs, based upon overestimation of dGTP when GTP levels in extracts are much higher than dGTP levels. We measured ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) pools in rat mitochondrial extracts and found that GTP pools exceed dGTP pools by 50-fold or less, not enough to interfere with the dGTP assay. Analysis of dNTP pools in state 3 mitochondria, after incubation with ADP and oxidizable substrates, gave similar results. We confirmed our earlier finding that rat mitochondrial dNTP pools are highly asymmetric. dNTP pools in cytosolic extracts are uniformly low, suggesting that the dNTP pool asymmetry arises within the mitochondrion. Moreover, we found rat tissue rNTP pools to be even more highly asymmetric, with ATP, for example, at least 2 orders of magnitude more abundant than CTP in liver extracts. This finding raises the possibility that transcription of the mitochondrial genome is more error-prone than transcription in the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2064796536,"Mutations in the three genes encoding the heterotrimeric RNase H2 complex cause Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS). Our mouse RNase H2 structure revealed that the catalytic RNase H2A subunit interfaces mostly with the RNase H2C subunit that is intricately interwoven with the RNase H2B subunit. We mapped the positions of AGS-causing RNase H2A mutations using the mouse RNase H2 structure and proposed that these mutations cause varied effects on catalytic potential. To determine the functional consequences of these mutations, heterotrimeric human RNase H2 complexes containing the RNase H2A subunit mutations were prepared, and catalytic efficiencies and nucleic acid binding properties were compared with the wild-type (WT) complex. These analyses reveal a dramatic range of effects with mutations at conserved positions G37S, R186W, and R235Q, reducing enzymatic activities and substrate binding affinities by as much as a 1000-fold, whereas mutations at non-conserved positions R108W, N212I, F230L, T240M, and R291H reduced activities and binding modestly or not at all. All mutants purify as three-subunit complexes, further supporting the required heterotrimeric structure in eukaryotic RNase H2. These kinetic properties reveal varied functional consequences of AGS-causing mutations in the catalytic RNase H2A subunit and reflect the complex mechanisms of nuclease dysfunction that include catalytic deficiencies and altered protein-nucleic acid interactions relevant in AGS."
https://openalex.org/W2108788618,"Vascular calcification is strongly linked with increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Vascular calcification is an active cell-mediated process that involves the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to an osteoblast-like phenotype. Several inhibitors of this process have been identified, including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). In this study, we examined the role of the IGF receptor (IGFR) and the importance of IGFR glycosylation in the maintenance of the VSMC phenotype in the face of factors known to promote osteogenic conversion. IGF-I (25 ng/ml) significantly protected VSMCs from β-glycerophosphate-induced osteogenic differentiation (p < 0.005) and mineral deposition (p < 0.01). Mevalonic acid depletion (induced by 100 nm cerivastatin) significantly inhibited these IGF protective effects (p < 0.01). Mevalonic acid depletion impaired IGFR processing, decreased the expression of mature IGFRs at the cell surface, and inhibited the downstream activation of Akt and MAPK. Inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation (tunicamycin, deoxymannojirimycin, and deoxynojirimycin) also markedly attenuated the inhibitory effect of IGF-I on β-glycerophosphate-induced mineralization (p < 0.05) and activation of Akt and MAPK. These results demonstrate that alterations in the glycosylation of the IGFR disrupt the ability of IGF-I to protect against the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs by several interrelated mechanisms: decreased IGFR processing, reduced IGFR cell-surface expression, and reduced downstream signaling via the Akt and MAPK pathways. IGF-I thus occupies a critical position in the maintenance of normal VSMC phenotype and protection from factors known to stimulate vascular calcification."
https://openalex.org/W2060483332,"The pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) is a major adhesin of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) that interacts in a human-specific manner with the ectodomain of the human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) produced by respiratory epithelial cells. This interaction promotes bacterial colonization and bacterial internalization by initiating host signal transduction cascades. Here, we examined alterations of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) levels in epithelial cells during host cell infections with pneumococci via the PspC-hpIgR mechanism. The release of [Ca(2+)](i) from intracellular stores in host cells was significantly increased by wild-type pneumococci but not by PspC-deficient pneumococci. The increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was dependent on phospholipase C as pretreatment of cells with a phospholipase C-specific inhibitor U73122 abolished the increase in [Ca(2+)](i). In addition, we demonstrated the effect of [Ca(2+)](i) on pneumococcal internalization by epithelial cells. Uptake of pneumococci was significantly increased after pretreatment of epithelial cells with the cell-permeable calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-tetraacetoxymethyl ester or use of EGTA as an extracellular Ca(2+)-chelating agent. In contrast, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase, which increases [Ca(2+)](i) in a sustained fashion, significantly reduced pIgR-mediated pneumococcal invasion. Importantly, pneumococcal adherence to pIgR-expressing cells was not altered in the presence of inhibitors as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that pneumococcal infections induce mobilization of [Ca(2+)](i) from intracellular stores. This may constitute a defense response of host cells as the experimental reduction of intracellular calcium levels facilitates pneumococcal internalization by pIgR-expressing cells, whereas elevated calcium levels diminished bacterial internalization by host epithelial cells."

Mutation of the C/EBPα-binding site in the Il4 promoter region abolished C/EBPα-driven Il4 promoter-luciferase activity. Our results further showed that a mutation in nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-binding sites in the Il4 promoter also negated C/EBPα-driven Il4 promoter-luciferase activity.

Mutation of the C/EBPα-binding site in the Il4 promoter region abolished C/EBPα-driven Il4 promoter-luciferase activity. Our results further showed that a mutation in nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-binding sites in the Il4 promoter also negated C/EBPα-driven Il4 promoter-luciferase activity. Our study demonstrates that C/EBPα, in cooperation with NFAT, directly regulates Il4 gene transcription. Basophils are a minor cell population, constituting less than 1% of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. Basophils have been linked to allergic diseases because of their presence at the site of allergic inflammation. Basophils are found in the lung and sputum of allergic asthmatics, in the nasal mucosa and secretions of allergic rhinitis patients, in the skin lesions of atopic dermatitis patients during allergic late phase reactions, and in various other chronic allergic disease conditions (1Arock M. Schneider E. Boissan M. Tricottet V. Dy M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 71: 557-564PubMed Google Scholar). Many novel functions mediated by basophils have been uncovered in recent years. Basophils have been documented to play critical roles in initiating Th2-type immune responses to allergen challenges (2Luccioli S. Brody D.T. Hasan S. Keane-Myers A. Prussin C. Metcalfe D.D. J.

Immunol. 2008; 9: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) reported that upon protease allergen sensitization basophils are activated and recruited into draining lymph nodes where they direct Th2 cell differentiation. More recently, basophils have been demonstrated to function as antigen-presenting cells in initiating Th2 responses (5Sokol C.L. Chu N.Q. Yu S. Nish S.A. Laufer T.M. Medzhitov R. Nat.

The role of basophils in mediating effective memory responses has been verified by a recent report using genetically modified mice that have a 90% reduction in basophil number (9Ohnmacht C.

Compared with Th2 cells, basophils are more robust IL-4-producing cells on a per cell basis. In the past decade, we have learned a great deal about how CD4+ Th2 cells regulate their Il4 gene transcription. The activation of STAT6 by IL-4 up-regulates GATA3, c-Maf, and JunB expression as naïve CD4+ T cells differentiate into Th2 cells (11Kim J.I. Ho I.C. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H.

However, it is not known whether basophils use the same molecules as Th2 cells to regulate the Il4 gene. Akashi and co-workers (14Iwasaki H. Mizuno S. Arinobu Y. Ozawa H. Mori Y. Shigematsu H.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3010-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and C/EBPα, a required transcription factor for all myeloid cell differentiation (15Zhang P. Iwasaki-Arai J. Iwasaki H. Fenyus M.L. Dayaram T. Owens B.M. Shigematsu H. Levantini E. Huettner C.S. Lekstrom-Himes J.A. Akashi K. Tenen D.G. Immunity. 2004; 21: 853-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), has been implicated as the deciding factor in determining the fate of basophils. If GATA2 expression precedes C/EBPα expression at the granulocyte-monocyte progenitor stage, then GATA2 together with C/EBPα will drive basophil differentiation. Conversely, if C/EBPα expression precedes GATA2 expression, then C/EBPα and GATA2 will drive eosinophil differentiation (14Iwasaki H. Mizuno S. Arinobu Y. Ozawa H. Mori Y. Shigematsu H. Takatsu K. Tenen D.G. Akashi K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3010-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether or not C/EBPα can directly regulate the Il4 gene along the basophil development pathway. Regulatory regions of the Il4 gene that confer Th2-specific expression have been identified. Several non-coding regions of the Il4 gene that show hypersensitivity to DNase I digestion have been reported to be critical in Th2-specific Il4 gene expression. These regulatory regions include the intergenic (between the Il13 and the Il4 gene) DNase I-hypersensitive site (HS)/consensus non-coding sequence (CNS)-1, the Il4 promoter (HS1), the intronic enhancer (IE), the proximal 3′ enhancer (HS4), and the distal 3′ enhancer (HS5/CNS-2/HS5a). Among these regions, HS4 has been shown to act as a silencer for Il4 gene transcription (16Ansel K.M. Djuretic I. Tanasa B. Rao A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 607-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Regulatory regions that confer basophil specific IL-4 expression are virtually unknown. Using the transgenic approach, Kubo and co-workers (17Yagi R. Tanaka S. Motomura Y. Kubo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8087-8097Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) tested the regulatory regions known for regulating Il4 gene expression in Th2 cells and showed that a 4-kb-long HS4 element together with a 5′ enhancer (−863 to −5448) and the Il4 promoter (−64 to −827) conferred basophil-specific GFP expression. This study, which shows that HS4, a defined silencer of the Il4 gene transcription in Th2 cells (18Ansel K.M. Greenwald R.J. Agarwal S. Bassing C.H. Monticelli S. Interlandi J. Djuretic I.M. Lee D.U. Sharpe A.H. Alt F.W. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1251-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), is an enhancer of the Il4 gene transcription in basophils, also suggests that basophils might use a different set of regulatory regions and transcription factors to confer basophil-specific Il4 gene expression (17Yagi R. Tanaka S. Motomura Y. Kubo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8087-8097Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, we report that C/EBPα, an essential transcription factor for basophil development, can also drive Il4 promoter-luciferase expression in response to FcϵRI receptor cross-linking in a DNA-binding site-specific manner. We also show that C/EBPα was activated by signals generated via the PI3K pathway and the calcium signaling pathway. IL-3 (10 μg) was mixed with anti-IL-3 antibody (5 μg; MP2–8F8, BD Pharmingen) at room temperature for 1 min based on published methods (19Finkelman F.D. Madden K.B. Morris S.C. Holmes J.M. Boiani N.

Immunol. 2009; 182: 2835-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The cytokine and antibody mixture (in 0.2–0.3 ml of PBS) was injected into mice via the lateral tail vein. Three days after injection, mice were killed, and bone marrow cells were collected. Primary basophils were purified from the IL-3 complex-treated bone marrow cells by positive selection using biotinylated anti-FcϵRIα antibody (MAR-1) and anti-biotin beads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). We routinely obtained primary basophils with purity greater than 90%. A rat basophilic leukemic (RBL) cell line was provided to us by Dr. Stephen Dreskin (Allergy and Clinic Immunology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO). IL-4-producing myeloid leukemia progenitor cells (32D.IL-4) were generated in our laboratory by retroviral insertion. 32D.IL-4 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of G418 (500 ng/ml) and IL-3 (10 ng/ml) plus 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated from untreated or treated primary basophils using an RNAqueousR-Micro® kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription. Real time PCR was performed in an ABI PRISMTM 7700 Sequence Detection System. The following primers were used: Il4: forward, 5′-ACAGGAGAAGGGACGCCAT-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAAGCCCTACAGACGAGCTCA-3′; C/EBPα: forward, 5′-AAAGCCAAGAAGTCGGTGGAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTTTATCTCGGCTCTTGCGC-3′; c-maf: forward, 5′-AGCAGTTGGTGACCATGTCG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGGAGATCTCCTGCTTGAGG-3′; GATA1: forward, 5′-GCCTGTGGCTTGTATCACAAG-3′ and reverse, 5′ CCTCCGCCAGAGTGTTGTAGT-3′; GATA2: forward, 5′-GAATGGACAGAACCGGCC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGGTGGTGGTTGTCGTCTGA-3′; GATA3: forward, 5′-CCTACCGGGTTCGGATGTAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTCACACACTCCCTGCCTTCT-3′; JunB: forward, 5′-CCTGTCTCTACACGACTACA-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTGAGGCTAGCTTCAGAGAT-3′; RBPJκ: forward, 5′-TCCACCAGCCTTACCTTCAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGTTAGGACACCACGGTTGC-3′; C/EBPδ: forward, 5′-GCTTTTCAGCCTGGACAGCC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCGATGGCGCTCTCGTCGT-3′; C/EBPϵ: forward, 5′-GGACCTACTATGAGTGCGAGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCTGTTCTTCCCCAGACTCG-3′; and HPRT: forward, 5′-CTCATGGACTGATTATGGACAGGAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCAGGTCAGCAAAGAACTTATAGCC-3′. The cycling conditions were 95 °C for 10 min followed by 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The amount of mRNA was expressed as the amount relative to that of HPRT (relative amounts = 2−ΔCT where ΔCT = CTSample − CTHPRT). The full lengths of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPϵ cDNAs were amplified from the cDNA of primary basophils by using the following primers: C/EBPα forward, 5′-AATAGATCTCCATGGAGTCGGCCGACTTC-3′ and C/EBPα reverse, 5′-AATGCGGCCGCCTCACGCGCAGTTGCCCATG-3′; C/EBPβ forward, 5′-AAATAGATCTATGCACCGCCTGCTGGCCTGG-3′ and C/EBPβ reverse, 5′-AAATGCGGCCGCCTAGCAGTGGCCCGCCGAGGC-3′; and C/EBPϵ forward, 5′-AAATAGATCTATGTCCCACGGGACCTACTAT-3′ and C/EBPϵ reverse, 5′-AAATGCGGCCGCTCAGCTGCAGCCCCCGACACC-3′. The PCR product was digested with BglII and NotI (restriction sites are underlined) and cloned into the retroviral expression vector MSCV2.2. C/EBPα deletion mutants were generated by PCR. The primers used were as follows: for ΔTE1 (deletion of transactivation domain 1): forward, 5′-AAATAGATCTCCATGTCTATAGACATCAGCGCCTAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AATGCGGCCGCCTCACGCGCAGTTGCCCATG-3′; for ΔTE1–2: forward, 5′-AAATAGATCTATGTCCGCGGGGGCGCACGGG-3′ and reverse, 5′-AATGCGGCCGCCTCACGCGCAGTTGCCCATG-3′; for ΔTE1–3: forward, 5′-AAATAGATCTATGCACGCGTCTCCCGCGCACCTGG-3′ and reverse, 5′-AATGCGGCCGCCTCACGCGCAGTTGCCCATG-3′); and for ΔbZIP: forward, 5′-AATAGATCTCCATGGAGTCGGCCGACTTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AAATGCGGCCGCTCAGGCACCGCTGCCACCGCCGCC-3′. C/EBPα site-directed mutations of phosphorylation sites, the basic region, and the leucine zipper of the bZIP domain were generated by the overlapping PCR method (21Urban A. Neukirchen S. Jaeger K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2227-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The primers used for preparing various mutants are listed in supplemental Table S1. All mutations were verified by sequencing. Luciferase vectors Il4P110 and Il4P575 have been described earlier (22Huang H. Hu-Li J. Chen H. Ben-Sasson S.Z. Paul W.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3731-3738PubMed Google Scholar). Il4P-IE, HSS-Il4P, HSS-Il4P-IE, and Il4 minilocus were kindly provided by Dr. Richard A. Flavell (23Lee G.R. Fields P.E. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 447-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The HS4 fragment was amplified from an Il4 genomic fragment and cloned into Il4P575 to generate Il4P-HS4. PCR was used to make the Il4 promoter-luciferase deletion constructs. The primers used were as follows: Il4P reverse, 5′-AATTAAGCTTCAATAGCTCTGTGCCGTCAG-3′; Il4P187 forward, 5′-AATTGGTACCGTTTCATTTTCCAATTGGTCTG-3′; Il4P237 forward, 5′-AATTGGTACCTTTCCTATGCTGAAACTTTGTAG-3′; and Il4P287 forward, 5′-AATTGGTACCTGGCAACCCTACGCTGATAA-3′. The amplified PCR products were digested with KpnI and HindIII and cloned into the luciferase vector pGL3. Linker-scan mutations and binding site mutations of the Il4 promoter were also generated by the overlapping PCR method. The primers used are listed in supplemental Table S2. Constructs made were verified by sequencing. Full-length cDNA for c-Jun, JunB, GATA1, GATA2, and c-Fos were ordered from Thermo Scientific; C/EBPδ, NFAT1, and NFAT2 were ordered from Addgene (24Monticelli S. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2971-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Renilla vector PRL-SV40 ordered from Promega (Madison, WI) was used as an internal transfection control. All the plasmids used for transfection were confirmed by sequencing. RBL cells (1 × 107) were electroporated with 10 μg of luciferase plasmid, 0.5 μg of Renilla vector, and 10 μg of transcription factor expression vectors at 320 V and 950 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II. For transfecting 32D.IL-4 cells, voltage and capacity were set at 350 V and 950 microfarads, respectively. Twenty hours after electroporation, the RBL cells were stimulated by IgE cross-linking with 1 μg/ml IgE (D8406, Sigma) and 1 μg/ml anti-IgE (R35–72, BD Pharmingen) for 6 h. 32D.IL-4 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 1 μm ionomycin for 5 h. After stimulation, cells were collected, and luciferase activities were measured by an Infinite M1000® microplate reader (Tecan Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA) using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (E1960, Promega). Transcription activity was expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity divided by Renilla activity. MEK inhibitor (U0126), JNK inhibitor II (catalog number 420119), protein kinase C inhibitor (bisindolylmaleimide I), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (SB202190), calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporin A), and PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin) were ordered from Calbiochem. Bone marrow basophils (1 × 106) and RBL cells were treated with inhibitors at the concentration indicated for 2 and 12 h, respectively, before IgE cross-linking. IL-4 protein was measured using an ELISA kit (catalog number 554390, BD Pharmingen). C57BL/6 mice were treated with 5-fluorouracil (5 mg/mouse) for 5 days. Bone marrow cells were harvested from the treated mice and cultured in the presence of IL-3 (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml), and stem cell factor (50 ng/ml) for 1 day. The treated cells were infected with either GFP or C/EBPα virus by spin infection. Infected cells (2 × 106) were injected into irradiated C57BL/6 recipient mice (600 rads) intravenously. Mice were kept under pathogen-free conditions with water containing antibiotics. Four to 6 weeks later, GFP+ basophils were isolated from the bone marrow of the reconstituted mice by FACS sorting and IL-4 ELISA measurement was performed. siRNA was ordered from Thermo Scientific. The control siRNA sequence is 5′-UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA-3′, and two specific siRNAs for targeting the sequences 5′-GAGCCGAGAUAAAGCCAAA-3′ and 5′-CCUGAGAGCUCCUUGGUCA-3′ were used for C/EBPα knockdown. Basophils were isolated and enriched from bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice that were injected with the IL-3 complex. The enriched basophils were cultured in the presence of IL-3 for 2 days and used for siRNA transfection by using a Nucleofector kit (Amaxa, Lonza Ltd.). Twenty-four hours later, the transfected basophils were assayed for IL-4 production by ELISA. Purified basophils were used for protein extraction, and 50 μg of whole cell lysates were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE followed by blotting to PVDF membrane. The following antibodies were used: anti-C/EBPα (14ΑΑ, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-C/EBPδ (M-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-C/EBPϵ (H-75, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blot was detected by enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). To search for potential transcription factors that might play critical roles in regulating Il4 gene transcription in basophils, we used the candidate gene approach. We compared mRNA expression of known Th2 transcription factors or known transcription factors that are pivotal in basophil development. We showed that GATA3, RBPJκ, and c-Maf were not detectable, whereas JunB, C/EBPα, GATA1, and GATA2 were all highly expressed in basophils (Fig. 1A). In addition to C/EBPα, the C/EBP family consists of several other isoforms. In fact, C/EBPβ has been shown to bind to both human and mouse Il4 promoter and to drive Il4 reporter gene expression in T cells (25Berberich-Siebelt F. Klein-Hessling S. Hepping N. Santner-Nanan B. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Serfling E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2576-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. Li-Weber M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5273-5279PubMed Google Scholar, 27Li-Weber M. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, we further examined which of the other C/EBP isoforms is expressed in basophils and showed that C/EBPδ and C/EBPϵ, but not C/EBPβ, were also expressed in basophils (Fig. 1, B and C). We first examined whether C/EBPα can activate or enhance Il4 gene transcription in myeloid cells. We co-transfected C/EBPα with various Il4 promoter-enhancer luciferase plasmids in murine 32D.IL-4 myeloid progenitor cells, which produced a large amount of IL-4 as the result of retroviral insertional mutagenesis (these cells produced around 5–10 ng/ml/106 cells, a >10-fold increase in IL-4 production compared with the parental 32D cell line). The Il4 promoter-enhancer luciferase used in this experiment included the regulatory regions that have been shown to promote Il4 gene transcription in CD4+ Th2 cells (IL4P and hypersensitive site S (HSS)), mast cells (IE), and basophils (HS4). We showed that C/EBPα drove the Il4 promoter-luciferase reporter gene transcription, but not that of other Il4 promoter-enhancer luciferase reporter genes, after the transfected cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 2C). On average, the C/EBPα-driven Il4 promoter-luciferase reporter gene activity was around 8-fold higher than the vector-driven luciferase activity. The 32D.IL-4 cells did not express FcϵRI receptor. To test whether C/EBPα could drive the Il4 promoter-luciferase reporter gene transcription in response to IgE cross-linking (a more physiological stimulation), we used an RBL cell line. RBL cells have been shown to produce IL-4 in response to IgE cross-linking (28Erickson J. Kane P. Goldstein B. Holowka D. Baird B. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We showed that C/EBPα directed the Il4 promoter-luciferase reporter gene transcription in a similar manner in response to IgE cross-linking (Fig. 2, C and D). Although the DNA binding sequences of CEBP isoforms are highly conservative, the transactivation domains of CEBP isoforms differ significantly. To test whether other C/EBP isoforms can also activate Il4 gene expression, we performed co-transfection of C/EBPs with Il4 promoter-luciferase in RBL cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, C/EBPδ activated Il4 promoter-luciferase expression albeit less potently compared with C/EBPα. C/EBPϵ also weakly activated Il4 promoter-luciferase expression. C/EBPβ failed to activate Il4 promoter-luciferase expression. Next, we performed deletion mutation analysis to demonstrate that the −237 to +1 region of the Il4 promoter was crucial in mediating the C/EBPα-driven luciferase transcription (Fig. 3B) and was a potentially important element in the response to IgE cross-linking located in the −237 to −187 region (Fig. 3B, left). Using the linker-scan mutation method (29Rooney J.W. Hoey T. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1995; 2: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we narrowed the region that was critical in enhancing C/EBPα-driven Il4 promoter-luciferase gene transcription to −227 to −218 (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, the region did not contain a C/EBPα-binding site. To determine whether C/EBPα-binding sites are imperative in mediating Il4 reporter gene transcription, we mutated a previously identified distal C/EBPβ-binding site (TGGTGTAT→TAACGTGTT; located in the −87 to −79 region) and found that the mutation reduced the C/EBPα-driven luciferase gene transcription by 50% (Fig. 3D). Mutation of the proximal C/EBPα-binding site (TTCAGCAAC→TGACTACAC; located in the −44 to −36 region) almost abolished the C/EBPα-driven luciferase expression (Fig. 3D). C/EBPα protein contains three transcription activation domains (TE1–3) and a basic leucine zipper domain (Fig. 4A). To determine which domain(s) is essential for driving the Il4 gene transcription, we performed deletion mutation analysis and found that C/EBPα lacking TE1 lost about half of its activity, C/EBPα lacking TE1–2 lost about two-thirds of its activity, and C/EBPα lacking all three TE domains completely failed to drive the Il4 gene transcription (Fig. 4B). These results support that C/EBPα is likely to directly interact with RNA polymerase II. Mutants lacking the bZIP domain were not only completely unable to initiate the Il4 gene transcription, but they also abolished the basal levels of Il4 gene transcription driven by endogenous transcription factor serving as a dominant negative mutant (Fig. 4B). The bZIP domain can be further divided into the DNA binding domain and the leucine zipper domain, which is needed for interaction with other transcription factors, such as PU.1, GATA1, RUNX-1, and p21waf1/cip1 (30Khanna-Gupta A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2008; 41: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We showed that mutation in Arg-297, Lys-298, and Arg-300 (collectively, these mutants are called BR3 (31Paz-Priel I. Cai D.H. Wang D. Kowalski J. Blackford A. Liu H. Heckman C.A. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. Boxer L.M. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) eliminated C/EBPα-driven transcription activity, whereas deletion of the leucine zipper domain only reduced C/EBPα-driven transcription activity by half. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/EBPα directly regulates Il4 gene transcription. The PKC/MAPK pathway, calcium signaling pathway, and PI3K pathway have been shown to be critical in regulating mast cell degranulation and de novo cytokine production (32Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C.

To determine which signaling pathway is involved in FcϵRI activation-induced IL-4 production by basophils, we injected mice with the IL-3 and anti-IL-3 antibody complex, a method that expands the number of basophils in the bone marrow by 10-fold in 3 days (20Ohmori K. Luo Y. Jia Y. Nishida J. Wang Z. Bunting K.D. Wang D. Huang H. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 2835-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We used the treated bone marrow without further enriching basophils because we found that basophils were the only cell type in the bone marrow that produced IL-4 (data not shown). IL-3 complex-treated bone marrow cells were treated with various inhibitors. We showed that PI3K (both wortmannin and LY294002; supplemental Fig. S1), MEK, JNK, the calcium signaling pathway, and the p38 signaling pathway were critical to IL-4 production by bone marrow basophils after IgE stimulation (Fig. 5A). Identical findings were obtained using the RBL cell line (Fig. 5B). To further determine which of PI3K, MEK, JNK, calcium signaling pathway, and p38 signaling pathway are essential in C/EBPα-mediated IL-4 production, we examined whether C/EBPα could drive the Il4 promoter-luciferase gene transcription in the presence of various inhibitors. We showed that only the calcium signaling pathway and the PI3K inhibitor nearly abolished the C/EBPα-driven Il4 promoter-luciferase gene transcription, whereas other inhibitors did not show any significant effects. These results demonstrate that the calcium signaling pathway and the PI3K signaling pathway are imperative in the C/EBPα-driven IL-4 production (Fig. 5C). This conclusion is consistent with a recent report (34Kuroda E. Antignano F. Ho V.W. Hughes M.R. Ruschmann J. Lam V. Kawakami T. Kerr W.G. McNagny K.M. Sly L.M. Krystal G. J.

https://openalex.org/W2038126121,"In yeast, the two main F(O) proton-translocating subunits of the ATP synthase (subunits 6/a and 9/c) are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Unfortunately, mutations that inactivate the F(O) typically result in loss of mtDNA under the form of ρ(-)/ρ(0) cells. Thus, we have designed a novel genetic strategy to circumvent this problem. It exploits previous findings that a null mutation in the nuclear ATP16 gene encoding ATP synthase subunit δ results in massive and lethal F(O)-mediated protons leaks across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mutations that inactivate the F(O) can thus, in these conditions, be selected positively as cell viability rescuing events. A first set of seven mutants was analyzed and all showed, as expected, very severe F(O) deficiencies. Two mutants carried nuclear mutations in known genes (AEP1, AEP2) required for subunit c expression. The five other mutations were located in mtDNA. Of these, three affect synthesis or stability of subunit a transcripts and the two last consisted in a single amino acid replacement in subunit c. One of the subunit c mutations is particularly interesting. It consists in an alanine to valine change at position 60 of subunit c adjacent to the essential glutamate of subunit c (at position 59) that interacts with the essential arginine 186 of subunit a. The properties of this mutant suggest that the contact zone between subunit a and the ten subunits c-ring structure only involves critical transient interactions confined to the region where protons are exchanged between the subunit a and the c-ring."

IntroductionNeuritogenesis is a dynamic process involving the extension of long, thin protrusions called neurites that will subsequently differentiate into long axons or an elaborate dendritic arbor (1Giannone G.

This highly polarized process occurs through the segmentation from the soma periphery of a microtubule-rich shaft capped with a growth cone, which itself is characterized by an actin-rich lamellipodium with numerous filopodial extensions and integrin-mediated adhesive contacts. Understanding this process is crucial, as it is necessary for proper wiring of the brain and nerve regeneration and has been linked to numerous neurodegenerative diseases.Although cultured neurons randomly form neurites in vitro, in vivo this process is orchestrated by gradients of chemoattractants, extracellular matrix proteins, and collapsing factors that precisely guide neurite initiation and advancement (5Arimura N.

This occurs in a polarized and highly controlled manner and relies on spatially regulated mechanisms for gradient sensing, membrane trafficking, integrin-mediated adhesion, and organization of the actin-microtubule cytoskeleton (5Arimura N.

Protein phosphorylation is a critical posttranslational modification that regulates protein-protein interactions, enzymatic activity, and subcellular localization. The reversible addition of PO43− to serine, threonine, and tyrosine amino acid residues is mediated by more than 500 kinases and more than 150 phosphatases (18Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R.

In many cases, kinases phosphorylate specific amino acids in the context of a consensus recognition sequence. For example, ERK is a proline-directed kinase that phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues with the consensus sequence PX(S/T)P, where X can be a neutral or basic amino acid (21Kim E.K. Choi E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1802: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 22Yee K.L. Weaver V.M. Hammer D.A. IET Syst.

Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The identification of phosphorylation sites in the context of a specific kinase recognition sequence of given substrates has proven quite useful in the predication of kinase activation events in the cell (25Linding R. Jensen L.J. Ostheimer G.J. van Vugt M.A. Jørgensen C. Miron I.M. Diella F. Colwill K. Taylor L. Elder K. Metalnikov P. Nguyen V. Pasculescu A. Jin J. Park J.G. Samson L.D. Woodgett J.R. Russell R.B.

Also, kinases themselves can be phosphorylated at specific sites that are known to promote enzymatic activation, which can be used to predict kinase activity in the cell. This is further enriched by computational models that predict higher order contextual features of kinases such as protein scaffolding, subcellular localization, and expression patterns (13Jørgensen C.

When combined, in silico programs have been shown to predict kinase activity with significant accuracy. This approach has been applied to large phosphoproteomic data sets consisting of thousands of phosphorylation sites revealing important kinase signaling networks that modulate cell migration, DNA damage, and yeast biology (13Jørgensen C.

Consequently, our understanding of the complex kinase/substrate signaling networks that regulate neurite formation and guidance is not defined. Here we describe a microporous filter method that facilitates selective purification of neurites undergoing growth or retraction. This fractionation method combined with immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography and LC-MS protein identification technologies facilitated the identification of thousands of protein phosphorylation signatures that mediate neurite extension or retraction events induced by growth promoting or collapsing stimuli, respectively. Functional annotation and kinase activity predications in silico revealed phosphoprotein networks controlling cytoskeletal remodeling, axon/dendrite specification, and cell adhesion. Kinase signaling analysis and cell-based assays revealed that an integrin/MEK/ERK signaling pathway operates as a critical switch controlling neurite extension and retraction dynamics.DISCUSSIONOur ability to differentially isolate neurites in a state of growth or retraction for proteomic analyses provided a simple and robust system to globally profile thousands of protein phosphorylation and kinase changes that mediate neuritogenesis. An important aspect of this model system is the ability to specifically isolate the neurite from the soma for proteomic analyses. This unique strategy allowed us to mine deeper into the neurite phosphoproteome, uncovering many more low abundant phosphoproteins. Because of this, we were able to obtain a more precise picture of the complex spatial kinase/substrate networks that control neurite growth/retraction kinetics. Also, the neurite purification methods described here will likely transfer to other neuronal cell types, guidance factors, and collapsing agents. For example, we have previously reported that neurites can be readily purified from PC12 cells responding to laminin and fibronectin guidance cues (35Pertz O.C. Wang Y. Yang F. Wang W. Gay L.J. Gristenko M.A. Clauss T.R. Anderson D.J. Liu T. Auberry K.J. Camp 2nd, D.G. Smith R.D. Klemke R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It may also be possible to selectively purify axons and dendrites from primary neurons for detailed proteomic analyses using specific differentiation and/or guidance factors. In any case, the utility of this model system combined with the rapid progress being made in quantitative mass spectrometry will help provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neurite proteome and its spatial organization, which in turn will provide valuable insight into the various disease pathologies caused by deregulation of this process.Using NetworKIN, we find that a large panel of kinases is active during neurite growth, whereas a relatively reduced number of kinases are active during retraction. Many of these kinases have been previously implicated in the regulation of different aspects of neurite outgrowth. PKA (PKACA) can trigger neurite outgrowth by phosphorylating synapsins (89Kao H.T. Song H.J. Porton B. Ming G.L. Hoh J. Abraham M. Czernik A.J. Pieribone V.A. Poo M.M. Greengard P. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) (90Vaudry D. Stork P.J. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The MET receptor (MET) enhances axonal outgrowth of cultured dorsal root ganglions by potentiating NGF signaling (91Maina F. Hilton M.C. Ponzetto C. Davies A.M. Klein R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3341-3350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase BTK (BTK) phosphorylates the actin regulator N-WASP, which is essential for neurite outgrowth (92Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The cyclin kinase Cdk5 (CDK5) regulates neurite and axon outgrowth by phosphorylating the kinase PAK1 and the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B (93Paglini G. Cáceres A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GSK3 (GSK3A) phosphorylates the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (Crmp-2) to promote neurite elongation via microtubule assembly (94Yoshimura T. Kawano Y. Arimura N. Kawabata S. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. Cell. 2005; 120: 137-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase kinase MKK4 (MAP2K4) and its substrate JNK (MAPK9) have also been involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth through the phosphorylation of the microtubule binding proteins MAP, MAP1, doublecortin, and SGC10 (95Haeusgen W. Boehm R. Zhao Y. Herdegen T. Waetzig V. Neuroscience. 2009; 161: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although these findings point to a wide array of kinase classes that regulate neuritogenesis, it is likely that they work together in time and space to fine-tune changes in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons that drive this process. Using similar proteomics and bioinformatic methods, we recently revealed a Rho GTPase signaling network that regulates neurite outgrowth (35Pertz O.C. Wang Y. Yang F. Wang W. Gay L.J. Gristenko M.A. Clauss T.R. Anderson D.J. Liu T. Auberry K.J. Camp 2nd, D.G. Smith R.D. Klemke R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This allowed us to uncover an unexpected signaling complexity, with different Rho GTPase signaling modules operating in time and space to regulate distinct neurite functions including neurite initiation, elongation, pathfinding, and filopodial stabilization. Similarly, the wide kinase activation and signal annotation profiles we observes hint to a high degree of modularity in fine tuning neuritogenesis. On the other hand, the precise functions of the protein kinases that modulate LPA-induced neurite collapse were less clear from our phosphoproteomic datasets. However, one of these kinases, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1, regulates microtubule depolymerization and the shortening of neuronal processes (96Yang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lee E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8357-8370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It will be important in the future to systematically probe these different kinase-substrate networks to reveal their specialized contribution to the dynamic processes of neurite growth and retraction.Our combined informatics and functional studies revealed that integrin to MEK/ERK signaling plays a prominent role in controlling neuritogenesis. Based on our findings and the work of others, we have constructed a working model for how MEK/ERK activation and deactivation by LPA control neuritogenesis (Fig. 6C). The signaling components that were used to construct the schematic and their relative abundance in the soma and neurite as well as their observed phosphorylation sites are listed in Fig. 6C and supplemental Table 3. Fig. 6C panel a shows the proposed pathway for how integrins mediate ERK activation leading to neurite extension. ECM proteins like laminin and fibronectin are present as adhesive gradients in the extracellular environment that can initiate and guide neurite protrusion from the cell body through activation of integrin receptors and the recruitment of their downstream effectors including FAK/CAS/Crk (8Dent E.W.

This canonical pathway operates spatially in the neurite to drive localized Rac activation of PAK. PAK then phosphorylates MEK Ser-298, leading to enhanced MEK and ERK activity as described in non-neuronal cells (31Park E.R. Eblen S.T. Catling A.D. Cell.

The integrin/Rac/PAK/MEK-Ser-298 signaling cascade promotes strong sustained ERK activation, which serves as a switch to mediate neurite outgrowth while suppressing basal RhoA/ROCK/MLC-mediated membrane contractility, possibly through PKA activation (panel b).Although the spatial mechanisms that promote localized ERK activation in the neurite are not clear, the integrin/Rac/PAK activation pathway most likely works in close conjunction with common upstream activators of MEK including Rap-1, Ras, and Raf (22Yee K.L.

It is notable that although MEK activation may occur through either B-Raf and/or Raf-1 activation, our phosphoproteomics work suggests that B-Raf is more likely involved as Raf-1 is highly phosphorylated on Ser-43 (growth specific) in extending neurites (supplemental Table 1). Ser-43 phosphorylation has previously been associated with PKA activation and is inhibitory to Raf-1 kinase activity (105Gerits N. Kostenko S. Shiryaev A. Johannessen M. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1592-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 106Dhillon A.S. Meikle S. Peyssonnaux C. Grindlay J. Kaiser C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Eychène A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). How then is B-Raf activity modulated to increase MEK/ERK signaling? Integrin activation of Rap-1 can modulate B-Raf activity, as can cAMP/PKA signaling (102Retta S.F. Balzac F. Avolio M. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rap1A and -B isoforms are present in the neurite, and several Rap1 GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and GAP (GTPase-activating protein) effector proteins are differentially phosphorylated during neurite growth and retraction (supplemental Table 1). Rap activity and its effectors could be modulated directly or indirectly by integrin activation and/or cell spreading on laminin, possibly through PKA activation (102Retta S.F. Balzac F. Avolio M. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Alternatively, integrin activation of FAK/Src can facilitate activation of the canonical Grb2 (growth factor rector-bound protein 2)/SOS (son of sevenless)/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (22Yee K.L. Weaver V.M. Hammer D.A. IET Syst. Biol. 2008; 2: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the end, ERK activity self-regulates by modulation of its upstream activators through negative feedback phosphorylation of MEK-S292, which suppresses PAK phosphorylation of 298 and phosphorylation of B-Raf-Ser-151, which inhibits B-Raf activity (102Retta S.F. Balzac F. Avolio M. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fig. 6C panel c shows a list of cytoskeletal effector proteins that are either known and/or predicted to be phosphorylated by ERK and, thus, may modulate neurite growth. Of particular interest are α-parvin, which modulates focal adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics and the microtubule modulating proteins Crmp-1, MARK2 (microtubule-associated regulatory kinase 2), MAP1B, and MAP2 (10Dehmelt L.

Supplemental Table 2 shows a complete list of all identified phosphoproteins with ERK consensus phosphorylation signatures.An important finding in our study was that LPA could disrupt integrin signaling, leading to blockade of the CAS/Crk/Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK pathway (Fig. 6C, panels a and b). We suspect that this facilitates neurite detachment from the ECM by losing integrin adhesions to the substratum while activating the Rho/ROCK contractile mechanisms that physically mediate growth cone collapse and membrane retraction through force generation (Fig. 6C and supplemental Fig. 1) (7Nikolic M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 731-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the RhoA/ROCK/MLC pathway has been reported to mediate neurite collapse by modulating Crmp family proteins and microtubule dynamics (5Arimura N. Kaibuchi K.

In our work here, Crmp-1 was observed to be enriched by 7-fold in the neurite and to be differentially phosphorylated on multiple sites in neurites undergoing growth or retraction (supplemental Table 1). Although the mechanisms that block LPA-induced integrin signaling in the neurite are not defined, Abl family kinases (Abl and Arg) are likely to play a central role through their ability to modulate CAS/Crk coupling and Rac activity at adhesion sites as described (8Dent E.W.

Cell. 2006; 17: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importantly, we found that Abl is hypertyrosine-phosphorylated and enriched by 7-fold in the neurite. Also, Abl itself and its known substrates c-CrkII Tyr-221 and LASP-1 show increased phosphorylation in the neurite in response to LPA (Fig. 4E) (82Lin Y.H. Park Z.Y. Lin D. Brahmbhatt A.A. Rio M.C. Yates 3rd, J.R. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This suggests that LPA activates Abl kinase, which in turn tyrosine phosphorylates Crk at Tyr-221, inhibiting CAS/Crk coupling and downstream Rac/PAK/MEK activation. It is also notable that LPA did not inhibit MEK-Ser-298 phosphorylation by PAK in cells expressing constitutively activated MEK, which was associated with decreased neurite retraction (Fig. 5, A and D). This suggests that MEK/ERK signaling provides a positive feedback to maintain integrin/CAS/Crk/Rac/PAK signaling and, thus, prevents neurite retraction.Taken together our work and the work of others suggest a model whereby the net effect of high Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK activation and RhoA inhibition is increased membrane protrusion and decreased neurite contraction events leading to net neurite growth. Increased Rac activity has been shown to suppress RhoA signaling, which leads to neurite growth in neurons (7Nikolic M. Int. J. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2017632262,"Protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane occurs via a ""translocon"" channel formed by the Sec61p complex. In yeast, two channels exist: the canonical Sec61p channel and a homolog called Ssh1p. Here, we used trapped translocation intermediates to demonstrate that a specific signal recognition particle-dependent substrate, Sec71p, is targeted exclusively to Ssh1p. Strikingly, we found that, in the absence of Ssh1p, precursor could be successfully redirected to canonical Sec61p, demonstrating that the normal targeting reaction must involve preferential sorting to Ssh1p. Our data therefore demonstrate that Ssh1p is the primary translocon for Sec71p and reveal a novel sorting mechanism at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane enabling precursors to be directed to distinct translocons. Interestingly, the Ssh1p-dependent translocation of Sec71p was found to be dependent upon Sec63p, demonstrating a previously unappreciated functional interaction between Sec63p and the Ssh1p translocon."

In the heart, MAPKs are implicated in regulating Cx43 remodeling; however, their precise roles remain obscure. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) is a critical component of the stress-activated MAPK signaling pathway. We have demonstrated previously that MKK4 antagonizes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Herein, we investigate the role of MKK4 in regulating Cx43 expression in cardiomyocytes. We found that knockdown of MKK4 expression or inhibition of its kinase activity in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) significantly reduced phenylephrine-induced Cx43 expression. Furthermore, two activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding elements in the Cx43 promoter region were identified as being responsible for the MKK4-regulated Cx43 expression. Consistently, we also detected heterogeneously reduced Cx43 expression and attenuated zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) content in the hearts of MKK4 cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out mice (MKK4cko) following pressure overload. To test whether heterogeneously reduced Cx43 expression contributes to ventricular arrhythmic vulnerability, MKK4cko and control mice were subjected to pressure overload followed by programmed electrical stimulation (PES). Six of 13 MKK4cko mice, but none of the controls, developed ventricular tachycardia. Epicardial activation mapping recorded from the MKK4cko hypertrophied heart showed ventricular activation delay. Mathematical models have simulated that the spatially heterogeneous decrease in Cx43 causes slowed ventricular conduction and fragmented wave propagations leading to re-entrant excitations. Collectively, these data reveal a novel role for MKK4 in regulating Cx43 expression and preventing hypertrophy-associated arrhythmogenesis.Cx43 is the predominant isoform of gap junction proteins in the working myocardium. It forms low resistance cell-to-cell channels, allowing ions and small molecules to move between adjacent cells and facilitating the orderly spread of the excitation wave responsible for synchronous contraction of the heart (1Saffitz J.E. Kléber A.G. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alterations in Cx43 expression may contribute directly to the arrhythmic substrate, as evidenced by studies in mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Cx43. Loss of Cx43 expression in the heart results in sudden arrhythmic death due to increased gap junctional resistance and slowed conduction velocity, which form a substrate for re-entrant arrhythmias (2Gutstein D.E.

Cx43 has a fast turnover rate with a half-life in the range of 1–5 h, implying a highly regulated process for its synthesis, trafficking, and degradation (1Saffitz J.E. Kléber A.G. Circ.

For example, activation of JNK in cardiomyocytes was correlated with the up-regulation of Cx43 after amphetamine treatment (6Shyu K.G. Wang B.W. Yang Y.H. Tsai S.C. Lin S. Lee C.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas Petrich et al. (7Petrich B.G. Eloff B.C. Lerner D.L. Kovacs A. Saffitz J.E. Rosenbaum D.S. Wang Y. J. Biol.

Destrument A. Tournier C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It was observed in vitro that MKK7 and MKK4 preferentially phosphorylate JNK on threonine 183 and tyrosine 185, respectively (13Brancho D. Tanaka N. Jaeschke A. Ventura J.J. Kelkar N. Tanaka Y.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The targeted deletion of the mkk4 or mkk7 gene leads to embryonic lethality, providing genetic evidence that MKK4 and MKK7 have nonredundant roles in vivo (12Wang X. Destrument A. Tournier C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This concept is underscored by the observation in mice with brain-specific ablation of mkk4 that decreased JNK activity caused a defect in neuronal migration and premature death (15Wang X. Nadarajah B. Robinson A.C. McColl B.W. Jin J.W. Dajas-Bailador F. Boot-Handford R.P. Tournier C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 7935-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have provided substantial evidence demonstrating the functional importance of MKK4 in the heart, where it is required in protecting the heart from maladaptive pathological hypertrophy (16Liu W. Zi M. Jin J. Prehar S. Oceandy D. Kimura T.E. Lei M. Neyses L. Weston A.H. Cartwright E.J. Wang X. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In the current study, we investigated the role of MKK4 in regulating Cx43 expression in cardiomyocytes in response to hypertrophic stress. We found in NRCMs that knockdown of endogenous MKK4 expression by siMKK4 or inhibition of its kinase activity by infection of an adenovirus encoding a dominant-negative form of MKK4 (Ad-dnMKK4) caused a substantial reduction in Cx43 expression together with inactivation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway after phenylephrine (PE) stimulation. To gain insight into the mechanism responsible for the decreased Cx43 transcript level, luciferase reporter assays were performed in siMKK4- or Ad-dnMKK4-NRCMs in which blunted Cx43 promoter reporter activity was detected after PE treatment. We also have demonstrated that MKK4 regulates Cx43 transcription most likely by virtue of two AP-1 binding sites in the Cx43 proximal promoter region.Consistent with these data, we observed decreased transcript and protein levels of Cx43 in the MKK4-deficient myocardium after 1 week of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Furthermore, the remaining Cx43 was found to be distributed heterogeneously in the MKK4cko-TAC hearts. In addition, we discovered a reduction in ZO-1 protein expression in the MKK4cko-TAC myocardium. To assess whether heterogeneously reduced Cx43 in the MKK4-deficient myocardium contributes to ventricular arrhythmic vulnerability, PES was applied to TAC-treated MKK4cko and MKK4f/f (littermate controls) mice, almost half of the MKK4cko mice (six of 13) compared with none of the controls (0/11) exhibited multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Epicardial activation mapping was recorded in the isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts showing ventricular activation delay in the MKK4cko-TAC heart. Accordingly, mathematical simulation models have demonstrated that the spatially heterogeneous decrease in Cx43 in MKK4cko-TAC mice causes slowed ventricular conduction and fragmented excitation wave fronts leading to re-entry, which may account for the increased susceptibility in ventricular arrhythmias.Overall, in the present work, we provide new information revealing the role of MKK4 in regulating Cx43 gene expression in cardiomyocytes, implying MKK4 is a critical cardiac protector preventing hypertrophy-associated ventricular arrhythmias through restriction of Cx43 remodeling.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we provide several lines of evidence demonstrating that MKK4 regulates Cx43 expression in cardiomyocytes. Knockdown of MKK4 or blocking its kinase activity in primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in a reduction in Cx43 expression. By promoter-reporter assays, we have shown that MKK4 modulates Cx43 expression through AP-1 activity. Study of the MKK4cko heart provided in vivo evidence demonstrating functional effects of MKK4 deficiency-induced Cx43 alteration. A deficiency of MKK4 in cardiomyocytes caused patchy Cx43 reduction in response to pressure overload. This alteration in Cx43 expression/distribution may constitute an arrhythmogenic substrate in MKK4cko-TAC mice.Regulation of Cx43 Expression by MKK4Assembly of gap junctions is a multiphase process, including connexin synthesis, trafficking, and formation of intercellular channels, of which connexin synthesis is the rudimentary step. It has been shown that the Cx43 promoter region contains several putative transcription factor binding sites for AP-1, cAMP response element, and specific protein-1 (SP-1), all of which are thought to be involved in up-regulation of Cx43 transcription (24Teunissen B.E. Jansen A.T. van Amersfoorth S.C. O'Brien T.X. Jongsma H.J. Bierhuizen M.F. Gene. 2003; 322: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Mitchell J.A. Lye S.J. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2048-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the other hand, muscle segment homeobox genes Msx1/2 can function in concert with T-box factors Tbx2/3 to repress Cx43 expression (26Boogerd K.J. Wong L.Y. Christoffels V.M. Klarenbeek M. Ruijter J.M. Moorman A.F. Barnett P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 78: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite this progress in understanding the transcriptional regulation of Cx43, the genetic control mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal expression pattern of Cx43 remain exclusive. In the current study, we have provided several lines of evidence to demonstrate MKK4 regulation of Cx43 gene expression: 1) knockdown of endogenous MKK4 expression by siMKK4 or inhibition of its kinase activity by infection of Ad-dnMKK4 caused a substantial reduction in Cx43 expression; 2) luciferase reporter assays showed blunted Cx43-promoter reporter activity in siMKK4- or Ad-dnMKK4-NRCMs after PE treatment; 3) increased MKK4 activation in NRCMs resulted in elevated Cx43 promoter-reporter activity; and 4) luciferase assays using mutations in the Cx43 promoter region demonstrated that MKK4-regulated Cx43 transcription is dependent on AP-1 transcriptional activity. Consistent with these data, decreased Cx43 expression was also detected in the MKK4cko-TAC heart. Of note, there was a similar reduction of Cx43 at both the mRNA and protein level. We thus believe that the MKK4/JNK/c-Jun pathway regulates Cx43 transcription via AP-1 activity in cardiomyocytes under hypertrophic stress and that decreased Cx43 protein expression is likely attributable to its reduced mRNA level.Cx43 is a highly phosphorylated and regulated protein. It has been proposed that phosphorylation of Cx43 is related to its internalization (5Laird D.W. Biochimica. et Biophysica. Acta. 2005; 1711: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); however, previous studies have also demonstrated that dephosphorylated Cx43 is associated with trafficking/endocytosis in the cytoplasm, whereas those gap junctions remaining in the intercalated disc contain phosphorylated Cx43 (27Matsushita T. Oyamada M. Fujimoto K. Yasuda Y. Masuda S. Wada Y. Oka T. Takamatsu T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Lampe P.D. Cooper C.D. King T.J. Burt J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3435-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In our experimental setting, we presently cannot rule out that (de)phosphorylation of Cx43 contributes to its reduction and heterogeneous expression in MKK4cko-TAC cardiomyocytes. However, the migratory pattern of Cx43 on SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis appeared similar in both controls and MKK4cko-TAC hearts. Alterations in Cx43 phosphorylation status may not always be reflected in its mobility on polyacrylamide gels, and, therefore, additional studies employing antibodies specific for different phosphorylated isoforms of Cx43 are necessary to resolve this issue.Roles of Junctional Proteins in MKK4cko-TAC MiceIt has become apparent that molecular “cross-talk” exists between gap junctions and adherens junctions or desmosomes. For example, cardiac-specific perturbation of N-cadherin leads to the formation of an arrhythmogenic substrate by an alteration in Cx43 (29Kostetskii I. Li J. Xiong Y. Zhou R. Ferrari V.A. Patel V.V. Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 30Li J. Patel V.V. Kostetskii I. Xiong Y. Chu A.F. Jacobson J.T. Yu C. Morley G.E. Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). β-Catenin, in addition to scaffolding N-cadherin to actin, also contributes to transcriptional regulation of Cx43 (31Ai Z. Fischer A. Spray D.C. Brown A.M. Fishman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Mutations in plakoglobin are linked to a rare recessive disorder, Naxos disease (32McKoy G. Protonotarios N. Crosby A. Tsatsopoulou A. Anastasakis A. Coonar A. Norman M. Baboonian C. Jeffery S. McKenna W.J. Lancet. 2000; 355: 2119-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cx43 levels are decreased remarkably in the hearts of Naxos disease patients, who present with right ventricular cardiomyopathy accompanied by a high incidence of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (32McKoy G. Protonotarios N. Crosby A. Tsatsopoulou A. Anastasakis A. Coonar A. Norman M. Baboonian C. Jeffery S. McKenna W.J.

ZO-1, in fact, physically associates with Cx43 acting as an adaptor, which anchors gap junctions to the cytoskeleton (20Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12725-12731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 33Maass K. Shibayama J. Chase S.E. Willecke K. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Abolition of the association of ZO-1 and Cx43 results in a reduction in the number of gap junction plaques and an increase in mean plaque size (33Maass K. Shibayama J. Chase S.E. Willecke K. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present study, we did not observe visible abnormalities in the expression and distribution of N-cadherin, β-catenin, and plakoglobin in the MKK4cko heart. However, ZO-1 expression proved to be significantly decreased in the MKK4cko hypertrophic heart. This reduction of ZO-1 expression may underlie the observed diffused expression of Cx43, part of which was detected in the cytoplasm. It is presently unclear whether MKK4 deficiency is directly responsible for the decreased ZO-1 expression or whether it is secondary to the reduction of Cx43 expression.Loss of MKK4 Couples Hypertrophic Signals to ArrhythmogenesisCell-to-cell coupling and myocardial tissue architecture are thought to be major factors dictating normal impulse propagation through the heart (34Kléber A.G. Rudy Y. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 431-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). QRS duration is determined by impulse conduction velocity and cardiomyocyte size (35Wiegerinck R.F. Verkerk A.O. Belterman C.N. van Veen T.A. Baartscheer A. Opthof T. Wilders R. de Bakker J.M. Coronel R. Circulation. 2006; 113: 806-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One week after TAC, MKK4cko mice displayed increased cardiac hypertrophy as indicated by enlarged cross-sectional area (346.5 ± 3.26 μm2) compared with 252.4 ± 6.88 μm2 cross-sectional area in the MKK4f/f cardiomyocyte (16Liu W. Zi M. Jin J. Prehar S. Oceandy D. Kimura T.E. Lei M. Neyses L. Weston A.H. Cartwright E.J. Wang X. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, ECG recordings showed prolonged QRS duration and greater QRS/QTc ratio in the MKK4cko-TAC heart, whereas JT intervals did not appear significantly different between the two TAC groups. Epicardial activation mapping demonstrated delayed ventricular electrical propagation in the MKK4cko-TAC heart. Together, these results indicate that the MKK4cko-TAC heart had slowed ventricular conduction, which is likely attributed to patchy Cx43 reduction together with increased cardiomyocyte size. Furthermore, in the hypertrophied MKK4cko heart, heterogeneity in Cx43 expression is thought to result in cardiomyocyte uncoupling, which creates the nonuniformities required for initiating breaks in a propagating wavefront. The mathematical models in this study have simulated this phenomenon. Computational simulations demonstrate that this spatially heterogeneous decrease in Cx43 accounts for slowed ventricular conduction and fragmented wave propagations, a critical factor for arrhythmogenesis. Previous studies have shown that ventricular myocardium is not homogeneous; it has electrophysiologically distinct cell types, which give rise to transmural voltage gradients and a dispersion of repolarization (36Antzelevitch C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 50: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Heterogeneity in Cx43 distribution has been correlated with increased transmural dispersion in refractoriness (37Wiegerinck R.F. van Veen T.A. Belterman C.N. Schumacher C.A. Noorman M. de Bakker J.M. Coronel R. Heart Rhythm. 2008; 5: 1178-1185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the hypertrophic response of enlarged myocardium mass, is believed to add additional factors to transmural dispersion of repolarization, augmenting electrical heterogeneities intrinsic to the ventricular myocardium. As such, it is plausible that heterogeneously reduced Cx43 expression together with increased hypertrophy predispose MKK4cko mice to ventricular arrhythmias.We have noticed that although a significant decrease was seen in Cx43 expression at both the mRNA and protein level in all MKK4cko-TAC hearts; however, six of 13 mutant mice developed ventricular tachycardia when in vivo ventricular programmed pacing was introduced. The possible reasons for such individual discrepancy in occurrence of ventricular tachycardia could be due to the heterogeneous reduction and distribution of Cx43 in MKK4cko-TAC mice, or due to individual difference in the extent of hypertrophy induced by TAC hence leads to a nonuniform reduction and/or distribution of Cx43 in MKK4cko-TAC mice, or due to the nature of the different response (changes in Cx43 expression) of individual mouse to TAC stress and genetic modification of MKK4.Of note, apart from cardiomyocytes, interstitial collagen deposition is also responsible for cardiac tissue architecture. Increased interstitial fibrosis, especially reparative fibrosis, which replaces zones of dead cardiomyocytes with collagen within muscle bundles, can disrupt impulse propagation. This type of fibrotic change is expected to amplify the effect of conduction slowing and electrical uncoupling in the areas of Cx43 remodeling. Interestingly, 1 week of TAC treatment did not cause apparent apoptosis and fibrosis in MKK4cko mice (16Liu W. Zi M. Jin J. Prehar S. Oceandy D. Kimura T.E. Lei M. Neyses L. Weston A.H. Cartwright E.J. Wang X. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); thus, involvement by interstitial fibrosis in ventricular tachycardia occurrence in MKK4cko mice can be excluded.ConclusionsIn summary, we have identified a new role for MKK4 in regulating Cx43 expression in cardiomyocytes. MKK4 is a critical regulator in the heart for maintaining Cx43 expression/distribution, which are important for preservation of normal cardiac electrical function. The recognition of the functional significance of MKK4 in preventing arrhythmogenesis, together with our previous findings that MKK4 antagonizes pathological hypertrophy, may lead to the development of better therapies for treating hypertrophy-associated ventricular arrhythmias.

In the heart, MAPKs are implicated in regulating Cx43 remodeling; however, their precise roles remain obscure. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) is a critical component of the stress-activated MAPK signaling pathway. We have demonstrated previously that MKK4 antagonizes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Herein, we investigate the role of MKK4 in regulating Cx43 expression in cardiomyocytes. We found that knockdown of MKK4 expression or inhibition of its kinase activity in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) significantly reduced phenylephrine-induced Cx43 expression. Furthermore, two activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding elements in the Cx43 promoter region were identified as being responsible for the MKK4-regulated Cx43 expression. Consistently, we also detected heterogeneously reduced Cx43 expression and attenuated zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) content in the hearts of MKK4 cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out mice (MKK4cko) following pressure overload. To test whether heterogeneously reduced Cx43 expression contributes to ventricular arrhythmic vulnerability, MKK4cko and control mice were subjected to pressure overload followed by programmed electrical stimulation (PES). Six of 13 MKK4cko mice, but none of the controls, developed ventricular tachycardia. Epicardial activation mapping recorded from the MKK4cko hypertrophied heart showed ventricular activation delay. Mathematical models have simulated that the spatially heterogeneous decrease in Cx43 causes slowed ventricular conduction and fragmented wave propagations leading to re-entrant excitations. Collectively, these data reveal a novel role for MKK4 in regulating Cx43 expression and preventing hypertrophy-associated arrhythmogenesis.Cx43 is the predominant isoform of gap junction proteins in the working myocardium. It forms low resistance cell-to-cell channels, allowing ions and small molecules to move between adjacent cells and facilitating the orderly spread of the excitation wave responsible for synchronous contraction of the heart (1Saffitz J.E. Kléber A.G. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alterations in Cx43 expression may contribute directly to the arrhythmic substrate, as evidenced by studies in mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Cx43. Loss of Cx43 expression in the heart results in sudden arrhythmic death due to increased gap junctional resistance and slowed conduction velocity, which form a substrate for re-entrant arrhythmias (2Gutstein D.E.

Willecke K. Jongsma H.J. Opthof T. de Bakker J.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1048-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Cx43 has a fast turnover rate with a half-life in the range of 1–5 h, implying a highly regulated process for its synthesis, trafficking, and degradation (1Saffitz J.E. Kléber A.G. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Laird D.W. Biochimica. et Biophysica. Acta. 2005; 1711: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In the heart, MAPKs are implicated in regulating Cx43 remodeling by either phosphorylation- or transcription-dependent mechanisms (6Shyu K.G. Wang B.W. Yang Y.H. Tsai S.C. Lin S. Lee C.C. Cardiovasc.

For example, activation of JNK in cardiomyocytes was correlated with the up-regulation of Cx43 after amphetamine treatment (6Shyu K.G. Wang B.W. Yang Y.H. Tsai S.C. Lin S. Lee C.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas Petrich et al. (7Petrich B.G. Eloff B.C. Lerner D.L. Kovacs A. Saffitz J.E. Rosenbaum D.S. Wang Y. J. Biol.

Destrument A. Tournier C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It was observed in vitro that MKK7 and MKK4 preferentially phosphorylate JNK on threonine 183 and tyrosine 185, respectively (13Brancho D. Tanaka N. Jaeschke A. Ventura J.J. Kelkar N. Tanaka Y. Kyuuma M. Takeshita T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 14Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl.

The targeted deletion of the mkk4 or mkk7 gene leads to embryonic lethality, providing genetic evidence that MKK4 and MKK7 have nonredundant roles in vivo (12Wang X. Destrument A. Tournier C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This concept is underscored by the observation in mice with brain-specific ablation of mkk4 that decreased JNK activity caused a defect in neuronal migration and premature death (15Wang X. Nadarajah B. Robinson A.C. McColl B.W. Jin J.W. Dajas-Bailador F. Boot-Handford R.P. Tournier C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 7935-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have provided substantial evidence demonstrating the functional importance of MKK4 in the heart, where it is required in protecting the heart from maladaptive pathological hypertrophy (16Liu W.

Understanding how viral fusion proteins mediate entry will provide valuable information for antiviral intervention to combat associated disease. The avian sarcoma and leukosis virus envelope glycoproteins, trimers composed of surface (SU) and transmembrane heterodimers, break the fusion process into several steps. First, interactions between SU and a cell surface receptor at neutral pH trigger an initial conformational change in the viral glycoprotein trimer followed by exposure to low pH enabling additional conformational changes to complete the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.

This study demonstrates the utility of this simple yet powerful method for assigning disulfide bonds in a complex glycoprotein. To enter cells and begin replication, enveloped viruses must fuse the membrane coating the viral particle with a cellular membrane to deliver a subviral particle inside the cell (for review, see Refs. 1Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 2White J.M. Delos S.E. Brecher M. Schornberg K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 189-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The fusion of two membranes is thermodynamically favored but comes with a very high kinetic barrier(s). Enveloped viruses have one or more glycoproteins to mediate the fusion process using the energy liberated upon conformational changes of the viral glycoprotein(s) to clear the kinetic barrier(s). Viral entry begins when the viral glycoproteins bind an appropriate cell surface protein initiating one of three possible mechanistic fates. The viral glycoprotein-receptor interaction can serve to enable trafficking of the virion into the endocytic pathway where the low pH environment triggers a conformation change in the viral glycoproteins initiating fusion of the viral and endosome membranes (e.g. influenza virus). With other viruses, for example most retroviruses, the viral glycoprotein-receptor interaction itself triggers a conformational change in the viral glycoproteins at neutral pH at the cell surface sufficient for the ultimate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. In a third mechanism, the interaction between the viral glycoprotein and receptor at neutral pH at the cell surface triggers an initial conformational change in the viral glycoproteins. The triggered glycoproteins then require exposure to low pH to complete the conformational changes for fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (e.g. avian sarcoma and leukosis viruses (ASLVs)). 3The abbreviations used are: ASLVavian sarcoma and leukosis virusCIDcollision-induced dissociationECDelectron capture dissociationESIelectrospray ionizationFTFourier transformFTICRFourier transform ion cyclotron resonanceMS/MStandem mass spectrometryPNGase FN-glycosidase FSUsurfaceTCEPtris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphineTEVtobacco etch virusTMtransmembrane. Understanding how viral fusion proteins mediate entry will provide valuable information for antiviral intervention to combat associated disease. We are using the homologous group of retroviruses, subgroups A to E ASLV, to study enveloped virus entry because these viruses have evolved from a common ancestor to use different cellular proteins as receptors (3Hunter E.

All retroviral glycoproteins are synthesized as polyprotein precursors consisting of the surface glycoprotein (SU) that contains the domains that bind the cellular receptor and the transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) that anchors the protein to the membrane and contains the domains responsible for the fusion process (for review, see Ref. 8Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar). After synthesis, the precursor polyproteins are glycosylated and form trimers through noncovalent interactions between extracellular regions of the TM glycoprotein. The viral glycoprotein precursors form a mature, metastable complex capable of mediating virus entry into the cell only after the SU and TM domains are cleaved by a cellular protease to yield a trimer of SU/TM heterodimers (9Young J.A.T. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 87-103Google Scholar). The interaction of multiple, noncontiguous regions of SU and a specific receptor protein are required to initiate the entry process by triggering a conformational change in the SU glycoproteins, allowing the kinetically trapped TM glycoprotein structure to extend and form a lower energy structure that projects the fusion peptide toward the target membrane. Two domains in TM are critical for the extension and the subsequent refolding of TM: the N-terminal and C-terminal heptad repeats. The lowest energy form of the TM trimer, the six-helix bundle, forms when the C-terminal heptad repeats fold back into grooves created by the N-terminal heptad repeats, bringing the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity. Fusion of the membranes goes through an initial outer lipid leaflet mixing, then hemifusion, initial pore formation, pore widening, and the completion of fusion where the retroviral glycoprotein 6HB may undergo additional structural rearrangements (10Markosyan R.M.

Acta. 2003; 1614: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cooperation of several glycoprotein-receptor interactions is likely required to form a local environment capable of fusion. The subgroup A to E ASLV envelope glycoproteins are highly related: differences in the hypervariable domains of SU (hr1, hr2, and vr3) define receptor usage and suggest that these viruses have evolved from a common ancestor (13Coffin J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Tva, the receptor for subgroup A ASLV, is related to the ligand-binding repeat of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (14Bates P. Young J.A. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 15Young J.A. Bates P. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tvb, the receptors for the subgroup B, D, and E ASLVs, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (16Adkins H.B. Brojatsch J. Naughton J. Rolls M.M. Pesola J.M. Young J.A.T. Proc. Natl.

Tvc, the receptors for subgroup C ASLVs, is related to yet a third disparate family of proteins, the immunoglobulin Ig proteins (19Elleder D. Stepanets V. Melder D.C. Senigl F. Geryk J. Pajer P. Plachý J. Hejnar J. Svoboda J. Federspiel M.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10408-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The normal physiological functions of Tva, Tvb, and Tvc are currently unknown. Engineered secreted forms of these ASLV receptors, the extracellular domain of the receptor alone or fused to a IgG domain, retain biological activity sufficient to bind the viral glycoproteins with high affinity and trigger conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins similar to changes expected to occur during initiation of the infection process (20Damico R. Bates P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6469-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Hernandez L.D. Peters R.J. Delos S.E. Young J.A. Agard D.A. White J.M. J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 10051-10060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Engineered secreted forms of the SU glycoproteins either alone or fused to an IgG domain can bind the soluble forms of the receptors in a subgroup-specific manner (23Holmen S.L. Federspiel M.J. Virology. 2000; 273: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The secreted forms of the ASLV SU or its receptor act as competitive inhibitors, having a significant antiviral effect on the specific ASLV subgroup infection of cells (22Holmen S.L. Salter D.W.

Virol. 2001; 75: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We are characterizing the structural and functional organization of the ASLV glycoproteins to understand better how the ASLV fusion proteins mediate the entry process (25Barnard R.J. Young J.A.T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 281: 107-136PubMed Google Scholar). Because the number and location of the cysteine residues, 14 Cys in SU, 5 in TM, and 13 of 14 possible N-linked glycosylation sites, 12 in SU, 2 in TM, are conserved in the subgroup A to E ASLV glycoproteins, it is likely these glycoproteins share a common structure and glycosylation pattern. Unusual for retroviruses, the ASLV TM glycoprotein has an internal fusion peptide 21 residues downstream of the N terminus with 2 cysteine residues flanking the fusion peptide. The organization of the functional domains of the ASLV TM fusion protein is remarkably similar to the Ebola virus fusion protein, GP2, although the ASLV SU and Ebola virus GP1 glycoproteins are not (26Gallaher W.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 477-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Weissenhorn W. Calder L.J. Wharton S.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6032-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A disulfide bond reported to be stable throughout the fusion process covalently connects the ASLV SU and TM glycoproteins. If we assume that the disulfide bond links 1 cysteine from SU and 1 cysteine from TM, then there is at least 1 cysteine in SU that is an unbound, free cysteine. Recently, Smith and Cunningham reported that the formation of a reactive cysteine thiolate at residue Cys38 in the subgroup A SU glycoprotein was absolutely required for productive ASLV infection but was not necessary for the glycoprotein binding of the Tva receptor or Tva-triggered conformational changes (28Smith J.G. Cunningham J.M. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Also, there was no evidence that the cysteine thiolate mediated isomerization of the SU-TM disulfide bond. In this study we physically mapped the secondary structure of an engineered secreted form of the subgroup A ASLV envelope glycoprotein (Fig. 1A). Einfeld and Hunter describe a secreted form of the subgroup A envelope glycoprotein truncated at TM residue 129 (SUATM129) (Fig. 1B), deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, which was still capable of forming oligomers (likely trimers) detected by sucrose gradient (29Einfeld D.A. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2383-2389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SUATM129 glycoprotein was expressed in chicken DF-1 cells (30Himly M. Foster D.N. Bottoli I. Iacovoni J.S. Vogt P.K.

We used this biologically active, complex glycoprotein to develop a simple, automated method for acquiring high resolution mass spectrometry data that enabled the identification of disulfide-linked peptides, the assignment of most of the disulfide bonds, and the identification of the sites of N-linked glycosylation from a single HPLC run. All of the proteases used, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Asp-N- endoproteinase, were sequencing grade and purchased from Roche Diagnostics. The PNGase F was purchased from New England Biolabs, and the Zwittergent 3-16 from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). The solvents were purchased from Honeywell Burdick and Jackson (Morristown, NJ), and the trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and formic acid were purchased from Fluka. The tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) and N-ethylmorpholine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. To aid in the purification of the SUATM129 glycoprotein, a 10-histidine residue tag preceded by the TEV protease cleavage sequence was added in-frame after amino acid 469 of the SR-A enveloped protein (Fig. 1). An adapter plasmid encoding the SUA-rIgG immunoadhesin, PUCCLA112N-SUA-rIgG, was described previously (23Holmen S.L. Federspiel M.J. Virology. 2000; 273: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The IgG region was replaced with the SalI to MfeI fragment of the SR-A env gene yielding a coding region that begins with a consensus Kozac start site, NcoI site, and encodes the complete leader region and the SR-A envelope to residue 469. Oligonucleotides were then used to add the TEV protease and His10 sequences by cloning as an MfeI to PstI fragment into PUCCLA112-SUATM129. The complete and tagged SUATM129 expression cassette was isolated as a ClaI fragment and cloned into the TFANEO expression plasmid under the transcriptional control of SR-A LTRs (32Federspiel M.J. Crittenden L.B. Hughes S.H. Virology. 1989; 173: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). TFANEO also encodes a neo expression cassette for selection. DF-1 cells (30Himly M. Foster D.N.

DF-1 cells transfected with the TFANEO-SUATM129 plasmid were grown in 500 μg of G418/ml to select for neomycin-resistant cells. Clones were isolated using cloning cylinders (Bellco Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ), expanded, and maintained with standard medium supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418. When the SUATM129-expressing cells were confluent, the medium was changed to a serum-free medium, VP-SFM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), harvested 24 h later, and cleared of debris using a 3 μm capsule filter (12116; PALL). The cleared supernatant was mixed with TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech), prewashed, and equilibrated with wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl) for 90 min at room temperature to bind the SUATM129 protein His10 tag, and then loaded into a chromatography column by gravity flow. The resin was washed with wash buffer (500 bed volumes) and then washed with 2.5 mm imidazole followed by 10 mm imidazole in wash buffer (100 bed volumes each). The resin was then eluted first with 5 bed volumes of 75 mm imidazole followed by 5 bed volumes of 250 mm imidazole in wash buffer, and the fractions were combined, concentrated and the buffer exchanged with 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, using JumboSep concentrators with 10K filters (PALL). To purify the SUATM129 protein further from contaminating proteins, ammonium sulfate was added to the preparation, resulting in a loading buffer of 1 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed with a gradient exchanging the load buffer to 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, buffer. The SUATM129 protein was eluted first with water, recovering ∼60–70% of the protein, followed by elution with 20% ethanol that recovered some additional SUATM129 protein. Fractions containing SUATM129 protein were combined and concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol for storage. To analyze reduced proteins, the samples were adjusted to 1× Laemmli loading buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. To analyze nonreduced proteins, the samples were adjusted to 1× Laemmli loading buffer without the β-mercaptoethanol (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. To analyze native proteins, the samples were adjusted to 1× Laemmli loading buffer without the SDS and β-mercaptoethanol (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and loaded directly. Proteins were separated on Criterion 4–15% Tris-HCl gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and either silver stained directly (33Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar), or the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The Western transfer filters were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 10% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 25 °C. The filters were then rinsed briefly in rinse buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with either an unconjugated anti-His antibody (1:3000 dilution) (27471001; GE Healthcare) or anti-ASLV SU(A) monoclonal antibody (34Ochsenbauer-Jambor C. Delos S.E. Accavitti M.A. White J.M. Hunter E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7518-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (purified from the mc8C5 hybridoma, a kind gift from Christina Ochsenbauer-Jambor and Eric Hunter, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL) (1:1000 dilution) in rinse buffer containing 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 25 °C. The filters were washed extensively with rinse buffer and then incubated with 50 ng/ml peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) in rinse buffer with 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 25 °C. After extensive washing with rinse buffer, immunodetection of the protein-antibody-peroxidase complexes was performed with Western blotting Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The immunoblots were then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. For alkaline phosphatase assays, DF-1 cell cultures (∼30% confluent) were incubated with 10-fold serial dilutions of the appropriate RCASBP/alkaline phosphatase virus stocks for 36–48 h. The assay for alkaline phosphatase activity was described previously (22Holmen S.L. Salter D.W. Payne W.S. Dodgson J.B. Hughes S.H. Federspiel M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10051-10060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin digestions were done as follows. 100 μg of SUATM129 was initially digested with 2.5 μg of trypsin in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 0.004% Zwittergent 3-16 buffer at 55 °C for 2 h. An additional 2.5 μg of trypsin in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 0.004% Zwittergent 3-16 buffer was then added to the reaction and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Chymotrypsin digestions were done as follows. 100 μg of purified SUATM was digested with 5 μg of chymotrypsin in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.004% Zwittergent 3-16 buffer at room temperature overnight. To remove all N-linked glycosylation, PNGase F (500 units/μl) (3000 units) was added to the postdigest reactions and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Each digest mixture was split into two aliquots, with the disulfide bonds reduced in one aliquot by adding TCEP (25 mm final) and incubating at 55 °C for 2 h. The nonreduced or reduced peptide mixtures were each separated with a Zorbax 300 SB-C18, 5-μm, 150 × 0.5-mm reverse phase column using an Agilent 1100 Series Capillary HPLC system at a flow rate of 15 μl/min and collecting 1-min fractions using gradients described in Table 1. Detection was by UV absorbance at 214 nm. All fractions were then dried down using a SpeedVac spinning concentrator and stored at −80 °C. Fractions were reconstituted with 40% acetonitrile, 5% isopropyl alcohol, and 0.2% formic acid prior to analysis by direct chip-based infusion Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry using an LTQ-FTICR-MS with electron capture dissociation (ECD) and an Advion Nanomate 100.TABLE 1HPLC running conditions for peptide separationProteaseGradientTime% BminSUATM/trypsinPhase A: 5% acetonitrile/0.1% TFAPhase B: 80% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA0515511545117801208012251355SUATM/chymotripsinPhase A: 5% acetonitrile/0.1% TFAPhase B: 80% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA0252108593069807280732782 Open table in a new tab Endoproteinase Asp-N was utilized for the fractions found to contain adjacent cysteines. The digests were performed on dried HPLC fractions that were resolubilized in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.4, with 4 ng of Asp-N and digested at 37 °C overnight prior to analysis by nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS. The fractions that were analyzed by chip-based direct infusion FTICR-ECD-MS were redried and solubilized in 0.2% N-ethylmorpholine buffer plus 1 ng of Asp-N and digested at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The HPLC fractions were resolubilized in 30 μl of 40% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid, 5% isopropyl alcohol. All disulfide-linked peptides were identified by screening the fractions with chip-based ESI infusion using an Advion Nanomate 100 coupled to a ThermoFinnigan LTQ-FT Hybrid Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer upgraded with the ECD capability. The Nanomate was set to pick up 6 μl of sample and spray at 1.5 kV with N2 back-pressure of 0.3 pound/square inch. Each fraction was screened for 3 min, performing data-dependent acquisitions consisting of a FT full scan from 300 to 2000 m/z with the resolving power set at 100,000 @ 400 m/z followed by an ECD scan from 100–2000 m/z (3 microscans, 100,000 R, energy = 4.0, delay = 10 ms, duration = 100 ms) on ions with charge states of [M+2H]2+ or higher, plus a linear ion trap collision-induced dissociation (CID) scan on ions with charge states of [M+2H]2+ and [M+3H]3+. Each ion was analyzed twice then placed on an exclusion list for 60 s. All ECD spectra were analyzed manually by looking for the presence of theoretical trypsin-cleaved peptide ions. Non-cysteine-containing peptide ions were identified from analysis of the CID-MS/MS spectra. ThermoFinnigan Xcalibur QualBrowser software was used to determine the theoretical isotopic distributions for the isotope clusters. Fractions containing peptides with adjacent cysteines were analyzed by nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS using a ThermoFinnigan LTQ Orbitrap Hybrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a nanoLC-two-dimensional HPLC system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA). The chymotrypsin fraction containing the C1 and C17C18C19 peptides was treated with Asp-N protease, after which an aliquot was diluted with 0.15% formic acid and 0.05% TFA and loaded onto a 250-nl OPTI-PAK trap (Optimize Technologies, Oregon City, OR) custom packed with Michrom Magic C8 solid phase (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). Chromatography was performed using 0.2% formic acid in both the A solvent (98% water and 2% acetonitrile) and B solvent (80% acetonitrile, 10% isopropyl alcohol, and 10% water), and a 10% B to 50% B gradient over 45 min at 325 nl/min through a hand-packed PicoFrit (New Objective, Woburn, MA) nanobore (Michrom Magic C18 3-μm 75 μm × 200 mm) column. The LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer experiment consisted of a FT full scan from 300 to 1200 m/z with resolution set at 60,000 (at 400 m/z), followed by Orbitrap CID MS/MS scans on the top three ions at 30,000 resolution. Dynamic exclusion was set to 2, and selected ions were placed on an exclusion list for 30 s. The lock-mass option was enabled for the FT full scans using the ambient air polydimethylcyclosiloxane ion of m/z = 445.120024 or a common phthalate ion m/z = 391.284286 for real-time internal calibration (35Olsen J.V. de Godoy L.M.

The MS/MS spectra ions were assigned manually. Relative abundance of the disulfide-linked peptides was determined for some of the HPLC fractions using Edman degradation N-terminal chemical sequencing on a Procise cLC Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The amino acid assignments were made manually, and the relative amounts of each peptide were determined from the amino acid yields of the first few sequencing cycles. The SUATM129 glycoprotein was produced in chicken cells, normal host cells for ASLV replication, to ensure appropriate envelope glycoprotein folding, glycosylation, and transport. DF-1 cell lines were established that stably produced SUATM129. SUATM129 was expressed as a secreted protein with a histidine tag to allow a relatively simple purification procedure of biologically active protein from cell culture supernatants in good yield (see “Experimental Procedures”). Biological activity was demonstrated by the ability of the SUATM129 protein to bind a soluble form of the ASLV subgroup A Tva receptor as shown by immunoprecipitation (data not shown) and the ability of SUATM129 to inhibit cell surface expressed Tva and specifically block ASLV(A) infection of normally susceptible cells by greater than 10–50-fold compared with another ASLV subgroup (data not shown). The calculated molecular mass of SUATM129 is 53,496 Da; the SUA subunit (37,265 Da) connected to the TM129 subunit (16,249 Da) by a disulfide bond. Previously published work on the secreted SUA-rIgG immunoadhesin, the complete SUA subunit fused to a rabbit IgG domain, identified that 10 of 11 potential N-linked glycosylation sites in SUA were glycosylated with ∼23 kDa of carbohydrate. If the SUATM129 glycoprotein contains similar levels of glycosylation, the SUATM129 glycosylated molecular mass would be a"

As in the case of Ala scanning, key residues in the primary structure are identified, and one of them is replaced by Cys via site-directed mutagenesis. The thiol of the residue introduced is subsequently modified by alternative chemical reagents to yield diverse Cys-X mutants of the protein. This chemical approach is orthogonal to Ala or Cys scanning and allows the expansion of the repertoire of amino acid side chains far beyond those present in natural proteins. In its present application, we have introduced Cys-X residues in human glutathione transferase (GST) M2-2, replacing Met-212 in the substrate-binding site. To achieve selectivity of the modifications, the Cys residues in the wild-type enzyme were replaced by Ala. A suite of simple substitutions resulted in a set of homologous Met derivatives ranging from normethionine to S-heptyl-cysteine. The chemical modifications were validated by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The derivatized mutant enzymes were assayed with alternative GST substrates representing diverse chemical reactions: aromatic substitution, epoxide opening, transnitrosylation, and addition to an ortho-quinone. The Cys substitutions had different effects on the alternative substrates and differentially enhanced or suppressed catalytic activities depending on both the Cys-X substitution and the substrate assayed. As a consequence, the enzyme specificity profile could be changed among the alternative substrates. The procedure lends itself to large-scale production of Cys-X modified protein variants.
