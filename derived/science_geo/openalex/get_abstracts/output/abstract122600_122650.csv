https://openalex.org/W1980862600,"Learners rely on a combination of experience-independent and experience-dependent mechanisms to extract information from the environment. Language acquisition involves both types of mechanisms, but most theorists emphasize the relative importance of experience-independent mechanisms. The present study shows that a fundamental task of language acquisition, segmentation of words from fluent speech, can be accomplished by 8-month-old infants based solely on the statistical relationships between neighboring speech sounds. Moreover, this word segmentation was based on statistical learning from only 2 minutes of exposure, suggesting that infants have access to a powerful mechanism for the computation of statistical properties of the language input."

Contained within the mushroom-shaped homo-oligomeric heptamer is a solvent-filled channel, 100 A in length, that runs along the sevenfold axis and ranges from 14 A to 46 A in diameter. The lytic, transmembrane domain comprises the lower half of a 14-strand antiparallel beta barrel, to which each protomer contributes two beta strands, each 65 A long. The interior of the beta barrel is primarily hydrophilic, and the exterior has a hydrophobic belt 28 A wide. The structure proves the heptameric subunit stoichiometry of the alpha-hemolysin oligomer, shows that a glycine-rich and solvent-exposed region of a water-soluble protein can self-assemble to form a transmembrane pore of defined structure, and provides insight into the principles of membrane interaction and transport activity of beta barrel pore-forming toxins."

In tomato plants, one class of wound-responsive genes encodes proteinase inhibitor (pin) proteins shown to block insect feeding. Application of many different factors will induce or inhibit pin gene expression. Ethylene is required in the transduction pathway leading from injury, and ethylene and jasmonates act together to regulate pin gene expression during the wound response."
https://openalex.org/W1981218861,"Stress responses in plants involve changes in the transcription of specific genes. The constitutively active mutants of two related Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPK1 and CDPK1a) activate a stress-inducible promoter, bypassing stress signals. Six other plant protein kinases, including two distinct CDPKs, fail to mimic this stress signaling. The activation is abolished by a CDPK1 mutation in the kinase domain and diminished by a constitutively active protein phosphatase 2C that is capable of blocking responses to the stress hormone abscisic acid. A variety of functions are mediated by different CDPKs. CDPK1 and CDPK1a may be positive regulators controlling stress signal transduction in plants."

Only those tubes with inner diameters of 4 nanometers or more were filled, suggesting a capillarity size dependence as a result of the lowering of the nanotube-salt interface energy with increasing curvature of the nanotube walls. Nanotube cavities should also be less chemically reactive than graphite and may serve as nanosize test tubes. This property has been illustrated by monitoring the decomposition of silver nitrate within nanotubes in situ in an electron microscope, which produced chains of silver nanobeads separated by high-pressure gas pockets."

We have analyzed the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways in hematopoietic cells transformed by Bcr/Abl. STAT5 and, to a lesser extent, STATs 1 and 3 were constitutively activated by tyrosine phosphorylation and induction of DNA binding activity in both P210 and P190BCR/ABL-transformed cells, but P190 differed in that it also prominently activated STAT6. There was low level tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs 1, 2, and 3 in Bcr/Abl-transformed cells, but no detectable complex formation with Bcr/Abl, and activation of STAT5 by P210 was not blocked by two different dominant-negative JAK mutants. These results suggest that P210 and P190BCR/ABL directly activate specific STAT family members and may help explain their overlapping yet distinct roles in leukemogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1979218462,"Indirect mechanisms are implicated in the pathogenesis of the dementia associated with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Proinflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and eicosanoids are elevated in the central nervous system of patients with HIV-1-related dementia. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potential mediator of neuronal injury, because cytokines may activate the immunologic (type II) isoform of NO synthase (iNOS). The levels of iNOS in severe HIV-1-associated dementia coincided with increased expression of the HIV-1 coat protein gp41. Furthermore, gp41 induced iNOS in primary cultures of mixed rat neuronal and glial cells and killed neurons through a NO-dependent mechanism. Thus, gp41-induced NO formation may contribute to the severe cognitive dysfunction associated with HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W1546743948,"Immobilization stress of male Sprague-Dawley rats induces oxidative damage to lipid, protein, and DNA in the brain. Significant increases in lipid peroxidation were found in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and midbrain compared to the unstressed controls. Significant increases in levels of protein oxidation were also found in the cortex, hypothalamus, striatum, and medulla oblongata. Oxidative nuclear DNA damage increased after stress in all brain regions, although only the cerebral cortex showed a significant increase. Depletion of glutathione showed some stimulation to oxidative damage in the unstressed control and stressed animals. Further studies of the mitochondrial and cytosol fractions of cerebral cortex demonstrated that mitochondria showed a significantly greater increase in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation than cytosol. Data from plasma and liver showed oxidative damage similar to that of the brain. These findings provide evidence to support the idea that stress produces oxidants, and that the oxidative damage in stress could contribute to the degenerative diseases of aging, including brain dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2052577034,"The three-dimensional structure of human decorin, a secreted proteoglycan involved in the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis and cellular growth, has been modeled based on the crystal structure of the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor. Both proteins contain leucine-rich repeats and share 18% identical residues. This model structure of decorin has an arch shape with the single glycosaminoglycan chain and the three N-linked oligosaccharides located on the same side of the molecule. Decorin was modeled as binding to a polar sequence of collagen type I found in the d band. The inner concave surface is the appropriate size and shape to accommodate only one collagen triple helix of ∼3 nm in length. The binding of one collagen triple helix to decorin is proposed to play a major role in the formation of the staggered arrangement of collagen molecules within the microfibrils by preventing lateral fusion of collagen molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2024868532,"We reported previously that the induced differentiation of the myelomonocytic cell line U937 by vitamin D3 is facilitated by the transcriptional induction of the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene by the vitamin D3 receptor (Liu, M., Lee, M.-H., Cohen, M., and Freedman, L. P. (1996) Genes Dev. 10, 143-153). Retinoic acid (RA), a physiological metabolite of vitamin A, is also a potent inducer of differentiation of several cell types, including myeloid leukemic cells. Like vitamin D3, RA acts through a subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, RARs and RXRs (retinoid X receptors), which regulate the expression of target genes by binding to specific DNA elements and modulating transcription initiation. In this report we demonstrate that the gene encoding p21 is also a RA-responsive target gene, and we describe a functional RA response element in this gene's promoter which is required to confer RA induction through RARRXR heterodimers. These results correlate the RA induction of monocytic differentiation of U937 cells with the transcriptional activation of the p21 gene and suggest a role for this cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex inhibitor in facilitating this differentiation pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2026330341,"The human beta-chemokine receptor CCR5 is an important cofactor for entry of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). The murine form of CCR5, despite its 82 percent identity to the human form, was not functional as an HIV-1 coreceptor. HIV-1 entry function could be reconstituted by fusion of various individual elements derived from the extracellular region of human CCR5 onto murine CCR5. Analysis of chimeras containing elements from human CCR5 and human CCR2B suggested that a complex structure rather than single contact sites is responsible for facilitation of viral entry. Further, certain chimeras lacking the domains necessary to signal in response to their natural chemokine ligands retained vigorous HIV-1 coreceptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2091259187,"A subset of B lymphocytes present primarily in the peritoneal and pleural cavities is defined by the expression of CD5 and is elevated in autoimmune diseases. Upon signaling through membrane immunoglobulin M (mIgM), splenic B lymphocytes (B-2) proliferate, whereas peritoneal B cells (B-1) undergo apoptosis. However, in CD5-deficient mice, B-1 cells responded to mIgM crosslinking by developing a resistance to apoptosis and entering the cell cycle. In wild-type B-1 cells, prevention of association between CD5 and mIgM rescued their growth response to mIgM crosslinking. Thus the B cell receptor-mediated signaling is negatively regulated by CD5 in normal B-1 cells."

https://openalex.org/W2030693139,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation and the regulation of adipocyte gene expression. Insulin also serves to promote adipogenesis. We report that insulin and a PPARγ ligand (thiazolidinedione (TZD)) stimulate in a synergistic manner the expression of an adipocyte-specific gene (aP2) in rat adipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells. Potential cross-talk between insulin signaling and PPARγ was studied in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing insulin receptors (CHO.T), PPARγ, and reporter genes. Both TZD and insulin independently stimulated PPARγ-mediated transactivation of aP2 promoter-luciferase reporter genes; both agents combined resulted in a synergistic effect. Co-transfection of CHO.T cells with dominant-negative mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-kinase (MKK1) abrogated both insulin- and TZD-mediated activation of PPARγ; transactivation was markedly increased in cells co-transfected with constitutively active MKK1. Both insulin and constitutively active MKK1 also stimulated 32P incorporation into PPARγ in vivo. The conclusions are: 1) Insulin synergizes with a PPARγ ligand and can activate the receptor in a ligand-independent fashion. 2) PPARγ is phosphorylated in vivo by insulin stimulation or activation of the MAP kinase pathway. 3) MAP kinase is an important mediator of cross-talk between insulin signal transduction pathways and PPARγ function.

Adipogenesis is a complex process regulated by a variety of hormones and molecules. Upon the induction of differentiation of fibroblast-like preadipocytes to mature adipocytes, a cascade of gene transcription events occurs, leading to the expression of a constellation of genes specific for adipocytes (1Spiegelman B.M.

Ligands for PPARγ, such as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 and antidiabetic thiazolidinedione (TZD) compounds, are potent inducers of adipocyte differentiation (7Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have an important role in potentiating the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Because both insulin (or IGF-1) and PPARγ regulate adipocyte differentiation, cross-talk between the two signaling pathways may occur. Insulin elicits its biological effects through activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and other immediate substrates (12White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proximal tyrosyl phosphorylation events lead to activation of several distinct signal transduction pathways including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. This involves activation of p21 Ras, which in turn activates Raf-1 leading to the activation of MAP kinase kinase (MKK) and the activation of p44MAPK (ERK1) and p42MAPK (ERK2) MAP kinases (13Kyriakis J.M.

Evidence is presented that suggests that insulin's effects are mediated by MAP kinase, which results in phosphorylation of PPARγ.

A high affinity PPARγ ligand, 5-[4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl)-2-hydroxyethoxy]-benzyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (TZD), was provided by G. Kieczykowski, P. Eskola, C. Santini, J. Leone, and P. Cicala (Merck). Adipocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats using a previously described procedure (21Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Packed adipocytes (4 ml) were added to 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and the incubation was carried out at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 16 h. Insulin (100 nM) or TZD (1 μM) were added to the culture medium, and the incubation was continued for 24 h. Confluent 3T3-L1 cells were incubated in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μM dexamethasome with insulin (100 nM), TZD (1 μM), or both agents for 72 h. Total RNA preparation, Northern, and slot blot procedures were performed as described (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The hybridization signals were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or autoradiography using XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak). The entire coding region of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 were subcloned into pSG5 vector or pMT2-HA. aP2 reporter plasmids were constructed by ligating promoter fragments (−5.4 kilobases) into PGL3 basic (Promega) or by ligating the luciferase gene into a reporter plasmid adjacent to the aP2 518-base pair enhancer and minimal promoter. A mutant PPARγ receptor with Ser112 to Ala mutation was prepared from pMT2-HA-PPARγ2 using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. CHO.T cells (600,000 cells/well, 6-well plate) were transiently transfected with various expression plasmids (total, 2-3 μg of DNA) and pCH110 (1 μg) using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent following the manufacturer's instruction. Lysates were prepared followed by the determination of luciferase and β-galacotosidase activities as described (17Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N. Leibowitz M.D. Moller D.E. Berger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). CHO.T cells (100-mm plates) were transfected with pMT2-HA-PPARγ2 with or without MKK1 expression vectors. 5 h after transfection, cells were refed and incubated in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 16 h. Cells were then serum-starved for 24 h, followed by incubation with phosphate-free medium for 4 h and then with medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/3 ml) and okadaic acid (300 nM). Cells were subsequently incubated for 30 min with or without insulin (500 nM). Cells were then washed and lysed. HA-tagged PPARγ was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco) and separated by electrophoresis on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and the 32P-labeled proteins were detected by PhosphorImager or autoradiography. Separate sets of membranes were incubated with anti-HA antibody. Protein bands were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.) and quantitated using IMAGEQUANT™ (Molecular Dynamics). GST-PPARγ and GST-PPARγ/LBD proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described by the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). PPARγ proteins (3 μg) were incubated in 30 μl of buffer containing 18 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM vanadate, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 20 μM ATP (5 μCi), and 0.2 μg of purified activated GST-p42 MAP kinase (UBI) at 30°C for 30 min. The proteins were separated on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the phosphoproteins were visualized with a PhosphorImager or by autoradiography. The effects of insulin and TZD, a high affinity PPARγ ligand, on the expression of a PPARγ-regulated gene, adipocyte-specific fatty acid binding protein (aP2), were assessed. In cultured primary rat adipocytes, incubation with insulin did not greatly affect the expression level of aP2, whereas incubation with TZD resulted in a slight increase in mean aP2 mRNA levels (Fig. 1A). However, when cells were incubated with both agents, aP2 mRNA levels were increased in a synergistic manner (Fig. 1A). To verify these observations using a different cell system, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were incubated for 72 h in the presence of TZD, insulin, or a combination of the two, followed by subsequent measurement of aP2 mRNA levels. Insulin alone did not cause significant changes in ap2 mRNA expression, whereas TZD induced a 30-fold increase in mean mRNA levels. Coincubation with insulin and TZD caused a further increase (50-fold) in aP2 expression (Fig. 1B). To determine whether insulin has an effect to augment the transcriptional activity of PPARγ, transactivation experiments were performed using transfected CHO cells that express insulin receptor, PPARγ, and PPARγ-responsive reporter genes. Following transfection, the cells were treated with TZD, insulin, or the combination of the two agents. As shown in Fig. 2, TZD caused a ∼2-fold increase in −5.4 kilobases aP2 promoter-luciferase activity, which was mediated by co-transfected PPARγ2. In the same cells, insulin alone stimulated PPARγ-mediated aP2 transcription by 10-fold. Even greater stimulation (60-fold) was observed when cells were incubated simultaneously with TZD and insulin. Lessor degrees of stimulation by insulin or insulin plus TZD were observed using cells without co-transfected PPARγ, indicating the presence of low levels of the endogenous protein (confirmed by Northern analysis; not shown). A similar pattern of PPARγ-mediated transactivation that was stimulated by insulin and (synergistically) by TZD plus insulin was also observed using alternative reporter constructs containing the distal 518-base pair enhancer of the aP2 promoter or a generic PPRE (data not shown). These results suggest that the effects of insulin and TZD on aP2 expression are mediated through PPARγ and PPRE. Furthermore, similar effects were observed when PPARγ1 rather than γ2 was used in the transactivation assay (data not shown). Thus, insulin stimulation can modulate the activity of PPARγ, independently of exogenous ligand as well as synergistically when combined with a known PPARγ agonist. In addition, we studied the effects of insulin and TZD in CHO.T cells that were co-transfected with pSG5-GR/PPARγ-LBD and the MMTV-LUC reporter gene. Although TZD stimulation resulted in a 10-fold increase in the luciferase activity, insulin had no effect (not shown). This suggests that the amino acid residue(s) of PPARγ, which are modulated in response to insulin signaling, reside outside of the receptor's ligand binding domain. In order to assess whether the MAP kinase pathway was required for insulin-mediated activation of PPARγ, CHO.T cells co-transfected with PPARγ and aP2 (5.4)-LUC were treated with or without PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MKK1 (20Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar). The effect of insulin on PPARγ activation was attenuated by this agent (50% inhibition at 10 μM, data not shown). To further explore this hypothesis, CHO.T cells were co-transfected with PPARγ and aP2 (5.4)-LUC, with or without the addition of alternative MKK1 constructs. As shown in Fig. 3, co-transfection with dominant-negative MKK1 abolished the effect of insulin and TZD to stimulate transactivation. In contrast, co-transfection with a constitutively active MKK1 mutant resulted an ∼3-fold increase in basal transactivation and an even more marked increase in TZD-mediated transactivation; the responses to insulin and insulin plus TZD were also augmented (∼2-fold). Co-transfection with wild-type MKK1 or RSK1, a kinase that lies downstream of MAP kinase, had no effects. Co-transfection with wild-type MAP kinase (ERK-1) resulted a modest increase in the effect of insulin and insulin plus TZD, suggesting amplification of the insulin-induced signal. The above results suggest that MAP kinase is both necessary and sufficient for the insulin-mediated effect on PPARγ function. Examination of the primary sequence of PPARγ indicates the presence of a potential MAP kinase phosphorylation site at Ser112. This sequence (PASP) matches the consensus sequence for MAP kinase (PXn(S/T)P; where X is a neutral or basic amino acid and n = 1 or 2) as defined by Gonzalez et al. (23Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the GST fusion protein containing full-length PPARγ2 was phosphorylated by purified P42MAP kinase in vitro. In contrast, protein containing the 300-residue PPARγ ligand binding domain (and lacking Ser112) was a poor substrate for MAP kinase. In addition, a PPARγ2 site-directed mutant (Ser112→ Ala) was not phosphorylated in vitro by p42 MAP kinase (not shown). To determine whether MAP kinase could modulate the phosphorylation state of PPARγ in intact cells, CHO.T cells were transfected with epitope-tagged PPARγ with or without MKK1 mutants, labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and then treated acutely with insulin. 32P-Labeled HA-PPARγ was subsequently immunoprecipitated from the lysates and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). Stimulation with insulin resulted in a significant (4-fold) increase in 32P incorporation into the HA-PPARγ protein. The addition of co-transfected constitutively active MKK1 was associated with a substantial increase (10-fold over basal) in PPARγ phosphorylation, whereas dominant-negative MKK1 inhibited the insulin-stimulated incorporation of 32P into HA-PPARγ. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that the 32P incorporation occurred on serine residue (data not shown). In the present study, we have demonstrated that insulin stimulates the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of PPARγ. These observations provide a link between two important elements involved in the regulation of adipogenesis and the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. Several lines of evidence were provided to show that the effects of insulin are mediated by MAP kinase. MAP kinase activation was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for in vivo phosphorylation of PPARγ and for mediating transcriptional activation in response to insulin. The results of these studies also suggest that insulin, via MAP kinase, can activate PPARγ in a ligand-independent fashion, as demonstrated in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 using CHO cells expressing insulin receptors. Data using rat adipocytes or 3T3-L1 cells clearly showed that insulin can substantially augment ligand-stimulated expression of a classic PPARγ-responsive gene (aP2). However, the extent to which insulin may independently promote the transcriptional activity of PPARγ in adipocytes may be more limited because insulin alone did not significantly affect expression of aP2 mRNA (Fig. 1). These results also imply that the function of PPARγ to regulate adipogenesis and adipocyte gene expression may involve critical control by a variety of stimuli (in addition to insulin or IGF-1) that modulate the activity of MAP kinase. In this regard, it should be noted that growth hormone is a potent stimulus of preadipocyte (3T3-F442A) differentiation and acts to stimulate MAP kinase activity in these same cells (14Campbell G.S. Pang L. Miyasaka T. Saltiel A.R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6074-6080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, preadipocyte proliferation has been demonstrated in response to α2-adrenoreceptor activation, which also resulted in activation of the MAP kinase pathway (16Bouloumie A. Planat V. Devedjian J.-C. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.-S. Record M. Lafontan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30254-30259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A requirement for MAP kinase in adipocyte differentiation was suggested by Sale et al., who noted that antisense inhibition of MAP kinase expression blocked the ability of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to undergo differentiation in response to insulin (15Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Growth factor-stimulated activation of nuclear hormone receptors has been previously reported and is best exemplified by the estrogen receptor. The estrogen receptor is activated by extracellular signals, including epidermal growth factor (24Ignar-Trowbridges D.M. Teng C.T. Ross K.A. Parker M.G. Korach K.S. McLachlan J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 992-998PubMed Google Scholar), insulin, and IGF-1 (25Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the estrogen receptor is phosphorylated in vitro by MAP kinase and that in vivo phosphorylation correlates with enhanced transcriptional activity (26Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 27Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). In addition to showing that insulin-stimulated PPARγ activation is mediated by MAP kinase, our data also suggest that the MAP kinase pathway may be required for ligand-stimulated activation (see Fig. 3). However, we have consistently observed only 2-3-fold activation of PPARγ by TZD alone using various reporter constructs in this study. Thus, further studies will be required to establish whether MAP kinase is necessary for full activation of PPARγ by specific ligands. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the TZDs represent a class of compounds with anti-diabetic efficacy (28Chang A.Y. Wyse B.M. Gilchrist B.J. Peterson T. Diani A.R. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It has been observed that this class of agents is not effective at glucose-lowering in animal models with insulin deficiency (29Kruetter D.K. Andrews K.M. Gibbs E.M. Hutson N.J. Sterveson R.W. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Ikeda H. Taketomi S. Sugiyama Y. Sodha T. Meguro K. Fujita T. Arzneim. Forsch. 1990; 40: 152-162Google Scholar). The results of this study may provide a partial explanation for the requirement of insulin in in vivo TZD action. The mechanism of insulin- and MAP kinase-stimulated PPARγ activation is unclear. In recent experiments, we found that PPARγ containing the Ser112→ Ala mutation was also activated by TZD and/or insulin in a manner similar to that observed with wild-type receptors (data not shown). In addition, insulin is capable of activating PPARα and PPARδ, both of which lack the consensus MAP kinase phosphorylation site at Ser112. Furthermore, PPARα and PPARδ transactivation was blocked by dominant negative MKK. 2B. Zhang, unpublished observation. These results suggest that the MAP kinase pathway regulates PPARs through an indirect mechanism that may be independent of direct phosphorylation by ERK1/ERK2. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that PPARγ is a phosphoprotein and can be activated independently by insulin and TZD. MAP kinase-mediated cross-talk between insulin signaling and PPARγ results in a synergistic effect that has important implications for our understanding of the regulation and function of PPARγ in vivo.

Prostaglandins play key roles in many biological processes, including cell division, blood pressure regulation, immune responses, ovulation, bone development, wound healing, and water balance. Altered prostanoid production is associated with a variety of illnesses, including bone resorption, cardiovascular disease, acute and chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and colon cancer (3DeWitt D.L.

Following its initial identification, PGS2 has been shown to be inducible by distinct stimuli in a variety of cells (8Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which PGS2 gene expression is elevated in various cells in response to various inducers has only recently begun to be elucidated. We previously demonstrated that the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) of the PGS2 promoter is required for v-src-induced expression of a PGS2 promoter-luciferase reporter (11Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We orginally anticipated that either CREB or another member of the ATF family of transcription factors would mediate v-src induction of PGS2 gene expression via this CRE. However, when expression vectors encoding wild-type CREB, ATF-2, or ATF-3 were expressed with the PGS2 reporter, induction by co-expressed v-src was blocked, rather than enhanced (12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The c-Jun transcription factor, a member of the bZIP transcription factor family, forms heterodimers with ATF transcription factors that bind to CRE sequences (13Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These experiments and additional co-transfection experiments suggested that c-Jun plays a major role in the transcriptional activation of the PGS2 gene by pp60src, the product of the v-src oncogene, via the CRE of the PGS2 promoter (12Xie W.

In contrast, the pTIS10−40LUC construct has the CRE and E-Box sites deleted. Bridge polymerase chain reaction (18Brunner C. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Muller H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

The amounts of DNA used for transfection with other constructs are specified in the text or in the figure legends, for each experiment. DNA precipitates remained on the cells for 5 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The cells were then cultured for 20 h in medium containing 0.5% newborn calf serum. 20% fetal calf serum or PDGF (10 ng/ml) were added to stimulate the transfected cells. Cells were harvested 6 h after the addition of PDGF or serum, and luciferase activity was assayed as described previously (11Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Triplicate dishes were used for all transfections, and all experiments were repeated at least twice. The JNK immunocomplex kinase assay was performed as described previously (12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 μg of plasmid encoding Flag-epitope tagged JNK1 was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells in 100-mm dishes, using the calcium phosphate method (12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The cells were kept in 0.5% newborn calf serum for 24 h after transfection. Cells were stimulated with 20% serum or with PDGF (10 ng/ml). 30 min later the cells were collected in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM sodium glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were pre-absorbed with Sepharose-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 30 min before the M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY) against Flag was added. A small sample of cell extract from each cell lysate was taken for protein assay to standardize for gel loading after the kinase reaction. M2 antibody was mixed with Sepharose beads for 1.5 h in a cold room. Excess antibody was washed away with lysis buffer. The antibody-conjugated beads were then added to the preabsorbed cell lysate for another 1.5 h. The binding mixtures were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The kinase assay was carried out in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MgCl2, 25 mM sodium glycerophosphate, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μM ATP, 2 μg of GST-c-Jun, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, at 30°C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS loading buffer and incubating in boiling water for 5 min. The reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried and exposed to x-ray film. The 371 nucleotides of the PGS2 promoter 5′ to the start site of transcription are sufficient for PGS2 gene induction by serum and PDGF (17Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because there are a limited number of cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements within these 371 nucleotides (17Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to generate luciferase reporter genes with specific mutations in potential regulatory sites. Transient transfection into NIH 3T3 cells was performed with each of these PGS2 reporters, and the ability of serum or PDGF to induce luciferase expression was examined. Mutation of the CRE element at nucleotides −56 to −51 of the PGS2 gene from CGTCA to atTCA reduced luciferase expression in serum- or PDGF-treated cells by about 70% when compared with the wild-type PGS2 regulatory region (Fig. 1). In contrast, mutation of the overlapping E-Box at nucleotides −53 to −48 of the PGS2 gene from CACGTG to CACGct had no effect on PDGF- or serum-stimulated luciferase activity. Although PDGF has been reported to induce gene expression through an Sp-1 element, mutation of the consensus Sp-1 site located at nucleotides −239 to −234 in the 5′ regulatory region of the PGS2 gene (17Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also had no effect on PDGF- or serum-induced luciferase activity (data not shown). We previously demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays that both recombinant CREB and endogenous CREB present in 3T3 cells can bind to the PGS2 CRE site (11Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of the CRE in PGS2 induction by serum and PDGF, we examined whether occupancy of this site by a dominant-negative CREB molecule could block the induction of luciferase activity by serum or PDGF. When a vector expressing a dominant-negative CREB was cotransfected with the TIS10−371LUC reporter, the dominant-negative CREB completely blocked induction of luciferase activity from the PGS2 promoter by PDGF or serum (data not shown). We conclude from the mutagenesis study and the co-transfection study using dominant-negative CREB expression that the CRE element of the PGS2 gene is essential for PGS2 induction by both PDGF and serum in NIH 3T3 cells as well as by v-src expression (12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that c-Jun mediates v-src induction of PGS2 expression (12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Jun might also play a role in serum and/or PDGF induction of PGS2 gene expression in fibroblasts, as it does for v-src induction (12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of overexpression of the c-Jun transcription factor. Expression of c-Jun enhances luciferase expression from the PGS2 promoter in response to serum or PDGF (Fig. 2A). These data are consistent with the suggestion that c-Jun mediates serum and PDGF induction of PGS2 gene expression. We previously demonstrated that wild-type CREB does not mediate v-src induction of PGS2 gene expression (12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast to the results with c-Jun, when wild-type CREB was coexpressed with the TIS10−371LUC PGS2 reporter gene, induction by serum or PDGF was partially blocked, rather than enhanced (data not shown). The inability of transfected wild-type CREB to enhance PDGF or serum-stimulated luciferase expression and the ability of c-Jun to enhance this induction suggest that like v-src induction, serum and PDGF induction is mediated by activation of c-Jun and not a member of the ATF transcription factor family. We wanted to determine whether the activation domain of the c-Jun transcription factor, when positioned at the location of the CRE site of the PGS2 promoter, can be transcriptionally activated by serum or PDGF treatment regardless of the DNA binding site. We used a minimal PGS2 promoter (from nucleotides −40 to +3) to prepare a luciferase reporter construct in which the CRE sequence in the PGS2 luciferase reporter is replaced with five yeast GAL4 transcription factor DNA binding sites from the gal4 gene (12Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This reporter construct was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, along with plasmids that express fusion proteins between the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the activation domains of several ATF or bZIP transcription factors. Basal, serum-stimulated, and PDGF-stimulated luciferase activities were then analyzed. The CRE and E-Box elements of the PGS2 promoter are absent from this reporter construct. Consequently, activation domains can be analyzed for signal transduction-stimulated transcriptional activity when placed immediately upstream of the basal PGS2 promoter, without interference from endogenous transcription factors. When this [gal4-PGS2][luciferase] reporter is cotransfected with the vector expressing a fusion protein of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the c-Jun activation domain (amino acids 5-200; GAL4-Jun), luciferase activity is elevated as a result of the unstimulated basal activity of the overexpressed GAL4-c-Jun protein (Fig. 2B). When cells containing the [gal4-PGS2][luciferase] reporter and the GAL4-c-Jun expression vector are exposed to serum or to PDGF, the mitogen treatments significantly enhance luciferase expression. We conclude that the c-Jun activation domain, if properly positioned “upstream” of the minimal PGS2 promoter, can drive either PDGF- or serum-induced gene expression. In contrast, GAL4-CREB protein is unable to mediate serum- or PDGF-stimulated luciferase expression from the [gal4-PGS2][luciferase] reporter (data not shown). Phosphorylation of serine residues Ser63 and Ser73 is necessary for transcriptional activation of c-Jun at AP-1 sites (24Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 25Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Grover-Bardwick A. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation at these two serines is required for PDGF- or serum-induced, c-Jun-mediated PGS2 induction, we used an expression vector encoding a fusion protein, GAL4-Jun 63/73, in which these serines are replaced by leucines. The GAL4-Jun 63/73 fusion protein is unable to mediate either basal expression, PDGF activation, or serum activation of the [gal4-PGS2][luciferase] reporter (Fig. 2B). We conclude that phosphorylation of the c-Jun activation domain at serines 63 and 73 is required for PDGF- or serum-induced, c-Jun-mediated transcriptional activation from the PGS2 regulatory region. In the preceding sections we have identified (i) the CRE of the PGS2 promoter as a major cis-acting element mediating serum- and PDGF-induced expression from the PGS2 gene and (ii) c-Jun as a transcription factor that participates in activation of the PGS2 gene in response to serum or PDGF. We next investigated the signal transduction pathway(s) stimulated by serum and PDGF that lead to transcriptional activation of c-Jun for PGS2 gene expression. Recent studies have demonstrated that JNK is the primary MAP kinase responsible for ligand-stimulated c-Jun phosphorylation in vivo (26Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). If serum or PDGF stimulate PGS2 expression via a c-Jun-dependent pathway in NIH 3T3 cells, then we would expect these ligands to also stimulate JNK activity. To test this hypothesis, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with Flag epitope-tagged JNK1 and treated cells with either PDGF or serum. Flag-JNK1 was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. Immunocomplex kinase assays were then performed using GST-c-Jun recombinant protein as substrate (12Xie W. Herschman H.R.

Both PDGF and serum treatment activate JNK enzyme activity in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3), as expected if c-Jun plays a major role in transcriptional activation of the PGS2 gene in response to these agents. Recent experiments from several laboratories have demonstrated that ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of JNK is mediated by activation of Ras and Rac, two small GTP-binding proteins (30Coso O.A.

Here, the effects of mechanical injury on the voltage-dependent magnesium (Mg2+) block of NMDA currents in cultured rat cortical neurons were examined. Stretch-induced injury was found to reduce the Mg2+ blockade, resulting in significantly larger ionic currents and increases in intracellular free calcium (Ca2+) concentration after NMDA stimulation of injured neurons. The Mg2+ blockade was partially restored by increased extracellular Mg2+ concentration or by pretreatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C.

Consequently, it has been hypothesized that with aging, as circulating levels of melatonin in mammals normally decrease, the brain might be at increased risk of neurodegeneration.

We created melatonin deficiency in rats by pinealectomy and induced neurodegeneration by two models of focal brain ischemia/stroke and by glutamate receptor-mediated, epilepsy-like seizures. We observed greater neurodegeneration in melatonin-deficient animals than in controls.

Various apoptotic stimuli activate Yama and/or ICE-LAP3; in turn, these proteases cleave a death substrate, the 116-kDa nuclear protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (23Kaufmann S.H.

Activation of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) by IGF-I or IGF-II treatment blocks PCD in both primary neurons as well as neural cell lines (28Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J.

While IGF-IR activation clearly prevents neural cells from entering a death program, little is known about the mechanism which underlies IGF-IR neuroprotection. We have employed well characterized human neuroblastoma cell lines as in vitro model systems to examine IGF-IR rescue of neural cells from PCD (30Martin D.M. Yee D. Carlson R.O. Feldman E.L. Mol.

SH-SY5Y cells express abundant cell surface IGF-IR and secrete IGF-II, maintaining an autocrine stimulus which provides resistance to PCD following withdrawal of other mitogens (30Martin D.M. Yee D.

Metabolic stressors, including hyperosmotic stress, induces PCD in SH-SY5Y cells, an effect which is inhibited by addition of exogenous IGF-I or IGF-II (28Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SHEP cells express 5-fold fewer cell surface IGF-IR receptors, produce no IGF-II, and are dependent on extrinsic mitogens for survival (29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar, 36Leventhal P.S. Randolph A.E. Vesbit T.E. Schenone A. Windebank A.J. Feldman E.L. Exp.

We have transfected SHEP cells with human IGF-IR, stably increasing cell surface IGF-IR abundance 5-15-fold. SHEP/IGF-IR transfectants are more resistant to hyperosmotic coupled PCD and withdrawal of other mitogens, suggesting increased IGF-IR expression has resulted in a longterm alteration in PCD regulation in these cells (29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined both the short- and long-term effects of IGF-IR activation on Bcl-2 and ced-3/ICE-like family members in SH-SY5Y, SHEP, and SHEP/IGF-IR transfectants after a hyperosmotic death stimulus. Short-term IGF-IR activation blocked hyperosmotic coupled PCD, inhibited PCD-associated changes in Bcl-2 cellular concentrations, and retarded proteolytic processing of the ced-3/ICE-like cysteine proteases. In contrast, long-term increased expression of IGF-IR increased cellular concentrations of Bcl-xL. Collectively, these data suggest that IGF-IR signaling exerts its short-term inhibitory effects upon PCD “upstream” of both Bcl and ICE-like proteins while a separable long-term effect on PCD is present following chronic increased IGF-IR expression. SH-SY5Y and SHEP human neuroblastoma cells (38Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Drs. Stephen Fisher and Valerie Castle, respectively, University of Michigan Medical Center. Transfection of SHEP cells with pSFFVNeo containing the cDNA for human IGF-IR and subsequent selection of stable SHEP/IGF-IR transfectants has been described previously (29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar). All cells are cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) and 10% calf serum in a humidified environment of 10% CO2 at 37°C and routinely subcultured after removal with trypsin-EDTA. SHEP/IGF-IR transfectants are maintained in media to which 200 μM G-418 has been added to select for expression of neomycin-resistant plasmids. For each of the experiments described below, cells were plated at an initial density of 5 × 106 cells/cm2 in appropriate growth media and grown in 15-cm dishes to 90% confluence. Confluent SH-SY5Y cells were washed twice with DMEM, then incubated in DMEM for 12-16 h before washing again and addition of the described experimental media conditions. For each time point and condition, adherent cells were gently rinsed 3 times in situ with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and combined with nonadherent cells collected in phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl, to which was added 100 μg/μl phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/μl leupeptin, and 10 μg/μl aprotinin just prior to use) then sonicated for two 8-s continuous bursts. Protein concentration was determined using a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay). Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (39Leventhal P.S. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5957-5960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (60 μg) were loaded for each experiment, and protein transfer was verified by staining gels with Coomassie Blue. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Yama/CPP32 and ICE-LAP3 were developed by Dixit and colleagues (18Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Bax and Bcl-xL, mouse monoclonal antibody to Bcl-2, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted 1:600-1:1000, for 2 h, probed with secondary antibodies (1:3000-1:10,000), and exposed following ECL reaction (Amersham) to autoradiography film (Hyperfilm-MP, Amersham). Each experiment was performed independently 3 times. Densitometric analysis of immunoblot autoradiographs was performed following digital scanning on a flat bed scanner (EPSON ES-1200) using gel analysis software (NIH Image 1.60). Yama/CPP32 and ICE-LAP3 are members of the ced-3/ICE-like proteases. These proteases participate in propagation of the cell death program following proteolytic conversion from a proenzyme form (15Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zheng Z. Beidler D.R.

Similar proteolytic reduction to the active 20-kDa form also allows ICE-LAP3 to cleave PARP. Thus, Yama/CPP32 and ICE-LAP3 serve as markers for PCD propagation. We have previously shown that hyperosmolar stress is a potent apoptotic stimulus for neural cells (28Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar, 41Matthews C. Odeh H. Feldman E.L. Neuroscience. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). More than 60% of SH-SY5Y cells undergo DNA fragmentation (as quantitated by flow cytometry following propidium iodine staining) within 24 h after exposure to 300 mM mannitol (29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar, 41Matthews C. Odeh H. Feldman E.L. Neuroscience. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). In the current, study we report that mannitol hyperosmolar shock rapidly induces conversion of proYama/CPP32 to Yama/CPP32 in SH-SY5Y cells. Appearance of signature 17-kDa Yama/CPP32 fragments are apparent in cell lysates within 6 h following exposure to 300 mM mannitol (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B compares protein lysates from SH-SY5Y cells treated for 6 or 24 h with 300 mM mannitol with or without the addition of 10 nM IGF-II. IGF-II blocks proteolytic processing of both Yama/CPP32 and ICE-LAP3, an effect which correlates with our previous findings that IGF-II can reduce mannitol-induced PCD 6- to 8-fold (29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of α-IR3, a blocking antibody specific for IGF-IR, inhibits IGF-II's effects on the proteolytic processing of both enzymes (Fig. 2A), confirming that specific activation of IGF-IR is necessary for IGF-II-mediated action (31Martin D.M. Feldman E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Substrate-specific activation of IGF-IR initiates intracellular signaling through both the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) signaling cascades (42De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. Gronskov K. Latus L.-J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 43Nishida E. Gotoh Y.

Sci. 1992; 17: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest a link between PI-3K activation and protection from PCD. Concentrations of insulin which are known to activate IGF-IR (42De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. Gronskov K. Latus L.-J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) prevent PCD in PC12 cells by activating PI-3K, independent of the MAP kinase pathway (45Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). In parallel, the ability of insulin to prevent PCD in PC-12 cells is blocked by wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI-3K (45Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Using Yama/CPP32 conversion as a marker of PCD, we find that 100 nM wortmannin blocks the protective effect of 10 nM IGF-II 6 h following mannitol exposure (Fig. 2B). Wortmannin alone induces neither PCD nor proteolytic cleavage of Yama. In contrast, we find that PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1, MEK2) (46Pang L. Sawada T Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) inhibits ERK activation in SH-SY5Y cells but had no effect on the ability of IGF-I to rescue neurons from hyperosmotic coupled PCD (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that PI-3K signaling is essential to IGF-IR mediated PCD protection, and that the site of IGF-IR mediated prevention of PCD occurs prior to (or “upstream of”) processing of Yama/CPP32 and other ICE-like proteases involved in propagation of the death program. Bcl-2, and the structurally related proteins Bcl-xL and Bax, are theorized to act as regulators of susceptibility to PCD in response to cellular injury, and function upstream of Yama and ICE-LAP3 to control PCD initiation (21Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is highly expressed in the developing nervous system (47Merry D.E. Veis D.J. Hickey W.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Development. 1994; 120: 301-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Bcl-2 overexpression leads to nervous system hypertrophy (48Martinou J.-C. Dubois-Dauphin M. Staple J.K. Rodriguez I. Frankowski H.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3253-3259PubMed Google Scholar). With maturation, central nervous Bcl-2 expression appears to be replaced by Bcl-xL (12Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 47Merry D.E. Veis D.J. Hickey W.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Development. 1994; 120: 301-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-xL also protects cells from PCD, and cotransfection with Bcl-2 does not increase protection, suggesting that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL share homologous mechanisms of action (12Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). mRNA for Bcl-xL is exclusively expressed in mature postmitotic neurons (12Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar), and targeted disruption of Bcl-xL during embryogenesis results in massive death of neurons (54Roth K.A. Motoyama N. Loh D.Y. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1753-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two homologues of the Bcl family, Bax and Bak, enhance PCD and antagonize the protective effects of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (2Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar, 13Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL heterodimerize with Bax; it is this heterodimerization which is necessary to suppress PCD (13Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The ratio of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL to Bax determines the susceptibility of a cell to PCD (13Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1996; 43: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine a possible role for IGF-IR signaling in Bcl protein regulation, we used immunoblot analysis of cellular lysates to probe for changes in total cellular pools of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax prior to and 24 h following treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with 300 mM mannitol with or without 10 nM IGF-II (Fig. 3). Densitometric analysis of Fig. 3 immunoblots indicates that mannitol treatment induced a 4-fold decrease in total cellular Bcl-2 (as a fraction of total cellular protein), consistent with reports that decreased transcription of Bcl-2, and most other cellular genes, accompanies neuronal PCD (58Gillardon F. Wickert H. Zimmerman M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1641-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 59Greenlund L.J.S. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr., E.M.

Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 1205-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This reduction is prevented by addition of IGF-II. Cellular Bcl-xL pool is reduced 40-60%, while total cellular Bax is reduced less than 20%. Collectively, these results suggest that short-term IGF-IR signaling results in regulation at or above the level of Bcl-2 transcription to sustain Bcl-2 expression and may inhibit PCD, in part, by preventing lethal changes in cellular Bcl-2/Bax ratios. The role of IGF or other growth factors on long-term regulation of Bcl proteins is poorly studied. To address this question, we examined human neuroblastoma SHEP cells transfected with human IGF-IR cDNA in either correct (FB+2) or reverse (FC−4) orientation. FB+2 expresses approximately 6 times the cell surface IGF-IR abundance of the SHEP parent line, as measured by flow cytometry analysis following IGF-IR specific antibody staining (29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar). FC−4 demonstrates IGF-IR abundance equivalent to parent SHEP cells (29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular pools of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax were compared for SH-SY5Y, FB+2, and FC−4 during log phase growth in appropriate growth media as described under “Materials and Methods.” Overexpression of IGF-IR in FB+2 correlated with a 2-3-fold increase in total FB+2 cellular Bcl-xL, while Bcl-xL concentration in control transfectant FC−4 remained unchanged (Fig. 4). A similar fold increase in Bcl-xL was also observed in FB+4, an IGF-IR transfectant clone which expresses approximately 4 times the cell surface IGF-IR as the parent SHEP line (29Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Bax and Bcl-2 concentrations were similar for FB+2 and FC−4, but when compared to SH-SY5Y cells, both transfectants expressed at least 10-fold lower levels of Bcl-2. Following treatment with 300 mM mannitol, both FC−4 and FB+2 showed a decrease in relative cellular Bcl-2, as described above for SH-SY5Y (data not shown). Our results suggest that IGF-IR overexpression may have a separable, long-term effect in promoting resistance to PCD by increasing total cellular concentrations of Bcl-xL. This idea is supported by the expression pattern of Bcl proteins during nervous system development. Bcl-2 expression is highest in rapidly dividing neuroblasts (12Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M.

In parallel, recent preliminary studies indicate that chronic activation of nerve growth factor receptors in PC12 cells also results in up-regulation of Bcl proteins (63Mills E.M. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Isom G.E. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 751Google Scholar). In summary, IGF-IR activation blocks hyperosmotic coupled PCD in neuroglia (28Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J. Cell.

We examined whether IGF-IR activation effected either the negative regulators of the death pathway, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax, or altered the function of the ced-3/ICE-like proteases. We found that osmotic stress decreased total neuronal Bcl-2 by 4-fold and correlated with proteolytic processing of ced-3/ICE-like proteases. IGF-IR activation prevented changes in Bcl-2 protein and IGF-IR:PI-3K signaling blocked ICE-LAP3 and Yama/CPP32 processing. Finally, increased neuronal IGF-IR expression enhanced the negative death regulator Bcl-xL. Collectively, our data suggest that IGF-IR signaling exerts its short-term inhibitory effects upon PCD “upstream” of both Bcl proteins and ced-3/ICE-like proteases, while chronic increased IGF-IR expression may modulate susceptibility to death signals by mediating the negative death regulator, Bcl-xL."

Cell-surface receptor redistribution does not consistently follow electric field lines and depends critically on the frequency of the applied ac electric fields, suggesting that mechanisms other than electroosmosis are involved. We hypothesized that cytoskeletal reorganization is responsible for electric field-induced cell-surface receptor redistribution, and used fluorescence video microscopy to study the reorganization of microfilaments in human hepatoma (Hep3B) cells exposed to low-frequency electric fields ranging in strength from 25 mV/cm to 20 V/cm (peak to peak). The frequency of the applied electric field was varied from 1 to 120 Hz and the field exposure duration from 1 to 60 min. In control cells, cytoplasmic microfilaments were aligned in the form of continuous parallel cables along the longitudinal axis of the cell. Exposure of cells to ac electric fields induced alterations in microfilament structure in a manner that depended on the frequency of the applied field. A 1 or 10 Hz ac field caused microfilament reorganization from continuous, aligned cable structures to discontinuous globular patches. In contrast, the structure of microfilaments in cells exposed to 20-120 Hz electric fields did not differ from that in control cells. The extent of microfilament reorganization increased nonlinearly with the electric field strength. The characteristic time for microfilament reorganization in cells exposed to a 1 Hz, 20 V/cm electric field was approximately 5 min. Applied ac electric fields could initiate signal transduction cascades, which in turn cause reorganization of cytoskeletal structures."

Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Virology. Raven Press, New York1990: 1921-1958Google Scholar). By transactivating several early lytic cycle viral promoters, Zta initiates the ordered cascade of EBV gene expression that results in the induction of an estimated 100 or more viral replication associated genes and culminates in virus production (2Kieff E. Liebowitz D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. VirologyVirology. Raven Press, New York1990: 1889-1920Google Scholar). In addition to its role in EBV lytic gene expression (3Grogan E.J. Jenson J. Countryman J.

Flemington E.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Zta is a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors and binds as a homodimer to multiple AP1 or ZRE (Zta-responsive elements) sites in the promoters of target genes (7Farrell P.J. Rowe D.T. Rooney C.M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal bZIP domain of Zta has significant amino acid homology with the basic DNA-binding and dimerization domains of c-Fos (7Farrell P.J. Rowe D.T. Rooney C.M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and C/EBP (8Kouzarides T. Packham G. Cook A. Farrell P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar). The bZIP domain of Zta mediates homodimerization through a coiled-coil interaction, although Zta lacks the heptad repeat of leucine residues found in the leucine zipper proteins (8Kouzarides T. Packham G. Cook A. Farrell P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar, 9Flemington E. Speck S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amino-terminal region of Zta does not appear to influence dimerization or DNA binding, but plays a role in activation of transcription (11Giot J.-F. Mikaelion I. Buisson M. Manet E. Joab I.

The Zta activation domain has been shown to mediate association with the general transcription factor TFIIA (14Chi T. Carey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7045-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2441-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).We have recently demonstrated that Zta inhibits proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 in several epithelial tumor cell lines (16Cayrol C. Flemington E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2748-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Zta-mediated G0/G1 arrest was found to result from induction of the tumor suppressor protein, p53, and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21/WAF-1/CIP-1 and p27/KIP-1, two pleiotropic mediators of cell cycle arrest, that inhibit kinase activity of various cyclin-CDK complexes (17El-Diery W.S.

Inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb), a known target of cyclin-dependent kinases (22Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar), was shown to overcome Zta-mediated G0/G1 arrest, indicating that pRb or pRb-related proteins are involved in the pathway of growth suppression induced by Zta (16Cayrol C. Flemington E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2748-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Here we report on the ability of Zta mutants to cause G0/G1 growth arrest and demonstrate that growth arrest is independent of the transactivation function of Zta. These results suggest a key role for the bZIP domain and flanking sequences in Zta-mediated growth arrest and induction of p21.DISCUSSIONSeveral conclusions can be derived from this limited genetic analysis. First, a tight correlation exists between growth arrest and induction of p21. We showed previously that induction of p21 by Zta is mediated through p53 (16Cayrol C. Flemington E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2748-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and, indeed, induction of p53 follows the same genetics as that of p21 (data not shown). Therefore, this pathway is likely to play an important role in transmitting Zta growth arrest signals.These studies also demonstrate that a carboxyl-terminal region of Zta encompassing the bZIP domain is sufficient to cause a G0/G1 growth arrest. Deletion of the amino-terminal half of Zta does not significantly affect its capacity to block G1/S progression since the mutant, ZΔ1-128, inhibited the percentage of cells in S phase, as efficiently as wild type Zta (respectively 3.9% and 5.7% versus 31% in untransfected cells). We note, however, that the G2/M population is not reduced in ZΔ1-128 expressing cells indicating an inability of cells to traverse through G2/M. This suggests that sequences between amino acids 1 and 128 are required for progression through the G2/M checkpoint in the context of other Zta-mediated alterations in cellular growth control pathways. This apparent G2/M arrest is not evident in Zdbm1-transfected cells indicating that the inability of ZΔ1-128 to transactivate ZRE containing cellular promoters is not the sole defect leading to a block in G2/M progression. Instead, it is possible that these sequences contribute to some functional interactions with factors involved in controlling the G2/M checkpoint control.The ability of the Zta DNA-binding mutant, Zdbm1, to efficiently induce cellular growth arrest provides additional support for the idea that the transactivation function of Zta is not required for inducing growth arrest. We have previously reported that Zta DNA binding mutants, including Zdbm1, can activate certain promoters in transient reporter assays probably through protein-protein interactions (23Flemington E.K. Lytle J.P. Cayrol C. Borras A.M. Speck S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3041-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, in these studies, we found that Zdbm1 and wild type Zta elicited transcriptional activation through distinct promoter elements and they may therefore have distinct promoter specificities. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that transcriptional activation plays a role in eliciting cellular growth arrest, we favor a model whereby Zta induces growth arrest through protein-protein interactions with key cell cycle control proteins. Previous studies demonstrated an interaction between p53 and the dimerization domain of Zta (26Zhang Z. Gutsch D. Kenney S. J. Virol. 1994; 14: 1929-1938Google Scholar). Moreover, in this study, it was suggested that the Zta-mediated post-transcriptional induction of p53 might arise through masking of p53 sequences involved in targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (26Zhang Z. Gutsch D. Kenney S. J. Virol. 1994; 14: 1929-1938Google Scholar). Since the results presented here point to a critical role for Zta's bZIP domain in eliciting G0/G1 growth arrest and p21 induction, this is a reasonable possibility.Results presented here suggest that sequences upstream from the bZIP domain, amino acids 128 to 167, are also required for p21 induction and for cellular growth arrest. At this time we don't know whether this sequence might contribute to or stabilize interactions with key cellular proteins or whether this region provides conformational contributions to the bZIP structure.The finding that the carboxyl-terminal region of Zta encompassing the bZIP domain is sufficient to block cell proliferation further emphasizes the critical role of bZIP domains and bZIP transcription factors in the control of cell proliferation. Other bZIP factors have previously been implicated in affecting cell growth control pathways. For example, the AP1 family bZIP factors, c-Fos and c-Jun, promote cell proliferation in some settings and are associated with differentiation in several cellular differentiation model systems (27Szabo E. Preis L.H. Birrer M.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 439-446PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gandarillas A. Watt F.M. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Gandarillas A.

The Caenorhabditis elegans bZIP protein Ces-2 has been shown to induce programmed cell death (32Metzstein M.M. Hengartner M.O. Tsung N. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Further investigations into mechanisms driving Zta-mediated G0/G1 growth arrest should reveal additional insights into the role of bZIP transcription factors in cell proliferation.

Heston L. Gradoville L. Miller G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1332-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and replication (4Schepers A. Pich D. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3921-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Fixman E.D. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1992; : 5030-5039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Zta can also regulate the expression of cellular factors such as the growth suppressive cytokine transforming growth factor-β (6Cayrol C. Flemington E.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Zta is a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors and binds as a homodimer to multiple AP1 or ZRE (Zta-responsive elements) sites in the promoters of target genes (7Farrell P.J. Rowe D.T. Rooney C.M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal bZIP domain of Zta has significant amino acid homology with the basic DNA-binding and dimerization domains of c-Fos (7Farrell P.J. Rowe D.T. Rooney C.M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and C/EBP (8Kouzarides T. Packham G. Cook A. Farrell P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar). The bZIP domain of Zta mediates homodimerization through a coiled-coil interaction, although Zta lacks the heptad repeat of leucine residues found in the leucine zipper proteins (8Kouzarides T. Packham G. Cook A. Farrell P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar, 9Flemington E. Speck S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amino-terminal region of Zta does not appear to influence dimerization or DNA binding, but plays a role in activation of transcription (11Giot J.-F. Mikaelion I. Buisson M. Manet E. Joab I.

The Zta activation domain has been shown to mediate association with the general transcription factor TFIIA (14Chi T. Carey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7045-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2441-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Amino acids between 25 and 86 were shown to be critical for this latter interaction (12Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2441-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).We have recently demonstrated that Zta inhibits proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 in several epithelial tumor cell lines (16Cayrol C. Flemington E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2748-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Zta-mediated G0/G1 arrest was found to result from induction of the tumor suppressor protein, p53, and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21/WAF-1/CIP-1 and p27/KIP-1, two pleiotropic mediators of cell cycle arrest, that inhibit kinase activity of various cyclin-CDK complexes (17El-Diery W.S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar), was shown to overcome Zta-mediated G0/G1 arrest, indicating that pRb or pRb-related proteins are involved in the pathway of growth suppression induced by Zta (16Cayrol C. Flemington E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2748-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Here we report on the ability of Zta mutants to cause G0/G1 growth arrest and demonstrate that growth arrest is independent of the transactivation function of Zta. These results suggest a key role for the bZIP domain and flanking sequences in Zta-mediated growth arrest and induction of p21."

Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Together with its processivity factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), pol δ is responsible for the bulk of leading strand synthesis as well as significant replication of the lagging stand. It is thought that PCNA enhances the processivity of pol δ by binding to both DNA and pol δ and by acting as a “sliding clamp” that stabilizes the interaction between pol δ and template-primer (2Stukenberg P.T.

The dramatically increased stability of the pol δtemplate-primer interaction in the presence of PCNA has profound functional implications. For example, it was demonstrated by O'Day et al. (7O'Day C.L. Burgers P.M.J. Taylor J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5403-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that PCNA could facilitate synthesis by yeast pol δ past a thymine dimer present in the template strand. Both cis-syn and trans-syn-L-thymine dimers could be bypassed. Similarly, the β-subunit of Escherichia coli pol III-holoenzyme, thought to be the functional prokaryotic homolog of eukaryotic PCNA (see Refs. 2Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), also affects replicative bypass of lesions, although in a complex way (see e.g. 9, 10). Finally, thioredoxin, the processivity subunit of T7 DNA polymerase and thus analogous to PCNA, also has effects on polymerase fidelity (11Kunkel T.A. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6830-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In light of these many observations, we reasoned that addition to pol δ incubations of homologous PCNA might lead indirectly to an increased incidence of any relatively unlikely event (e.g. incorporation versus misincorporation). In the present study we analyzed the impact of PCNA on two different sorts of unlikely events catalyzed by pol δ, 1) misincorporation, i.e. incorporation of a normal dNMP opposite a noncomplementary template nucleotide, and extension without excision of a mismatched primer nucleotide; and 2) incorporation of an abnormal nucleotide, i.e. a nucleotide analog. For both, PCNA enhanced the activity of pol δ, essentially as was expected based on enhanced stability of the pol δtemplate-primer complex. These observations suggest compelling evolutionary selection pressure to account for the active 3′-5′-exonuclease associated with pol δ. A modified analog of dTTP, 2′-deoxythymidine-5′-O-(α-phosphonomethyl)-β,γ-diphosphate (dTCH2PP2; for structure, see Fig. 4A), was synthesized as described (12Kukhanova M.K. Kuznetsova E.V.

Unlabeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) were high performance liquid chromatography-purified and were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. 32P-Labeled ATP and 32P-labeled dNTPs were from Amersham Corp. Synthetic oligonucleotides of defined sequence were prepared by conventional phosphoramidite chemistry and purified by PAGE in the presence of 7 M urea. (dT)4 was also made synthetically by conventional phosphoramidite chemistry. PCNA and pol δ were both purified from calf thymus according to published protocols (6Ng L. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M.

All other materials were obtained commercially; chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further purification. DNA polymerase assays were performed essentially as described previously (6Ng L. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol.

The standard reaction mixture for pol δ contained 40 mM bis-Tris, pH 6.7, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Additional details are provided in the figure legends. Fidelity assays were performed according to Creighton and Goodman (19Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For kinetic measurements, 5% or less of the total primer present before incubation with enzyme was extended. Results of primer extension were quantified after PAGE of reaction products in the presence of 7 M urea using a Molecular Dynamics 445 SI PhosphorImager. Unless indicated otherwise, all kinetic constants were calculated as described previously (18Mozzherin D. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Inhibition reactions were performed within the linear region of product formed versus time. With poly(dA)-(dT)16 as template-primer, inhibition was quantified by placing some of each reaction mixture on 1 × 1-cm squares of Whatman DE-81 filter paper and washing filter paper squares in a 5% solution of Na2HPO412H2O to remove unincorporated dNTPs. Inhibition with other template-primers was quantified by phosphorimager analysis after denaturing PAGE. Kinetic constants were determined by least-squares nonlinear regression to a rectangular hyperbola. The ratio of Vmax/Km was determined either from direct calculation (see above) or from the slope in the linear region of the rectangular hyperbola (19Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE band mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described previously (4Ng L. McConnell M. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13571-13576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but without MgCl2 and otherwise as detailed in figure legends. EDTA was included in each incubation and in the gel electrophoresis buffer at 3 mM. Nearest neighbor analyses were used to prove incorporation of dTCH2PP2 into oligonucleotide primer and were performed essentially as described (20Swartz J. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 739-751Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Wang T.S.-F. Sedwick W.D. Korn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 21-mer primer was annealed to template such that the next three nucleotides to be incorporated were dTMP, dCMP, and dTMP (Fig. 4B). This primer was extended with [α-32P]dCTP and either unlabeled dTTP or unlabeled dTCH2PP2 such that 32P-labeled 24-mers were synthesized. Resulting 24-mers were PAGE-purified in the presence of 7 M urea and digested to completion with micrococcal nuclease, and products were analyzed either by denaturing PAGE or silica gel thin layer chromatography run in isopropyl alcohol:NH4OH (25% in H2O):H2O (7:1:2). Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Life Sciences Inc., St. Petersburg, FL) was used to add dideoxynucleoside monophosphate (ddNMP) residues to synthetic 20-mer primers, essentially as previously (6Ng L. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fisher P.A. Korn D.

After ddNMP addition, ddNMP-terminated 21-mers were separated from unreacted 20-mers by denaturing PAGE performed preparatively. Typically 65-100% of the 20-mer starting material was converted to ddNMP-terminated 21-mer during the incubation with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Determination of DNA polymerase activity in polyacrylamide gels in situ was performed as described previously (5McConnell M. Miller H. Mozzherin D. Quamina A. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8268-8274Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) after standard nondenaturing PAGE-band mobility shift assays. Nucleic acid template-primers were unlabeled. After electrophoresis, entire gels were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a standard pol δ-reaction mixture (4Ng L. McConnell M. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13571-13576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ng L. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol.

After incubation, gels were washed extensively (24-48 h) in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid to remove unincorporated dTTP after which they were subjected to autoradiography. We previously reported that PCNA stabilized the pol δtemplate-primer interaction nearly 2000-fold (5McConnell M. Miller H. Mozzherin D. Quamina A. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8268-8274Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To study the interaction of pol δ with mismatched template-primers, PAGE-band mobility shift assays were initially performed with a single 30-mer template annealed to four different 21-mer primers. Each primer contained a different dideoxynucleoside monophosphate at the 3′-terminal position. The structures of the four template-primers used are shown (Fig. 1A). PAGE-stable complex formation was detected by autoradiography after 5′-32P labeling of nucleic acid. Although complex formation was strongest with the matched template-primer (I) (Fig. 1B), PCNA-dependent complex formation was detected with each of the three mismatched template-primers (II-IV) (Fig. 1, C-E). The experiment shown was performed in the continuous presence of EDTA. Identical results to those shown (Fig. 1) were obtained when primers containing 3′-OH groups were used instead of 2′,3′-H groups (not shown, but see Fig. 2).Fig. 2Difference between pol δPCNAmatched template-primer complex and pol δPCNAmismatched template-primer complex as revealed by in situ DNA polymerase assay. A, to allow incorporation, experiment was performed with 3′-OH-terminated primers; a single 21-mer was annealed to each of four 30-mers as shown to generate one matched template-primer (I) and three terminally mismatched template-primers (II-IV).

Accordingly, 32P-labeled primer was recovered from the nondenaturing PAGE-purified complex formed among pol δ, PCNA, and mismatched template-primer and was subjected to denaturing PAGE to analyze primer size. Detection of full-length (21-mer) primer (not shown) was considered proof that the mismatched primer was not modified during incubation with pol δ and that a pol δPCNAmismatched template-primer complex was indeed forming. Ferguson plot (25Ferguson K.A. Metabolism. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) analysis was used to show that the complex formed by pol δ and PCNA with a matched template-primer was indistinguishable from that formed with a mismatched template-primer. Gels of five different polyacrylamide concentrations were used. At all polyacrylamide concentrations and with all three mismatched template-primers, the pol δPCNAmatched template-primer complex comigrated with the pol δPCNAmismatched template-primer complexes (not shown). This suggests that the complex formed among pol δ, PCNA, and a matched template-primer contains the same molecules in the same ratio as that formed among pol δ, PCNA, and a mismatched template-primer. In situ DNA polymerase activity determination revealed that the complex formed among pol δ, PCNA, and mismatched template-primer could be distinguished from the complex formed with a matched template-primer. The template-primers used for in situ DNA polymerase assays are shown (Fig. 2A). When a 3′-OH-terminated primer is used and the pol δPCNAtemplate-primer complex is formed in EDTA, the only additional ingredients required to visualize DNA synthesis are MgCl2 and radiolabeled dNTP (5McConnell M. Miller H. Mozzherin D. Quamina A. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8268-8274Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Accordingly, complex was formed with unlabeled matched or mismatched template-primer; to monitor formation and mobility, complex was also formed with 32P-labeled template-primer. Both labeled and unlabeled complexes were subjected to nondenaturing PAGE, and the portion of the gel containing complex formed with unlabeled template-primer was incubated in [α-32P]dTTP, dCTP, and 6 mM MgCl2. Nucleotide incorporation was readily detected coincident in PAGE mobility with the complex formed among pol δ, PCNA, and labeled template-primer (Fig. 2, B and C, compare lanes a; see also Fig. 2C, lane M). In contrast, mismatched template-primers, although supporting substantial complex formation when pol δ and PCNA were added (Fig. 2B, lanes b-d), supported much less nucleotide incorporation in the in situ DNA polymerase assay (Fig. 2C, lanes b-d). Curiously, primers with AC and AG mismatches at the 3′-position apparently supported more incorporation (mismatch extension) than a primer with an AA mismatch at the 3′-position (Fig. 2C, lanes b-d). This observation is of uncertain significance. It was established that extension of mispaired primer termini contributes significantly to errors made during DNA replication (for a review, see Ref. 17Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Formation of a PCNA-dependent complex between pol δ and template-primers containing 3′-terminally mispaired nucleotides led us to determine, directly, the effect of PCNA on the fidelity of pol δ. The strategy of Creighton and Goodman (19Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was employed. For this, we used the template-primers shown in Fig. 3A. Initially, this consisted of a 5′-32P-labeled 17-nucleotide primer (Fig. 3A, underlined) which was annealed to an unlabeled 64-mer template such that the next nucleotides to be incorporated were (in order) dGMP, dCMP, dTMP, and dAMP. All incubations contained 5 ng of pol δ and dGTP such that the first nucleotide specified could be incorporated. In addition, incubations contained either no PCNA (see Fig. 3B) or 70 ng of PCNA (Fig. 3C), dTTP at 10 μM (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 2-6), or as indicated, and dCTP as indicated. Data from these experiments were quantified by phosphorimager. To determine relative velocities for the correct nucleotide, results shown in Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 1-6, were quantified; radioactivity in the band resulting from dTMP incorporation plus radioactivity in the band resulting from dCMP incorporation was divided by radioactivity in the band resulting from dGMP incorporation. The results from Fig. 3C are plotted versus dCTP concentration (Fig. 3D). To determine relative velocity for the incorrect nucleotide, results shown in Fig. 3, C, lanes 1 and 7-9, were quantified; radioactivity in the band resulting from dTMP incorporation was divided by radioactivity in the band resulting from dGMP incorporation. The results are plotted versus dTTP concentration (Fig. 3E). There was no misincorporation of dTMP detected for pol δ alone (Fig. 3B, lanes 7-9) or in the presence of dGTP only (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 1). To determine fidelity (efficiency of incorporation (misincorporation), and extension (26Randall S.K. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6864-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), Vmax/Km values were calculated as described previously (18Mozzherin D. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) from the data shown (Fig. 3). As noted, with pol δ alone, there was no detectable misincorporation. We estimate that pol δ misincorporates less than once for every 105 nucleotides incorporated correctly. In the presence of PCNA, pol δ catalyzed one misincorporation event (dTMP instead of dCMP) for every 3700 nucleotides incorporated correctly. This amounts to at least a 27-fold decrease in pol δ fidelity brought about by PCNA. To investigate the effect of primer length on PCNA-induced misincorporation catalyzed by pol δ, each of the primers shown in Fig. 3A was 5′-32P-labeled and annealed to the template shown in Fig. 3A. Incubations were formulated as indicated; only results with 21-mer are shown (Fig. 3F). Identical results were obtained with 13-, 17-, 25-, 29-, 36-, 41-, and 46-mer (not shown). Only in the presence of both dTTP and PCNA was a second dTMP residue incorporated (Fig. 5, downpointing arrows), indicative of both misincorporation of dTMP in place of dCMP and extension without excision of the mismatched primer terminus. The structure of dTCH2PP2 is shown in Fig. 4A. dTCH2PP2 has been used diagnostically to distinguish different DNA polymerases (16Jasko M.V. Semizarov D.G. Victorova L.S. Mozzherin D.J. Krayevsky A.A. Kukhanova M.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Incorporation of this analog in place of dTMP was evaluated using the synthetic template-primer shown (Fig. 4B). Extension of this primer with either pol δ alone (Fig. 5, lanes 2-6) or pol δ plus PCNA (Fig. 5, lanes 7-11) revealed that PCNA increased dramatically the ability of pol δ to apparently incorporate (and/or not excise) dTCH2P. Also apparent from inspection of Fig. 5, lane 8, is PCNA-induced misincorporation and extension of dTMP opposite template dGMP. In separate experiments, we showed that in the presence of PCNA, pol δ could extend a 3′-dTCH2P terminated primer generated after incorporation from a dTCH2PP2 precursor (not shown). Modified nearest neighbor analyses (20Swartz J. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 739-751Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Wang T.S.-F. Sedwick W.D. Korn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to prove that the dTMP analog dTCH2P was indeed being incorporated (and/or not excised) by pol δ in the presence of PCNA. Two separate incubations contained pol δ, PCNA, synthetic template-primer (Fig. 4B), [α-32P]dCTP, and either dTTP or dTCH2PP2; radiolabeled 24-mer was synthesized in both cases and PAGE-purified in 7 M urea. The two purified 24-mers (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2) were treated identically with micrococcal nuclease, and digests were analyzed by PAGE in the presence of 7 M urea. Results demonstrated that after digestion of the dTMP-containing 24-mer (Fig. 6, lane 1), only 32P-labeled dTMP was recovered (Fig. 6, lane 3); identical digestion of the putatively dTCH2P-containing 24-mer (Fig. 6, lane 2) resulted in a 32P-labeled species of dramatically different mobility (Fig. 6, lane 4). This species was presumably 5′-dAMP-dTCH2P-dCM[32P]dTCH2OH-3′. The dramatically different products recovered after micrococcal nuclease treatment thus confirmed incorporation of dTCH2P by pol δ in the presence of PCNA. Identical conclusions were reached after considering results from silica gel thin layer chromatography (not shown). Quantitative comparison of dTMP and dTCH2P incorporation (Fig. 7) revealed that dTTP was much more efficiently utilized than dTCH2PP2. (Efficiency is defined as Vmax/Km, see Ref. 26Randall S.K. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6864-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar.) Vmax and Km were calculated as described previously (18Mozzherin D. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Vmax and Km for dTTP were 4.6 and 0.6 μM, respectively. The Vmax and Km for dTCH2PP2 were 1.6 and 18.2 μM, respectively. Hence, in the presence of PCNA, dTTP is utilized by pol δ 87-fold more efficiently than dTCH2PP2. In the absence of PCNA, pol δ apparently does not use dTCH2PP2 as a substrate. The ability of PCNA to promote utilization of dTCH2PP2 by pol δ could be either direct, through increased affinity for dTCH2PP2 or rate of dTCH2P incorporation, or indirect, through increased stability of the pol δPCNAtemplate-primer complex. If direct (e.g. through increased affinity for dTCH2PP2), we would expect PCNA to alter significantly inhibition of incorporation by dTCH2PP2; indirect action (e.g. through increased affinity for template-primer) would not change the inhibitory potency of dTCH2PP2. To distinguish direct from indirect effects, we examined the ability of dTCH2PP2 to compete for dNTP utilization by pol δ. As a preliminary, it was noted that dTCH2PP2 only inhibited incorporation of dTMP and did not affect utilization of dGTP on a template-primer which directed dGMP incorporation (Fig. 8A). With a similar template-primer but which directed dTMP incorporation, dTCH2PP2 was a potent inhibitor of pol δ activity; inhibitory potency was not affected by PCNA (Fig. 8B). On a different template-primer that directed dTMP incorporation, poly(dA)-(dT)16, dTCH2PP2 was also a potent inhibitor of dTMP incorporation, and inhibition was not affected by PCNA (Fig. 8C). PCNA is without significant effect on the affinity of pol δ for dTTP (not shown). Under static conditions, PCNA decreases dissociation of pol δ from the pol δtemplate-primer complex nearly 2000-fold (4Ng L. McConnell M. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13571-13576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5McConnell M. Miller H. Mozzherin D. Quamina A. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8268-8274Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This is reflected under dynamic conditions, i.e. during template-directed dNMP incorporation, in decreased Km for appropriate template-primers (6Ng L. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dramatically increased processivity of DNA synthesis (see e.g. Ref. 14Tan C.-K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the PCNA-induced increase in the stability of the pol δtemplate-primer complex is necessary for efficient DNA replication (see e.g. Ref. 27Prelich G. Kostura M. Marshak D.R. Mathews M.B. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), our results demonstrate that it also causes substantial decreases in the fidelity with which pol δ catalyzes replication as well as increases incorporation (and/or inhibits excision) of a nucleotide analog, dTCH2P, relative to unmodified dTMP. We propose that increased efficiency of both unlikely events results from prolonged residence of pol δ at the template-primer junction induced specifically by PCNA and that this is intrinsic to the mechanism of “clamp-type” processivity factors. Similar proposals have previously been advanced for prokaryotes (see e.g. Refs. 9Shavitt O. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11275-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tadmor Y. Ascarelli-Goell R. Skaliter R. Livneh Z. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kunkel T.A. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6830-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We demonstrated directly that PCNA stabilizes the interaction of pol δ with a template-primer containing a 3′-terminally mismatched primer (Fig. 1) in a complex that is indistinguishable from that formed with a fully base-paired template-primer (Fig. 2). Moreover, the terminally mispaired primer can apparently be extended, at least under some circumstances (Fig. 2). These observations correlate with at least a 27-fold decrease in the fidelity of pol δ brought about by the addition of PCNA (Fig. 3). Formally, the apparent increase in misincorporation of dTMP as measured in our assay could result if the dTTP used was contaminated with dCTP and PCNA acted to reduce the Km of pol δ for dCTP. Given the vendor-stated purity of the dTTP used, we considered this highly unlikely. Nevertheless, to evaluate this possibility directly, we determined the Km of pol δ for dCTP both with and without PCNA. Km values of 7.5 and 12 μM, respectively, were determined, 2D. Ju. Mozzherin and P. A. Fisher, unpublished data. thus ruling out Km effects as a mechanism to account for the apparent misincorporation of dTMP. We also considered the possibility of template contamination to account for dTMP misincorporation. However, if this was the case, the ratio of dTMP incorporation versus dCMP incorporation would not be expected to change dependent on the presence or absence of PCNA. We think it noteworthy that in the assay used to evaluate pol δ fidelity, we did not distinguish among nucleotide misincorporation, mismatch excision, and extension of a 3′-terminally mispaired primer. It is clear from the data shown that PCNA promotes complex formation with a mispaired primer terminus (Fig. 1) and, at least under some conditions, can allow such a primer to be extended (Fig. 2). In several contexts, we were unable to demonstrate any effect of PCNA on mismatch excision. 3M. McConnell and P. A. Fisher, unpublished data. There is currently no information pertinent to effects of PCNA on misincorporation of normal nucleotides (as distinct from mispaired primer extension) by pol δ. However, PCNA clearly promotes the misincorporation (and/or inhibits excision) of a nucleotide analog by pol δ (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; see below). This is certainly an area for future research that will have considerable bearing on understanding the effects of PCNA on replication by pol δ. We would also like to note that the conditions used to delineate PCNA-induced infidelity by pol δ differ significantly from those found in vivo. In our assays, only a single dNTP, dTTP, is provided, potentially biasing our system toward misincorporation. In vivo, all four dNTPs are present. It remains to be determined if PCNA would promote misincorporation by pol δ during in vivo replication. The other unfavorable event catalyzed by pol δ that PCNA promotes is incorporation of the dTMP analog, dTCH2P (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). This analog was used diagnostically to distinguish DNA polymerase α from DNA polymerase ε (16Jasko M.V. Semizarov D.G. Victorova L.S. Mozzherin D.J. Krayevsky A.A. Kukhanova M.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In light of our current observations, such results must be interpreted with caution since, in vivo, it is possible that hypothetical and as yet undiscovered accessory factors could influence dramatically analog utilization by DNA polymerases. Inhibition data (Fig. 8) demonstrate that PCNA enhancement of dTCH2P incorporation by pol δ occurs through an indirect mechanism rather than a direct effect of PCNA on the interaction of pol δ with dTCH2PP2. The ability of dTCH2PP2 to compete with dTTP is unaffected by PCNA (Fig. 8). Accordingly, it is our conclusion that PCNA can promote stable nucleotide misincorporation (as opposed to extension of mismatched primer termini) indirectly through stabilization of interaction of pol δ with the primed template. Ultimately, it is, in our estimation, the effect of PCNA on dissociation of pol δ from the template-primer that provides the evolutionary selection pressure necessary to maintain the 3′-5′-exonuclease intrinsic to pol δ. Any DNA polymerase that functions processively by virtue of decreased dissociation from the primed template (enhanced template-primer binding) is inherently more likely to misincorporate, immortalize a misincorporated nucleotide, or incorporate a nucleotide analog in place of a normal nucleotide. In all instances, the 3′-5′-exonuclease is ideally suited to deal efficiently with any errors committed by pol δ. In contrast, DNA polymerases α and β, which are not highly processive, lack intrinsic 3′-5′-exonuclease activities. However, we would also like to note that in our in vitro assays, the 3′-5′-exonuclease of pol δ is demonstrably active (see Ref. 6Ng L. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet both effects of PCNA, enhanced misincorporation/mismatched primer extension and greater incorporation of dTCH2P, were easily observed. In cells, there are presumably other factors that contribute to the accuracy of pol δ. The assays described here may be useful to identify such factors in vitro It is a pleasure to acknowledge M. Kukhanova, H. Miller, and V. Mikhailov for helpful discussions as well as D. Bogenhagen for critical reading of the manuscript."

Nature. 1944; 154: 570-575Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Fetuins are glycoproteins with both N-linked and O-linked carbohydrate side chains (2Hayase T. Rice K.G. Dziegielewska K.M. Kuhlenschmidt M. Reilly T. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4915-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Edge A.S. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16135-16141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fetuins occur in large amounts in blood and cerebrospinal fluid and accumulate to high concentrations in calcified bone (4Triffitt J.T. Gebauer U. Ashton B.A. Owen M.E. Reynolds J.J. Nature. 1976; 262: 226-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The fetuins form a family within the superfamily of mammalian cystatins (5Elzanowski A. Barker W.C. Hunt L.T. Seibel-Ross E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); they are characterized by a tripartite structure, i.e. two NH2-terminally located cystatin-like domains (D1, D2) and a unique COOH-terminal domain (D3) not present in other mammalian cystatins (6Brown W.M. Dziegielewska K.M. Saunders N.R. Christie D.L. Nawratil P. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although many biological functions have been attributed to fetuins, none has been unequivocally established to date (for review, see Ref. 7Dziegielewska K.M. Brown W.M. Fetuin. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1995Crossref Google Scholar).The human homologue of fetuin, α2-HS glycoprotein, has long been known as a major protein of the plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid. Early studies have demonstrated that α2-HS isolated from Cohn's fraction VI of human plasma is a two-chain molecule consisting of a A-chain of 282 amino acid residues and a B-chain of 27 residues (8Yoshioka Y. Gejyo F. Marti T. Rickli E.E. Bürgi W. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Schmid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1665-1676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gejyo F. Chang J.L. Bürgi W. Schmid K. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Van Halbeek H. Dorland L. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4966-4971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of the α2-HS cDNA revealed that a single mRNA transcript encodes the A and the B chains, and that a sequence segment of 40 residues (“connecting peptide”) bridges the A and B portions in the primary translation product, pre-α2-HS (10Lee C.C. Bowman B.H. Yang F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4403-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because this segment is absent in the α2-HS form of Cohn's fraction VI it has been hypothesized that the connecting peptide is released from the precursor protein by an unknown proteinase, and that the liberated peptide might serve a biological function (9Gejyo F. Chang J.L. Bürgi W. Schmid K. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Van Halbeek H. Dorland L. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4966-4971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated α2-HS from freshly drawn human plasma in the presence of proteinase inhibitors, and determined that the circulating form of α2-HS is a two-chain protein with a heavy chain of 321 residues and a light chain of 27 residues (11Kellermann J. Haupt H. Auerswald E.A. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14121-14128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This circulating form of α2-HS still contained the connecting peptide attached to the heavy chain, and only the terminal residue of arginine in position 322 was missing. These findings prompted us to investigate α2-HS proteolytic processing thereby addressing the following questions: (i) is the release of the connecting peptide a consequence of the isolation procedure or does it occur under (patho)physiological conditions; (ii) is the connecting peptide released in a single step, i.e. by cleavage of the Leu282-Leu283 bond, or by sequential processes; (iii) which proteinase(s) is (are) involved in the release of the connecting peptide or fragments thereof, and what is the nature of the enzyme(s), if any, that split(s) the critical Leu-Leu bond? Our experimental data indicate that the connecting peptide region is highly succeptible to proteolytic breakdown in vitro and in vivo, and that a chymotryptic activity can release the connecting peptide or fragments thereof from the circulating form of α2-HS.DISCUSSIONFetuins are abundant in mammalian plasma and tissues. Much knowledge has accumulated on the structure of these prototypic glycoproteins, however, their functional role is less well defined. Bovine fetuin has been implicated in the stimulation of cell growth (27Puck T.T. Waldren C.A. Jones C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the modulation of brain development (28Dziegielewska K.M. M. llgård K. Reynolds M.L. Saunders N.R. Cell Tissue. Res. 1987; 248: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The rat homologue, first described as phosphoprotein pp63, was shown to be an inhibitor of the endogenous tyrosine kinase activity associated with the insulin receptor (29Auberger P. Falquerho L.

The fetuins have therefore been implicated in the regulation of the mitogenic response following insulin stimulation (29Auberger P. Falquerho L. Contreres J.O. Pages G. Le Cam G. Rossi B. Le Cam A. Cell. 1989; 58: 631-640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 30Rauth G. Pöschke O. Fink E. Eulitz M. Tippmer S. Kellerer M. Häring H.U. Nawratil P. Haasemann M. Jahnen-Dechent W.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that fetuins bind transforming growth factor-β-like cytokines (32Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and therefore can antagonize the action of transforming growth factor-β and bone morphogenic proteins similarly suggest a role for fetuins as modulators of growth and development.Consistently, fetuins have been localized in mineralized bone tissue. Rat fetuin has also been described as bone sialic acid containing protein (33Ohnishi T. Nakamura O. Ozawa M. Arakaki N. Muramatsu T. Daikuhara Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or 60 K acidic glycoprotein (34Mizuno M. Farach Carson M.C. Pinero G.J. Fujisawa R. Brunn J.C. Seyer J.M. Bousfield G.R. Mark M.P. Butler W.T. Bone Miner. 1991; 13: 1-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and both proteins were introduced as putative modulators of bone formation. A rabbit bone protein, hemonectin, which is closely associated or identical with rabbit fetuin (35White H. Totty N. Panayotou G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was originally defined as a homing factor for the granulocyte lineage (36Campbell A.D. Long M.W. Wicha M.S. Nature. 1987; 329: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The human counterpart of fetuin, α2-HS glycoprotein, is thought to play a major role in bone metabolism (37Colclasure G.C. Lloyd W.S. Lamkin M. Gonnerman W. Troxler R.F. Offner G.D. Bürgi W. Schmid K. Nimberg R.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 66: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To this end we have recently shown that domain D1 of fetuins mediates inhibition of apatite formation to inhibit unwanted mineralization in plasma and possibly during early stages of bone mineralization (18Schinke T.

Serine phosphorylation was shown to be critically required for rat fetuin inhibition of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (29Auberger P. Falquerho L. Contreres J.O. Pages G. Le Cam G. Rossi B. Le Cam A. Cell. 1989; 58: 631-640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and multiple serine phosphorylation was also demonstrated in human fetuin (38Jahnen-Dechent W. Trindl A. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, the inhibition of apatite formation by fetuins was largely independent of secondary amino acid modifications (18Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Pöschke O. Müller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). One intriguing structural feature of human fetuin with possible functional implication was revealed when the cDNA sequence of human α2-HS was published (10Lee C.C. Bowman B.H. Yang F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4403-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and compared to the known protein sequences from the A- and B-chains (8Yoshioka Y. Gejyo F. Marti T. Rickli E.E. Bürgi W. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Schmid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1665-1676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gejyo F. Chang J.L. Bürgi W. Schmid K. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Van Halbeek H. Dorland L. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4966-4971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Namely, a stretch of 40 amino acids predicted by the cDNA sequence was conspicuously absent from the published protein sequence. This tempted us and others to speculate that this connecting peptide served some unknown biological function after being proteolytically liberated. Subsequently we have isolated from freshly drawn plasma under the strict protection of proteinase inhibitors a two-chain form of α2-HS where the heavy chain still harbors the connecting peptide except for a single COOH-terminal residue of Arg at position 322 (11Kellermann J. Haupt H. Auerswald E.A. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14121-14128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This heavy chain (as opposed to A-chain) form of α2-HS is dominant in the plasma; we have failed to detect in plasma a single chain form or the two-chain form with the heavy chain including Arg322 (11Kellermann J. Haupt H. Auerswald E.A. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14121-14128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have, however, identified the single chain form along with the heavy chain form of α2-HS in the supernatant of a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, suggesting that the endoproteolytic cleavage and the exoproteolytic removal of Arg322 are closely associated with the site of biosynthesis (38Jahnen-Dechent W. Trindl A. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and most probably do not occur in the plasma. Still an explanation was missing as to why a rather homogenous A-chain form of α2-HS has been isolated by alternative purification procedures (8Yoshioka Y. Gejyo F. Marti T. Rickli E.E. Bürgi W. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Schmid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1665-1676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gejyo F. Chang J.L. Bürgi W. Schmid K. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Van Halbeek H.

Acta. 1961; 47: 440-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Predictably, a single clip at positions 282/283 of the heavy chain of α2-HS should release a connecting peptide of 39 residues (desArg40-CP) and generate the A-chain form.To search for proteinases that could release the connecting peptide in vitro, we subjected our plasma α2-HS to limited proteolysis by a set of proteinases and analyzed the fraction of small peptides liberated in this way. A single enzyme, chymotrypsin, cleaves the critical Leu-Leu bond at positions 282/283 implying that a chymotrypsin-like activity might release desArg40-CP in vivo. An additional cleavage site of chymotrypsin at positions 283/284 (Leu-Ala) is adjacent to the former site and might yield a shortened form of the connecting peptide, desLeu1desArg40-CP. Given the fact that the molar enzyme over substrate ratio was 1:10,000, and that >90% of the starting material was processed after an incubation period of 30 min, it appears that chymotrypsin is an extremely efficient processing enzyme for α2-HS. Because two additional chymotrypsin cleavage sites are located distally of the critical Leu-Leu bond we cannot rule out the possibilities that the connecting peptide is released sequentially by stepwise cleavage from its COOH-terminal end, or that the released connecting peptide is subsequently cleaved into fragments of variable size.Unlike chymotrypsin most of the other tested proteases split the center portion of the connecting peptide. Six fragments are released by the cleavage of a short segment of 9 residues harboring the MAHS7 epitope (positions 294 to 303; Ala-His-Tyr-Asp-Leu-Arg-His-Thr-Phe), Fig. 7, bottom panel. This part of the molecule is well conserved in the fetuin family: 5 out of 9 amino acids are invariant among human, bovine, sheep, and rat fetuins (6Brown W.M. Dziegielewska K.M. Saunders N.R. Christie D.L. Nawratil P. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, the NH2-terminal portion of the connecting peptide that harbors 2 cleavage sites, and its COOH-terminal portion where we found no cleavage site are less conserved (2/12 and 8/20, respectively). Clustering of the cleavage sites on a short segment indicates that this stretch is likely to represent a primary attack site for proteinases in α2-HS akin the “hyperfrangible region” identified in human high molecular weight kininogen (39Vogel R. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Esterl A. Machleidt W. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by the finding that the MAHS7 epitope is readily lost even under strictly limited proteolysis in vitro.Is the connecting peptide released in vivo? We have been unable to find in anticoagulated plasma of healthy donors significant amounts of the A-chain form which is devoid of the connecting peptide (not shown). However, under pathological conditions, such as sepsis, truncated forms of α2-HS were detected in the plasma, and these forms were virtually free of the connecting peptide. These observations are compatible with the notion that the connecting peptide (or at least major part of it) is released from the circulating two-chain form under pathological conditions. We cannot, however, rule out that α2-HS, sequestered from the plasma compartment or locally synthesized, might release its connecting peptide in situ due to the action of chymotryptic activities. Future studies will focus on the proteolytic processing of α2-HS in peripheral organs such as the bone, and will directly address the potential biological roles of the connecting peptide and its major fragments.

Nature. 1944; 154: 570-575Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Fetuins are glycoproteins with both N-linked and O-linked carbohydrate side chains (2Hayase T. Rice K.G. Dziegielewska K.M. Kuhlenschmidt M. Reilly T. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4915-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Edge A.S. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16135-16141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fetuins occur in large amounts in blood and cerebrospinal fluid and accumulate to high concentrations in calcified bone (4Triffitt J.T. Gebauer U. Ashton B.A. Owen M.E. Reynolds J.J. Nature. 1976; 262: 226-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The fetuins form a family within the superfamily of mammalian cystatins (5Elzanowski A. Barker W.C. Hunt L.T. Seibel-Ross E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); they are characterized by a tripartite structure, i.e. two NH2-terminally located cystatin-like domains (D1, D2) and a unique COOH-terminal domain (D3) not present in other mammalian cystatins (6Brown W.M. Dziegielewska K.M. Saunders N.R. Christie D.L. Nawratil P. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although many biological functions have been attributed to fetuins, none has been unequivocally established to date (for review, see Ref. 7Dziegielewska K.M. Brown W.M. Fetuin. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1995Crossref Google Scholar).The human homologue of fetuin, α2-HS glycoprotein, has long been known as a major protein of the plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid. Early studies have demonstrated that α2-HS isolated from Cohn's fraction VI of human plasma is a two-chain molecule consisting of a A-chain of 282 amino acid residues and a B-chain of 27 residues (8Yoshioka Y. Gejyo F. Marti T. Rickli E.E. Bürgi W. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Schmid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1665-1676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gejyo F. Chang J.L. Bürgi W. Schmid K.

Cloning of the α2-HS cDNA revealed that a single mRNA transcript encodes the A and the B chains, and that a sequence segment of 40 residues (“connecting peptide”) bridges the A and B portions in the primary translation product, pre-α2-HS (10Lee C.C. Bowman B.H. Yang F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4403-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because this segment is absent in the α2-HS form of Cohn's fraction VI it has been hypothesized that the connecting peptide is released from the precursor protein by an unknown proteinase, and that the liberated peptide might serve a biological function (9Gejyo F. Chang J.L. Bürgi W. Schmid K. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Van Halbeek H. Dorland L. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4966-4971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated α2-HS from freshly drawn human plasma in the presence of proteinase inhibitors, and determined that the circulating form of α2-HS is a two-chain protein with a heavy chain of 321 residues and a light chain of 27 residues (11Kellermann J. Haupt H. Auerswald E.A. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14121-14128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This circulating form of α2-HS still contained the connecting peptide attached to the heavy chain, and only the terminal residue of arginine in position 322 was missing. These findings prompted us to investigate α2-HS proteolytic processing thereby addressing the following questions: (i) is the release of the connecting peptide a consequence of the isolation procedure or does it occur under (patho)physiological conditions; (ii) is the connecting peptide released in a single step, i.e. by cleavage of the Leu282-Leu283 bond, or by sequential processes; (iii) which proteinase(s) is (are) involved in the release of the connecting peptide or fragments thereof, and what is the nature of the enzyme(s), if any, that split(s) the critical Leu-Leu bond? Our experimental data indicate that the connecting peptide region is highly succeptible to proteolytic breakdown in vitro and in vivo, and that a chymotryptic activity can release the connecting peptide or fragments thereof from the circulating form of α2-HS."

Here we describe the identification of this gut peptide in the human brain and pituitary. With reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we were able to isolate and clone the transcript from human hypothalamus. An antibody generated against a synthetic peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of hITF was used for immunohistochemical studies of appropriate tissue sections. Neurons expressing hITF were identified in two magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei, the paraventricular and periventricular nuclei. hITF polypeptide was also observed in Herring bodies of the neurohypophysis and in secretory cells of the adenohypophysis. Double immunostaining with anti-growth hormone antibody showed partial coexistence in a selected subpopulation of adenohypophysial cells. Localization of hITF in the hypothalamo-neurohypo- physial system may suggest a modulatory action on the classical magnocellular nonapeptides vasopressin and oxytocin, and further indicates an adenohypophysial importance of this peptide. It is likely that hITF represents a novel neuropeptide of yet unknown function.—Probst, J. C., Zetzsche, T., Weber, M., Theilemann, P., SkuteUa, T., Landgraf, R., Jirik- owski, G. F.

Functionally active scIL5 was constructed using recombinant DNA methods by linking two IL5 monomers with a Gly-Gly linker. Mutants were constructed at residues Arg91, Glu110, and Trp111, previously shown to be involved in IL5 receptor α chain binding, and at residue Glu13, known to be involved in signal transduction presumably through interaction with the receptor βc chain. Mutants were examined for receptor α chain binding by an optical biosensor assay and for bioactivity using a cell proliferation assay. Substitution of the two binding site residues R91 and W111 in the same 4-helix bundle domain caused a 5-fold greater reduction in receptor binding affinity than when the two substitutions were distributed one in each domain. Substitution of E13 and R91 either in the same or in opposite domains gave comparable IL5Rα chain binding kinetics, essentially unchanged from those of scIL5. However, in contrast to the binding affinity pattern observed with R91A/W111A dual mutants, distributing the E13A/R91A mutations between the two 4-helix bundle domains caused a 5-6-fold greater loss of bioactivity than when the two changes were in the same domain, leaving the other domain unaltered. Taken with previous mutagenesis data, these results are consistent with a single shared-site model of IL5-IL5Rα chain recognition in which a single α chain can orientate in either of two modes, each one of which is stabilized preferentially by one of the two 4-helix bundles of IL5.

Distinct sites have been observed for α and βc interaction on the surface of IL5. Hybrid constructs of mouse/human IL5 suggest that structural elements in the C-terminal 36-residue sequence of IL5 (which includes the helix D) interact directly with IL5Rα and confer species specificity (9McKenzie A.N.J.

All these residues are around the dimer interface. In contrast, Glu13, which is at the distal ends of the IL5 dimer away from the helix bundle interface, has been suggested to interact with the βc chain of IL5R, since mutation at this position results in loss of biological activity but does not affect the binding affinity to α chain (10Tavernier J.

The effectiveness of Glu13-substituted IL5 mutants as antagonists of biological activity is consistent with a sequential receptor subunit binding scheme, whereby the cytokine initially binds the specific receptor α chain followed by interaction with βc to initiate signal transduction. That tight αβc complexes do not pre-form also is suggested from the observation of cytokine cross-competition using IL3 and GM-CSF to block IL5 activity (14Lopez A.F. Vadas M.A. Woodcock J.M.

The dual subunit composition of hIL5R, together with the observation that both dimeric IL5 and monomeric GM-CSF can trigger the same βc, led us to investigate the topological layout of receptor binding sites on IL5 that effect interaction and consequent bioactivity. A key observation has been that, despite the dimeric nature of IL5, the binding stoichiometry between soluble IL5 receptor α chain (shIL5Rα) and hIL5 is 1:1, that is, one receptor α chain bound per dimeric IL5 (4Johanson K.

Since energetically important residues for α chain binding are distributed around the central interface between the two 4-helix bundles (12Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the binding site for α chain could contain residues from both bundle surfaces, thus constituting a single central shared site. However, mutagenesis of wild-type IL5 (wtIL5) inevitably leads to symmetrical mutations of both bundles, thus restricting more high resolution topological mapping using the wild-type protein. We recently reported creation of a single-chain form of human IL5 (scIL5), in which two IL5 molecules were tandemly linked by a peptide linker (16Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Importantly, scIL5 and wtIL5 had equivalent biological activity and binding affinity for shIL5Rα. The design of functionally active scIL5 allowed asymmetric mutagenesis of the symmetrical IL5 molecule. Through asymmetric mutagenesis, we obtained preliminary data to suggest that the single receptor α chain binding site on hIL5, that is positioned around the interface of the two four-helix bundles of the cytokine, uses residues from the two bundles in an asymmetric fashion (16Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More recently, Dickason and Huston (13Dickason R.R. Huston D.P. Nature. 1996; 379: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) described a biologically active IL5 monomer (mono 5) in which the length of the CD loop of hIL5 was increased to that of monomeric GM-CSF. The results with mono 5 showed that a single 4-helix bundle domain of IL5 contains sufficient structure to induce biological function. However, the IL5 monomer had about a 1 order of magnitude lower level for EC50 (13Dickason R.R. Huston D.P. Nature. 1996; 379: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and lower receptor α chain affinity than wtIL5 (17Dickason R.R. English J.D. Huston D.P. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 2D. P. Huston, personal communication. The lower affinity of “mono 5” leaves open the possibility that both domains of IL5 are involved in receptor interaction in wtIL5. In the present work, we sought to investigate further the topology of the IL5Rα binding site on IL5 by making dual asymmetric Ala substitutions at residues E13, R91, E110, and W111. Residues R91, E110, and W111 have been identified as important residues for receptor α chain binding by extensive mutagenesis studies (10Tavernier J. Tuypens A.V. Plaetinck R.D. Heyden J.V. Cuisez Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), while E13 is the only residue so far identified to be important for bioactivity but not receptor α chain binding. We report here the results of these mutation studies with scIL5 and the insights gained into the composition of the binding sites for hIL5Rα and -βc. Construction of the COS expression vector pCDN-IL5(sc) containing the hIL5 coding sequence was described before (12Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with this vector using DEAE-dextran (18Sussman D.J. Milman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and grown in serum-free medium. Cell-free supernatants were collected after 3 days and stored at 4°C. Levels of expression were measured by Western blot using polyclonal anti-hIL5 antibodies. Site-directed mutagenesis was first carried out on pCDN-IL5 by a “cassette mutagenesis” method (19Wells J.A. Vasser M. Powers D.B. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To make a single site mutation in scIL5, the mutant pCDN-IL5 was digested with BglII and ligated with the 350-base pair BglII fragment of pCDN-IL5(sc). To make multiple mutations in the single-chain hIL5, single mutations were first made individually in pCDN-IL5 or pCDN-IL5(sc), and then combined by restriction digestion and ligation. Presence of desired mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. The mutants made in this study were: R91A(a); R91A(b); W111A(b); R91A(a)/W111A(b); R91A(b)/W111A(b); R91A(a)/E110A(b); R91A(b)/E110A(b); E13A(a)/R91A(b); and E13A(b)/R91A(b). The N-terminal half of scIL5 is defined as (a), the C-terminal half as (b). For example, R91A(a)/W111A(b) has R91 replaced by A on the N-terminal half of scIL5, and W111 replaced by A on the C-terminal monomer of scIL5. The rest of the mutants are named analogously. Kinetic and equilibrium constants for the interaction between hIL5Rα and different forms of hIL5 were measured using an SPR optical biosensor (BIAcore, Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala) in an assay similar to that described previously (12Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expressed hIL5 from COS supernatants was anchored noncovalently but tightly to the non-neutralizing antibody 24G9 (20Ames R.S. Tornetta M.A. McMillan L.J. Kaiser K.F. Homes S.D. Appelbaum E. Cusimano D.M. Theisen T.W. Gross M.S. Jones C.S. Silverman C. Porter T.G. Cook R.M. Bennett D. Chaiken I.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6355-6364PubMed Google Scholar), and the binding of various concentrations of shIL5Rα to the attached hIL5 was then measured. The mutants studied here were bound to the anchoring antibody as tightly as wild-type hIL5 and dissociated only very slowly from the antibody within the time of each run of the assay. This slow dissociation had no significant affect on the binding analysis (12Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Conditions for the sensor assay were the same as those reported previously (12Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), except that the flow rate was changed to 50 μl/min in the dissociation phase of the IL5shIL5Rα complex. The linear portions of the association and dissociation phases of sensorgrams obtained for a series of shIL5Rα concentrations were analyzed to give kon and koff. Kd values were determined from ratios of koff/kon. Biological activity was measured using a subclone of the human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 (subclone TF1-28), which is highly responsive to recombinant hIL5. The assay was described previously (16Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Data were fitted to a four-parameter logistic curve (Grafit 3.0), and EC50 values were calculated. Results are given as the mean of three to six determinations. Coefficients of variation were <25%. Concentrations of wtIL5, scIL5, and mutants were determined by a combination of Western blot analysis (12Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and quantitative IL5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the monoclonal antibodies 24G9 and TRFK-5 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis). COS cell supernatants were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with anti-hIL5 antiserum (12Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, all mutants were secreted into the supernatant and had the same molecular weight (∼34 kDa) as scIL5. COS-expressed wtIL5 homodimer also had the same molecular weight as scIL5 (16Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, all mutants were recognized by a panel of anti-IL5 monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating their structural integrity (data not shown). We previously reported single-site Ala mutants of residues R91, E110, and W111 showing that, when only one residue of a given type is substituted in scIL5, affinity for Rα binding is far more than half that when both residues are mutated simultaneously (16Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used these three key binding residues to construct different mutation combinations distributed over one or both domains of scIL5. The locations of these residues in the tertiary structure of IL5 are shown in Fig. 2. The binding kinetics of the interactions between shIL5Rα and mutants were measured by a sandwich biosensor assay (Fig. 3, Table I).Fig. 3Comparison of the binding kinetics of scIL5, R91A(a)/W111A(b), and R91A(b)/W111A(b) for their interactions with shIL5Rα. Data were obtained with a BIAcore SPR optical biosensor. Overlays of sensorgrams showing binding of various concentrations of shIL5Rα to IL5 mutants were plotted. The marked numbers indicate the concentrations of shIL5Rα. The increase in response shows the binding of shIL5Rα.

Open table in a new tab Mutants R91A(a), R91A(b), and W111A(b), which have only one residue substituted in the dimer, showed a small decrease (2-3-fold) in receptor affinity (Table I). In contrast, substitution of R91A or W111A in both domains gave ∼40-fold reduction in receptor affinity. The much greater affinity decrease seen with a double mutant versus a single site mutant (e.g. R91(a,b) versus R91(a)) suggests a nonadditive role for these residues in stabilizing the IL5-receptor complex. When substitutions R91A and W111A were combined, either in one domain R91A(b)/W111A(b) or in two different domains R91A(a)/W111A(b), markedly different receptor binding properties were obtained (Fig. 3 and Table I). R91A(b)/W111A(b), despite having one of its two 4-helix bundle domains unmodified, showed a weaker affinity (37 nM) than R91A(a)/W111A(b) (6.9 nM). This strongly suggests that the receptor-binding site is constituted of residues from both domains rather than from a half molecule. Dual asymmetric mutants were also made for the combination of residues R91 and E110. In contrast to the results obtained with mutants R91A(a)/W111A(b) and R91A(b)/W111A(b), the Kd values of R91A(a)/E110A(b) and R91A(b)/E110A(b) were similar (Table I). However, R91A(a)/E110A(b) and R91A(b)/E110A(b) showed 3- and 2-fold further reduction in Kd, respectively, versus the Kd of their corresponding single mutants R91A(a) and R91A(b) (Table I). In other words, replacing residue E110 had an additional effect whether it was in the same domain in which the R91A mutation resides or whether instead it is on the other domain from that containing R91A. This suggests that both E110 residues at the dimer interface contribute to the binding of receptor α chain and is also consistent with the model that the receptor-binding site is constituted of residues from both domains. If the receptor only interacts with one domain of IL5, R91A(b)/E110A(b) should have a higher affinity than R91A(a)/E110A(b) since the former has an undisrupted domain while the latter does not. The TF1 cell proliferation assay was used to measure the biological activity of IL5 mutants. It was reported previously that residue E13 is not involved in IL5Rα binding activity, but is required for biological activity (10Tavernier J. Tuypens A.V. Plaetinck R.D. Heyden J.V. Cuisez Y. Oefner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5194-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Graber P. Proudfoot A.E.I. Talabot F. Bernard A. McKinnon M. Banks M. Fattah D. Solari R. Peitsh M.C. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15762-15769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, there was only a ∼2-3-fold decrease in biological activity when one E13 residue was mutated to Ala in scIL5 (16Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To test whether binding of IL5Rα caused activation of βc through the E13 on the same domain which forms the major part of the receptor α chain binding site, we made combinations of asymmetric mutations of R91 and E13. As shown in Table I, E13A(a)/R91A(b) and E13A(b)/R91A(b) had the same receptor α chain binding kinetics, with Kd values being almost the same as that for wtIL5. However, the biological activities of these two mutants differed significantly (Fig. 4 and Table I). Mutant E13A(a)/R91A(b), where changes were made in only one 4-helix bundle, showed no reduction in bioactivity. Mutant E13A(b)/R91A(b), which had substitutions made in different bundles, showed a 6-fold decrease in activity. We began this study with a preliminary hypothesis that the receptor α chain binding site in IL5 is contributed dominantly by helices A and D and, reflecting the 1:1 α receptor:IL5 binding stoichiometry, that the α receptor binding site involves both 4-helix bundle components of the IL5 homodimer (16Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We were also aware of recent work showing that monomeric IL5 is at least partially functionally active (13Dickason R.R. Huston D.P. Nature. 1996; 379: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Dickason R.R. English J.D. Huston D.P. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and that hence only a single 4-helix bundle domain is required for bioactivity. Hence, we were interested in delineating more fully the extent to which the symmetrical IL5 may bind receptor subunits asymmetrically to produce a biological effect. We made several dual-residue asymmetric mutants of scIL5. In one case, we made dual mutants wherein both residues substituted were receptor α chain binding residues, such as R91 and W111. In a second case, one of the residues was α chain binding (R91), while the second was a non-α chain binding residue (E13), which is, however, intimately involved in bioactivity possibly through a role in signal transduction. In both cases, the two mutations were arranged in scIL5 so that either one was in each 4-helix bundle or both were in the same bundle, thus leaving the second bundle unaltered as wild type. Among binding site residue dual mutants, the most dramatic effect was seen with R91A/W111A. Here, the dual mutant with both changes in the same 4-helix bundle showed greater lowering of α chain affinity than the dual mutant with one change in each of the two 4-helix bundle domains. For the dual binding/signal transduction residue mutant R91A/E13A, the effect of sequestering both mutations in the same bundle is the opposite, no decrease in bioactivity, versus the substantial decrease when the two mutations are distributed one per each bundle. The above results lead to a model of asymmetric receptor recruitment by IL5 that is shown in Fig. 5. Here, the α receptor binds to the single shared α chain site, which straddles the 4-helix bundle interface, but it can bind to this site in two alternative modes, favoring contact with either one or the other 4-helix bundle. Overlapping contact or at least physical occlusion would explain why the stoichiometry of α chain binding does not exceed 1:1. Both α chain binding modes are identical with respect to stabilizing contacts on the IL5 surface, since the two 4-helix bundle domains of IL5 are arranged symmetrically about the dyad axis. For asymmetric mutants such as R91A(b) and R91A(b)/W111A(b), the two binding modes are not equivalent, with one binding mode expected to have a much lower affinity. However, no obvious heterogeneity was detected in either the association or dissociation phases of the interactions between these asymmetric mutants and the receptor α chain, likely because the weaker binding mode was unavailable after the α chain occupied the higher-affinity site. The model in Fig. 5 also shows only one receptor βc binding at a time, though there appear to be two sites, one around each of the two Glu13 residues, which could be crucial for βc recruitment. It is proposed that βc is only recruited to bind IL5 once α is bound and that the βc site favored is the “cis” site, namely the site involving the Glu13 on the 4-helix bundle domain which predominates in contacting α-chain. This would explain why there is less bioactivity with E13A(b)/R91A(b) than with E13A(a)/R91A(b), since the former has both of its bundle surfaces disabled with respect to α and βc interaction. A key observation leading to the present study and to the proposed model in Fig. 5 is that monomeric IL5, which is biologically active, has a somewhat lower α chain binding affinity (17Dickason R.R. English J.D. Huston D.P. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).2 Independently, we also designed and cloned a monomeric form of IL5, 3J. Li and I. M. Chaiken, unpublished results. in our case by inserting the peptide segment GGSGGSGG between residues 85 and 86 in the wtIL5 sequence. With this form expressed in COS cells, we measured binding to receptor α chain directly by biosensor analysis using the BIAcore optical biosensor. We obtained a Kd for this mono 5 of about 200 nM, compared to 3 nM for the dimeric wtIL5. The large difference in affinity strongly supports the model of a shared α chain binding site as illustrated in Fig. 5. Based on their affinity constants (Kd), the calculated binding free energies of wtIL5 and mono 5 for shIL5Rα were −11.6 and −9.1 Kcal/mol, respectively. Thus the binding energy was mainly contributed by one 4-helix bundle of IL5. This is consistent with our model that a single receptor α chain is stabilized preferentially by one of the two 4-helix bundle domains of IL5 (Fig. 5). This is also consistent with the observed nonadditive role of the same residue (such as Arg91) on two bundles in α chain binding. A possible alternative to this model is that recruitment of α and βc receptor subunits occurs at “trans” sites (βc binding on the 4-helix bundle domain opposite the domain that dominates in α chain binding including through R91) as opposed to the cis arrangement in Fig. 5. However, we consider the trans organization to be less likely for two reasons. First, if recruitment were trans, we would have expected less effect on biological activity for asymmetric mutant E13A(b)/R91A(b), where the distribution of substitutions is one change in each 4-helix bundle domain and thus the second possible E13/R91 pair is wild type, compared to E13A(a)/R91A(b), where both E13/R91 pairs are partially altered. Second, a trans organization of α and βc is inconsistent with the substantial biological activity observed for monomeric IL5 (13Dickason R.R. Huston D.P. Nature. 1996; 379: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar),3 which can only recruit both receptor chains in a cis configuration (α and βc binding to the single 4-helix bundle). A second alternative explanation of our data is a half-site reactivity model combined with the effect of geometric proximity of the two alternative half-sites. In this latter model, IL5Rα interacts with residues from only one 4-helix bundle domain, and the IL5Rα binding site on the other domain is inaccessible due to a steric effect. Additionally, an IL5Rα molecule can immediately bind to the other proximal site during its dissociation from the first site on IL5. This proximity effect would cause an apparent increase in binding affinity. Thus, the decrease in receptor-binding affinity seen for mutants R91A(b)/W111A(b) and R91A(b)/E110A(b) (both have an undisrupted domain) could be due to the loss of the proximity effect. We cannot rule out this possibility. However, the proximity effect, if it exists, does not account fully for our data, since R91A(b), which has one domain disrupted, has only a 30% increase in koff compared to scIL5. Furthermore, the presence of a proximity effect would not alter the main conclusion of this work that the α and βc subunits of IL5 receptor are recruited asymmetrically. It has been suggested that βc subunit dimerization might be involved in signaling (21Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea R. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Takaki S. Takatsu K. Int. Archs.

Med. 1996; 183: 1911-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Due to the 2-fold symmetry of IL5, IL5 itself can possibly link two βc chains upon activation. However, our asymmetric mutagenesis data suggest that direct βc dimerization is unlikely. First, single-chain mutant E13A(b) showed only a slight decrease in biological activity (16Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); second, there was a significant difference in biological activities of mutants E13A(a)/R91A(b) and E13A(b)/R91A(b). The fact that E13A(a)/R91A(b) showed close to wild-type activity indicates that the binding of IL5Rα causes the binding of one βc chain to the same 4-helix domain where IL5Rα binds. Again, this is consistent with the finding that mono 5 is biologically active (13Dickason R.R. Huston D.P. Nature. 1996; 379: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the marked reduction (16-fold) in the affinity for IL5Rα observed in the asymmetric mutant R91A(b)/W111A(b) did not result in a parallel reduction in biological activity (Table I). Such a strong discontinuity between affinity and biological activity of IL5 mutants has been seen before (11Graber P. Proudfoot A.E.I. Talabot F. Bernard A. McKinnon M. Banks M. Fattah D. Solari R. Peitsh M.C. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15762-15769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One interpretation is that the magnitude of cell proliferation, a response to βc recruitment that no doubt involves several cell surface and intracellular steps (21Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea R. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Takaki S. Takatsu K. Int. Archs.

Med. 1996; 183: 1911-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), is nonlinearly related to (and hence seemingly permissive of) some variations in the binding of IL5Rα. A future effort to measure binding of the various scIL5 mutants to αβc complex versus α alone could yield a useful insight into the mechanism underlying the discontinuity between α chain affinity and bioactivity.

https://openalex.org/W2009172086,"Transgenic mice, homozygous for HIV-1 protease expression in the eye lens, display degradation of some lens crystallins and cytoskeletal proteins prior to cataract formation on postnatal days 23-25. Alterations to the internal lens hydration state also occur; therefore, the status of the aquaporin protein MIP26 was examined over postnatal days 16-25 to determine if it was altered during cataractogenesis. The MIP was identical in transgenic and control lenses until day 21. By postnatal day 25 (frank cataract), in the lenses obtained from transgenic animals, the 26-kDa band was absent and there was a concurrent increase in the proportion of MIP23. Immunoblotting demonstrated cleavage at the C terminus. Lenses were also maintained in an organ culture system to demonstrate that the cataractogenic process is inherent to the isolated lens and to determine the contribution of cysteine protease action. Organ culture experiments revealed a similar progression to nuclear cataract formation as seen in vivo. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the soluble lens crystallin fraction of organ cultured lenses revealed the same cleavage pattern as occurs in vivo. Organ culture of transgenic lenses with E64, a cysteine protease inhibitor, dramatically delayed cataractogenesis and prevented proteolytic cleavage of both MIP26 and crystallins. HIV-1 protease, while the trigger of cataract formation, does not appear to be the protease responsible for cleavage of MIP or lens crystallins. These results suggest that activation of endogenous cysteine protease activity is involved in the cleavage of these proteins and occurs downstream of HIV-1 protease action. Transgenic mice, homozygous for HIV-1 protease expression in the eye lens, display degradation of some lens crystallins and cytoskeletal proteins prior to cataract formation on postnatal days 23-25. Alterations to the internal lens hydration state also occur; therefore, the status of the aquaporin protein MIP26 was examined over postnatal days 16-25 to determine if it was altered during cataractogenesis. The MIP was identical in transgenic and control lenses until day 21. By postnatal day 25 (frank cataract), in the lenses obtained from transgenic animals, the 26-kDa band was absent and there was a concurrent increase in the proportion of MIP23. Immunoblotting demonstrated cleavage at the C terminus. Lenses were also maintained in an organ culture system to demonstrate that the cataractogenic process is inherent to the isolated lens and to determine the contribution of cysteine protease action. Organ culture experiments revealed a similar progression to nuclear cataract formation as seen in vivo.

Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are susceptible to secondary pathologies that can lead to death. Intense research to elucidate the molecular aspects of HIV viral/cell interactions led to the creation of transgenic mice containing the entire HIV-1 genome with a nonfunctional viral reverse transcriptase. Many of these transgenic mice displayed cataract formation within 3 to 6 months of age (4Iwakura Y. Shioda T. Tosu M. Yoshida E. Hayashi M. Nagata T. Shibuta H. AIDS. 1992; 6: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). While AIDS patients are at risk of blindness from uveitis and retinitis caused by secondary viral infections, little information exists regarding possible increased incidence of cataracts. One small study of patients has reported ocular lens opacities in many of the HIV-1-infected patients examined (5Schnaudigel O.-E. Gumbel H. Richter R. Subklew R. Garweg T. Ophthalmologe. 1994; 91: 668-670PubMed Google Scholar). human immunodeficiency virus. Transgenic mice (line TG72) expressing the HIV-1 protease under control of the lens-specific αA-crystallin promoter also develop cataracts on postnatal days 23-25 indicating that expression of the protease alone will cause cataracts. Cataract formation is dependent on the HIV-1 protease, because transgenic mice expressing an inactive HIV-1 protease in the lens remain cataract-free as do TG72 mice that are administered HIV-1 protease inhibitors (6Tumminia S.J. Jonak G.J. Focht R.J. Cheng Y.-S.E. Russell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In homozygous TG72 mice, lenses show refractive index changes prior to cataract formation. Lens nuclear alterations appear about postnatal day 21, and by day 23 distinct nuclear cataracts are apparent. The cataractous nuclei of the lenses are displaced posteriorly with increasing age and increase in diameter. Light scattering measurements and scanning electron microscopy have revealed that alterations to the cytoskeleton and membrane components are responsible for much of the opacification, and biochemical data have shown extensive proteolysis of lens proteins. Damage to both lens crystallins and lens fiber cell membranes leads to water influx and a decrease of nonfreezable water. Density fluctuations from cytoplasmic density variation and the possible increased extracellular space cause the light scattering which is seen as cataract (7Bettelheim F.A. Zeng F.F. Bia Y. Tumminia S.J. Russell P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Curiously, the patterns of proteolysis of the lens crystallin proteins are not those that can be generated by the HIV-1 protease (6Tumminia S.J. Jonak G.J. Focht R.J. Cheng Y.-S.E. Russell P.R. J.

Opinion Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), comprises over 50% of the intrinsic membrane protein of the lens fiber cell. MIP may play a role in regulating the transmembrane flux of water in lens fiber cells and in addition there is evidence to suggest MIP maintains the very small extracellular space between fiber cells through electrostatic association to phospholipid head groups of the opposing fiber cell membrane (10Michea L.F. Andrinolo D. Ceppi H. Lagos N. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MIP associates with structural proteins of the lens cytoplasm such as α- and β-crystallins, and the binding of ATP to α-crystallin increases its affinity for binding to MIP (11Reddy M.C.

Eye Res. 1988; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This pattern is consistent with the proposed 6-transmembrane and 8-transmembrane models for aquaporin-0 (MIP26) (19Preston G.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11110-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 20Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Sci. 1991; 16: 170-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both models propose that a long C-terminal extension of MIP26 extends on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane which would make the C terminus available to cytoplasmic proteases. MIP26 is essential for lens transparency as illustrated by two mutations of MIP26 in the mouse strains Catfr and Lop. Early fiber cell degeneration, similar to that in the TG72 mouse lens, occurs in Catfr and Lop mice (22Shiels A. Bassnett S. Nature Genet. 1996; 12: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To determine the role that HIV-1 protease may play in the cellular destruction of the lenses of the TG72 animals, the change in the membrane protein MIP26 was investigated. An organ culture technique was developed to study the changes of this protein ex vivo. Lenses were obtained from normal FVB/N mice and the mouse line TG72 homozygous for the HIV-1 protease. All experiments strictly adhered to the NIH guidelines on the care and use of animals in research. Lenses were homogenized and fractionated into water-soluble, urea-soluble, EDTA-extractable, and insoluble membrane fractions. The final membrane fraction contained MIP26. Lenses were homogenized directly in 1.5-ml conical plastic tubes containing ice-cold 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0. Homogenates were separated by centrifugation (12,000 × g × 5 min, 5°C) into water-soluble and insoluble fractions. The insoluble fraction was washed sequentially with Tris-Ca buffer (1×), Tris-Ca 7 M urea buffer (2×), Tris-Ca buffer (1×), Tris-2 mM EDTA buffer (2×), 50 mM NaOH (1×), and Tris-EDTA buffer (1×). The final urea insoluble pellets were dehydrated by Speed Vac. Susceptibility of MIP26 to HIV-1 protease action was tested by incubation of insoluble membrane preparations from normal lenses with exogenous recombinant HIV-1 protease (Bachem Biochem, King of Prussia, PA). Incubations contained 4 mg of resuspended membranes prepared from lenses of normal FVB/N mice and 400 ng of HIV-1 protease in 21 μl of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). Control incubations contained membrane preparation only. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 20 h in a rotary shaker. As a positive control for active protease, incubations were carried out with 4 mg of rhesus monkey α-crystallin fraction prepared by gel filtration of monkey lens soluble protein on a CL6B column (90 × 2.5 cm) using 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.3 buffer. For organ culture, 18-day-old eyes were enucleated from TG72 animals and opened posteriorly from the optic nerve remnant, avoiding the lens. Pressure was applied to the anterior segment to expel the lens onto parafilm with the assistance of a teflon spatula, followed by immediate transfer into serum-free TC199 media (300 mosm, pH 7.2) with or without 0.50 mM E64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, Sigma). Lenses at this age were transparent. Lens integrity was assessed by the absence of lens proteins in the culture media after 2 h (23Tumminia S.J. Qin C. Zigler J.S. Russell P. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar) and was a precondition for use in culture experiments. Culture medium was changed daily. Samples of membrane preparations or membrane/protease incubations were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide SDS-gels using the Pharmacia PhastGel system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Washed membrane pellets or membrane/protease incubation mixtures were dissolved in sample buffer (2.5% SDS, 2%β-mercaptoethanol), but were not heated to avoid aggregation of MIP26 into high molecular weight complexes. MIP26 and its degradation products were visualized with Coomassie Blue staining. For Western immunoblotting, proteins were transferred according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blots were incubated with primary antibody (4°C, 48 h, 1:100) in 10% milk diluent (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Unbound immunoglobins were removed with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (3 × 20 min, 37°C), and blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase (1:20,000, 3 h, 37°C). Bands were detected by chemiluminescence reaction using CSPD substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Rabbit antisera made to octapeptides corresponding to conserved sequences in the N- and C-terminal regions of mouse and bovine MIP26 were kindly provided by Dr. Larry Takemoto (Kansas State University). Octapeptides were: MIP-(1-8), MWELRSAS; MIP-(252-59), TGEPVELK; MIP-(256-63), VELKTQAL. Water-soluble lens crystallins were subject to isoelectric focusing under denaturing conditions followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. Water-soluble fractions were dissolved in 8 M urea, 2% Nonidet P40, 5% Pharmalite 3-10 ampholytes. Pharmacia IEF 3-9 PhastGels were equilibrated in the same solution for 30 min, and samples were focused according to the manufacturer's protocol. Second dimension polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 12.5% polyacrylamide PhastGels at 250 V for 60 V-h (15°C). Proteins were visualized with silver staining. MIP26 was the major intrinsic protein in membrane preparations of normal and younger transgenic TG72 lenses as visualized in SDS gels of the membrane fractions (Fig. 1A). Although there was a small amount of variation between animals, alterations of MIP appeared to start about postnatal day 20 and were complete by day 25. Increased amounts of the 25-kDa and 23-kDa polypeptides were detected in the lenses of TG72 mice by 21 days of age compared to control lenses from the normal mice. By 25 days of age, MIP26 was essentially absent in lenses from TG72 mice, and only the 23-kDa polypeptide remained. This pattern of degradation paralleled the formation of nuclear cataract. Incubations of lens membrane preparations from control mice with recombinant HIV-1 protease did not resemble the proteolysis of MIP26 in vivo. MIP26 was resistant to the recombinant HIV-1 protease even in membrane preparations substantially free of many associated extrinsic proteins (Fig. 1B). A positive control for recombinant HIV-1 protease activity was provided by incubations with monkey α-crystallin fractions under the same conditions. Proteolysis of α-crystallins resulted in lower molecular weight products, demonstrating that the recombinant HIV-1 protease was active under the incubation conditions employed. Transparent lenses from 18-day-old TG72 mice, removed prior to cataract formation, went on to develop nuclear cataract after 2 days of organ culture in medium TC199. The nuclear opacity increased in diameter to involve more of the lens cortex throughout 6 days of culture. This progression was very similar to the cataract formation in TG72 mice in vivo. Lenses were also incubated in medium containing 0.5 mM E64, a cysteine protease inhibitor. E64 at this concentration did not inhibit recombinant HIV-1 protease activity when used with HIV protease substrate III (Bachem Biochem) in vitro (data not shown). TG72 lenses cultured in medium TC199 containing E64 were free of nuclear cataract after 2 and 4 days of culture in contrast to TG72 lenses cultured without E64 (Fig. 2A). E64-treated lenses developed nuclear cataract after the 6th day of organ culture. Besides the delay in progression of cataract, the diameter of the opacities were smaller than seen in untreated lenses. Examination of MIP26 in membrane preparations from organ-cultured TG72 lenses revealed progressive cleavage of MIP26 concomitant with nuclear cataract formation as seen in SDS gels (Fig. 2B). Degradation products appeared at 25 kDa and 23 kDa, as seen in vivo. Higher molecular mass bands attributed to glycosylated forms of MIP were also detectable (18David L.L. Takemoto L.J. Anderson R.S. Shearer T.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1988; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Degradation of MIP26 was more progressive after the 4th and 6th days of organ culture. However, proteolysis of MIP26 was inhibited in organ cultured TG72 lenses treated with E64. This inhibition was effective in preventing the appearance of the 25-kDa and 23-kDa polypeptides throughout the culture period. Intact MIP26 was immunoreactive with rabbit antisera to the N-terminal (anti-MIP-(1-8)), as well as the C-terminal region (anti-MIP-(252-59), anti-MIP-(256-63)) (Fig. 3). The 25-kDa and 23-kDa bands only displayed reactivity to the N-terminal directed anti-MIP-(1-8). Degradation of the MIP26 in organ culture was from the C terminus and mimicked the degradation in vivo. Two-dimensional gel analysis of soluble proteins from organ-cultured TG72 lenses detected many crystallins including α- and β-crystallins, with progressive proteolysis of αA-crystallin, βA1-crystallin, βB2-crystallin, and βB1/βB3-crystallins occurring with nuclear cataract formation (Fig. 4). Crystallin modifications were not observed in organ-cultured TG72 lenses treated with E64. The pattern observed with cataract formation in organ culture was strikingly similar to the one reported for these lens proteins in vivo (6Tumminia S.J. Jonak G.J. Focht R.J. Cheng Y.-S.E. Russell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The expression of HIV-1 protease in the lens leads to alteration in the membrane aquaporin MIP26 prior to nuclear cataract formation, but apparently not in a direct manner. Gel analysis of lens membrane preparations revealed that MIP26 is cleaved in lenses of transgenic TG72 mice resulting in the progressive formation of 25-kDa and 23-kDa polypeptides. Cleavage of MIP26 was at the C terminus. That HIV-1 protease does not directly cleave MIP26 was suggested by incubations of membrane preparations from control mouse lenses with recombinant HIV protease in vitro. The pattern of MIP26 cleavage is similar to that seen with other rodent cataract models suggesting common mechanisms in the process of opacification regardless of the initiating event (17Russell P. Kinoshita J.H. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1980; 19: 150Google Scholar, 18David L.L. Takemoto L.J. Anderson R.S. Shearer T.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1988; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Peracchia and Girsch (25Peracchia C. Girsch S.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1985; 4: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Peracchia C. Girsch S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown that the C terminus of MIP26 is most likely the channel gate. The permeability of liposomes reconstituted with MIP26 is altered by Ca2+ in the presence of calmodulin which interacts with MIP-(225-241) in the C-terminal region (27Girsch S.J. Peracchia C. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 83: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Girsch S.J. Peracchia C. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 83: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Girsch S.J.

Biol. 1991; 126: 75-88Google Scholar, 31Ehring G.R. Zampighi G.A. Hall J.E. Prog. Cell Res. 1993; 3: 143-151Google Scholar) have shown that the presence of the C-terminal region is required to stabilize MIP in the closed state. Phosphorylation of this region of MIP, as well as cleavage of the C terminus, opens the channel (32Pearson R.B. Woodgett J.R. Cohen P. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14471-14476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lampe P.D. Johnson R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The abnormal increase in the fraction of MIP in the open state as a result of proteolysis is consistent with the alterations to water distribution in the TG72 lens. The changes to water distribution occur at the same time as the cleavage of MIP26, and both precede eventual destruction of fiber cell membranes in the lens nucleus at 23-25 days of age. This first use of an organ culture system of a precataractous lens has increased the understanding of cataract formation in these animals. Degradation of MIP26 and lens crystallins in organ-cultured lenses appeared to be identical to the process in vivo. This suggests that activation of endogenous proteases by the HIV-1 protease had a similar mechanism. Cataract formation in organ culture coincides with the proteolysis of MIP26 and the appearance of 25-kDa and 23-kDa polypeptides as seen in vivo. Immunoblotting demonstrated that cleavage of MIP26 was at the C terminus, again consistent with the proteolysis of this protein in vivo. The time course of cataract formation appears to be accelerated somewhat in organ culture, which is likely the result of inevitable trauma associated with the dissection of the lens from the globe and initiating culture. All lenses were initially checked for integrity using the very sensitive protein leakage technique, but it is logical that some alterations in the lens occurs as a result of the manipulations necessary to start organ culture. The pattern of crystallin cleavage in organ-cultured lenses of TG72 mice was also very similar to the pattern previously reported in vivo where βB1, βB3, and βA3-crystallins were degraded rapidly with the onset of nuclear cataract (6Tumminia S.J. Jonak G.J. Focht R.J. Cheng Y.-S.E. Russell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown here for MIP26, the cleavage pattern of soluble lens crystallins in vivo cannot be reproduced by incubations of normal mouse lens crystallins with recombinant HIV-1 protease in vitro (6Tumminia S.J. Jonak G.J. Focht R.J. Cheng Y.-S.E. Russell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This infers the hypothesis that other endogenous proteases can become activated by the action of expressed HIV-1 protease. Inhibition of cysteine protease activity in organ cultured TG72 lenses with E64 dramatically preserved the MIP26 and reduced the formation of MIP26-derived polypeptides at 25 kDa and 23 kDa. Likewise, the formation of nuclear cataract was inhibited in E64-treated organ cultured lenses although this inhibitor is ineffective against the HIV-1 protease. Examination of lens crystallins from organ-cultured TG72 lenses on two-dimensional gels also demonstrated that E64 prevented the characteristic proteolysis of αA-crystallin, βB1-crystallin, βB3-crystallin, and βA3 crystallin that occurs with nuclear cataract formation in these animals. Calpain would be a logical candidate for the activated cysteine protease activity in the TG72 lens. Two classes of Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases, calpain I (μ-calpain) and calpain II (m-calpain), and the endogenous inhibitor polypeptide calpastatin are found in the mammalian lens (34Yoshida H. Murachi T. Tsukahara I. Invest. Opththalmol. & Visual Sci. 1985; 26: 953-956PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain II is the more abundant form in the lens compared with calpain I. Both calpains have the same regulatory 30-kDa subunit, and become fully activated by micromolar (calpain I) or millimolar (calpain II) Ca2+ concentrations. Calpastatin (mass 110 kDa) directly binds and inhibits calpain I and II (35Nakamura M. Inomata M. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was recently shown by Eto et al. (36Eto A. Yoshiko A. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25115-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that calpain can translocate to the membrane and degrade substrates at that location. Two possible mechanisms for calpain activation in the TG72 mouse lens would be that HIV-1 protease causes the lens fiber intracellular Ca2+ concentration to increase or that HIV-1 protease might activate calpain by proteolysis directly or by degrading calpastatin. The cleavage of the MIP26 appears to be an accelerating factor in the opacification of the lens. As more of this important membrane protein is degraded, cellular integrity and particularly ion balance within the cell may be compromised. Subsequent activation of ion-dependent proteases would intensify the destruction of the cells. The similarity of cataract formation in organ culture with that in vivo suggests that the same mechanism of cytoskeletal and membrane structural damage occurs in both.

We identified a GC-rich, 30-base pair IGFRE in the porcine P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage gene, P450 11A (P450scc) (14Urban R.J. Shupnik M.A. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25761-25769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we determined that the porcine P450scc IGFRE could induce IGF-I-stimulated gene expression in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, we showed that Sp1 and a another unknown transcription factor, P2, bound to the IGFRE and mediated IGF-I-induced gene expression. All restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Radioactive nucleotides were obtained from Amersham. Pure human recombinant IGF-I was obtained from Bachem Inc. (Torrance, CA). The luciferase reporter gene constructs containing the porcine P450scc core promoter and IGFRE have been previously described (14Urban R.J. Shupnik M.A. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25761-25769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the −2320 construct contains the entire sequenced upstream region of P450scc including the IGFRE. The −100 construct contains the porcine core promoter without the IGFRE (14Urban R.J. Shupnik M.A. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25761-25769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides mWT and mM1-mM7 represent the porcine IGFRE and mutations to the GC box of the IGFRE (see Table I). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized with BamHI and SalI sites for directional cloning into pSVPLUC. The plasmid pSVPLUC is a modified pGEM3 plasmid containing the luciferase gene and the enhancerless SV40 early region promoter (15Brasier A.R. Ron D. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 5: 108-123Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The plasmid was obtained from Dr. Allan Brasier, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX. Annealed oligonucleotides were used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and selected mutants (mWT, mM1, mM2, and mM6) were cloned into pSVPLUC for transfection experiments in MCF-7 cells.

Open table in a new tab MCF-7 cells were cultured in Earle's minimum essential medium + 10% fetal bovine serum with 1 ml of penicillin/streptomycin/100 ml of medium. Transient transfection was done by lipofection (Tfx-50 Reagent, Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection experiments were done on 60-mm plates as per the Promega protocol for Tfx-50 Reagent. A 3 to 1 ratio (1 μg of DNA/2.5 μl of Tfx-50) was used for each transfection. The control plasmid pSV2Apap (containing the SV40 early promoter, enhancer region, and the human placental alkaline phosphatase gene; Ref. 16Henthorn P. Zervos P. Raducha M. Harris H. Kadesch T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6342-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with the chimeric construct of interest. After transfection, cells were maintained in 2.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested and measured for luminescence as described previously (14Urban R.J. Shupnik M.A. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25761-25769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining lysate was measured for alkaline phosphatase activity using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) and measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled by polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol). Nuclear extract protein from MCF-7 cells (10 μg), 5 × gel shift binding solution (20% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)poly(dC-dI), and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (50,000 cpm) were incubated at room temperature for 15 min for shift assays. For supershift assays, 2 μl of Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was incubated at room temperature for 15 min with the nuclear extract protein, 5 × buffer, and poly(dI-dC)poly(dC-dI). Labeled oligonucleotide was then added for an additional 15 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis in 0.5 × TBE buffer (1 M Tris-HCl, 1 M boric acid, 20 mM EDTA) and visualized by autoradiography. Differences between control and IGF-I treatment for transient transfection experiments in MCF-7 cells with porcine core promoter and pSVPLUC constructs were done by paired t tests. ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test was used to compare basal expression of wild type and mutant pSVPLUC constructs. Probability values of ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The −2320 porcine P450scc construct, containing the porcine IGFRE, showed a significant increase in luciferase activity when transfected into MCF-7 cells with a control plasmid (pSV2Apap) and treated with IGF-I (Fig. 1). The porcine P450scc core promoter alone (−100) was not stimulated with IGF-I treatment (Fig. 1), nor was the pOLUC (promoterless luciferase) plasmid alone (data not shown). The activity of the porcine P450scc core promoter was minimal, but detectable in MCF-7 cells. EMSA with MCF-7 nuclear extract protein and an oligonucleotide of the porcine IGFRE identified two transcription factors binding to the IGFRE (Fig. 2). The binding of both factors was competitively inhibited by 100 × unlabeled IGFRE oligonucleotide, but 100 × unlabeled consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) only inhibited binding of the top band (Fig. 2). To further show that Sp1 was binding to the IGFRE, supershift assays were done with an Sp1 antibody that recognizes both isoforms of Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The top band was supershifted by Sp1 antibody, although not completely (Fig. 3). The lower, unknown band was designated as P2.Fig. 3Electrophoretic mobility Sp1 supershift assay of MCF-7 transcription factors. Autoradiogram of a supershift assay using Sp1 antibody, MCF-7 nuclear extract protein (10 μg), and either 32P-labeled porcine IGFRE or consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide. Lanes A and B represent Sp1 oligonucleotide (positive control) and lanes C and D represent porcine IGFRE oligonucleotide. Lanes B and D show the addition of 2 μl of Sp1 antibody. The porcine IGFRE oligonucleotide was 30 base pairs, while the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide was 23 base pairs as shown by the slower electrophoretic mobility of the IGFRE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether IGF-I treatment affected the binding activity of Sp1 and P2 to the IGFRE, MCF-7 nuclear extract protein was collected on cells treated for 48 h with IGF-I (20 nM). EMSA found the binding activity of both proteins was increased after IGF-I treatment (Fig. 4). A series of mutations were made to the porcine IGFRE in the form of synthetic oligonucleotides to create mutants that bound one transcription factor and not the other. These mutations were made only to the GC box of the IGFRE and were more selective than mutations reported previously (14Urban R.J. Shupnik M.A. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25761-25769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all, seven different mutants were tested in EMSA. The mutants and their binding activity for Sp1 and P2 are summarized in Table I. Because of the low activity of the porcine P450scc core promoter in MCF-7 cells, constructs of selected mutants of the IGFRE were made in pSVPLUC. The constructs were mM1 (no binding of either transcription factor), mM2 (binds Sp1 only), and mM6 (binds P2 only). The EMSA results for the selected mutants are shown in Fig. 5 (mWT and mM2) and Fig. 6 (mWT, mM1, and mM6). These mutant constructs were transfected into MCF-7 cells with the control plasmid and treated with IGF-I (20 nM) for 48 h. The pSVPLUC construct showed a 2-fold increase in reporter gene expression after treatment with IGF-I in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Therefore, all IGF-I treatment values were divided by 2 before comparison with control transfections. A significant increase in reporter gene expression was measured with mWT, but not the three mutant constructs (Fig. 7). ANOVA was used to compare the basal reporter gene activity of the wild type and mutant constructs. All three mutant constructs showed significantly less activity than the wild type construct. Therefore, theses results show that the binding of both transcription factors is necessary for basal and IGF-I-stimulated transcriptional activity of the porcine IGFRE in MCF-7 cells.Fig. 6EMSA of a porcine IGFRE mutant that binds P2 alone.

The binding of both transcription factors is necessary for basal and IGF-I-stimulated transcriptional activity of the porcine IGFRE. IGF-I treatment increases the binding of both transcription factors to the IGFRE. While Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that controls expression of many genes (17Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 18Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11109-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the unknown transcription factor, P2, may be more specific in its effects on gene expression. Therefore, characterization of P2 could lead to specific therapies that retard breast cancer cell growth. IGF-I-stimulated gene expression is mediated by transcription factors that bind to GC-rich domains of genes. The IGFREs identified contain only one GC box and are located approximately 100-150 base pairs from a TATA box (9Alemany J. Borras T. De Pablo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpstra A.J. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol.

This promoter arraignment differs from other promoters that contain multiple GC boxes and often lack the TATA box sequence (19Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fuji-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). As expected, the GC boxes found in the IGFREs bind Sp1 (9Alemany J. Borras T. De Pablo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpstra A.J. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol.

Studies in the promoter of chicken δ1-crystallin gene identified two transcription factors binding to a GC-rich domain that mediated IGF-I-stimulated gene expression (10Alemany J. Klement J.F. Borras T. De Pablo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One of these was identified as Sp1 by cooperative binding with purified Sp1 protein (10Alemany J. Klement J.F. Borras T. De Pablo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the promoter region of the rat elastin gene a GC-rich domain has also been identified as regulating IGF-I-stimulated gene expression and binding Sp1 (13Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpstra A.J. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6555-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, IGF-I treatment decreases Sp1 binding to this region and is proposed to allow the binding of some factor that mediates the IGF-I effect (13Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpstra A.J. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6555-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both studies of these IGFREs suggest that an additional factor is necessary for gene expression by the IGFRE (10Alemany J. Klement J.F. Borras T. De Pablo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpstra A.J. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6555-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our study confirms these suggestions by showing that the binding of P2 and Sp1 is necessary to induce IGF-I-stimulated gene expression. Determining that P2 is necessary for IGF-I-stimulated gene expression in MCF-7 cells also presents the possibility that manipulation of P2 binding will selectively inhibit breast cancer cell growth. Breast cancer cell initial development, growth, and later metastases involve the IGF-I system (4LeRoith D. Baserga R. Helman L. Roberts Jr., C.T. Ann. Intern. Med. 1995; 122: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The expression of IGF-I in breast cancers is of independent prognostic significance and relates to the malignant histopathological features of the breast cancer cells (20Toropainen E. Lipponen P. Syrjänen K. Eur. J. Cancer A. 1995; 31A: 1443-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The beneficial effect of tamoxifen on the treatment of breast cancer is linked to its lowering of plasma concentrations of IGF-I (21Lahti E.I. Knip M. Laatikainen T.J. Cancer. 1994; 74: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Stable expression of IGF-I receptor antisense RNA in MCF-7 breast cancer cells will reduce IGF-I and serum-stimulated cellular proliferation (7Neuenschwander S. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4298-4303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any therapy that reduces the expression of Sp1 in breast cancer cells would likely have adverse effects on normal cells and tissues because the transcription factor is ubiquitous and involved in the regulation of many genes. However, there is the potential for more cell-specific actions on breast cancer cell growth with the other transcription factor, P2. The extent of this factor's expression and its importance in normal cell function can only be assessed once the factor has been identified. Therefore, isolation and identification of P2 could result in a therapy that prevents the growth and metastasis of certain breast cancers. In summary, we determined that MCF-7 cells contain transcription factors (Sp1, P2) that mediate IGF-I-stimulated gene expression of a known IGFRE (porcine 450scc). Further characterization of the P2 transcription factor may result in a therapy that prevents IGF-I-mediated breast cancer cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1868248369,"We previously identified a carboxy-terminal transactivation function termed AF-2 within the last 15 amino acids of the ligand binding domain of the human retinoic acid receptor alpha (hRAR alpha). Truncation of this region abolished transcriptional activity. Here we provide a systematic analysis using alanine scanning mutagenesis of amino acids from Ser405 to Gly419 on a truncated hRAR alpha (delta419) to identify residues within this region that are responsible for transcriptional activity. Whereas mutations in positions 405, 408, 411, and 415-419 have little or no effect on the ability of modified receptors to activate a DR5 response element, mutations in positions 406, 407, 409, 410, and 412-413 modify either the potency or efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) -induced gene transcription. Therefore, receptors with mutations in positions 409, 410, 413, and 414 have low transcriptional activity over a wide range of tRA concentrations. Receptors with mutations in positions 406, 407, and 412 exhibit a maximum transcriptional activity similar to wild-type hRAR alpha, but require higher concentrations of tRA. Replacing residues 405-419 on delta419 with the conserved AF-2 domain from the vitamin D3 receptor or the estrogen receptor results in a receptor with wild-type or low transcriptional activity, respectively. A full-length hRAR alpha mutant with an alanine substitution at position 406 (hRAR alpha M406A) binds tRA, but unlike the truncated M406A, which lacks the ""F"" region, it is not transcriptionally active. Protease mapping experiments detect a consistent difference in the conformation of hRAR alpha M406A compared to wild-type hRAR alpha. These data define amino acids from Ser405 to Gly419 on delta419 that are critical for transcriptional activity and point to the importance of the conformational integrity of receptor domains in maintaining ligand-induced transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W1954264650,"Whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed on human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with rat cDNAs for the alpha6, beta2, and gamma2S subunits of the GABA(A) receptor. The volatile anesthetic halothane directly activated a current in the absence of the ligand gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Both the current amplitude and the rate of desensitization increased in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 1.0+/-0.2 mM and a Hill coefficient (nh) of 1.5+/-0.1. The EC50 and nh for GABA to activate the receptor were 1.0+/-0.3 microM and 1.4+/-0.2, respectively. The peak amplitude of the halothane-activated current was about 4% of the maximal GABA response, which was not changed when the concentration of Ca2+ in the external solution was decreased from 2 mM to 0.2 mM. The reversal potential of both halothane- and GABA-activated currents changed with the external Cl- concentration as predicted by the Nernst equation for chloride ions. The halothane- and GABA-activated currents were blocked by both the noncompetitive GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin and the competitive GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. Schild plots revealed that the K(i)s for bicuculline to competitively antagonize the currents activated by halothane and GABA are similar (0.69 and 0.72 microM, respectively). These results indicate that halothane activates the alpha6 beta2 gamma2S GABA(A) receptor to induce a current similar to the GABA-induced current."

Members of this family are involved in a variety of cell responses to signals that target most signaling systems, including the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems (2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). Moreover, in all of the examined cell types, PKC is the major, if not the only, intracellular target for tumor-promoting phorbol esters (3Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All identified PKCs share a common functional requirement for phosphatidylserine (PS) and differ in their sensitivity to other activators (4Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar). Conventional PKC isotypes (cPKCs) represent a group of four isoenzymes (PKC-α, -βI, -βII, and -γ) that are sensitive to synergistic activation by 1,2-diacylglycerol and calcium. Under resting conditions most PKC-α is located in the cytosol and is inactive. The in situ dynamic equilibrium between membrane-associated and cytosolic forms of PKC is regulated to a large extent by the intracellular level of calcium and 1,2-diacylglycerol (5Trilivas I. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3102-3107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, phorbol esters and several physiological stimuli cause translocation of the responsive PKCs to the cell membranes with subsequent kinase activation and phosphorylation of endogenous substrates (6Kraft A.S.

Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar). An additional source of functional heterogeneity in the biological effects of phorbol ester may result from the multisite phosphorylation of PKC (7Huang K.-P. Chan K.-F.J. Singh T.J. Nakabayashi H.

PKC is initially translated as an unphosphorylated and inactive particulate-bound form (primary product), which is converted to an activable cytosolic form (mature form) by at least three sequential stages of priming phosphorylations (9Borner C. Filippuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13902-13909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pears C. Stabel S. Cazaubon S. Parker P. Biochem.

Newton A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Once the mature PKC has been formed, it is believed to be subjected to further autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation by various activators and protein kinases, respectively. We have previously reported that in vitro both the combinations of calcium plus PS (Ca2+/PS) and PS plus phorbol ester (PS/TPA) greatly stimulate the autophosphorylation of PKC but apparently on distinct sites (13House C. Robinson P.J. Kemp B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Robinson P.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 87-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Additionally, the mature PKC-α isozyme uniquely undergoes a mobility shift to a slower migrating form upon autophosphorylation induced by PS/TPA and not by Ca2+/PS. Interestingly, the unique autophosphorylation induced in vitro by phorbol ester in the absence of calcium correlates with an altered PKC substrate specificity and altered kinetics of substrate phosphorylation (15Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although distinct changes in the phosphorylation state have been correlated to activation and inactivation of PKC function (16Mitchell F. Marais R. Parker P. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Molina C. Ashendel C. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4624-4630PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ohno S. Mizuno K. Adachi Y. Hata A. Akita Y. Akimoto K. Osada S. Hirai S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17495-17501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the relationship between the state of activation and the state of phosphorylation remains to be fully elucidated. In principle, a stimulus-dependent alteration in the balance between distinct PKC phosphoforms might be as critical for a cell response as the translocation of the enzyme itself. However, technical difficulties in detecting the individual phosphoforms of a given PKC isotype have severely hampered the analysis of the in vivo correspondence between changes in the ratio of differentially phosphorylated PKC forms and changes in the enzyme functionality. PKC-α is the most studied isotype among the PKC species and the only cPKC expressed in PC12 cells. With a two-dimensional immunoblot method we have recently described the in situ phosphorylation of PKC-α in response to PC12 cell exposure to phorbol ester (19Gatti A. Wang X. Robinson P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313/2: 111-118Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we use this methodological approach to examine the potential functional role of the unique phosphorylation of PKC-α previously observed in vitro (13House C. Robinson P.J. Kemp B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Robinson P.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 87-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We report that a group of immunoreactive PKC-α forms with highly acidic pI and retarded mobility on SDS-PAGE are resistant to phorbol ester-mediated translocation and down-regulation. These results suggest a biologically relevant role for these distinctly phosphorylated variants of PKC-α. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. Cells were maintained in a 37°C incubator in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 7% CO2. Culture plates were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C. When cell homogenates were required, cells were lysed with 10 passes through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The resulting pellet was discarded, while the supernatant (postnuclear cell homogenate) was stored at −70°C. When subcellular fractionation was required, cells were sonicated with an ultrasonic probe in the same washing buffer supplemented with 40 μM leupeptin. After cell lysis, subcellular fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was collected and designated as the soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EGTA, 0.75 mM CaCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μM leupeptin, and 1% (w/v) n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside. The resuspended pellet was dissociated by repeated aspirations through a plastic pipette tip, shaken for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was designated the particulate fraction. Postnuclear cell homogenates and subcellular fractions from PC12 cells were loaded onto a pre-equilibrated diethylaminoethylcellulose (DE52, Whatman, 2 ml) column to partially purify PKC, as described previously (19Gatti A. Wang X. Robinson P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313/2: 111-118Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). DE52 extracts were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, as described previously (20Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). When indicated, DE52 samples were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis essentially as described previously (21O'Farrel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Samples were diluted 1:1 with buffer for isoelectric focusing (9.5 M urea, 5% CHAPS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. ampholines 1.2% pH 5-8, 0.8% pH 3-10), and additional solid urea was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Aliquots (50-100 μl) were loaded onto 7.5-cm-long isoelectric focusing gel tubes (0.2 cm, internal diameter) and resolved with non-equilibrium isoelectric focusing (7000 V-h) in the first dimension. The second dimension was run as 10% SDS-PAGE on a Bio-Rad minigel. Rat brain PKC was purified to apparent homogeneity and subjected to phosphopeptide mapping with V8 protease as described previously (13House C. Robinson P.J. Kemp B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified PKC was electrophoresed on 7.5% acrylamide gels to resolve PKC-α from PKC-β and -γ, since PKC-α has been shown to migrate at a slightly higher molecular mass (81 versus 80 kDa) under these conditions (14Robinson P.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 87-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In vitro autophosphorylation of PKC-α was carried out and assessed as described previously (19Gatti A. Wang X. Robinson P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313/2: 111-118Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Proteins from SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, as described previously (22Towbin H. Staethlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44918) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mr = 40,000) and incubated with the primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoreactivity was detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dakopatts) using the ECL method, following Amersham Corp. instructions. The monoclonal anti-PKC-α antibodies were used at the working concentration of 1 μg/ml (MC5, from Amersham Corp.) or 0.15 μg/ml (Transduction Laboratories). The anti-PKC-α specific antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Note that by using PC12 cells, the immunorecognition by MC5 is specific for the PKC-α isotype (19Gatti A. Wang X. Robinson P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313/2: 111-118Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, as in all examined cell types, phorbol ester induces most PKC to redistribute from the soluble to the particulate fraction. We initially measured TPA-mediated translocation using SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with the MC5 anti-PKC antibody (from Amersham Corp.). This antibody was previously shown in PC12 cells to specifically recognize the PKC-α, the only cPKC isotype in these cells (19Gatti A. Wang X. Robinson P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313/2: 111-118Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). DE52 extracts of TPA-treated and untreated PC12 cells were probed with MC5, and most of the major immunoreactive PKC-α form was found to translocate from the soluble to the particulate fraction within 30 min of cell incubation with 100 nM TPA (indicated as the 80-kDa form, Fig. 1). However, a smaller proportion of the PKC-α corresponding to a slower migrating form accumulated in the soluble fraction upon cell exposure to phorbol ester (indicated as the 82-kDa form, Fig. 1). Note that the immunoreactive signals from both the 80- and 82-kDa forms were fully displaced if a mix of purified rat brain cPKCs was included in the incubation medium containing the primary antibody (data not shown), demonstrating the specificity of the immunodetection. DE52 extracts of PC12 cells were then subjected to a two-dimensional immunoblot procedure and probed with the MC5 antibody. The expression of PKC-α in untreated cells was preferentially restricted to the cytosolic fraction where it consisted of two distinct pools of differentially migrating PKC-α forms, here designated pool 1 and pool 2 (Fig. 2, panels A and C). We previously demonstrated multiple phosphoforms of PKC-α within pool 1 after brief stimulation of intact cells with TPA (19Gatti A. Wang X. Robinson P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313/2: 111-118Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the appearance of pool 2 has not previously been reported and was revealed in this study by use of a broader range of ampholytes in the preparation of isoelectrofocusing gels. The unequal isoelectric migration of the two pools appears to be the result of the difference in the relative degree of phosphorylation of the respective PKC-α forms, with the more acidic forms in pool 2 being apparently more phosphorylated than those of pool 1. Consistent with this observation, the more acidic forms are characterized by a slower electrophoretic mobility in the second dimension of the two-dimensional procedure. Such a mobility shift and the highly acidic two-dimensional profile indicate that pool 1 and pool 2 forms of PKC-α are likely to exhibit large differences in their protein conformation. Within 30 min of cell exposure to 100 nM TPA most of the PKC-α pool 1 had translocated to the particulate fraction, while pool 2 remained in the cytosol (Fig. 2, panels B and D). A similar two-dimensional profile, although characterized by a reduced visualization of pool 2, was obtained when parallel two-dimensional blots were probed with an anti-PKC-α antibody from another commercial source (Transduction Laboratories, Fig. 3). The immunoreactive signals resulting from the use of both antibodies were displaced when each primary antibody was incubated together with a mix of purified cPKCs, confirming the specificity in the immunorecognition of both pools (data not shown). A prolonged phorbol ester treatment of cells mediates association of PKC with cell membranes followed by both catalytic inactivation (23Rodriguez-Pena A. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 24Inagaki M. Hagiwara M. Saitoh M. Hidaka H. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and proteolytic degradation of the kinase itself (25Young S. Parker P. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In order to assess whether the lack of a detectable response of pool 2 to phorbol ester was extended beyond the acute phase of treatment, PC12 cells were exposed to differential down-regulation, and the recovery of PKC-α was assessed by immunoblot with the MC5 antibody. The standard immunoblot analysis of DE52 extracts from cells treated with an increasing TPA concentration for 2.5 h revealed that 1 μM TPA caused a substantial loss of the 80-kDa form without altering the recovery of the 82-kDa species (Fig. 4, panel A). A two-dimensional immunoblot with the same antibody showed that pool 2 of PKC-α is insensitive to 2.5-h exposure to 1 μM TPA, despite the loss of pool 1 (Fig. 4, panel B). Additional one- and two-dimensional immunoblot analyses of samples deriving from a more prolonged cell exposure to phorbol ester (15 h with 1 μM TPA) gave similar results (data not shown), thus indicating that pool 2 consists of truly resistant forms of PKC-α. To determine whether in vitro PKC-α autophosphorylation produces patterns that may explain the unique two-dimensional profile of pool 2 observed in intact cells, purified cPKC was autophosphorylated in the presence of various activators, after which the extracted PKC-α was subjected to phosphopeptide mapping. We have previously reported that autophosphorylation of PKC-α in the presence of PS plus calcium (Ca2+/PS) is not associated with any detectable shift in its electrophoretic mobility, while autophosphorylation in the presence of PS plus phorbol ester (PS/TPA) promotes the conversion into an apparently higher molecular weight form (14Robinson P.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 87-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Here, phosphopeptide mapping with V8 protease of these differentially migrating forms revealed that PKC-α autophosphorylation produced two distinct patterns (Fig. 5, lanes 1-3), suggesting that the sites of autophosphorylation may be switched by the availability of calcium. In the presence of calcium, the phosphopeptide maps of PKC-α were similar to those of PKC-β/γ (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6). However, PS/TPA in the absence of calcium produced very different phosphopeptide maps of PKC-β/γ (lane 4) without any concomitant mobility shift of the respective undigested proteins (14Robinson P.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 87-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We finally examined whether highly acidic PKC-α forms (equivalent to pool 2) are detectable upon in vitro treatment of purified rat brain PKC with its activators. Although both combinations of PS/TPA and Ca2+/PS apparently promote PKC-α autophosphorylation (as visualized by the acidic shift in the two-dimensional profile, Fig. 6), only PS/TPA produced detectable pool 2 (Fig. 6, panel C). To confirm the identity of pool 2, samples from in vitro autophosphorylation of purified cPKC (with PS/TPA) and from in situ treated PC12 cells (30 min with 100 nM TPA) were mixed and subjected to the same two-dimensional immunoblot procedure. The PKC-α forms of pool 2 from PC12 cells were found to co-migrate with the highly acidic variants resulting from the PS/TPA-mediated autophosphorylation of rat brain PKC-α (data not shown). The central aim of this study was to investigate whether cell exposure to a single PKC activator (phorbol ester) may induce differential responses in distinct PKC-α phosphoforms. We have recently shown a phorbol ester-stimulated increase in the number of differentially migrating forms of PKC-α in PC12 cells, presumably resulting from a combination of autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation events (19Gatti A. Wang X. Robinson P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313/2: 111-118Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since the majority of PKC-α in a cell at any given time consists of a mature form (of ∼80 kDa), these phosphorylation events do not appear to be related to the multistage priming phosphorylation reported by others (9Borner C. Filippuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13902-13909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pears C. Stabel S. Cazaubon S. Parker P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Cazaubon S.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17559-17563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the use of a broader range in the pH gradient of the first dimension of the two-dimensional immunoblot allowed the detection of additional PKC-α forms (here termed pool 2) in DE52 extracts from untreated PC12 cells. These forms of PKC-α are more acidic than the previously identified immunoreactive forms (here termed pool 1) and are characterized by an electrophoretic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (82 kDa), which is consistent with the previously demonstrated in vitro mobility shift of PKC-α due to phorbol ester-mediated autophosphorylation (13House C. Robinson P.J. Kemp B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Robinson P.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 87-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We also found that acute cell treatment with phorbol ester induced pool 1 to translocate to the cell membranes, without affecting the intracellular localization of pool 2. Furthermore, a prolonged treatment with phorbol ester caused a substantial reduction in the cellular level of pool 1, in the absence of a concomitant loss of pool 2. These results reveal a great selectivity in the phorbol ester action on differentially phosphorylated PKC-α forms. Both pool 1 (detected with the two-dimensional immunoblot procedure) and the major 80-kDa band (visualized via standard immunoblot) appear to consist of typical PKC-α forms: they are well recognized by two distinct commercially available anti-PKC-α antibodies, and they respond to acute and chronic phorbol ester treatment with membrane translocation and down-regulation, respectively. The same considerations only partially apply for the PKC-α immunoreactive forms corresponding to pool 2 and/or 82-kDa species. Both are preferentially recognized by the Amersham Corp. anti-PKC-α antibody and more weakly by the antibody supplied by Transduction Laboratories. However, they both share a unique resistance to phorbol ester-mediated translocation and down-regulation. The possibility that the species corresponding to pool 2 and 82-kDa forms consists of an isotype other than PKC-α is not likely because of the lack of any such comigrating PKC form in PC12 cells (19Gatti A. Wang X. Robinson P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313/2: 111-118Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above observations suggest that the 82-kDa forms constitute pool 2 and that this consists of bona fide PKC-α. This is further substantiated by our previous finding that upon PS/TPA-mediated autophosphorylation, the mature PKC-α is converted to a slower migrating form (15Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the autophosphorylated PKC-α, rather than the transphosphorylated form, is likely to represent pool 2 in intact PC12 cells. Evidence to support this proposal derives from the following observations. Firstly, the in vitro treatment of purified PKC with its activators (PS/TPA) induces the appearance of slower migrating and highly acidic PKC-α forms that co-migrate in two-dimensional immunoblots with those representing pool 2 from intact PC12 cells. The appearance of slower migrating PKC-α species, when compared with the mature 80-kDa form, is a rather unique event, since the only other reported mobility shift of PKC-α occurs during the priming process from the 76-kDa precursor to the activable 80-kDa protein kinase. Note that the 80-kDa protein species reported in our study was indeed mature PKC-α, since it was reduced to an inactive 76 kDa form by in vitro treatment with phosphatases. 2A. Gatti, unpublished results. Further, among other cPKCs the change in gel mobility and in phosphopeptide map reported here is restricted to the PKC-α, indicating a high degree of specificity of the effect. Despite the above considerations, the possibility that in intact cells phorbol ester activates a protein kinase responsible for the conversion of pool 1 PKC-α into pool 2 by transphosphorylation cannot be completely ruled out yet. Why do the 82-kDa PKC-α forms of pool 2 remain in the cytosol if phorbol ester mediates membrane translocation of most PKC-α forms and down-regulation of the entire membrane-associated pool? According to the simplest interpretation, a unique site-specific autophosphorylation of PKC-α induced by the exogenous activators reduces the overall protein lipophilicity and interferes with its association with cell membranes, thus preventing the membrane-driven process of down-regulation. Such an autophosphorylation of PKC-α may induce conformational changes and mask the phospholipid binding site. Alternatively, the unique autophosphorylation may promote PKC binding to an unidentified binding protein that prevents translocation. A direct correlation between an increased phosphorylation of PKC and its dissociation from the membrane has been described in several reports. The autophosphorylated form of PKC is reported to be preferentially retained in a high speed supernatant rather than to associate with PS vesicles (26Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cell-free experiments, autophosphorylation protected PKC from PS-induced proteolysis (27Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the addition of Mg/ATP dissociated PKC from membranes presumably following autophosphorylation (28Wolf M. Cuatrecasas P. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15718-15722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, autophosphorylation may play a key role in regulating the biological function of PKC. Our results demonstrate a biological role for PKC-α phosphorylation in the protection of a pool of this isotype from translocation and down-regulation. Pool 1 and pool 2 respond in a conventional and unique manner to cell treatment with phorbol ester, respectively. This indicates the existence of a substantial degree of functional heterogeneity within a single PKC isotype. After previously reporting that the substrate specificity of PKC is partly regulated by the same agents that control its phosphorylation state (15Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have shown here that site-specific phosphorylation regulates subcellular localization and susceptibility to down-regulation. Therefore, it is conceivable that a heterogenous population of PKC phosphoforms in vivo exerts a wide range of actions, the effects of which represent an important source of functional diversity. We thank Dr. Xin Wang for help with purification of PKC and Luigi D'Offizi for expert assistance in preparation of the figures."

The relative ratios of myogenic regulatory factors may have fundamental roles in selecting specific muscle genes for activation and/or repression. INTRODUCTIONVertebrate cardiac and skeletal α-actin gene expression is distributed in distinct muscle-specific patterns during development. In birds and small mammals, the ratios of cardiac to skeletal α-actin mRNA and protein gradually decrease from 80% in embryonic skeletal muscle to 50% in the neonate and finally to about 5% in the adult limb (1Vandekerckhove J. Bugaisky G. Buckingham M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1838-1843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cardiac α-actin can be considered an embryonic skeletal muscle isoform that is down-regulated during skeletal muscle maturation while retaining high level expression in the heart. This switch in striated actin isoforms is mediated during development by control regions present in transcriptional regulatory sequences (2Cox R.D. Buckingham M.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When linked to a β-galactosidase reporter, the proximal promoter of the mouse cardiac actin gene produces low level but specific in vivo expression that mimics the developmental down-regulation of the endogenous cardiac actin gene (3Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).E-boxes (DNA consensus sequence CANNTG) are found in the regulatory regions of many genes including those expressed only in muscle. For example, the avian cardiac actin promoter depends upon an intact E-box for expression in primary embryonic skeletal muscle cultures (4Moss J.B. McQuinn T.C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12731-12740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). These four myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) share extensive homology within the bHLH motif that mediates DNA binding and heterodimerization with ubiquitously expressed bHLH proteins such as E12/E47, E2-2, and HEB (6Lassar A.B.

Transcriptional activation relies upon protein-DNA contacts made by two residues in the conserved basic region, creating a permissive protein conformation (7Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The core DNA-protein complex is modulated by non-homologous transcriptional activation domains, which confer upon each factor distinct functional abilities (8Weintraub H. Dwarki V.J. Verma I.

Interestingly, MRF4 and MyoD contain N-terminal activation domains, yet MRF4 fails to induce the expression of many muscle-specific genes despite its ability to bind E-box sequences. The differential activities of MRFs may be one of the mechanisms whereby diverse myogenic phenotypes are achieved.The developmental expression of a MRF has often been correlated with that of its target gene. Cardiac actin transcripts appear in the first skeletal muscle cells to develop in the somitic myotome of the mouse, concurrent with the expression of Myf5 (12Ott M.-O. Bober E. Lyons G. Arnold H.H. Buckingham M.E. Development. 1991; 111: 1097-1107PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of MRFs in discrete myotomal compartments may serve as an address system for distinct myoblast populations (13Smith T.H. Kachinsky A.M. Miller J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Myoblasts require MyoD and Myf5 expression since mice containing deletions in both genes lack all myoblast populations (reviewed in Ref. 5Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Myogenin-null mice fail to form functional skeletal muscle in vivo yet contain myoblasts that differentiate in vitro (14Venuti J.M. Morris J.H. Vivian J.L. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Three different MRF4-negative mouse lines with skeletal rib defects of varying severity appear to reflect alterations in expression of Myf5 that is linked to MRF4 (15Olson E.N. Arnold H.H. Rigby P.W.J. Wold B.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The only viable MRF4-null mouse expresses normal levels of Myf5 and MyoD and increased levels of myogenin mRNA (16Zhang W. Behringer R.R. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The generation of double knockouts of MRF4 and MyoD or myogenin should further define the role of MRF4 during development.MRF4 is the predominant myogenic bHLH protein in neonatal mouse limb, where cardiac α-actin expression is dramatically reduced (17Hinterberger T. Sassoon D. Rhodes S. Konieczny S.F. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In neonatal chick pectoralis muscle, MyoD levels approach those of MRF4 while myogenin mRNA declines at birth (18Saitoh O. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nabeshima T.I. Periasamy M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2503-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because commitment to a muscle cell fate can be achieved by increasing the ratio of activating over inhibiting factors such that a threshold is overcome, the absolute level of any given myogenic factor may be less important than the relative levels of all the activating myogenic factors. If MRF4 suppresses the expression of some muscle genes and not others, then the relatively high levels of MRF4 late in development may restrict the levels of muscle gene expression in some muscle fibertypes but not others. In support of this hypothesis, the myogenin promoter binds MRF4 but is not activated (16Zhang W. Behringer R.R. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Furthermore, myogenin overexpressed in mouse fast isoform-specific muscles causes high neonatal lethality and the up-regulation of acetylcholine receptor genes. The result is the formation of increased numbers of receptors at extrasynaptic surfaces (19Gundersen K. Rabben I. Klocke B.J. Merlie J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Supersensitivity to acetylcholine leads to a denervation phenotype and subsequent muscle atrophy. Thus, the balance of myogenic factors may be critical for the establishment and maintenance of the muscle phenotype.We asked whether one function of MRF4 was to suppress cardiac α-actin gene expression in developing skeletal muscle. Our experiments addressed the potential of rat MRF4, as well as its human homolog Myf6, to repress cardiac α-actin promoter activity in embryonic day 11.5 chick pectoralis primary muscle cultures. We detected repression by MRF4 in the primary myotube cultures since myogenesis had already been initiated in the presence of endogenous MRFs. Repression by MRF4 was compared with that of Id, a dominant negative inhibitor of bHLH function (20Pesce I. Benezra R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7874-7880Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We engineered two mutations in the DNA binding domain and showed the necessity for occupation of the E-box in repression. We found that unlike Id, MRF4 mediated repression partially through binding to the target E-box. The production of chimeric MyoD and MRF4 proteins demonstrated that the N terminus of MRF4 is unique among the four MRFs in its ability to negatively regulate cardiac α-actin promoter activity in skeletal muscle cell cultures, despite the presence of an intact transcriptional activation domain.DISCUSSIONMany regulatory factors in a variety of cell types belong to families that share DNA binding and/or heterodimerization motifs. Some of the family members activate while others repress transcription. Because these factors can act in combinations, a small change in the stoichiometry of a particular family member can alter cell phenotype. Relative protein concentrations change due to an altered rate of mRNA or protein synthesis and degradation. As development proceeds, threshold levels of different factors could shift a critical balance, initiating a series of subsequent events.MRF4 is predominantly expressed in adult skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that MRF4 had a functional role distinct from MyoD, Myf5, or myogenin in regulating cardiac actin and other muscle genes that are not expressed in all adult muscles. By altering the effective concentrations of the myogenic bHLH transcription factors in a primary myoblast culture system where myogenesis had been initiated, we determined that MRF4 suppressed expression from the introduced cardiac actin promoter yet activated the desmin promoter. We also tested 10T1/2 cells engineered to stably express MyoD or MRF4. Cardiac actin was expressed at high levels in the presence of MyoD. However, in the presence of stably expressed MRF4, co-transfected MyoD activated cardiac actin expression 10-fold less efficiently than in the MyoD-expressing cells. These experiments suggested a mechanism whereby MyoD was in competition with MRF4. Increasing levels of MRF4 relative to other myogenic factors during development such that certain genes are repressed while others remain activated may ultimately contribute to the restriction of muscle cell phenotype.Repression would be inefficient unless the level of inhibitor was very high, binding by the repressor occurred with greater affinity than binding by activators, or if the repressor failed to interact with surrounding factors required for the formation of an active transcription initiation complex. Our experiments suggested that high levels of MRF4 relative to other MRFs had the effect of selecting targets for repression. This result is supported by the observation that in adult mouse skeletal muscle, levels of MRF4 are at least 10-fold greater than MyoD, and cardiac actin expression is absent. In addition, factors binding to the SRE did not affect MRF4 activity, suggesting that the primary cause of repression was the interaction among MRF4, its heterodimerization partner, and the E-box. We also found that the 4RTKCAT construct, containing a multimerized E-box, was inhibited by MRF4 and activated by MyoD. Our primary muscle cell culture system detected the inhibitory effect of MRF4 on 4RTKCAT whereas this construct was activated at low levels by MRF4 in 10T1/2 fibroblasts (25Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6103-6108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The repression we observed might occur by means of a model suggested by the crystal structure of a MyoD homodimer bound to a synthetic E-box. A highly conserved alanine and threonine in the MyoD basic region exerted indirect effects on the protein-DNA complex that was relayed to the protein surface (7Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Thr-115 contacted a nucleic acid in the E-box while the small size of the adjacent Ala-114 allowed a nearby Arg-111 to be buried inside the major groove. An additional nucleic acid contact, which may be required for transcriptional activation, became possible. A homologous arginine (Arg-95) in MRF4 was changed to a glycine in the BS2 mutation. An inactive complex was formed in which the critical contacts with the DNA major groove could not be made. BS2 was unable to bind DNA yet continued to form E protein heterodimers, titrating available partners that would otherwise be available for the production of MyoD activator complexes.Further consideration of structure-function relationships elucidates the role of the N terminus in repression. The MRF4 N-terminal domain was crucial for negative regulation in chick primary myotube cultures. MRF4 amino acids 1-88 were capable of conferring repressive activity onto the MyoD or myogenin C terminus. Potential structural conformations adopted by MRFs in contact with different E-boxes may also rely on amino acid sequences outside the conserved bHLH domains. Examination of the N-terminal MRF sequences reveals that 5 out of 10 amino acids near the MRF4 basic region (amino acids 65-74) are prolines whereas 1 out of 10 for MyoD and Myf5 and 2 out of 10 for myogenin are found in this location. Prolines have the capacity to twist the shape of the protein away from a helical configuration or out of a β sheet. MRF4 may adopt different conformations that still allow for binding to an E-box yet do not form transcriptionally active complexes because the adopted conformation fails to produce the correct protein-DNA contacts. Other examples of bHLH proteins that act as repressors in the Drosophila peripheral nervous system (34Van Doren M. Ellis H.M. Posakony J.W. Development. 1991; 113: 245-255PubMed Google Scholar) or in the rat central nervous system (35Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) rely on prolines within the basic region. Their function is to restrict neuroblast lineage by interacting with ubiquitous E protein partners that otherwise bind positive activators such as achaete and scute. Hairy (34Van Doren M. Ellis H.M. Posakony J.W. Development. 1991; 113: 245-255PubMed Google Scholar) and Hes 1 (35Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) bind directly to DNA sequences called N-boxes (CACNAG) located in the regulatory regions of downstream genes. Some of these negative regulators are also expressed in muscle (35Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). We have not tested the ability of MRF4 to bind N-boxes, and MRF4 does not contain a proline within the consensus basic region. However, the regulatory versatility of bHLH proteins must rely upon factors in addition to the consensus DNA binding region in contact with an E-box.The N terminus of MyoD (8Weintraub H. Dwarki V.J. Verma I. Davis R. Hollenberg S. Snider L. Lassar A. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), the N and C termini of myogenin (9Schwarz J.J. Chakraborty T. Martin J. Zhou J. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 266-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the N and C termini of Myf5 (11Braun T. Winter B. Bober E. Arnold H.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the N terminus (amino acids 10-30) of MRF4 (10Mak K.-L. To R.Q. Kong Y. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4334-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) contained transcriptional activation domains as defined by Gal4 chimeras. N-terminal MyoD and MRF4 sequences were exchanged, and relative expression levels of reporter constructs in 10T1/2 cells were observed (10Mak K.-L. To R.Q. Kong Y. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4334-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MyoD or a D44 chimera (MyoDMRF4Δ5′) transactivated a minimal human cardiac actin promoter element to similar levels. A 44D chimera that contained MRF4 sequences 1-181 (MRF4Δ3′MyoD) did not transactivate the reporter efficiently. Analogous to our results, any construct containing MRF4 N-terminal sequences was less capable of transactivation than those containing MyoD N-terminal sequences. N-terminal sequences flanking the MRF4 transcriptional activation domain (amino acids 10-30) reduced the ability of the N terminus to activate transcription. The relative activities of the MyoD:MRF4 chimeras were comparable with those observed by us. However, the minimal human cardiac actin reporter (36Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) lacked E-box sequences shown to be important for expression in ES cells (37Skerjanc I.S. McBurney M.W. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and should not be compared with the chick promoter construct. By analogy, sequential truncation of troponin I regulatory sequences have been shown to respond differently in MRF4 co-transfections (26Banerjee-Basu S. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whereas MRF4 activated TnI regulatory regions shorter than 2300 base pairs, larger fragments were not activated by MRF4.Our model predicts that MRF4 selects E-boxes for activation or for repression. The MRF4E-box complex present in primary muscle cell cultures acted as an inhibitor through a competition mechanism such that positive activators did not bind to the chick cardiac actin and 4RTKCAT E-box regulatory elements. When in contact with the permissive E-box in the desmin promoter, the MRF4 activation domain acquired transcriptional competence. It is possible that early in development, when the relative levels of MRF4 are low, muscle genes later destined to be repressed are activated, such as cardiac actin. If MRF4 were overexpressed at this time, (subtle) muscle phenotypes might arise, for example a suppression of cardiac actin in skeletal muscle precursors. Reciprocally, the MRF4-null mouse would be expected to overexpress cardiac actin in adult skeletal muscle, since the relative levels of MRF4 had been reduced. Levels of cardiac actin have not been compared in wild type and MRF4-null adult muscle. Continued examination of the expression of cardiac actin and other embryonic isoforms in MRF4-null neonates should lend insight into repression by MRF4. INTRODUCTIONVertebrate cardiac and skeletal α-actin gene expression is distributed in distinct muscle-specific patterns during development. In birds and small mammals, the ratios of cardiac to skeletal α-actin mRNA and protein gradually decrease from 80% in embryonic skeletal muscle to 50% in the neonate and finally to about 5% in the adult limb (1Vandekerckhove J. Bugaisky G. Buckingham M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1838-1843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cardiac α-actin can be considered an embryonic skeletal muscle isoform that is down-regulated during skeletal muscle maturation while retaining high level expression in the heart. This switch in striated actin isoforms is mediated during development by control regions present in transcriptional regulatory sequences (2Cox R.D. Buckingham M.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When linked to a β-galactosidase reporter, the proximal promoter of the mouse cardiac actin gene produces low level but specific in vivo expression that mimics the developmental down-regulation of the endogenous cardiac actin gene (3Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).E-boxes (DNA consensus sequence CANNTG) are found in the regulatory regions of many genes including those expressed only in muscle. For example, the avian cardiac actin promoter depends upon an intact E-box for expression in primary embryonic skeletal muscle cultures (4Moss J.B. McQuinn T.C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12731-12740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The skeletal muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixMRFmyogenic regulatory factorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseSRFserum response factorSREserum response elementEMSVMurine sarcoma virus promoter CAT expression vector. factors MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 can bind and activate E-boxes both in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 5Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). These four myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) share extensive homology within the bHLH motif that mediates DNA binding and heterodimerization with ubiquitously expressed bHLH proteins such as E12/E47, E2-2, and HEB (6Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation relies upon protein-DNA contacts made by two residues in the conserved basic region, creating a permissive protein conformation (7Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The core DNA-protein complex is modulated by non-homologous transcriptional activation domains, which confer upon each factor distinct functional abilities (8Weintraub H. Dwarki V.J. Verma I. Davis R. Hollenberg S. Snider L. Lassar A. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Schwarz J.J. Chakraborty T. Martin J. Zhou J. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

Bober E. Arnold H.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MRF4 and MyoD contain N-terminal activation domains, yet MRF4 fails to induce the expression of many muscle-specific genes despite its ability to bind E-box sequences. The differential activities of MRFs may be one of the mechanisms whereby diverse myogenic phenotypes are achieved.The developmental expression of a MRF has often been correlated with that of its target gene.

Three different MRF4-negative mouse lines with skeletal rib defects of varying severity appear to reflect alterations in expression of Myf5 that is linked to MRF4 (15Olson E.N. Arnold H.H.

https://openalex.org/W2120345805,"We investigated the effects of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) on the transcriptional activity of the porcine P-45011A (P450scc) insulin-like growth factor response element (IGFRE). TNFα inhibited insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-stimulated P450scc mRNA concentrations in cultures of porcine granulosa cells. Transient transfection experiments in granulosa cells with deletion P450scc/luciferase constructs showed that TNFα inhibited the transcriptional activity of the IGFRE. IGF-I binding and IGF-I receptor mRNA concentrations in porcine granulosa cells were not inhibited by TNFα. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear extract protein from porcine granulosa cells treated with IGF-I and TNFα showed that Sp1 and a second transcription factor, P2, bound to the IGFRE. While IGF-I treatment increased the binding activity of both factors, TNFα specifically inhibited the IGF-I-stimulated binding activity of P2. Transient transfection studies done in mouse fibroblasts overexpressing the IGF-I receptor (NWTb3) with the porcine IGFRE (three repeats) in an SV40/luciferase construct also showed TNFα inhibited IGF-I-stimulated reporter gene expression. We conclude that TNFα inhibits the transcriptional activity of the porcine P450scc IGFRE by preventing IGF-I-stimulated binding of P2.

Studies indicate TNFα may be a key mediator in regression of the corpus luteum (CL) (1Adashi E.Y. Resnick C.E. Packman J.N. Hurwitz A. Payne D.W. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1990; 162: 889-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the porcine ovary, specific, high affinity TNFα receptors exist on granulosa and small luteal cells (2Veldhuis J.D. Garmey J.C. Urban R.J. Demers L.M. Aggarwal B.B. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Richards R.G. Almond G.W. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). TNFα inhibits insulin-stimulated mRNA concentrations of P-450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P45011A (P450scc) in porcine granulosa cells (2Veldhuis J.D. Garmey J.C. Urban R.J. Demers L.M. Aggarwal B.B. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a growth factor that also regulates steroidogenesis in the ovary. In porcine granulosa cells, IGF-I increases P450scc mRNA concentrations (4Urban R.J. Garmey J.C. Shupnik M.A. Veldhuis J.D. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2481-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Isolation of the porcine P450scc gene and transient transfection studies in porcine granulosa cells identified a 30-base pair IGF-responsive region (IGFRE) in the gene (5Urban R.J. Shupnik M.A. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25761-25769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The porcine P450scc IGFRE is a GC-rich domain that binds Sp1 and another transcription factor, P2 (6Urban R.J. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31695-31698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).This study determined that TNFα inhibits the function of the porcine P450scc IGFRE in porcine granulosa by preventing IGF-I-stimulated binding of P2. This finding presents a mechanism whereby TNFα can induce luteolysis by inhibiting IGF-I-supported steroidogenesis in the CL. Moreover, it establishes P2 as the transcription factor mediating the IGF-I response.DISCUSSIONThis study found that TNFα inhibited IGF-I-stimulated P450scc mRNA concentrations and progesterone production in porcine granulosa cells by suppressing the transcriptional activity of the porcine P450scc IGFRE. This inhibition was caused by a reduction in the IGF-I-stimulated binding of the transcription factor designated P2. We showed in a previous study (6Urban R.J. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31695-31698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that the binding of both Sp1 and P2 in MCF-7 cells was necessary for transcriptional activity of the porcine IGFRE. These results extend this finding by showing that the binding of P2 mediates the cell-specific effects of TNFα on the porcine IGFRE.From the results of this study and the previous study in MCF-7 cells (6Urban R.J. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31695-31698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we can develop the mechanism of how the porcine IGFRE is able to stimulate gene expression. The IGFRE requires the binding of Sp1 for basal function of the element. However, while necessary, this binding is not specific. This is evident from the EMSA results during treatment with TNFα and IGF-I. Despite a reduction in P450scc gene expression (decreased mRNA concentrations), the binding of Sp1 to the IGFRE was increased over the binding that occurred with IGF-I treatment alone. It is the binding of P2 to the IGFRE that correlates with gene expression of the IGFRE. Therefore, P2 is mediating the cell-specific actions of IGF-I on gene expression.The increase in the binding activity of Sp1 and P2 to the porcine P450scc IGFRE during IGF-I treatment is consistent with results found in MCF-7 cells (6Urban R.J. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31695-31698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, these findings in porcine granulosa cells were not found using EMSA in a previous study by our group (5Urban R.J. Shupnik M.A. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25761-25769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the previous study, the EMSA was done using a 7% polyacrylamide gel and samon sperm as carrier DNA (5Urban R.J. Shupnik M.A. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25761-25769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current method (4% polyacrylamide gel and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)poly(dC-dI)) results in DNA-protein complexes that can be supershifted with an Sp1 antibody (this could not be done with the 7% gel). Therefore, the refinement in methods is the most likely explanation for the differences in our findings.We were also unable to completely supershift the upper band with the Sp1 antibody. This is similar to our findings in MCF-7 nuclear extract protein (6Urban R.J. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31695-31698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but the remaining band is more evident in porcine granulosa cells. This may be because a human antibody is being used in porcine cells. A mutant oligonucleotide to the IGFRE that binds only P2 showed no binding of the upper band (6Urban R.J. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31695-31698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The transfection experiments done in mouse fibroblasts are significant because they show that the findings in porcine granulosa cells can be reproduced in a different cell. This is made even more significant in that with the mouse fibroblast cell lines, a control plasmid can be co-transfected and used to normalize results. Porcine granulosa cells transfection results (due to a lack of expression of most viral promoters) were normalized with protein concentrations.Another significant finding in this study was the TNFα signaling pathway interacting with the IGF-I pathway in porcine granulosa cells. There is evidence in other cells of interactions between the pathways. TNFα inhibits IGF-I-stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage from hypophysectomize rats (18Lazarus D.D. Moldawer L.L. Lowry S.F. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 219-223PubMed Google Scholar). In human obesity, TNFα expression from adipose tissue can be correlated with the level of hyperinsulinemia (19Hotamisligil G.S. Arner A. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). Studies indicate that TNFα inhibits insulin receptor signaling by causing a modified form of IRS-1 that suppresses rather than enhances the signaling pathway (20Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). However, other studies have indicated that TNFα modulates insulin receptor signaling by protein-tyrosine phosphatase activation (21Kroder G. Bossenmaier B. Kellerer M. Capp E. Stoyanov B. Mühlhöfer A. Berti L. Horikoshi H. Ullrich A. Häring H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Mutations to the IGF-I receptor show that the initial mechanisms of activation of the insulin and IGF-I receptor are almost identical (22Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of TNFα inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated transcriptional activity of the porcine IGFRE may further our understanding of obesity and insulin resistance.These findings in porcine granulosa cells must also be viewed from their physiologic significance regarding corpus luteum function. Corpus luteum that are regressing have an increase in resident ovarian macrophages and TNFα concentrations (23Adashi E.Y. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 454-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The site of synthesis of TNFα in the CL has not been absolutely determined, but, in addition to resident macrophages, the endothelial cells of the CL have been implicated as a source of TNFα (24Hehnke-Vagnoni K.E. Clark C.L. Taylor M.J. Ford S.P. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the bovine, an increase in intraluteal TNFα is related to luteolysis and the peak activity of luteal TNFα occurs before the decline in progesterone production (25Shaw D.W. Britt J.H. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). IGF-I is also important in the regulation of CL function. The porcine CL expresses mRNA concentrations for IGF-I and IGF-binding proteins (26Gadsby J.E. Lovdal J.A. Samaras S. Barber J.S. Hammond J.M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In women, elevated concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) occur in luteinizing follicles, further suggesting the importance of the IGF-I autocrine/paracrine system in regulation of CL function (27Van Dessel H.J.H.M.T. Chandrasekher Y. Yap O.W.S. Lee P.D.K. Hintz R.L. Faessen G.H.J. Brat D.D.M. Fauser B.C.J.M. Giudice L.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study presents a plausible mechanism for the interaction of TNFα and IGF-I on CL function. These experiments were done in granulosa cells, so these results must be extrapolated to the small luteal cell. Increasing concentrations of TNFα from either machrophages or epithelial cells in CL would inhibit IGF-I-supported progesterone production. This inhibition of steroidogenesis would be the initial step in the regression of the CL.In summary, this study shows that TNFα inhibits the transcriptional activity of the porcine P450scc IGFRE in porcine granulosa and mouse fibroblasts cells. This finding supports a plausible mechanism for TNFα induction of CL luteolysis and further defines P2 as the transcription factor that mediates IGF-I-stimulated gene expression.

Studies indicate TNFα may be a key mediator in regression of the corpus luteum (CL) (1Adashi E.Y. Resnick C.E. Packman J.N. Hurwitz A. Payne D.W. Am. J. Obstet.

In the porcine ovary, specific, high affinity TNFα receptors exist on granulosa and small luteal cells (2Veldhuis J.D. Garmey J.C. Urban R.J. Demers L.M. Aggarwal B.B.

TNFα inhibits insulin-stimulated mRNA concentrations of P-450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P45011A (P450scc) in porcine granulosa cells (2Veldhuis J.D. Garmey J.C. Urban R.J. Demers L.M. Aggarwal B.B. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a growth factor that also regulates steroidogenesis in the ovary. In porcine granulosa cells, IGF-I increases P450scc mRNA concentrations (4Urban R.J. Garmey J.C. Shupnik M.A. Veldhuis J.D. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2481-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Isolation of the porcine P450scc gene and transient transfection studies in porcine granulosa cells identified a 30-base pair IGF-responsive region (IGFRE) in the gene (5Urban R.J. Shupnik M.A. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25761-25769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The porcine P450scc IGFRE is a GC-rich domain that binds Sp1 and another transcription factor, P2 (6Urban R.J. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31695-31698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).This study determined that TNFα inhibits the function of the porcine P450scc IGFRE in porcine granulosa by preventing IGF-I-stimulated binding of P2. This finding presents a mechanism whereby TNFα can induce luteolysis by inhibiting IGF-I-supported steroidogenesis in the CL. Moreover, it establishes P2 as the transcription factor mediating the IGF-I response.

This study determined that TNFα inhibits the function of the porcine P450scc IGFRE in porcine granulosa by preventing IGF-I-stimulated binding of P2. This finding presents a mechanism whereby TNFα can induce luteolysis by inhibiting IGF-I-supported steroidogenesis in the CL. Moreover, it establishes P2 as the transcription factor mediating the IGF-I response. DISCUSSIONThis study found that TNFα inhibited IGF-I-stimulated P450scc mRNA concentrations and progesterone production in porcine granulosa cells by suppressing the transcriptional activity of the porcine P450scc IGFRE. This inhibition was caused by a reduction in the IGF-I-stimulated binding of the transcription factor designated P2. We showed in a previous study (6Urban R.J. Bodenburg Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31695-31698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that the binding of both Sp1 and P2 in MCF-7 cells was necessary for transcriptional activity of the porcine IGFRE. These results extend this finding by showing that the binding of P2 mediates the cell-specific effects of TNFα on the porcine IGFRE.From the results of this study and the previous study in MCF-7 cells (6Urban R.J.

Chandrasekher Y. Yap O.W.S. Lee P.D.K. Hintz R.L. Faessen G.H.J. Brat D.D.M. Fauser B.C.J.M. Giudice L.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study presents a plausible mechanism for the interaction of TNFα and IGF-I on CL function. These experiments were done in granulosa cells, so these results must be extrapolated to the small luteal cell. Increasing concentrations of TNFα from either machrophages or epithelial cells in CL would inhibit IGF-I-supported progesterone production. This inhibition of steroidogenesis would be the initial step in the regression of the CL. In summary, this study shows that TNFα inhibits the transcriptional activity of the porcine P450scc IGFRE in porcine granulosa and mouse fibroblasts cells. This finding supports a plausible mechanism for TNFα induction of CL luteolysis and further defines P2 as the transcription factor that mediates IGF-I-stimulated gene expression. We thank Cathy Yeargan for performing the progesterone assay."
https://openalex.org/W1523094853,"Cytophilia is one of the biologic properties of the Fc region of immunoglobulins operationally defined as the ability of an antibody molecule to attach to certain cell types before combination with antigen. By attachment of cytophilic antibody to membrane Fc receptors, cells become ""armed"" with antibodies and able to interact specifically with soluble or particulate antigens. In contrast to this cytophilia, the so-called opsonic antibody binds to FcR of various cell types only after it has complexed with antigen. In spite of knowledge of cytophilic properties of immunoglobulins for more than 30 years and an impressive accumulation of facts regarding the structure and function of cell-surface FcR binding IgG, IgE, or IgA molecules, less progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of cytophilia. Our extensive studies of the structural and functional aspects of the interaction of IgG in monomeric form with human natural killer cells, via the type IIIA IgG Fc receptor (Fc gamma RIIIA), provide a focal point for revisiting this major pathway of direct and continuous communication between the humoral and cellular compartments of the immune system."
