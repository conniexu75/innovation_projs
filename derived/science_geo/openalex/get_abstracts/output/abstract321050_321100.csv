https://openalex.org/W1987653347,"A new polymorph of cesium, existing over the narrow pressure range from about 42.2 to 42.7 kilobars at room temperature, has been discovered. Its crystal structure is face-centered-cubic with a = 5.800 +/- 0.007 A at 42.5 kb and 27 degrees C. Cesium-II, which exists over the pressure range 23.7 to 42.2 kb, is also face-centered-cubic with a = 5.984 +/- 0.011 A at 41 kb and 27 degrees C. An improved resistance-pressure curve and x-ray compressibility measurements for Cs are also given."

The presence of large amounts of sym-triazine derivatives is of particular interest, because these compounds have no known biochemical significance."
https://openalex.org/W2000234576,"In the article Man9s first encounters with metallurgy by T. A. Wertime (4 Dec., p. 1257) the interpretation of the kinds of shading used in Table 1 was printed in reverse order. The correct order. is (i) Bronze. (ii) Smelting and closed mold casting of copper from ores. (iii) Melting and open mold casting of native copper. (iv) Hammering and annealing of native copper. The shading itself is correct. In Table 3, Tell Asmar was erroneously noted as being in Iran; it is located in Iraq."
https://openalex.org/W1993974228,"Strength-promoting intercrystalline links in polyethylene, crystallized from the melt, have been observed under the electron microscope. The links measure up to many thousands of angstroms in length (depending upon the molecular weight of the polymer) and are of the order of 100 A in diameter. Their formation appears to be initiated by molecular chains which contact, and begin to crystallize upon, the surfaces of two or more different crystals, often some distance apart. Deposition continues until these molecular bridges are pulled taut. More molecules are laid down upon the bridges to build up the larger links, which are themselves crystalline and may well be extended-chain single crystals."

Correlations between initial respiration rates and growth rates of seedlings were found in diferent lots of seeds."
https://openalex.org/W2044910359,"When kept at constant temperature and subjected to a daily cycle of light and darkness, males of Paraponera clavata, Iridomyrmex humilis, Solenopsis saevissima, Veromessor andrei, and Camponotus clarithorax were active at different hours. With Solenopsis and Veromessor the active hours relative to the laboratory dawn corresponded with the hours of mating flight in the field. In four of the five species the rise preceding maximum activity began before change to light or to darkness. This endogenous behavior, widespread in males, is of interest because timing in the worker caste has been questioned."

https://openalex.org/W2051853391,"The method of isotope dilution for determining the exchangeable mass of different substances in living organisms is, at best, approximate. A formally exact method, defining the otherwise vague concept of exchangeable mass, is proposed. The new method may serve as a standard for determining errors in results obtained by the earlier method."

 in a discussion at Brown University, he reflected on the nature of knowledge, research, and teaching, and urged that things
 be lived, not merely learned. Teaching, he said, must balance details and generalizations, but also be balanced with general
 human values."
https://openalex.org/W2064518812,"Rapid determinations of titanium dioxide have been made by x-ray emission techniques to evaluate the potentiality of using the TiO(2) content of samples for checking field correlations and assisting in identification of pyroclastic units from Cascade volcanoes. Preliminary data suggest that the two most wide-spread units have characteristic ranges of TiO(2) content and that other, less extensive layers have ranges which, though characteristic, often overlap the ranges of the more widespread layers. Relative to fresh samples,. weathered samples from B and C soil horizons are enriched in TiO(2)."
https://openalex.org/W2054506253,"The tensions developed in the internal evaporating leaf surfaces were estimated for a desert halophyte, Reaumuria hirtella, growing in its natural habitat. The method was based on the assumption that at zero transpiration the vapor pressure of the inner parts of the leaf was in equilibrium with that of the atmosphere, provided that stomatal resistance was constant during the measuring period. This could be ensured, since the measuring system controlled both the concentration of carbon dioxide and the atmospheric humidity, while measuring photosynthesis and transpiration simultaneously. Tension values of 180, 240, and 320 bars were recorded for three different Reaumuria hirtella plants."
https://openalex.org/W2061672897,"Observations of the optical properties and electrical conductivity of silver iodide at pressures between 2 and 4 kilobars are indicative of the formation of free silver (or silver and iodine) in this pressure range. On the basis of the sequence of events and the volume relations, this reaction could account for the smooth and reversible phase transformations of silver iodide in this pressure range. The phenomenon may be due to the trapping of an electron by the silver ion (in a thermally excited state) as a result of the distortion of the lattice under pressure."

https://openalex.org/W2077444153,"If we had no eyes we should still know of the sun by the feeling of warmth. The intensity of solar rays in any part of the spectrum can be measured by delicate thermometry. Vision and photography are both restricted within comparatively narrow limits of wavelength, and each differs in its sensitiveness from wave-length to wave-length. Ultra-violet, visible and invisible red rays, however, all produce their just and proportional influences on the bolometer, or thermopile. This is not universally known, and there are still many who suppose we should distinguish between so-called actinic, visible and heat rays. Doubt has been expressed, for instance, whether bolometric measurements give true indications of the intensity of those rays which promote plant growth. Such doubts are not justified, and we may expect very valuable results in the future from the application of the spectro-bolometer to the interesting questions of radiation and plant physiology. We use heat units to express the intensity of solar radiation. The solar constant of radiation may be defined closely enough as the number of degrees by which one gram of water at 150 centigrade would be raised, if there should be used to heat it all the solar radiation which would pass at right angles in one minute through an opening one centimeter square, located in free space, at the earth's mean solar distance. Experiments were begun about T835 by Pouillet and by Sir John Herschel for the measurement of this great constant of nature. The investigation has been continued by Forbes, Crova, Violle, Radau, Langley, K. Angstrom, Chwolson, W. A. Michelson, Rizzo, Hansky, Scheiner and others. It is an indication of the great difficulty of the research that entire uncer-"
https://openalex.org/W2100484348,The rare and problematic Ordovician molluscan genus Babinka is a probable evolutionary link between the bivalve superfamily Lucinacea and some monoplacophora-like ancestral mollusc. Babinka provides the first direct evidence of a transition between the class Bivalvia and more primitive molluscan ancestors.

Dissolution of such dendrites as well as their growth can be reliably controlled. This principle may be used in the design of components for adaptive electronic systems.
