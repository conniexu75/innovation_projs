https://openalex.org/W2101117598,"Mitochondria are complex organelles whose dysfunction underlies a broad spectrum of human diseases. Identifying all of the proteins resident in this organelle and understanding how they integrate into pathways represent major challenges in cell biology. Toward this goal, we performed mass spectrometry, GFP tagging, and machine learning to create a mitochondrial compendium of 1098 genes and their protein expression across 14 mouse tissues. We link poorly characterized proteins in this inventory to known mitochondrial pathways by virtue of shared evolutionary history. Using this approach, we predict 19 proteins to be important for the function of complex I (CI) of the electron transport chain. We validate a subset of these predictions using RNAi, including C8orf38, which we further show harbors an inherited mutation in a lethal, infantile CI deficiency. Our results have important implications for understanding CI function and pathogenesis and, more generally, illustrate how our compendium can serve as a foundation for systematic investigations of mitochondria.

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles essential for cellular life, death, and differentiation. Although they are best known for ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), they house myriad other biochemical pathways and are centers for apoptosis and ion homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction causes over 50 diseases ranging from neonatal fatalities to adult-onset neurodegeneration and is a likely contributor to cancer and type II diabetes (DiMauro and Schon, 2003DiMauro S.

The 13 proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome have been known since its sequencing (Anderson et al., 1981Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C.

However, there may be as many as 1500 nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (Lopez et al., 2000Lopez M.F. Kristal B.S. Chernokalskaya E. Lazarev A. Shestopalov A.I. Bogdanova A. Robinson M.

A complete protein inventory for this organelle across tissues would provide a molecular framework for the investigation of mitochondrial biology and pathogenesis. Recent progress in defining the mitochondrial proteome has been driven by large-scale approaches, including mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics in mammals (Forner et al., 2006Forner F.

However, each of these methods suffers from intrinsic technical limitations. MS-based approaches struggle with distinguishing genuine mitochondrial proteins from copurifying contaminants, and published reports exhibit up to 41% false-positive rates (Table S1 available online). Additionally, these approaches tend to miss low-abundance proteins or those expressed only in specific tissues or developmental states, and thus capture only 23%–40% of known mitochondrial components (Table S1). Other experimental approaches such as epitope tagging are limited by the availability of cDNA clones, tag interference, and overexpression artifacts. Although integrative machine-learning methods can be more comprehensive (Calvo et al., 2006Calvo S. Jain M. Xie X. Sheth S.A. Chang B. Goldberger O.A. Spinazzola A. Zeviani M. Carr S.A. Mootha V.K.

A Bayesian networks approach for predicting protein-protein interactions from genomic data.Science. 2003; 302: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), they require subsequent experimental validation. Here, we perform in-depth protein mass spectrometry, microscopy, and machine learning to construct a protein compendium of the mitochondrion. We perform MS-based proteomics on both highly purified and crude mitochondrial preparations to discover genuine mitochondrial proteins and distinguish them from contaminants on the basis of enrichment. We integrate these MS data with six other genome-scale datasets of mitochondrial localization using a Bayesian framework and additionally perform the most extensive GFP tagging study focused on mammalian mitochondria. The resulting compendium consists of 1098 genes (Figure 1) and their protein expression across 14 mouse tissues. Although not complete, this represents the most comprehensive and accurate molecular characterization of the organelle to date. Our compendium provides a framework for identifying novel proteins within pathways resident in the mitochondrion. Here, we focus on complex I (CI) of the electron transport chain, a macromolecular structure composed of ∼45 subunits in mammals (Carroll et al., 2006Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Bovine complex I is a complex of 45 different subunits.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32724-32727Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). CI deficiency is the most common cause of rare, respiratory chain diseases (DiMauro and Schon, 2003DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Mitochondrial respiratory-chain diseases.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2656-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (Schapira, 2008Schapira A.H. Mitochondria in the aetiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.Lancet Neurol. 2008; 7: 97-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Half of the patients with CI deficiency lack mutations in any known CI subunit, suggesting that yet unidentified genes crucial for maturation, assembly, or stability of CI are mutated in the remaining cases (Janssen et al., 2006Janssen R.J. Nijtmans L.G. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J.A. Mitochondrial complex I: Structure, function and pathology.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2006; 29: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Multiple assembly factors for much smaller complexes IV and V have been identified in S. cerevisiae, and it is estimated that complex IV alone requires over 20 factors (Devenish et al., 2000Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Insights into ATP synthase assembly and function through the molecular genetic manipulation of subunits of the yeast mitochondrial enzyme complex.Biochim. Biophys.

Assembly of mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase, a complicated and highly regulated cellular process.Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1129-C1147Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the absence of CI in S. cerevisiae has impeded similar studies and, to date, only three CI assembly and maturation factors have been identified (Ogilvie et al., 2005Ogilvie I. Kennaway N.G.

Smeitink J.A. et al.Human mitochondrial complex I assembly is mediated by NDUFAF1.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5317-5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To systematically discover proteins essential for CI function, we apply the technique of phylogenetic profiling which uses shared evolutionary history to highlight functionally related proteins (Pellegrini et al., 1999Pellegrini M. Marcotte E.M. Thompson M.J. Eisenberg D. Yeates T.O. Assigning protein functions by comparative genome analysis: Protein phylogenetic profiles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 4285-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). This approach was recently used to identify the CI assembly factor NDUFA12L using five yeast species (Ogilvie et al., 2005Ogilvie I. Kennaway N.G. Shoubridge E.A. A molecular chaperone for mitochondrial complex I assembly is mutated in a progressive encephalopathy.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2784-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We apply this approach more broadly to our mitochondrial protein inventory and report that 19 of these proteins share ancestry with a large subset of CI proteins. We validate several of these predictions in cellular models and additionally report that one of these genes, C8orf38, harbors a causative mutation in an inherited CI deficiency. Together, these studies illustrate the utility of an expanded mitochondrial inventory in advancing basic and disease biology of the organelle. Our compendium, called MitoCarta, is freely available at http://www.broad.mit.edu/publications/MitoCarta/. As a first step toward establishing an experimentally supported inventory of mammalian mitochondrial proteins, we performed protein mass spectrometry on mitochondria from 14 diverse mouse organs (Figure 1). We designed our proteomic experiments in two phases in order to identify as many mitochondrial proteins as possible while systematically flagging copurifying contaminants. In the discovery phase, we isolated highly purified mitochondria from cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, kidney, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, testis, and placenta obtained from healthy C57BL/6 mice. Mitochondrial purity was assessed by western blots against selected mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial proteins, and intactness was verified by polarographic studies (data not shown) and electron microscopy (Figure 2A, Figure S1). Each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and then sectioned into 20 bands that were each analyzed by high-performance, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an LTQ Orbitrap Hybrid MS system. We captured 4.7 million tandem mass spectra and searched them against the mouse RefSeq protein database using stringent matching criteria, resulting in the confident identification of products from 3881 genes (Table S2). The detected proteins are not biased by molecular weight, isoelectric point, or presence of transmembrane helices but do show a slight bias against proteins whose transcripts exhibit low abundance (Figure S2). We estimate that we identify 85% of proteins within each sample (on the basis of technical liver replicates), but we saturate detection of distinct proteins by sampling many tissues (Figure 2B). In total, we identify 88% of previously known mitochondrial proteins, including 93% of OXPHOS proteins. In the subtractive proteomics phase, we applied in-solution LC-MS/MS on both crude and purified mitochondria from ten of the above tissues. This approach is based on the observation that bona fide mitochondrial proteins should become enriched during the purification process, and likewise contaminants should become depleted (e.g., the loss of ER protein calreticulin in Figure 2A). This subtractive method is similar in concept to protein correlation profiling (Foster et al., 2006Foster L.J. de Hoog C.L. Zhang Y. Zhang Y. Xie X. Mootha V.K. Mann M. A mammalian organelle map by protein correlation profiling.Cell. 2006; 125: 187-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Of the 2565 gene products detected in either crude or pure samples, 1022 were more abundant in crude samples (crude enriched), 709 more abundant in purified samples (pure enriched), and the remainder inconclusive (see the Experimental Procedures). The crude-enriched set contained many plasma membrane and extracellular proteins (likely as precursors in the ER), whereas the pure-enriched set was almost exclusively mitochondrial, validating that the subtractive proteomics approach can aid in distinguishing genuine mitochondrial proteins from contaminants (Figure 2C). We next combined the data from the discovery and subtractive phases in order to assign a probability that each protein detected by discovery MS/MS was truly mitochondrial. To do so, we compiled training sets comprised of 591 known mitochondria genes (Tmito) and 2519 nonmitochondrial genes (T∼mito), listed in Table S3. To avoid circularity, our curated Tmito list excludes mitochondrial proteins characterized solely by prior proteomic studies. Using our training data, we calculated the likelihood ratio that each protein is genuinely mitochondrial on the basis of its discovery MS/MS protein abundance and its subtractive MS/MS enrichment (see the Experimental Procedures and Figure S3). As shown in Figure 2D, the likelihood ratio quantifies the confidence that a protein detected by MS/MS is truly mitochondrial. Our combination of discovery and subtractive proteomics is extremely powerful for the discovery of bona fide mitochondrial proteins, though this approach alone is not sufficiently sensitive or specific (Figure 3A). For example, these experiments miss proteins that are extremely low in abundance, lack tryptic peptides amenable to MS, or localize to mitochondria only under specific conditions. In order to approach a comprehensive mitochondrial inventory, we need to integrate these data with other available information. We therefore combined our MS/MS results with six complementary computational, homology-based, and experimental techniques to determine likelihood of mitochondrial localization (Figure 3A and the Experimental Procedures). Using the Maestro naive Bayes framework we developed previously (Calvo et al., 2006Calvo S. Jain M. Xie X. Sheth S.A. Chang B. Goldberger O.A. Spinazzola A. Zeviani M. Carr S.A. Mootha V.K. Systematic identification of human mitochondrial disease genes through integrative genomics.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), we used training data to convert each method's data values into log-likelihood scores of mitochondrial localization (Table S4). Since the seven methods are largely conditionally independent (Figure S4), we sum these individual log-likelihood scores into the combined Maestro score on the basis of an independent probability model. Using Maestro, we systematically rank all mouse genes by their likelihood of mitochondrial localization (Table S3). We can assess accuracy at each score by using a corrected false discovery rate statistic (cFDR), which accounts for the sizes of our training sets (see the Experimental Procedures). At a Maestro score threshold of 4.56, corresponding to 10% cFDR, there are 951 mitochondrial gene predictions including 498/591 known mitochondrial genes (84% sensitivity). This Bayesian integration avoids overfitting the training data, as shown through 10-fold crossvalidation (in rotation, training on 90% of the data and reserving 10% for testing) that achieves comparable 82% sensitivity at the same cFDR. As seen in Figure 3A, integration greatly increases prediction accuracy. We additionally undertook a large-scale microscopy study as a complementary experimental approach to confirm mitochondrial localization (Figure 1). We tested the human orthologs of our mouse predictions because of the availability of high-quality clones from the human hORFeome v3.1 collection (Lamesch et al., 2007Lamesch P. Li N. Milstein S. Fan C. Hao T. Szabo G. Hu Z. Venkatesan K. Bethel G. Martin P. et al.hORFeome v3.1: A resource of human open reading frames representing over 10,000 human genes.Genomics. 2007; 89: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We created C terminus GFP-fusion constructs and visualized subcellular localization in HeLa cells by fluorescence microscopy. This method showed clear mitochondrial localization of 12/21 positive controls and none of 18 negative controls, indicating that this technique is specific but has limited sensitivity. We then tested 470 genes that lacked prior experimental support of mitochondrial localization. These candidates were selected from an interim Maestro analysis and have an estimated 59% on the basis of our final Bayesian analysis. Of the 404 candidates successfully transfected, we identified 131 genes with clear mitochondrial localization (representatives shown in Figure 3B, with the complete set available at http://www.broad.mit.edu/publications/MitoCarta/). The success rate of this approach matches our estimated cFDR and sensitivity rates—thus validating our Bayesian integration. The 273 constructs without clear mitochondrial localization were less informative because it is possible that the GFP tag interfered with mitochondrial import, the wrong splice form was tested, or HeLa cells lacked necessary chaperones and/or modifiers. Combining our discovery and subtractive proteomics with computation, microscopy, and previous literature, we defined a high-confidence mitochondrial compendium of 1098 genes, termed MitoCarta (Figure 1). This inventory is estimated to be over 85% complete and contain ∼10% false positives (see the Supplemental Data). It contains 356 genes without previous mitochondrial annotation in the Gene Ontology (GO) or MitoP2 (Prokisch et al., 2006Prokisch H. Andreoli C. Ahting U. Heiss K. Ruepp A. Scharfe C. Meitinger T. MitoP2: The mitochondrial proteome database–now including mouse data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D705-D711Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) databases and distinguishes itself from other catalogs by providing strong experimental support for 87% of genes on the basis of mass spectrometry (70%), GFP studies (12%), and/or literature curation (54%). We conservatively estimate that at least 85 of the MitoCarta proteins are also resident in other cellular locations, on the basis of crossing MitoCarta with two organelle-based proteomic surveys shown in Table S5 (Foster et al., 2006Foster L.J. de Hoog C.L. Zhang Y. Zhang Y. Xie X. Mootha V.K. Mann M.

The MitoCarta collection includes some notable components and highlights important regulatory features for the organelle. For example, the inventory includes several kinases, phosphatases, RNA-binding proteins, and disease-related proteins (MMACHC, ATIC) not previously associated with the mitochondrion (Table S3B). Interestingly, as a collection, the MitoCarta genes have significantly shorter UTRs and coding regions and are more highly expressed than all mouse genes (Table S6). Their promoters tend to have CpG islands and lack TATA boxes, a feature shared with other “housekeeping” genes that may account for their higher expression (Carninci et al., 2006Carninci P. Sandelin A. Lenhard B. Katayama S. Shimokawa K. Ponjavic J. Semple C.A. Taylor M.S. Engstrom P.G. Frith M.C. et al.Genome-wide analysis of mammalian promoter architecture and evolution.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Additionally, MitoCarta promoters are enriched for the presence of eight conserved sequence motifs, including five known mitochondrial transcription factor binding sites and three newly described elements (Table S6). In addition to expanding the number of known mitochondrial proteins, our inventory provides the opportunity to assess differences in mitochondrial protein expression across tissues (Figure 4A). We assessed the relative abundance of each MitoCarta protein across our 14 tissues using MS total peak intensity (see the Experimental Procedures). This metric is highly reproducible across technical replicates (Figure S5) and correlates quite well with mRNA expression (see the Supplemental Data). However, because our atlas contains only a single replicate per tissue, we note two caveats: First, it cannot be used to assess statistically significant differences in abundance across tissues, and second, because of stochastic sampling, we estimate that we detect approximately 90% of proteins present in each tissue. We utilize this protein atlas to investigate the differences in mitochondrial pathways between tissues. We find that approximately one-third of MitoCarta genes are core mitochondrial components present across all sampled tissues, including most OXPHOS subunits and the TCA cycle (Figure 4B). However, most MitoCarta genes show some degree of tissue specificity (Figure 4A). Interestingly, these include much of the mitochondrial ribosome and half of the subunits of complex IV, several of which have previous verification of tissue-specific expression (Huttemann et al., 2003Huttemann M. Jaradat S. Grossman L.I. Cytochrome c oxidase of mammals contains a testes-specific isoform of subunit VIb–the counterpart to testes-specific cytochrome c?.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2003; 66: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Additionally, the enzymes of the ketogenesis and urea cycle pathways are expressed in a broader set of tissues than expected, including brain and placenta (Figure S6). Typically, we find that mitochondria express an average of ∼760 unique gene products per tissue (range 554–797, Figure 4C), with pairs of tissues typically sharing ∼75% of proteins (range 63%–88%). Moreover, using a cytochrome c ELISA, we estimate that mitochondrial quantity varies by a remarkable 30-fold among a panel of 19 tissues (Figure 4D). Together, these analyses reveal the tissue diversity of mitochondrial quantity and composition and demonstrate how our compendium can serve as a resource for future investigations into tissue-specific mitochondrial biology. The expanded mitochondrial compendium also provides an opportunity to discover novel components for pathways resident in the organelle. Nearly 300 genes—26% of our inventory—have no association with a GO biological process. To associate a subset of these with known pathways, we performed phylogenetic profiling, which uses shared evolutionary history to identify functionally related proteins (Pellegrini et al., 1999Pellegrini M. Marcotte E.M. Thompson M.J. Eisenberg D. Yeates T.O. Assigning protein functions by comparative genome analysis: Protein phylogenetic profiles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 4285-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). This approach is likely to be particularly applicable to the mitochondrion, given its unique evolutionary history of descending from a Rickettsia-like endosymbiont early in eukaryotic evolution (Andersson et al., 1998Andersson S.G. Zomorodipour A. Andersson J.O. Sicheritz-Ponten T. Alsmark U.C. Podowski R.M. Naslund A.K. Eriksson A.S. Winkler H.H. Kurland C.G. The genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii and the origin of mitochondria.Nature. 1998; 396: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). To explore the utility of phylogenetic profiling for mitochondria, we first identified homologs of mouse MitoCarta proteins in 500 fully sequenced species (Figure 5A, Table S7). We find that 75% of present-day mitochondrial components have clear bacterial ancestry (BlastP expect < 1e-3) and that 57% have bacterial best-bidirectional orthologs, which is more than 3-fold higher than that of all mouse proteins (Figure 5C). The phylogenetic profiles confirm that functionally related mitochondrial proteins tend to have similar evolutionary histories. For example, most proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism, the citric acid cycle, and folate metabolism have ancient origins (Figure 5B). Conversely, the mitochondrial protein import machinery and mitochondrial carriers are more recent innovations (Figure 5B). Thus, it may be possible to use shared evolutionary history to associate unannotated MitoCarta proteins with known pathways. We focused this strategy on identifying factors essential to respiratory chain complex I because of its prominent role in energy metabolism and disease. Currently, there are only three known assembly factors for this large, macromolecular complex, though clinical data suggest that there are many unidentified factors needed for its assembly and activity (Janssen et al., 2006Janssen R.J. Nijtmans L.G. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J.A. Mitochondrial complex I: Structure, function and pathology.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2006; 29: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These factors likely reside in the mitochondrion, and thus our MitoCarta compendium aids in prioritizing candidates. Additionally, the evolutionary history of CI across five yeast species has recently been proven useful in the identification of the assembly factor NDUFA12L, supporting this phylogenetic approach (Gabaldon et al., 2005Gabaldon T. Rainey D. Huynen M.A. Tracing the evolution of a large protein complex in the eukaryotes, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I).J. Mol.

A molecular chaperone for mitochondrial complex I assembly is mutated in a progressive encephalopathy.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2784-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In order to establish a broader phylogenetic profile for CI, we first built a rooted phylogenetic tree of 42 eukaryotes (Figure 6C, Experimental Procedures). This tree is robust to different phylogenetic reconstruction methods, except for some positioning uncertainty of three deep-branching protist species (see the Supplemental Data). We observed that a set of 15 CI proteins are not only absent from several yeast species but are ancestral bacterial subunits that have been independently lost at least four times in eukaryotic evolution (Figure 6A, Table S8). It is probable that the species that lost CI also lost the proteins required for its assembly and function. Only 19 other MitoCarta proteins share this profile and now represent strong candidates for functional association with CI (Figure 6B). These 19 MitoCarta proteins, termed Complex One Phylogenetic Profile (COPP), as well as an expanded set with weaker phylogenetic signatures, are listed in Table S8. The COPP set includes two well-studied proteins involved in branched-chain amino acid degradation (Ivd and Mccc2), and four proteins involved in lipid breakdown (Dci, Phyh, Amacr, and AF397014), which raises the intriguing hypothesis of an association between these pathways and complex I activity. We tested four of our COPP genes for an involvement in CI activity by creating stable knockdowns in human fibroblasts via lentiviral-mediated RNAi (Root et al., 2006Root D.E. Hacohen N. Hahn W.C. Lander E.S. Sabatini D.M. Genome-scale loss-of-function screening with a lentiviral RNAi library.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Given that we are interested in the clinical relevance of these predictions, we chose to test the human orthologs of our mouse candidates. We achieved at least 80% knockdown of three COPP genes and 50% knockdown of the fourth, as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 6E). We next assessed both CI abundance, using immunoblots against a CI subunit, and CI activity, using immunocapture-based activity assays (see the Experimental Procedures and Figure S7). Knockdown of C8orf38 showed the strongest reduction of both CI abundance and activity, comparable to the known CI assembly factor NDUFAF1 (Figures 6D–6F). These data strongly suggest that C8orf38, which previously had no prior association to any biological process or subcellular location, is crucial for activity and/or assembly of endogenous CI. The other three candidate knockdown lines showed 20%–40% reduction of CI activity (Figure 6F) with variable effects on CI abundance (Figure 6D). The moderate reduction of CI activity does not offer definitive evidence of association with CI; however, we note that the CI activity assay measures only the NADH dehydrogenase activity, which may still be largely intact even if other modules of CI are improperly assembled. Thus, we experimentally validate the importance of one COPP gene, show suggestive evidence for three other COPP genes, and prioritize more than one dozen additional proteins for future studies of complex I. The 19 MitoCarta COPP genes identified above represent strong candidates for genes underlying clinical CI deficiency. We used these candidates in combination with homozygosity mapping to search for a causative gene mutation in two siblings (female and male) with severe isolated CI deficiency, born to first-cousin Lebanese parents (Figure 7A). The siblings presented at 10 and 7 months, respectively, with focal right-hand seizures, decreased movement and strength, ataxia, and evolving rigidity. Both had persistent lactic acidosis, and neuroimaging was consistent with Leigh syndrome. The affected girl had isolated CI deficiency in muscle, liver, and fibroblasts with normal or elevated activities of other complexes and citrate synthase (Figure 7B). She died at 34 months of age from a cardiorespiratory arrest after admission to the hospital with pneumonia. The affected boy had an isolated CI defect confirmed in fibroblasts and is currently 22 months of age. Since the underlying molecular defect is likely a recessive mutation, we performed homozygosity mapping on DNA isolated from the five family members and identified eight chromosomal regions of homozygosity shared only by the affected siblings (Figure 7C and the Experimental Procedures). Collectively, these regions contain 857 genes, including four CI structural subunits and one COPP gene, C8orf38 (Figure 7C). Sequencing of two CI structural subunit genes showed no mutations; however, sequencing of C8orf38 (NM_152416) revealed a c.296A→G mutation in exon 2 that segregated with the disease in the family (Figure 7D). This mutation causes a predicted Gln99Arg substitution in a residue fully conserved across vertebrates and may also cause a splicing defect because of its position at the 3′ end of exon 2 (Figure 7D). This mutation was not present in EST databases, SNP databases, or in the 100 Lebanese chromosomes tested. The localization of C8orf38 to the mitochondrion, its RNAi phenotype of CI deficiency (Figure 6F), and the segregating C8orf38 mutation at a highly conserved residue together strongly establish that C8orf38 is a human CI disease gene. We have constructed a high-quality compendium of mitochondrial proteins, used comparative genomics to predict roles for unannotated proteins in CI biology, and validated these predictions with cellular models and human genetics. Our inventory of 1098 mitochondrial genes and their protein expression across 14 tissues represents the most comprehensive characterization of the organelle to date and provides a framework for addressing major questions in mitochondrial biology."

However, at the time of the “Modern Synthesis” of evolutionary theory that drew together various disciplines including genetics, paleontology, and systematics, very little could be said about the effects of genes on development, let alone on the evolution of form. Despite Huxley's acknowledgment, embryology and developmental genetics played no part in forging the Modern Synthesis (Gilbert et al., 1996Gilbert S.F. Opitz J.M. Raff R.A. Resynthesizing evolutionary and developmental biology.Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and little role in the fabric of evolutionary biology for many decades thereafter. The situation started to change twenty-five years ago with the discovery of the homeobox. This coding sequence was first identified in several loci involved in segment formation and identity in the fruit fly Drosophila (McGinnis et al., 1984McGinnis W. Garber R.L. Wirz J. Kuroiwa A.

These discoveries forced developmental geneticists to confront evolutionary concepts and evolutionary biologists to confront a new source of unforeseen and penetrating genetic insights into the generation and diversification of animal form. As the dust has settled on some of the earlier surprises, the brief history of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has begun to inspire some reflection on the contributions of this discipline to overall evolutionary theory. Not surprisingly, the opinions offered range from “evolution cannot be understood without understanding the evolution of development… A revolutionary synthesis of developmental biology and evolution is in progress” (Raff, 2000Raff R.A. Evo-devo: the evolution of a new discipline.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) to “Let's be honest: the much-hyped discipline of evolutionary developmental biology…hasn't quite lived up to expectations—at least, not if one were expecting a revolution in biology” (Richardson, 2003Richardson M. A naturalist's evo-devo.Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 351Crossref Google Scholar). Still others have drawn an analogy between current enthusiasm for ideas in evo-devo and the theory of punctuated equilibrium as a cautionary tale of an area of research that “has claimed to offer unique and revolutionary insights into the evolutionary process” but of which “little now remains” (Hoekstra and Coyne, 2007Hoekstra H.E. Coyne J.A. The locus of evolution: evo devo and the genetics of adaptation.Evolution Int. J. Org. Evolution. 2007; 61: 995-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). But do questions posed about evo-devo and evolutionary theory matter to anyone besides the specialists and a few future historians? I think the answers matter very much. By “theory” here, I mean “structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts” (from Gould, 1994Gould S.J. Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes. W.W. Norton & Company, New York1994Google Scholar). Without theories to organize and interpret facts, without the power of general explanations, we are left with just piles of case studies. Moreover, we are without the frameworks that enable us to make predictions about any particular case. Here, I will take the position that we have learned enough about the function, regulation, and history of the genes controlling animal development to formulate a general theory of how form evolves and to make predictions about the genetic path of morphological evolution—predictions that are now being fulfilled for a variety of traits and genes in diverse taxa. My goals in this article are three-fold. First, to review key principles, many from molecular developmental biology, that laid the foundation for a new understanding of the evolution of form. Second, to articulate a genetic theory of morphological evolution that has emerged from a large body of empirical studies. And third, to explain how evo-devo, by providing long-sought explanations of the causal links between gene mutation, development, and the evolution of form, has filled a major gap in and expanded upon the evolutionary synthesis. Before I delve into the specific findings from developmental genetics and evo-devo, it is important to establish some historical perspective through a brief exploration of the roots of some key ideas about the relationship between the evolution of molecules and form. The relationship between the evolution of molecules and morphology has been fertile ground for both controversy and major advances in evolutionary biology. On several occasions, evolutionary biologists have been surprised by molecular data that did not conform to expectations. In each case, wrestling with new data has led to new conceptual insights. The first instance was in the early 1960s when initial comparisons of globins and cytochromes from different species revealed that proteins changed over time but without any apparent effect on function. These observations did not fit the expectation that all evolutionary change was adaptive and led to the proposal that most mutations fixed between species were functionally neutral or nearly neutral and evolved by genetic drift. Emile Zuckerkandl, one of the pioneers of molecular evolutionary biology, reasoned that phenotypes could change by altering the timing or rate of protein synthesis (Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965Zuckerkandl E. Pauling L. Evolutionary divergence and convergence in proteins.in: Bryson V. Vogel H. Evolving Genes and Proteins. Academic Press, New York1965: 97-166Crossref Google Scholar). He also made the prescient suggestion that there may be an important mechanistic distinction between the evolution of organismal form, which he proposed may depend more on changes in DNA than on alterations in protein expression, and the evolution of function, which would result from physicochemical changes in proteins (Zuckerkandl, 1968Zuckerkandl E. Hemoglobins, Haeckel's “Biogenic Law,” and molecular aspects of development.in: Rich A. Davidson N. Structural chemistry and molecular biology. W.H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1968: 256-274Google Scholar). The second major surprise was the similarity of proteins from species that looked and behaved as differently as, for example, chimps and humans. Mary-Claire King and Allan Wilson underscored the apparent paradox that presented and the challenge “to explain how species which have such substantially similar genes can differ so substantially in anatomy…” (King and Wilson, 1975King M. Wilson A.C. Evolution at two levels in humans and chimpanzees.Science. 1975; 188: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). They, like Zuckerkandl and others (Britten and Davidson, 1971Britten R.J. Davidson E.H. Repetitive and non-repetitive DNA sequences and a speculation on the origins of evolutionary novelty.Q. Rev. Biol. 1971; 46: 111-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), suggested that the evolution of anatomy occurred more by changing gene regulation than by changing protein sequences. The testing of these proposals, however, had to wait for the genetic revolution in developmental biology and a series of discoveries that began to unfold in 1984, when evolutionary biologists were again confronted with molecular data that did not fit prior expectations—namely that the disparate body forms and structures of long-diverged members of the animal kingdom were governed by very similar sets of genes. To get a sense of the sea change brought about by these discoveries—a “before” picture as a prelude to the “after” picture that will constitute the rest of this article—revealing snapshots are provided by two book reviews that appeared back to back in the March 1984 issue of Cell (published just weeks before the first report of the homeobox). In his review of a new book on embryology, developmental biologist Gunther Stent noted the lack of general conclusions and ascribed the “turbid” state of embryology as a consequence of the history and complexity of the process (Stent, 1984Stent G.S. From probability to molecular biology.Cell. 1984; 36: 567-570Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). He wrote, “embryologists are confronted with an ensemble of unique phenomena…we cannot expect to discover a general theory of development, rather we are faced with a near infinitude of particulars, which have to be sorted out case by case.” Next came Peter Lawrence's review of a symposium volume from a meeting on “Development and Evolution” (Lawrence, 1984Lawrence P.A. Unpinioned opinions.Cell. 1984; 36: 570-571Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). His assessment was blunt: “To discuss usefully the interface between two subjects—like evolution and development—one depends on a deep understanding of both. Unfortunately our knowledge of these fields is poor and the result, in the book, is a great deal of pretentious twaddle…” Lawrence pointed out how participants were divided over the potential value, or lack thereof, of genetic approaches to development as well as the question of whether the genome contained a direct or explicit program for development. Many times over the next decade or so, generalities of animal development would be found among the particulars of Drosophila development in the form of shared regulatory genes. The question of the existence of a genomic program for development was quickly transformed into the pursuit of the components and logic of that program—the genetic regulatory networks that we now recognize to be the essence of animal development (Davidson, 2006Davidson E.H. The Regulatory Genome: Gene Regulatory Networks in Development and Evolution. Academic Press, Oxford2006Google Scholar). And, with respect to genetic mechanisms governing the evolution of anatomy, the issue turned logically to how components of these regulatory networks evolve. The collective impact of that pursuit has been to direct attention away from long-standing ideas about the necessity for gene duplication or protein evolution in the origins of novelty and toward changes in gene regulation, regulatory networks, and regulatory sequences as sources of morphological variation and diversity. Below, I will first focus on eight principles, derived from observations from molecular and evolutionary developmental biology, in order to explain why thinking progressed along these lines. These principles form part of the foundation of a genetic understanding of morphological evolution. Then, I will examine the direct evidence concerning the genetic and molecular basis of morphological divergence and describe a specific, predictive theory. Most proteins regulating development participate in multiple, independent developmental processes and the formation and patterning of morphologically disparate body structures. King and Wilson reached their seminal hypothesis by comparing the very similar genes of two different species. Here, I will illustrate one of the seminal insights from developmental genetics, and perhaps the most critical observations in terms of implications for the evolution of anatomy, by considering the identical genes of two different forms of the same species. Take, as an example, the larval and adult forms of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. They are more distinct in terms of morphology and ecology than the adult forms of any pair of sister species. Yet, we now know of hundreds of gene products that, although identical in sequence in the developing larval and adult forms, shape the development of these markedly different body morphologies. Probing a bit deeper into the development of individual structures, we know of many gene products that, although identical in different tissues or body parts, shape the distinct appearance of each part. For example, the Drosophila Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling protein shapes embryonic dorsoventral axis polarity, epidermal patterning, gut morphogenesis, and the patterning of wings, legs, and other appendages (Gelbart, 1989Gelbart W.M. The decapentaplegic gene: a TGF-beta homologue controlling pattern formation in Drosophila.Development. 1989; 107: 65-74PubMed Google Scholar). The same is true for most signaling proteins and transcription factors, components of the “genetic toolkit” that regulate animal development. For instance, the Sonic hedgehog protein shapes digit number and polarity, floor plate development, cerebellum development, feather bud formation, and other processes in chickens (McMahon et al., 2003McMahon A.P. Ingham P.W. Tabin C.J. Developmental roles and clinical significance of hedgehog signaling.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 53: 1-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each set of structures is obviously much more divergent within individual species than are the corresponding homologous structures of different species. Proteins that serve multiple roles are said to be pleiotropic (from the Greek meaning “many ways”). Most proteins that regulate development exhibit what is termed “mosaic pleiotropism” (Hadorn, 1961Hadorn E. Developmental Genetics and Lethal Factors. Methuen & Co Ltd, John Wiley & Sons, Inc, London1961Crossref Google Scholar) in that they function independently in different cell types, germ layers, body parts, and developmental stages. This extent of pleiotropism was a surprise as there was no particular reason to expect that the formation and patterning of such different structures would or could involve the same protein. However, once the mosaic pleiotropism of toolkit proteins is fully appreciated, important evolutionary implications clearly follow. First, because the exact same protein can shape the development of remarkably different body parts, one may infer that the same protein can therefore shape smaller differences in the anatomy of the same part between species. Second, mutations that alter the function or activity of such proteins are likely to have widespread and potentially many negative effects on development and fitness, and their coding sequences may thus be under considerable evolutionary constraints. The existence of these constraints has been borne out by decades of developmental genetic studies, but the remarkable degree of constraint was entirely unforeseen until revealed by comparative functional analyses (see points 2, 3, 4). Third, the use of the same gene in shaping many entirely different traits suggests that in the course of evolution, gene function somehow expanded without gene duplication. This inference, now well confirmed, is contrary to once prevailing ideas concerning the origin of new gene functions (see point 5). Furthermore, it raises the question of how the multifunctionality of these loci evolved. Tacit answers to that question also came from molecular developmental genetics (see points 7, 8). Morphologically disparate and long-diverged animal taxa share similar toolkits of body-building and body-patterning genes. The best known discoveries of evo-devo are those concerning the presence of homeobox-containing Hox genes and Hox gene clusters in flies, vertebrates, and most animal phyla. The similarities in animal genetic toolkits extend to a large number and wide variety of transcription factors and components of signaling pathways. The phylogenetic distribution of toolkit genes suggests that a fairly complete modern toolkit was in place in the last common ancestor of bilaterians, prior to the Cambrian period. Furthermore, various signaling pathways have also been found to be much better represented in early-branching animals than their anatomical complexity would suggest. For example, 11 of 12 Wnt gene families known from vertebrates are found in cnidarians (Kusserow et al., 2005Kusserow A. Pang K. Sturm C. Hrouda M. Lentfer J. Schmidt H.A. Technau U. van Haeseler A. Hobmayer B. Martindale M.Q. et al.Unexpected complexity of the Wnt gene family in a sea anemone.Nature. 2005; 433: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and six of the major bilaterian signaling pathways are represented in sponges (Nichols et al., 2006Nichols S.A. Dirks W. Pearse J.S. King N. Early evolution of animal cell signaling and adhesion genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12451-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The extensive sequence conservation in animal toolkit proteins indicates that considerable functional constraints have operated on many orthologous proteins for more than 500 million years of animal diversification. Many animal toolkit proteins, despite over 1 billion years of independent evolution in different lineages, often exhibit functionally equivalent activities in vivo when substituted for one another. These observations indicate that the biochemical properties of these proteins and their interactions with receptors, cofactors, etc. have diverged little over vast expanses of time. Even more striking than their sequence conservation, a wide variety of toolkit proteins are functionally equivalent when substituted for homologous proteins (orthologs and paralogs) in divergent taxa. This line of experimentation began with tests of vertebrate Hox proteins introduced into flies (Malicki et al., 1990Malicki J. Schughart K. McGinnis W. Mouse Hox-2.2 specifies thoracic segmental identity in Drosophila embryos and larvae.Cell. 1990; 63: 961-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, McGinnis et al., 1990McGinnis N. Kuziora M.A. McGinnis W. Human Hox-4.2 and Drosophila deformed encode similar regulatory specificities in Drosophila embryos and larvae.Cell. 1990; 63: 969-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best-known example is the ability of the mouse Pax-6 protein to induce ommatidium formation in Drosophila, just like the Drosophila Pax-6 (Eyeless) protein (Halder et al., 1995Halder G. Callaerts P. Gehring W.J. Induction of ectopic eyes by targeted expression of the eyeless gene in Drosophila.Science. 1995; 267: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Another striking example of functional equivalence is the ability of a cnidarian Achaete-Scute homolog (CnASH) to induce formation of sensory organs in Drosophila, just as the Drosophila homologs do (Grens et al., 1995Grens A. Mason E. Marsh J.L. Bode H.R. Evolutionary conservation of a cell fate specification gene: the Hydra achaete-scute homolog has proneural activity in Drosophila.Development. 1995; 121: 4027-4035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite over 1 billion years of independent evolution, the CnASH protein forms a heterodimer with the endogenous Drosophila binding partner Daughterless, and these dimers bind sequence specifically to sites in target gene-regulatory elements. What makes these results so surprising and notable is that the function of any transcription factor or ligand is dependent upon interaction with other endogenous proteins—transcription factors, coactivators, corepressors, and parts of the transcriptional machinery in the case of transcription factors, cell-surface receptors in the case of ligands. One might expect that genetic drift or the coadaptation of proteins within lineages would lead to functional incompatibilities among proteins from different taxa, especially those separated by over 1 billion years of independent evolution. Yet, many proteins are so conserved that they can interact and function together with other proteins from long-diverged taxa. These results have been more the rule than the exception for transcription factors (I will discuss informative exceptions later). Numerous studies of eukaryotic transcription demonstrate that the basic transcriptional machinery, many coactivators, corepressors, chromatin-remodeling complexes, and the protein motifs through which transcription factors interact with them, are often very well conserved. One situation where functional changes within transcription factors might be expected would be among paralogous proteins that have evolved by gene duplication and divergence. However, the functional equivalence of various sets of paralogs has also been well documented (for example, Fitzgerald et al., 1993Fitzgerald K. Wilkinson H.A. Greenwald I. glp-1 can substitute for lin-12 in specifying cell fate decisions in Caenorhabditis elegans.Development. 1993; 119: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Li and Noll, 1994Li X. Noll M. Evolution of distinct developmental functions of three Drosophila genes by acquisition of different cis-regulated regions.Nature. 1994; 367: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), although, as expected, there are some notable exceptions that I will also discuss later (Zhao and Potter, 2001Zhao Y. Potter S.S. Functional specificity of the Hoxa13 homobox.Development. 2001; 128: 3197-3207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Zhao and Potter, 2002Zhao Y. Potter S.S. Functional comparison of the Hoxa 4, Hoxa 10, and Hoxa 11 homeoboxes.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The formation and differentiation of many structures such as eyes, limbs, and hearts—so morphologically divergent among different phyla that they were long thought to have evolved completely independently—are governed by similar sets of genes and some deeply conserved genetic regulatory circuits. In addition to their functional equivalence, various toolkit proteins are involved in the development of morphologically disparate structures with similar functions. The association of the Pax-6 protein with eye development throughout the animal kingdom (Gehring and Ikeo, 1999Gehring W.J. Ikeo K. Pax 6: mastering eye morphogenesis and eye evolution.Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 371-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), of several transcription factors required for cardiac tissue development in flies, vertebrates, and other animals (Olson, 2006Olson E.N. Gene regulatory networks in the evolution and development of the heart.Science. 2006; 313: 1922-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), of Distal-less/Dlx protein expression in the development of a variety of animal appendages (Panganiban et al., 1997Panganiban G. Irvine S.M. Lowe C. Roehl H. Corley L.S. Sherbon B. Grenier J.K. Fallon J.F. Kimble J. Walker M. et al.The origin and evolution of animal appendages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5162-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and other examples have prompted reexamination of the concept of biological homology (Wagner, 2007Wagner G.P. The developmental genetics of homology.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The deployment of homologous transcription factors in similar roles reflects that some parts of genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) present in a common ancestor were conserved in descendant lineages. The existence of common regulatory inputs acting in a similar manner in the development of structures that are not directly related by common ancestry (that is, not homologous) has been referred to as “deep homology” (Shubin et al., 1997Shubin N. Tabin C.J. Carroll S.B. Fossils, genes and the evolution of animal limbs.Nature. 1997; 388: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Some highly conserved GRNs have been identified (Davidson, 2006Davidson E.H. The Regulatory Genome: Gene Regulatory Networks in Development and Evolution. Academic Press, Oxford2006Google Scholar). Because the different structures of long-diverged animals were thought to have arisen independently, the similar roles of orthologous toolkit proteins in their development has prompted reevaluation of their once-presumed independent origins. Duplications within several prominent toolkit gene families have been surprisingly rare in the course of animal diversification relative to duplications of other gene families. These observations indicate that gene duplication is not a necessary ingredient for morphological novelty, as once assumed, and there is evidence that duplications of some toolkit genes are actually selected against because of their effects on gene dosage-sensitive developmental processes. From the earliest days of molecular evolutionary biology, the roles for new genes in the origins of new functions has been a pervasive and widely accepted idea. Ohno, 1970Ohno S. Evolution by Gene Duplication. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1970Crossref Google Scholar claimed that gene redundancy was crucial to novelty and that “allelic mutations of already existing gene loci cannot account for major changes in evolution.” Kimura and Ohta, 1974Kimura M. Ohta T. On some principles governing molecular evolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1974; 71: 2848-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar agreed that “gene duplication must always precede the emergence of a gene having a new function.” The expectations were no different for the evolution of anatomy. In a classic article in developmental genetics, Lewis proposed that the increased segmental diversity of insects relative to arthropod ancestors was the result of an increase in the number of segment identity-determining Hox genes, including the evolution of a haltere-promoting gene to shape this distinctly dipteran trait (Lewis, 1978Lewis E.B. A gene complex controlling segmentation in Drosophila.Nature. 1978; 276: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar). This intuitive idea turned out, however, to be incorrect. The common ancestor of all arthropods actually had two more Hox genes than do certain modern insects, and the “haltere-promoting” Ultrabithorax gene predated the origin of halteres by more than 300 million years as well as the origin of the entire arthropod phylum (Grenier et al., 1997Grenier J.K. Garber T.L. Warren R. Whitington P.M. Carroll S.B. Evolution of the entire arthropod Hox gene set predated the origin and radiation of the onychophoran/arthropod clade.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 547-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). (A) Based upon the Hox gene complements of onychophora and arthropods, a minimum of ten Hox genes must have existed in the common ancestor of lobopodians and arthropods. No new Hox genes arose in centipedes or insects while the Hox3 and ftz genes were co-opted into new functions in certain insects (stippling). (B) No new Hox genes are known to have evolved since the divergence of tetrapods from a common sarcopterygian ancestor shared with coelacanths. Rather, gene loss has occurred in several lineages.

Here we characterize the second-generation 8-hydroxy quinoline analog PBT2, which also targets metal-induced aggregation of Aß, but is more effective as a Zn/Cu ionophore and has greater blood-brain barrier permeability. Given orally to two types of amyloid-bearing transgenic mouse models of AD, PBT2 outperformed CQ by markedly decreasing soluble interstitial brain Aß within hours and improving cognitive performance to exceed that of normal littermate controls within days. Nontransgenic mice were unaffected by PBT2. The current data demonstrate that ionophore activity, inhibition of in vitro metal-mediated Aß reactions, and blood-brain barrier permeability are indices that predict a potential disease-modifying drug for AD. The speed of recovery of the animals underscores the acutely reversible nature of the cognitive deficits associated with transgenic models of AD."

The physiological significance of the two forms of mRNAs encoding the same protein is unknown. Here, we show that the short and long 3' UTR BDNF mRNAs are involved in different cellular functions. The short 3' UTR mRNAs are restricted to somata, whereas the long 3' UTR mRNAs are also localized in dendrites. In a mouse mutant where the long 3' UTR is truncated, dendritic targeting of BDNF mRNAs is impaired. There is little BDNF in hippocampal dendrites despite normal levels of total BDNF protein. This mutant exhibits deficits in pruning and enlargement of dendritic spines, as well as selective impairment in long-term potentiation in dendrites, but not somata, of hippocampal neurons. These results provide insights into local and dendritic actions of BDNF and reveal a mechanism for differential regulation of subcellular functions of proteins."

We demonstrate here that cellular cholesterol levels in dividing T cells are maintained in part through reciprocal regulation of the LXR and SREBP transcriptional programs.

Ligation of LXR during T cell activation inhibits mitogen-driven expansion, whereas loss of LXRβ confers a proliferative advantage.

These results implicate LXR signaling in a metabolic checkpoint that modulates cell proliferation and immunity. The capacity of lymphocytes to undergo rapid expansion in response to antigenic challenge is essential for adaptive immunity. Mounting evidence suggests that metabolism plays a key role in the determination of lymphocyte responses. For example, activated T lymphocytes are functionally glycolytic despite sufficient oxygen tension (Fox et al., 2005Fox C.J. Hammerman P.S. Thompson C.B. Fuel feeds function: Energy metabolism and the T-cell response.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this metabolic program, T cell activation requires high glucose availability (Roos and Loos, 1973Roos D. Loos J.A.

In the absence of sufficient glucose, T cells fail to proliferate, and they undergo apoptosis (Alves et al., 2006Alves N.L. Derks I.A. Berk E. Spijker R. van Lier R.A. Eldering E.

The influence of cellular lipid metabolism on immune responses, however, is poorly understood. Cholesterol is an important component of cell membranes and has long been recognized to be necessary for cell growth and proliferation (Brown and Goldstein, 1974Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Early studies defined a relationship between the pathway for de novo sterol synthesis and movement through the cell cycle in lymphocytes. Blocking of mevalonate production with certain cholesterol derivatives or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) inhibits DNA synthesis and mitosis (Chakrabarti and Engleman, 1991Chakrabarti R.

A complicating factor in these studies, however, is the requirement for the mevalonate pathway in production of nonsterol mevalonate derivatives such as geranylgeraniol and farnesol. Indeed, much of the immunomodulatory effects of statins have been attributed to the biology of these products (Kwak et al., 2000Kwak B. Mulhaupt F. Myit S. Mach F.

The question of whether intracellular cholesterol distribution or availability represents a dynamic signal for control of immune responses has not been adequately explored, and the molecular mechanisms that link lipid metabolism to cellular growth and the cell-cycle machinery remain unknown. The liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulate cholesterol homeostasis. The endogenous activators of these receptors are oxysterols and intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (Janowski et al., 1996Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. An oxysterol signalling pathway mediated by the nuclear receptor LXR alpha.Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). The two LXR isotypes share considerable sequence homology and respond to the same ligands, but their tissue distribution differs markedly. LXRα is highly expressed in liver, adipose tissue, and macrophages, and LXRβ is expressed ubiquitously (Repa and Mangelsdorf, 2000Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. The role of orphan nuclear receptors in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Many LXR target genes are involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, such as ABCA1, ABCG1, SREBP-1c, and fatty acid synthase (Tontonoz and Mangelsdorf, 2003Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Liver X receptor signaling pathways in cardiovascular disease.Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Other targets, such as AIM/SPα, are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and innate immune responses (Joseph et al., 2004Joseph S.B. Bradley M.N. Castrillo A. Bruhn K.W. Mak P.A. Pei L. Hogenesch J. O'Connell R.M. Cheng G.

USA. 2004; 101: 17813-17818Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). LXRs also have the capacity to negatively regulate inflammatory gene expression via transrepression (Joseph et al., 2003Joseph S.B. Castrillo A. Laffitte B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Reciprocal regulation of inflammation and lipid metabolism by liver X receptors.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The LXR pathway has been shown to impact inflammatory responses in models of atherosclerosis, contact dermatitis, sepsis, and multiple sclerosis (Hindinger et al., 2006Hindinger C. Hinton D.R.

USA. 2002; 99: 11896-11901Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms underlying signal-specific transrepression remain incompletely understood, it is clear that activation of LXR inhibits inflammatory responses to LPS or cytokines in part via blockade of NF-κB signaling (Joseph et al., 2003Joseph S.B. Castrillo A. Laffitte B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Reciprocal regulation of inflammation and lipid metabolism by liver X receptors.Nat.

Rosenfeld M.G. et al.Molecular determinants of crosstalk between nuclear receptors and toll-like receptors.Cell. 2005; 122: 707-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that LXR-dependent repression of inflammatory target genes occurs via an N-CoR- and sumoylation-dependent process (Ghisletti et al., 2007Ghisletti S. Huang W. Ogawa S. Pascual G. Lin M.E. Willson T.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Parallel SUMOylation-dependent pathways mediate gene- and signal-specific transrepression by LXRs and PPARgamma.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of TLR3 or TLR4 inhibits LXR cholesterol function via the transcription factor IRF-3, suggesting that LXR functions to regulate the crosstalk between inflammatory and metabolic pathways (Castrillo et al., 2003Castrillo A. Joseph S.B. Vaidya S.A. Haberland M. Fogelman A.M. Cheng G. Tontonoz P. Crosstalk between LXR and toll-like receptor signaling mediates bacterial and viral antagonism of cholesterol metabolism.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 805-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Despite recent progress in understanding of the links between LXR and innate immunity, little is known regarding the impact of LXR signaling on T and B cell biology and acquired immunity. We demonstrate here that transcriptional regulation of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis impacts cell proliferation and acquired immune responses. We show that T cell activation is accompanied by the downregulation of LXR target genes involved in cholesterol transport and the simultaneous induction of the SREBP-2 pathway for cholesterol synthesis. Ligand activation of LXR inhibits mitogen-driven T cell expansion by altering cellular sterol content through a pathway requiring the transporter ABCG1. Conversely, loss of LXR expression confers a proliferative advantage to lymphocytes, resulting in enhanced homeostatic and antigen-driven responses. LXR-dependent coupling of cholesterol metabolism and proliferation represents a previously unrecognized mechanism for the regulation of immune responses. To investigate the role of LXRs in lymphoid cells, we examined the immune system of young Lxrα and Lxrβ null mice (Peet et al., 1998Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cholesterol and bile acid metabolism are impaired in mice lacking the nuclear oxysterol receptor LXR alpha.Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) on a C57BL/6 background (greater than ten generations backcrossed). Flow cytometric analysis of spleen, lymph node (LN), and thymus from 6- to 8-week-old Lxrα and Lxrβ null mice revealed no significant differences in the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T and CD19+B220+ B lymphocyte populations when compared to LXR-sufficient controls (Figure S1A available online and data not shown). Thus, global loss of either LXR isotype does not grossly alter the development of T or B lymphocytes. However, analysis of hematopoetic tissues from older Lxrβ null mice (5–6 months) revealed moderate splenomegaly and an expansion in the total number of lymphocytes in spleen (p = 0.01) and LN (p = 0.01) (Figures 1A and 1B). No significant difference in the frequency of T and B cells was noted in the spleen, whereas LNs from Lxrβ null mice consistently showed a modest expansion in the B cell compartment (Figure 1C). Since Foxp3+ Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in maintaining lymphocyte homeostasis, we considered the possibility that the lymphoid hyperplasia might reflect a loss of Tregs. However, FACS analysis of Lxrβ null spleen and LN cells revealed no difference in the frequency of CD4+Foxp3+ T cells (Figure S1B), nor were differences noted in the activation markers CD69, CD25, and CD44 (Figure S1C; data not shown). Similarly, no differences were observed in the frequency of dendritic cells (DCs) from spleens of Lxrβ null mice or in MHC class II, CD86, and CD40 expression levels. These observations suggest that antigen-presenting cells are not activated and are not directly mediating the lymphoid hyperplasia (Figure S2). Next, we examined the expression pattern of Lxrα and Lxrβ in murine immune cells. Lxrα was expressed at high levels in peritoneal-derived macrophages and bone-marrow-derived macrophages, whereas little or no mRNA was detected in resting purified B and T cells (Figure S3A). Lxrβ was expressed in macrophages, T cells, and B cells. We considered the possibility that activation of lymphocytes might alter Lxrα expression, but we failed to detect expression in splenic T cells from C57BL/6 mice activated with plate-bound anti-CD3ɛ (pbCD3) mAb in the presence or absence of 2 μM GW3965 (synthetic LXR agonist; Figure S3B). Human T cells were also found to express LXRβ but not LXRα protein (Figure S3C). As expected, expression of LXRα in THP-1 macrophages was induced by GW3965 as a result of autoregulation (Laffitte et al., 2001Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Walczak R. Pei L. Wilpitz D.C. Collins J.L. Tontonoz P. Autoregulation of the human liver X receptor alpha promoter.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7558-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) (Figure S3C). Activation of LXR induced target gene expression in human T cells but did not lead to the upregulation of LXRα mRNA (Figure S3D; data not shown). We hypothesized that LXR may regulate proliferation and/or acquisition of effector functions in lymphocytes. To test this possibility, we examined 3H-thymidine incorporation into whole spleen cells from WT, Lxrα null, or Lxrβ null mice stimulated with a panel of mitogenic stimuli. Interestingly, anti-IgM-(Fab')2-, concavalin A- and PMA/ionomycin-stimulated spleen cells from Lxrβ null mice incorporated significantly more thymidine than did those from WT controls (Figure 1D; data not shown). So that it could be determined whether this effect was due to an intrinsic difference in cell proliferation, purified CFSE-labeled T cells were stimulated with pbCD3 and analyzed by flow cytometry for proliferative response and viability. No difference was observed in cell viability or the dilution of CFSE-labeled T cells at 24 hr, indicating that Lxrβ null T cells do not have an inherent early survival advantage (Figure 1E). However, analysis at 72 hr and 96 hr revealed that the absolute number of T cells that had divided in response to TCR stimulus was markedly greater in Lxrβ null T cells than in Lxrα null and WT cells (Figure 1F). Thus, LXRβ expression intrinsically regulates lymphocyte expansion in response to either TCR, BCR, or pharmacologic activation. In complimentary studies, we asked whether LXR activation altered the proliferative capacity of lymphocytes in vitro. Spleen cultures from C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with anti-IgM-(Fab')2 or pbCD3 in the presence or absence of GW3965, LG68 (RXR agonist), or a physiologic LXR ligand, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. After 48–96 hr, cultures were pulsed with 3H-thymidine overnight so that proliferation could be determined. Activation of LXR by LXR and/or RXR agonists markedly reduced the proliferative capacity of cultured cells (Figure 2A). Similarly, proliferation of B and T cells was inhibited by 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of LXR agonists on lymphocyte proliferation was receptor dependent, cultures were stimulated with a panel of T and B cell mitogens in the presence or absence of receptor agonists. Activation of LXR alone or in combination with RXR markedly reduced 3H-thymidine incorporation in WT spleen cell cultures stimulated with Con A, anti-IgM, or LPS (Figure 2B and Figure S4). A similar reduction in 3H-thymidine incorporation was seen in spleen cells from Lxrα null mice. In contrast, LXR activation had little or no effect on 3H-thymidine incorporation into mitogen-stimulated Lxrβ null splenocytes (Figure 2B and Figure S4). A modest decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation was observed in LG268-treated splenocytes stimulated with LPS and anti-IgM, indicative of an RXR-dependent, LXR-independent effect in B cells (Figure 2B and Figure S4). However, this decrease was not observed in Con A-treated spleen cells, suggesting that RXR activation alone does not perturb T cell expansion in this system (Figure 2B). We considered the possibility that activation of LXR in whole spleen cultures might indirectly impact lymphocyte expansion through actions on other cell types. So that this issue could be addressed, purified T cells were CFSE labeled and stimulated with pbCD3 in the presence of either receptor agonists or vehicle. Importantly, there was no significant difference in the viability of T cells cultured with LXR/RXR ligands at 24 hr, indicating that they are not inherently toxic to lymphocytes at these concentrations (Figure 2C). FACS analysis of cultures at 48–96 hr revealed that LXR activation inhibited proliferation of WT and Lxrα null T cells, but not Lxrβ null cells (Figure 2D). Thus, LXR activation has an intrinsic effect on lymphocyte proliferation that is mediated by LXRβ. We have also observed LXR-dependent inhibition of proliferation in developing bone-marrow-derived monocytes cultured with M-CSF in vitro (data not shown). Interestingly, we failed to observe an effect of LXR ligands on the proliferation of a number of transformed T and B cell lines (including Jurkat and Ramos; data not shown). This observation suggests that many transformed cells have lost their sensitivity to the LXR antiproliferative effect. Efficient T cell activation requires two signals. The first is mediated via the TCR, whereas the second can be transmitted from a number of cell-surface receptors (Bromley et al., 2001Bromley S.K. Burack W.R. Johnson K.G. Somersalo K. Sims T.N. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. The immunological synapse.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 375-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). To determine whether costimulation could restore proliferation in the presence of ligand, we activated purified WT T cells with pbCD3 and added either soluble anti-CD28 or rIL-2. As expected, LXR activation markedly reduced proliferation in response to pbCD3 (Figure 2E); however, the addition of anti-CD28 or IL-2 to cultures did not rescue. Next, we investigated whether the effects of LXR on lymphocyte expansion were also shared with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. In addition to LXR, both PPARγ and GR are known to inhibit inflammatory responses in immune cells (Ogawa et al., 2005Ogawa S. Lozach J. Benner C. Pascual G. Tangirala R.K. Westin S. Hoffmann A. Subramaniam S. David M. Rosenfeld M.G. et al.Molecular determinants of crosstalk between nuclear receptors and toll-like receptors.Cell. 2005; 122: 707-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Treatment of T cells with dexamethasone caused cell death in 75%–90% of cells after 24 hr, whereas activation of LXR, RXR, or PPARγ had little effect (Figure 2F and Figure S5C). Interestingly, in contrast to LXR activation, PPARγ signaling conferred a modest survival advantage to proliferating T cells in vitro at later time points (data not shown). Thus, LXRβ activation regulates lymphocyte expansion in a manner distinct from glucocorticoid receptor and PPARγ. For the determination of whether the transcriptional program initiated by LXR also regulates human lymphocytes, purified T cells were collected from peripheral blood of normal donors. Purified T cells were treated with vehicle or receptor ligands and stimulated with pbCD3 +/− soluble anti-CD28. In contrast to what is seen in murine lymphocytes, LXR/RXR activation did not induce apoptosis in cultures analyzed up to 72 hr (Figure S5D). Similar to murine lymphocytes, LXR activation also decreased the proliferative capacity of human CD8+ or CD4+ T cells stimulated with pbCD3 (Figure 2G and Figure S5A). In contrast to murine T cells, the addition of anti-CD28 was able to overcome the LXR-mediated inhibition of proliferation (Figure S5B), suggesting subtle differences in the biology of LXR in mouse and human lymphocytes. One possible explanation for the antiproliferative effects of LXR is that the receptor is engaging an apoptotic pathway that decreases the total number of lymphocytes proliferating. Alternatively, it could be that LXR-dependent transcription is regulating cell-cycle progression. Analysis of forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) characteristics of cultured T cells demonstrated that neither the activation nor ablation of LXR altered cellular enlargement in response to pbCD3 (Figure 3A; data not shown). However, examination of T cell blasts at 36–48 hr clearly established that LXR-activated cells did not divide efficiently (Figure 3B). Transgenic overexpression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-xL or addition of the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk provided a modest survival advantage over their wild-type counterparts but did not restore proliferation in the presence of LXR ligand (Figure 3C; data not shown), consistent with a primary effect of LXR on proliferation rather than cell viability. Next, we analyzed the DNA content of activated T cells in the presence or absence of LXR ligand. Interestingly, Lxrβ null T cells displayed an increased fraction of cells in S and G2/M phase and a decreased sub2N fraction at 36–48 hr compared to WT cells (Figure 3D and Figure S6). WT but not Lxrβ null cells treated with LXR agonist showed a markedly reduced fraction of cells moving through the cell cycle and an increase in the apoptotic sub2N fraction (Figure 3D and Figure S6). Analysis of DNA content in pbCD3-stimulated human T cell cultures also indicated a significant reduction in cells entering S phase at 24 hr with no difference in the sub2N fraction (data not shown). Thus, activation of LXRβ limits the capacity of T cells to move through the cell cycle, resulting in decreased proliferation. We also analyzed the expression of cell-cycle proteins. qPCR analysis of GW3965-treated lymphocytes showed normal upregulation of cylin D2, D3, and c-Myc, suggesting movement into G1 (data not shown). Similarly, we observed normal upregulation of proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67 and CDK 4 (Figures 3E and 3F). However, ligand-treated cells maintained increased levels of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27kip, indicating a decreased ability to move through cell cycle. Accordingly, viable ligand-treated cells showed decreased PCNA expression at 48 hr (Figure 3E). We also observed decreased mRNA expression of cyclin E1 and E2 (data not shown), further supporting our assertion that enforced LXR activation decreases cell-cycle progression in activated lymphocytes. The NF-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in lymphocyte activation (Schulze-Luehrmann and Ghosh, 2006Schulze-Luehrmann J. Ghosh S. Antigen-receptor signaling to nuclear factor kappa B.Immunity. 2006; 25: 701-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Since LXR is known to block NF-κB-dependent gene expression, we considered the possibility that the anti-inflammatory action of LXR might underlie its effects on lymphocyte expansion. However, LXR activation did not significantly impact the upregulation of the activation markers CD69 and CD25 at 24 hr (Figure S7A; data not shown). LXR/RXR activation also did not perturb IL-2 production (Figure S7B). Furthermore, restimulation of resting T cells with IL-2 led to comparable induction of the IL-2-responsive genes lymphotoxin A and granzyme B (Figure S7C) (Beadling and Smith, 2002Beadling C.

Coupled with the observations that Lxrβ null T cells do not express higher levels of CD25, CD44, or CD69 ex vivo (Figure S1D and data not shown) and do not upregulate these markers to a greater extent in response to TCR crosslinking (Figure S7D), these data strongly suggest that the regulation of proliferation by LXR is not achieved through alterations of TCR or IL-2 signaling or inhibition of proximal lymphocyte activation. We also addressed when LXR activation must occur in relation to TCR signals in order to block proliferation. To that end, CFSE-labeled T cells were activated with pbCD3 for 24 hr before LXR/RXR ligands were added to cultures. Interestingly, activation of LXR after 24 hr of TCR signaling perturbed expansion only in later rounds of division (Figure S8). If LXR ligands were washed out 2 hr after stimulation, then proliferation was restored (Figure S8), indicating that sustained LXR signaling is required to inhibit proliferation. These observations suggested that the effects of LXR were likely to be mediated by activation or repression of downstream target genes (see below). To determine the mechanism by which LXR modulates proliferation, we profiled gene expression in splenic murine T lymphocytes before or after stimulation with pbCD3 in the presence or absence of LXR agonists. In particular, we examined genes involved in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, reverse cholesterol transport, and cholesterol uptake. Consistent with previous reports showing that cholesterol synthesis is stimulated in activated T cells (Chen et al., 1975Chen H.W. Heiniger H.J. Kandutsch A.A. Relationship between sterol synthesis and DNA synthesis in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated mouse lymphocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), our findings indicate that the entire pathway of SREBP-2 target genes was induced after activation (Figure 4A). Pathways for fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis were also induced, consistent with activation of SREBP-1 (data not shown). Unexpectedly, TCR activation also resulted in the concomitant and profound downregulation of LXR target genes, including two key genes involved in cholesterol transport, Abca1 and Abcg1 (Figure 4A). In contrast, culturing of activated lymphocytes with LXR led to a robust induction of these genes. The transcriptional effects of LXR were notably more limited in T cells as compared to other cell types, such as macrophages. A relatively small"

Here, we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1 is translationally induced within 5 min of mGluR activation, and this response is essential for mGluR-dependent LTD. The increase in Arc/Arg3.1 translation requires eEF2K, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase that binds mGluR and dissociates upon mGluR activation, whereupon it phosphorylates eEF2. Phospho-eEF2 acts to slow the elongation step of translation and inhibits general protein synthesis but simultaneously increases Arc/Arg3.1 translation. Genetic deletion of eEF2K results in a selective deficit of rapid mGluR-dependent Arc/Arg3.1 translation and mGluR-LTD. This rapid translational mechanism is disrupted in the fragile X disease mouse (Fmr1 KO) in which mGluR-LTD does not require de novo protein synthesis but does require Arc/Arg3.1. We propose a model in which eEF2K-eEF2 and FMRP coordinately control the dynamic translation of Arc/Arg3.1 mRNA in dendrites that is critical for synapse-specific LTD."

These changes are caused by parasite proteins exported to the erythrocyte using novel trafficking machinery assembled in the host cell. To understand these unique modifications, we used a large-scale gene knockout strategy combined with functional screens to identify proteins exported into parasite-infected erythrocytes and involved in remodeling these cells. Eight genes were identified encoding proteins required for export of the parasite adhesin PfEMP1 and assembly of knobs that function as physical platforms to anchor the adhesin.

Collectively these proteins function as a pathogen secretion system, similar to bacteria and may provide targets for antivirulence based therapies to a disease responsible for millions of deaths annually. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria in humans with 1 to 3 million deaths annually. Once in the blood, multiplication of the parasite inside erythrocytes is responsible for associated morbidity and mortality. Profound structural and morphological changes occur in erythrocytes after parasite invasion, dramatically altering their physical properties and impairing circulation in vivo (Cooke et al., 2004Cooke B.M. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. Malaria and the red blood cell membrane.Semin. Hematol. 2004; 41: 173-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast to normal erythrocytes, parasitised cells are rigid and adhere to host endothelium as well as other cell types (Barnwell, 1989Barnwell J.W. Cytoadherence and sequestration in falciparum malaria.Exp. Parasitol. 1989; 69: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The increased rigidity and adhesiveness of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes result in augmented haemodynamic resistance in the microvasculature (Raventos et al., 1985Raventos S.C. Kaul D.K. Macaluso F. Nagel R.L. Membrane knobs are required for the microcirculatory obstruction induced by Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1985; 82: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and play an important role in the pathogenesis of malaria. Adherence of infected red cells to vascular endothelium is mediated by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein (PfEMP1) (Leech et al., 1984Leech J.H. Barnwell J.W. Miller L.H. Howard R.J. Identification of a strain-specific malarial antigen exposed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.J. Exp.

This in turn is anchored at the red cell membrane skeleton by knobs, macromolecular complexes consisting of knob associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) (Crabb et al., 1997Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F. Targeted gene disruption shows that knobs enable malaria-infected red cells to cytoadhere under physiological shear stress.Cell. 1997; 89: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In the absence of knobs, PfEMP1 cannot form adhesive interactions of sufficient strength to withstand disruption by forces of blood flow (Crabb et al., 1997Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F. Targeted gene disruption shows that knobs enable malaria-infected red cells to cytoadhere under physiological shear stress.Cell. 1997; 89: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). KAHRP binding with the membrane skeleton leads to an increased rigidity, blockage of blood vessels and resistance to flow (Pei et al., 2005Pei X. An X. Guo X. Tarnawski M. Coppel R. Mohandas N. Structural and Functional Studies of Interaction between Plasmodium falciparum Knob-associated Histidine-rich Protein (KAHRP) and Erythrocyte Spectrin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31166-31171Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The parasite proteins involved are transported through host cells without trafficking machinery and inserted into a highly organized membrane skeleton structure. The formation of a de novo transport system and trafficking of parasite proteins to diverse locations in the host cell is unique in cell biology (Marti et al., 2005Marti M. Baum J. Rug M. Tilley L. Cowman A.F. Signal-mediated export of proteins from the malaria parasite to the host erythrocyte.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Parasite proteins such as PfEMP1 and KAHRP have to traverse several membranes to reach their destination (Marti et al., 2005Marti M. Baum J. Rug M. Tilley L. Cowman A.F. Signal-mediated export of proteins from the malaria parasite to the host erythrocyte.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A pentameric sequence has been identified required for translocation of proteins across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane termed the P. falciparum Export Element (PEXEL) (Marti et al., 2004Marti M. Good R.T. Rug M. Knuepfer E. Cowman A.F. Targeting malaria virulence and remodeling proteins to the host erythrocyte.Science. 2004; 306: 1930-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) or Vacuolar Targeting Signal (VTS) (Hiller et al., 2004Hiller N.L. Bhattacharjee S. van Ooij C. Liolios K. Harrison T. Lopez-Estrano C. Haldar K. A host-targeting signal in virulence proteins reveals a secretome in malarial infection.Science. 2004; 306: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Indeed, a similar sequence has been identified in the parasitic fungi Phytophtora infestans that is required for export of proteins into infected plant cells (Whisson et al., 2007Whisson S.C. Boevink P.C. Moleleki L. Avrova A.O. Morales J.G. Gilroy E.M. Armstrong M.R. Grouffaud S. van West P. Chapman S. et al.A translocation signal for delivery of oomycete effector proteins into host plant cells.Nature. 2007; 450: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Searching of the P. falciparum genome sequence has revealed 8% of P. falciparum genes contain this sequence (Hiller et al., 2004Hiller N.L. Bhattacharjee S. van Ooij C. Liolios K. Harrison T. Lopez-Estrano C. Haldar K.

Caler E. Carlton J.M. Simpson K. Speed T.P. Cowman A.F. Lineage-specific expansion of proteins exported to erythrocytes in malaria parasites.Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R12Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Many of these are likely to encode proteins that play an important role in remodelling infected erythrocytes (Marti et al., 2005Marti M. Baum J. Rug M. Tilley L. Cowman A.F. Signal-mediated export of proteins from the malaria parasite to the host erythrocyte.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Translocation across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane via a PEXEL motif is functionally conserved across all Plasmodium species. However the ‘exportome’ for P. falciparum is 5-10 times larger than that of other malaria parasites partly because of radiation and expansion of gene families including those containing DnaJ domains (Walsh et al., 2004Walsh P. Bursac D. Law Y.C. Cyr D. Lithgow T. The J-protein family: modulating protein assembly, disassembly and translocation.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and other novel domains called PHIST (Plasmodium helical interspersed subtelomeric family) (Sargeant et al., 2006Sargeant T.J. Marti M. Caler E. Carlton J.M. Simpson K. Speed T.P. Cowman A.F. Lineage-specific expansion of proteins exported to erythrocytes in malaria parasites.Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R12Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). One explanation for increased number of proteins exported to the host erythrocyte in P. falciparum is they are necessary for export of P.falciparum specific PfEMP1 to the parasite-infected erythrocyte surface (Marti et al., 2005Marti M. Baum J. Rug M. Tilley L. Cowman A.F. Signal-mediated export of proteins from the malaria parasite to the host erythrocyte.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Once across the parasitophorous vacuole, many exported proteins interact with novel structures in the red cell cytoplasm called Maurer's clefts, structures that serve as a sorting point from which P. falciparum proteins are deposited underneath or into the erythrocyte membrane (Wickham et al., 2001Wickham M.E. Rug M. Ralph S.A. Klonis N. McFadden G.I. Tilley L. Cowman A.F. Trafficking and assembly of the cytoadherence complex in Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). At least one of the proteins resident in clefts, the skeleton binding protein 1 (SBP1) has been shown to be required for transport of PfEMP1 to the red cell membrane (Cooke et al., 2006Cooke B.M. Buckingham D.W. Glenister F.K. Fernandez K.M. Bannister L.H. Marti M. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. A Maurer's cleft-associated protein is essential for expression of the major malaria virulence antigen on the surface of infected red blood cells.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Maier et al., 2007Maier A.G. Rug M. O'Neill M.T. Beeson J.G. Marti M. Reeder J. Cowman A.F. Skeleton-binding protein 1 functions at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane to traffic PfEMP1 to the Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocyte surface.Blood. 2007; 109: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To identify proteins involved in this process we used functional screens by constructing loss-of-function mutants of genes encoding proteins predicted to be exported. We were particularly interested in finding proteins required for trafficking PfEMP1 to the infected erythrocyte surface, correct assembly of knobs and those involved in rigidification of infected red cells, all processes associated with virulence in malaria infection. The scale of these studies is an order of magnitude greater than previously attempted in the field of malaria. This allowed us to identify previously unknown proteins exported to the P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte, responsible for establishment of the parasite in its intracellular environment and providing essential functions for assembly and localization of virulence determinants. We scanned the P. falciparum genome to generate a list that included known exported proteins, as well as those with a PEXEL motif (Hiller et al., 2004Hiller N.L. Bhattacharjee S. van Ooij C. Liolios K. Harrison T. Lopez-Estrano C. Haldar K.

Lineage-specific expansion of proteins exported to erythrocytes in malaria parasites.Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R12Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Using these criteria we compiled a list of 83 candidate genes of which 46 had PEXEL motifs (Figure 1, shaded blue). Five genes were chosen that do not have a PEXEL but are exported including SURFIN (Winter et al., 2005Winter G. Kawai S. Haeggstrom M. Kaneko O. von Euler A. Kawazu S. Palm D. Fernandez V.

A putative Plasmodium falciparum exported serine/threonine protein kinase.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), PIESP1 (Florens et al., 2004Florens L. Liu X. Wang Y. Yang S. Schwartz O. Peglar M. Carucci D.J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Wub Y. Proteomics approach reveals novel proteins on the surface of malaria-infected erythrocytes.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 135: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and Pf332 (Mattei and Scherf, 1992Mattei D. Scherf A. The Pf332 gene of Plasmodium falciparum codes for a giant protein that is translocated from the parasite to the membrane of infected erythrocytes.Gene. 1992; 110: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Figure 1, shaded gray). Together, these 51 exported proteins constitute a representative subset of the exportome manageable in terms of a P. falciparum gene knockout screen. In addition, we included 32 genes encoding proteins with a signal sequence and gene transcription in blood-stages to provide a comparison with respect to essentiality (Figure 1, shaded green). The original list was made before identification of the PEXEL motif. The latter gene set were identified as potentially exported as they fitted bioinformatic criteria including a signal sequence and transcription in early rings. Subsequently, upon identification of the PEXEL the list was refined; however, we retained the 32 genes classed as not exported. Most genes within the exported set were transcribed either in ring stages soon after invasion and/or in schizont stages when the invasive merozoite is formed (Figure 1). This is consistent with these proteins playing a role in repairing or remodelling the host erythrocyte after invasion of the merozoite. To disrupt the function of these genes in P. falciparum, we constructed plasmids that integrate into targeted genes by double crossover homologous recombination using plasmid pHHT-TK (Duraisingh et al., 2002Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Negative selection of Plasmodium falciparum reveals targeted gene deletion by double crossover recombination.Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). During this work we developed improved plasmids (pCC1, see supplementary methods) for negative selection using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (CDUP) gene (Figure 2A) (Maier et al., 2006Maier A.G. Braks J.A. Waters A.P. Cowman A.F. Negative selection using yeast cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyl transferase in Plasmodium falciparum for targeted gene deletion by double crossover recombination.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transfected into CS2, a strain of P. falciparum conferring adhesion of infected erythrocytes to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) via a PfEMP1 encoded by var2csa (Salanti et al., 2004Salanti A. Dahlback M. Turner L. Nielsen M.A. Barfod L. Magistrado P. Jensen A.T. Lavstsen T. Ofori M.F. Marsh K. et al.Evidence for the involvement of VAR2CSA in pregnancy-associated malaria.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This parasite line was chosen because expression of PfEMP1 encoded by var2csa is very stable over time. As most PfEMP1 genes undergo rapid transcriptional switches to other family members as a means of immune evasion these switching events could confound our subsequent analysis, the choice of var2csa minimizes this problem. In P. falciparum the transfected plasmids are maintained as episomal circles and integration by double crossover homologous recombination occurs at low frequency (Maier et al., 2006Maier A.G. Braks J.A. Waters A.P. Cowman A.F. Negative selection using yeast cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyl transferase in Plasmodium falciparum for targeted gene deletion by double crossover recombination.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Growth on WR99210 (positive selection) and 5′-fluorocytosine (negative selection) favors the survival of transfected parasites with homologous integration into the target gene and loss of episomal plasmids (Maier et al., 2006Maier A.G. Braks J.A. Waters A.P. Cowman A.F. Negative selection using yeast cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyl transferase in Plasmodium falciparum for targeted gene deletion by double crossover recombination.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Gene disruption was analyzed by Southern blots that indicated the plasmid had integrated by double-crossover homologous recombination into 53 of 83 genes (Figures 2B and S1). To show that gene disruption results in loss of protein expression we generated antibodies to a subset and analyzed them by Western blots to demonstrate loss of protein expression (Figure 2C). Although transfection of the plasmids was successful for the other 30 genes, it was not possible to derive parasites in which the constructs had integrated. While the inability to select for double crossover homologous recombination for some genes is not definitive proof that they are essential under laboratory conditions it is consistent with the proposition that they serve an important function in growth of the parasite in the host erythrocyte. We propagated P. falciparum in human erythrocytes in vitro and under these circumstances, genes that may be essential for survival in vivo (e.g., in the presence of the immune system), such as those involved in the transport of PfEMP1 and its display on the parasite-infected erythrocyte surface, may not be required. Therefore we expected fewer exported proteins to be essential for in vitro growth when compared to non-exported blood-stage proteins, many of which presumably function to maintain normal erythrocytic growth. Overall, 53 of the P. falciparum genes tested could be disrupted and classified as non-essential for erythrocytic growth (64% of those tested) (Figure 3A). Consistent with our hypothesis, fewer exported proteins were likely to be essential (23.5%) than those not exported from the parasite (43.7%). Genes encoding proteins annotated as having a probable metabolic role were over-represented among “essential” genes whereas other annotated classes or those with no obvious functional homologs (hypothetical proteins) were present in similar proportions in the gene knockout and essential groups (Figure 3B). Interestingly, for genes PFD0095c, MAL7P1.149 and MAL8P1.153 we were able to disrupt the endogenous loci but this was accompanied by a duplication event maintaining expression of the gene (Figure S2). We concluded these genes are essential for in vitro growth. No matter which sub-classification was used to group different genes, a higher proportion of non-exported proteins were considered essential (Figure 3C). Among the genes encoding exported proteins, both disruptable and non-disruptable examples were found within the PHIST family and those containing DnaJ domains. The latter suggests that some co-chaperone functions may be essential, while others may not (Walsh et al., 2004Walsh P. Bursac D. Law Y.C. Cyr D. Lithgow T. The J-protein family: modulating protein assembly, disassembly and translocation.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D). To identify genes required for trafficking, display and function of PfEMP1 on the surface of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes we screened mutant lines for recognition of surface antigens by antibodies from malaria-exposed individuals (Beeson et al., 2006Beeson J.G. Mann E.J. Byrne T.J. Caragounis A. Elliott S.R. Brown G.V. Rogerson S.J. Antigenic differences and conservation among placental Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes and acquisition of variant-specific and cross-reactive antibodies.J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 193: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The CS2 parasite line used here expresses the var2csa gene (PFL0030c) (Duffy et al., 2006Duffy M.F. Maier A.G. Byrne T.J. Marty A.J. Elliott S.R. O'Neill M.T. Payne P.D. Rogerson S.J. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. et al.VAR2CSA is the principal ligand for chondroitin sulfate A in two allogeneic isolates of Plasmodium falciparum.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 149: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which encodes a PfEMP1 responsible for adhesion to CSA (Salanti et al., 2004Salanti A. Dahlback M. Turner L. Nielsen M.A. Barfod L. Magistrado P. Jensen A.T. Lavstsen T. Ofori M.F. Marsh K. et al.Evidence for the involvement of VAR2CSA in pregnancy-associated malaria.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In vivo, parasites expressing this var gene tend to be found in primigravid women and very rarely in males or mutligravid women who have developed antibodies specific for the var2csa PfEMP1. We can thus use sera from multigravid women to detect surface expressed PfEMP1 on CS2-infected erythrocytes (Beeson et al., 2006Beeson J.G. Mann E.J. Byrne T.J. Caragounis A. Elliott S.R. Brown G.V. Rogerson S.J. Antigenic differences and conservation among placental Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes and acquisition of variant-specific and cross-reactive antibodies.J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 193: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An initial screen with such sera showed that 10 of the 53 parasite-infected erythrocyte lines had a decrease in reactivity of ≥ 70% compared to parental CS2-infected red cells (Figure 4A) and we chose these as a cut off for further analyses. To confirm the reduced level of PfEMP1 on the surface of these cells we used an assay in which surface exposed protein is cleaved by trypsin and the conserved C terminus of the protein detected by western blot with antibodies against the acidic terminal segment (ATS) (Waterkeyn et al., 2000Waterkeyn J.F. Wickham M.E. Davern K. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Culvenor J.G. Waller R.F. Cowman A.F.

This differentiates surface exposed PfEMP1 from the intracellular pool. Surface exposed PfEMP1 in parental line CS2 results in cleavage products of 90 and 70 kDa (Figure 4B) whereas the internal pool of PfEMP1 in these cells migrates at approximately 300 kDa. This antibody also shows crossreaction with host spectrin (Rug et al., 2006Rug M. Prescott S.W. Fernandez K.M. Cooke B.M. Cowman A.F.

Four of the mutant cell lines, in which the genes PFB0106c, MAL7P1.172, PF13_0076 and PF14_0758 had been disrupted, showed none or very low levels of surface expressed PfEMP1 as evidenced by the absence of cleaved fragments of any size. The CS2ΔMAL7P1.172 cells also showed greatly reduced levels of total PfEMP1. The parasite lines CS2ΔMAL7P1.171 and CS2ΔPF10_0025 showed consistently reduced surface expression of PfEMP1, in multiple independent experiments, in comparison with parental wild-type cells. These results suggest that proteins encoded by PFB0106c, MAL7P1.172, PF13_0076, PF14_0758, MAL7P1.171 and PF10_0025 play a role in trafficking and display of the virulence protein PfEMP1 on the host erythrocyte (Figure 7). Although the expression of the var2csa gene is very stable in comparison to other members of the var gene family, switching to other var genes does occur at low frequency and these other var gene products would not react with the sera that we used. In order to eliminate such false positives, we screened all knockout parasites for their ability to bind to CSA, which is a unique feature of the var2sa gene product. Four parasite lines CS2ΔPFA0620c, CS2ΔPFB0090c, CS2ΔPFE0060w and CS2ΔMAL7P1.91 showed decreased levels of adherence to CSA and a trypsin-cleaved C terminus of PfEMP1 of altered size suggesting a switch to an alternative PfEMP1-encoding gene. These lines were subjected to selection for CSA binding to recover parasites in which var2csa was the dominant var gene expressed. Following selection, an increased reactivity with human serum from multigravid females compared to unselected lines was observed (Figure 4A PFA0620c up, PFB0090c up, PFE0060w up). Additionally, the size of the trypsin-cleaved PfEMP1 was now the same as the parental CS2 line (Fig. S3 compared to before CSA selection Figure 4C). We conclude that these lines are false positives due to antigenic switching. To confirm the lines in which the genes PFB0106c, MAL7P1.172, PF14_0758, MAL7P1.171, PF10_0025, and PF13_0076 were disrupted had altered adherence properties, and to identify others in which adherence had been affected, we used flow based cytoadherence assays with CSA. The parasite lines CS2ΔPFB0106c, CS2ΔMAL7P1.172, CS2ΔPF14_0758 show no adherence to CSA under flow conditions (Figure 4C) consistent with absence of PfEMP1 on the surface of parasite-infected host cells (Figure 4B). Additionally, the parasite lines CS2ΔMAL7P1.171, CS2ΔPF10_0025 and CS2ΔPF13_0076 showed greatly reduced levels of adherence which provides functional evidence of decreased levels of PfEMP1 on the infected erythrocyte surface (Figure 4B). Similar results were obtained using static adhesion assays to CSA (Figure S4). These results provide further evidence that the proteins encoded by PFB0106c, MAL7P1.172, PF14_0758, MAL7P1.171, PF10_0025 and PF13_0076 play a role in trafficking and display of PfEMP1 on the host cell surface (Figure 7). To determine if loss of function in mutant parasite lines had an effect on distribution of PfEMP1, KAHRP, PfEMP3 or SBP1 in host erythrocytes we performed immunofluorescence experiments with antibodies (Figures 5, S5, and S7). None of the cell lines showed any trafficking defects of PfEMP3 or SBP1 (Figures S5 and S7). CS2ΔPFB0106c and CS2ΔMAL7P1.171 infected erythrocytes showed normal KAHRP distribution; however, PfEMP1 was primarily concentrated in the parasite with little detected within infected-erythrocytes (Figure 5A) suggesting the defect was a decreased efficiency of transfer of PfEMP1 to Maurer's clefts. PFB0106c protein in parental CS2-infected erythrocytes was distributed in the erythrocyte cytoplasm as well as localized to Maurer's clefts (Figure 5B) suggesting it is exported to the erythrocyte cytoplasm and interacts with Maurer's clefts as has been reported for KAHRP and PfEMP3 (Knuepfer et al., 2005Knuepfer E.

https://openalex.org/W2013614359,"CD133 (prominin-1), a 5-transmembrane glycoprotein, has recently been considered to be an important marker that represents the subset population of cancer stem-like cells. Herein we report the isolation of CD133-positive cells (LC-CD133+) and CD133-negative cells (LC-CD133−) from tissue samples of ten patients with non-small cell lung cancer (LC) and five LC cell lines. LC-CD133+ displayed higher Oct-4 expressions with the ability to self-renew and may represent a reservoir with proliferative potential for generating lung cancer cells. Furthermore, LC-CD133+, unlike LC-CD133−, highly co-expressed the multiple drug-resistant marker ABCG2 and showed significant resistance to chemotherapy agents (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) and radiotherapy. The treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with lentiviral vector can specifically block the capability of LC-CD133+ to form spheres and can further facilitate LC-CD133+ to differentiate into LC-CD133−. In addition, knock-down of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133+ can significantly inhibit the abilities of tumor invasion and colony formation, and increase apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Finally, in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for LC-CD133+ can be improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Oct-4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining the self-renewing, cancer stem-like, and chemoradioresistant properties of LC-CD133+. Future research is warranted regarding the up-regulated expression of Oct-4 in LC-CD133+ and malignant lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2030040408,"Salient stimuli that modify behavior induce transcription of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1) and transport Arc mRNA into dendrites, suggesting that local Arc translation mediates synaptic plasticity that encodes such stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in hippocampal neurons induced by group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) relies on rapid translation of Arc. mGluR-LTD induction causes long-term increases in AMPA receptor endocytosis rate and dendritic synthesis of Arc, a component of the AMPAR endocytosis machinery. Knockdown of Arc prevents mGluRs from triggering AMPAR endocytosis or LTD, and acute blockade of new Arc synthesis with antisense oligonucleotides blocks mGluR-LTD and AMPAR trafficking. In contrast, LTD induced by NMDA receptors does not persistently alter AMPAR endocytosis rate, induce Arc synthesis, or require Arc protein. These data demonstrate a role for local Arc synthesis specifically in mGluR-LTD and suggest that mGluR-LTD may be one consequence of Arc mRNA induction during experience."
https://openalex.org/W2019428638,"Satellite cells reside beneath the basal lamina of skeletal muscle fibers and include cells that act as precursors for muscle growth and repair. Although they share a common anatomical localization and typically are considered a homogeneous population, satellite cells actually exhibit substantial heterogeneity. We used cell-surface marker expression to purify from the satellite cell pool a distinct population of skeletal muscle precursors (SMPs) that function as muscle stem cells. When engrafted into muscle of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, purified SMPs contributed to up to 94% of myofibers, restoring dystrophin expression and significantly improving muscle histology and contractile function. Transplanted SMPs also entered the satellite cell compartment, renewing the endogenous stem cell pool and participating in subsequent rounds of injury repair. Together, these studies indicate the presence in adult skeletal muscle of prospectively isolatable muscle-forming stem cells and directly demonstrate the efficacy of myogenic stem cell transplant for treating muscle degenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2162716784,"Proper regulation of chromatin structure is necessary for the maintenance of cell type-specific gene expression patterns. The embryonic stem cell (ESC) expression pattern governs self-renewal and pluripotency. Here, we present an RNAi screen in mouse ESCs of 1008 loci encoding chromatin proteins. We identified 68 proteins that exhibit diverse phenotypes upon knockdown (KD), including seven subunits of the Tip60-p400 complex. Phenotypic analyses revealed that Tip60-p400 is necessary to maintain characteristic features of ESCs. We show that p400 localization to the promoters of both silent and active genes is dependent upon histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Furthermore, the Tip60-p400 KD gene expression profile is enriched for developmental regulators and significantly overlaps with that of the transcription factor Nanog. Depletion of Nanog reduces p400 binding to target promoters without affecting H3K4me3 levels. Together, these data indicate that Tip60-p400 integrates signals from Nanog and H3K4me3 to regulate gene expression in ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2160025503,"The small GTPases, Rab5 and Rac, are essential for endocytosis and actin remodeling, respectively. Coordination of these processes is critical to achieve spatial restriction of intracellular signaling, which is essential for a variety of polarized functions. Here, we show that clathrin- and Rab5-mediated endocytosis are required for the activation of Rac induced by motogenic stimuli. Rac activation occurs on early endosomes, where the RacGEF Tiam1 is also recruited. Subsequent recycling of Rac to the plasma membrane ensures localized signaling, leading to the formation of actin-based migratory protrusions. Thus, membrane trafficking of Rac is required for the spatial resolution of Rac-dependent motogenic signals. We further demonstrate that a Rab5-to-Rac circuitry controls the morphology of motile mammalian tumor cells and primordial germinal cells during zebrafish development, suggesting that this circuitry is relevant for the regulation of migratory programs in various cells, in both in vitro settings and whole organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2167291962,"The p53 tumor suppressor is a key mediator of cellular responses to various stresses. Here, we show that under conditions of basal physiologic and cell-culture stress, p53 inhibits expression of the CD44 cell-surface molecule via binding to a noncanonical p53-binding sequence in the CD44 promoter. This interaction enables an untransformed cell to respond to stress-induced, p53-dependent cytostatic and apoptotic signals that would otherwise be blocked by the actions of CD44. In the absence of p53 function, the resulting derepressed CD44 expression is essential for the growth and tumor-initiating ability of highly tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. In both tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells, CD44's expression is positively regulated by p63, a paralogue of p53. Our data indicate that CD44 is a key tumor-promoting agent in transformed tumor cells lacking p53 function. They also suggest that the derepression of CD44 resulting from inactivation of p53 can potentially aid the survival of immortalized, premalignant cells.

CD44 is a transmembrane cell-surface protein (Aruffo et al., 1990Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. CD44 is the principal cell surface receptor for hyaluronate.Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar) that is synthesized in multiple isoforms because of alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA. Although it lacks its own signaling domain, it has recently been shown to be essential for the homing and stem cell properties of leukemic stem cells (Jin et al., 2006Jin L. Hope K.J. Zhai Q.

CD44 has also been found to support anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in experimental models of solid cancers (Barbour et al., 2003Barbour A.P. Reeder J.A. Walsh M.D. Fawcett J. Antalis T.M. Gotley D.C.

Rak J. et al.CD44 regulates hematopoietic progenitor distribution, granuloma formation, and tumorigenicity.Blood. 1997; 90: 2217-2233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise role played by CD44 in tumorigenesis has thus remained unclear. The tumor-promoting functions of CD44 have been attributed to its association with and costimulation of signaling by a number of growth factor receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2), epidermal growth factor receptor-1 (Her1), and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met) (Ponta et al., 2003Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. CD44: From adhesion molecules to signalling regulators.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). In the case of breast cancer pathogenesis, for example, the most prominent of these receptors is Her2, which is overexpressed in 20%–30% of these tumors and is responsible for releasing mitogenic and trophic signals into breast cancer cells (Yarden, 2001Yarden Y. Biology of HER2 and its importance in breast cancer.Oncology. 2001; 61: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). These and other observations have suggested that CD44 confers a decided growth advantage on certain types of cancer cells. Moreover, the CD44 cell-surface antigen serves as a useful marker for detecting and enriching for several types of tumor-initiating cells (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S.

We hypothesized that signals regulating CD44 expression are essential for understanding the role of this protein in tumorigenesis. In studying this issue, we noted that immunohistochemical analyses of clinical samples of hepatocellular and renal carcinomas had demonstrated that CD44 protein is expressed at high levels together with elevated levels of p53 (Endo and Terada, 2000Endo K. Terada T. Protein expression of CD44 (standard and variant isoforms) in hepatocellular carcinoma: Relationships with tumor grade, clinicopathologic parameters, p53 expression, and patient survival.J.

Since the expression of p53 protein in tumor samples indicates the presence of a mutant, functionally inactive p53 protein (Iggo et al., 1990Iggo R. Gatter K. Bartek J. Lane D. Harris A.L. Increased expression of mutant forms of p53 oncogene in primary lung cancer.Lancet. 1990; 335: 675-679Abstract PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, Sjogren et al., 1996Sjogren S. Inganas M. Norberg T.

Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), this suggested that CD44 might be repressed by wild-type p53. In response to strong cellular stresses, such as DNA damage or oncogenic signals, the wild-type form of p53 regulates expression of a large cohort of genes that effect cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis (Levine, 1997Levine A.J. p53, the cellular gatekeeper for growth and division.Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6528) Google Scholar, Levine et al., 2006Levine A.J.

Recent findings have uncovered additional roles of the p53 protein that is expressed under basal physiologic and cell-culture stress conditions, notably regulation of mitochondrial respiration (Bensaad et al., 2006Bensaad K.

Under normal in vivo conditions, specifically in primary mouse mammary epithelial cells, p53 regulates the expression of ∼40 transcripts, pointing to its potentially important physiologic role in the absence of any unusual cell-physiologic stresses (Aldaz et al., 2002Aldaz C.M. Hu Y. Daniel R. Gaddis S. Kittrell F. Medina D. Serial analysis of gene expression in normal p53 null mammary epithelium.Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6366-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The p53 paralogue, p63, has been recently shown to positively regulate CD44 mRNA expression in microarray-based gene expression analyses of the MCF10A immortalized nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line. This study demonstrated that ectopic expression of p63 leads to the upregulation of CD44 expression, whereas shRNA directed against p63 mRNA leads to loss of CD44 expression (Carroll et al., 2006Carroll D.K. Carroll J.S. Leong C.O. Cheng F. Brown M. Mills A.A. Brugge J.S. Ellisen L.W. p63 regulates an adhesion programme and cell survival in epithelial cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, this work did not indicate whether p63, which is essential for the normal development of epithelial tissues (Mills et al., 1999Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. p63 is a p53 homologue required for limb and epidermal morphogenesis.Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 1999Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D.

McKeon F. p63 is essential for regenerative proliferation in limb, craniofacial and epithelial development.Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar), is also able to positively regulate CD44 expression at the protein level and in tumorigenic cells. These various observations provoked us to examine the mechanisms regulating the abundance of CD44 in cells and the functional consequences of its expression at various levels in such cells. To address the regulation and apparently important role of CD44 in mammary epithelial cell physiology and tumorigenesis, we chose to analyze its function in a novel type of early-passage, human mammary epithelial cells (BPECs) that were recently isolated and propagated in this laboratory (Ince et al., 2007Ince T.A. Richardson A.L. Bell G.W. Saitoh M. Godar S. Karnoub A.E. Iglehart J.D. Weinberg R.A. Transformation of different human breast epithelial cell types leads to distinct tumor phenotypes.Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 160-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The experimentally transformed derivatives of these cells, termed BPLER cells, were created by the introduction of genes encoding the hTERT telomerase subunit, the SV40 large and small T antigens, and the H-Ras V12 oncoprotein (Hahn et al., 1999Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Creation of human tumour cells with defined genetic elements.Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, Ince et al., 2007Ince T.A. Richardson A.L. Bell G.W. Saitoh M.

Transformation of different human breast epithelial cell types leads to distinct tumor phenotypes.Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 160-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These BPLER cells yield tumor xenografts that closely resemble, at the histopathological level, invasive ductal adenocarcinomas, the most common type of human breast cancer. In addition, injection of as few as 10–100 of these transformed cells suffices to induce tumors in immunocompromised mouse hosts, even in the absence of prior enrichment of tumor-initiating cells (Ince et al., 2007Ince T.A. Richardson A.L. Bell G.W. Saitoh M. Godar S. Karnoub A.E. Iglehart J.D. Weinberg R.A. Transformation of different human breast epithelial cell types leads to distinct tumor phenotypes.Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 160-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This tumor-initiating efficiency is comparable to that of CD44high/CD24low cells that have been isolated directly from populations of human breast cancer cells (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (7906) Google Scholar). This experimental model of human breast pathogenesis allowed us to study the function and expression of p53 and CD44 in both primary BPEC cells and in the derived, experimentally transformed BPLER cells. Prompted by the clinical evidence cited above (Endo and Terada, 2000Endo K. Terada T.

Oncol. 2002; 7: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we undertook to confirm that p53 mutant status is in fact associated with elevated CD44 expression in a series of breast cancer specimens whose p53 mutant status and gene expression profiles were known (Miller et al., 2005Miller L.D. Smeds J. George J. Vega V.B. Vergara L. Ploner A. Pawitan Y. Hall P. Klaar S. Liu E.T. Bergh J.

Since not all p53 mutations are equally detrimental to p53 function, we chose to further sort these tumor specimens according to the expression of a p53-induced gene, p21Waf1. Although CD44 is positively and negatively regulated by a number of distinct signals (Ponta et al., 2003Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. CD44: From adhesion molecules to signalling regulators.Nat.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), we were surprised that p53 mutant/p21-low-expression patterns in human tumors were, on their own, able to predict high CD44 expression, doing so in a statistically significant manner (Figure S1 available online). This correlation suggested that p53 could act as a negative regulator of CD44 expression in spontaneously arising human tumors. We therefore undertook to investigate whether p53 indeed functions to repress CD44 expression in untransformed human mammary epithelial cells. Because the BPEC cells mentioned above have a limited life span in culture, they were initially immortalized by introduction of a vector expressing the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT), yielding BPEC-T cells. To visualize the CD44 protein expression at the single-cell level, we immunostained subconfluent monolayer cultures of these BPEC-T cells. Curiously, the CD44 expression in control BPEC-T cells was found to be elevated in the outer perimeters of BPEC-T cell clusters, with a gradual decrease toward the center of each cluster (Figure 1A). In order to explore the possible connection of this behavior with p53 function, we infected populations of BPEC-T cells with a lentiviral construct encoding an shRNA that causes degradation of p53 mRNA or, alternatively, with a retroviral construct encoding the human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein, which is known to trigger degradation of the p53 protein. The expression gradient described above was absent in cells expressing the p53-shRNA construct or in cells in which the E6 oncoprotein was deployed to degrade p53 (Figure 1A). In both cases, these cells exhibited elevated levels of CD44 protein nearly uniformly, regardless of the cells' positions within a cluster (Figure 1A). This suggested that the uneven expression of CD44 by control BPEC-T cells was a reflection of p53 function. Control experiments in BPEC-T cells treated with a genotoxic agent—doxorubicin—indicated that the p53 gene and protein expressed in all cellular locations within these clusters were equally capable of responding to genotoxic stress (Figure S2). These findings suggested heterogeneous activation of p53 protein expression within the cell clusters of BPEC-T cells growing in monolayer culture. To test this possibility, we performed double immunofluorescent staining for both p53 and CD44. As anticipated, the control BPEC-T cells revealed largely mutually exclusive localizations of the two proteins (Figure 1B), consistent with the notion of p53-dependent repression of CD44. Further analysis of protein expression in these cells with immunoblotting revealed that CD44 expression was significantly increased in the confluent cells in which p53 expression had been suppressed by either the shRNA construct or E6 oncoprotein (Figure 1C). At present, the nature of the contextual signals causing differential activation of p53 expression within the BPEC-T cell clusters is obscure. Nonetheless, these results provided an initial indication that high CD44 expression is a signature of relatively low p53 activity. To determine whether p53 regulates CD44 expression at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level, we measured total CD44 mRNA expression by semiquantitative RT-PCR using primers to the CD44 sequences common to all CD44 mRNA isoforms. As shown in Figure 1D, the mRNA levels for CD44 paralleled the results from the protein expression analyses—i.e., CD44 mRNAs were upregulated 4- to 5-fold and CD44 protein 4-fold in BPEC-T cells in which p53 function had been largely abolished. Hence, CD44 expression was suppressed by p53 largely through effects on CD44 mRNA levels. We also examined how the levels of p53 expression were correlated with those of CD44 in a living tissue. To do so, we undertook immunohistochemical analyses of the mammary glands of 10-week-old wild-type and p53−/− isogenic mice. These analyses demonstrated significantly higher CD44 protein expression in the mammary glands of p53−/− mice than in those of wild-type animals. The difference in CD44 signal was most prominent in the basal epithelial cells, but was also apparent in occasional luminal epithelial cells (Figure 1E). To exclude the possibility that the observed repression was a consequence of genomic instability in these p53−/− mice, we took advantage of a recently published conditional mouse model, in which p53 expression is restored in otherwise p53 null tissues of mice by administration of tamoxifen to activate the Cre recombinase (Ventura et al., 2007Ventura A. Kirsch D.G. McLaughlin M.E. Tuveson D.A. Grimm J. Lintault L. Newman J. Reczek E.E. Weissleder R. Jacks T. Restoration of p53 function leads to tumour regression in vivo.Nature. 2007; 445: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). When p53 expression was restored in the tissues of adult mice (with 50%–80% efficiency in mammary epithelial cells), we observed downregulation of CD44 protein levels specifically in the mammary epithelium of these mice but not in the mammary epithelium of mice treated only with oil vehicle (Figure S3). As before, these observations indicated that the expression of p53 varied inversely with that of CD44. Moreover, they indicated that p53 antagonism of CD44 expression can operate in normal tissues, where p53 is expressed at low levels and in the apparent absence of any unusual cell-physiologic stresses. In order to explore the possibly direct influence of p53 on the promoter of the CD44 gene, a 2 kb DNA segment located upstream of its transcription initiation site was introduced into a luciferase reporter vector. Since p53 can regulate transcription either directly by binding to a promoter sequence or indirectly via protein-protein interactions (Ho and Benchimol, 2003Ho J. Benchimol S. Transcriptional repression mediated by the p53 tumour suppressor.Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we distinguished between these alternative mechanisms by using two p53 mutants that are defective in DNA binding. As shown in Figure 2A, in contrast to their wild-type counterpart, which strongly repressed the activity of the CD44 promoter reporter construct, both p53 mutants failed to do so. Hence, the actions of p53 on the CD44 gene promoter appeared to require the intact DNA-binding activity of p53. It remained unclear, however, whether the observed repression was mediated by direct binding of p53 to the CD44 promoter. To address this issue, we attempted to identify a p53-response element in this promoter. Indeed, sequence analyses revealed a region within the CD44 promoter that exhibits strong sequence similarity to the noncanonical p53-binding site found in the MDR1 gene (Figure 2B) (Johnson et al., 2001Johnson R.A. Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. Transcriptional repression by p53 through direct binding to a novel DNA element.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27716-27720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which is known to contain four p53-binding elements. The canonical p53-binding site implicated in activation of transcription by p53 is comprised of two copies of the sequence PuPuPuC(A/T) arranged head to head and separated by 0–13 nucleotides, as is seen, for example, in the promoter of the p21Waf1 gene. The noncanonical p53-binding site in the MDR1 gene consists of four p53-binding sites that are oriented in an alternating head-to-tail arrangement (Johnson et al., 2001Johnson R.A. Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. Transcriptional repression by p53 through direct binding to a novel DNA element.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27716-27720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we created a mutant CD44 reporter construct bearing three point mutations in two of the four putative p53-response elements (Figure 2B). As shown in Figure 2C, the resulting mutant CD44 promoter was no longer repressed by ectopic expression of p53 in otherwise p53 null SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells. In addition, in the absence of ectopically expressed p53, the basal activity of the mutant promoter was about 20% lower than that of the wild-type promoter, suggesting the presence of some type of transcription-promoting site within the p53-response elements (Figure 2C). To prove that the CD44 reporter construct was also susceptible to p53-dependent repression when chromosomally integrated, we introduced constructs encoding the wild-type CD44 promoter, the mutant CD44 promoter, or a promoterless reporter, each driving a luciferase gene, into lentiviral vectors and used these to infect the BPEC-T cells with normal or experimentally suppressed p53 levels. The promoter activities of the resulting chromosomally integrated constructs closely paralleled those obtained from transient transfections of SAOS-2 cells (Figures 2A and 2C) and suggested that the above-described noncanonical p53-binding site is involved in repression of CD44 promoter activity in the presence of the basal p53 expression in BPEC-T cells (Figure S4). These results agreed with deletion analyses of the CD44 promoter performed in parallel (Figure S5). In order to confirm the direct physical interaction of p53 with sequences in the CD44 promoter, we extended these studies by performing gel-shift analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Using DNA oligonucleotides mimicking the potential p53-binding site, we demonstrated direct binding of p53 protein to the CD44 promoter sequence, as indicated by the retardation of electrophoretic migration in the presence of added purified p53 (Figure 2D). To analyze the specificity of this binding, we performed a competition assay with either an unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide or an oligonucleotide containing the base substitutions previously introduced into the promoter in the promoter-reporter assays described above. As shown in Figure 2E, the wild-type oligonucleotide was more efficient in displacing the labeled oligonucleotide from the complex with p53 protein than was the mutated one. In order to determine whether the interaction between CD44 promoter and p53 protein also occurs in vivo, we undertook chromatin immunoprecipitation of chromatin complexes containing p53 and analyzed them for the presence of a p53-response site in CD44 promoter. As shown in Figure S6, we were able to detect physical association of p53 with the CD44 promoter sequence in BPEC-T cells. These results provide evidence that p53 represses CD44 transcription via direct interaction with a specific site within the CD44 promoter located at position −239 to −263 bp relative to the transcription start site of the human CD44 gene (Shtivelman and Bishop, 1991Shtivelman E. Bishop J.M. Expression of CD44 is repressed in neuroblastoma cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5446-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Having found that p53 functions as a repressor of CD44 expression, we attempted to discover the cell-physiologic rationale of this repression. CD44 is known to act predominantly in a growth-promoting and antiapoptotic fashion (Ponta et al., 2003Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. CD44: From adhesion molecules to signalling regulators.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Because the tumor-suppressing function of p53 relies on inhibition of these processes, we hypothesized that p53 downregulates CD44 expression in order to prevent CD44 from compromising its growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic functions. At the biochemical level, CD44 is known to stimulate EGF-induced signaling (Bourguignon et al., 1997Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu H. Chu A. Iida N. Zhang L. Hung M.C. Interaction between the adhesion receptor, CD44, and the oncogene product, p185HER2, promotes human ovarian tumor cell activation.J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether CD44 could facilitate EGF signaling in the BPEC-T cells used in our experiments and, if so, whether such signaling influenced these cells' responses to p53-directed inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. To address these questions, we analyzed p53 function in the BPEC-T cells expressing normal levels of p53 (shLuc/GFP), in BPEC-T cells overexpressing the “standard” form of CD44 (which does not contain variable exons [shLuc/CD44s]), and in BPEC-T cells expressing an shRNA directed against p53 (shp53/GFP; Figure 3A).

This single blinded, dose escalating, controlled Phase 1 study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of recombinant Pfs25 and Pvs25 formulated with Montanide ISA 51, a water-in-oil emulsion. Methodology/Principal Findings The trial was conducted at The Johns Hopkins Center for Immunization Research, Washington DC, USA, between May 16, 2005–April 30, 2007. The trial was designed to enroll 72 healthy male and non-pregnant female volunteers into 1 group to receive adjuvant control and 6 groups to receive escalating doses of the vaccines. Due to unexpected reactogenicity, the vaccination was halted and only 36 volunteers were enrolled into 4 groups: 3 groups of 10 volunteers each were immunized with 5 µg of Pfs25/ISA 51, 5 µg of Pvs25/ISA 51, or 20 µg of Pvs25/ISA 51, respectively. A fourth group of 6 volunteers received adjuvant control (PBS/ISA 51). Frequent local reactogenicity was observed. Systemic adverse events included two cases of erythema nodosum considered to be probably related to the combination of the antigen and the adjuvant. Significant antibody responses were detected in volunteers who completed the lowest scheduled doses of Pfs25/ISA 51. Serum anti-Pfs25 levels correlated with transmission blocking activity. Conclusion/Significance It is feasible to induce transmission blocking immunity in humans using the Pfs25/ISA 51 vaccine, but these vaccines are unexpectedly reactogenic for further development. This is the first report that the formulation is associated with systemic adverse events including erythema nodosum. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00295581"
https://openalex.org/W2053110665,"To efficiently transcribe genes, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) must overcome barriers imposed by nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin structure. Many genes, including Drosophila melanogaster Hsp70, undergo changes in chromatin structure upon activation. To characterize these changes, we mapped the nucleosome landscape of Hsp70 after an instantaneous heat shock at high spatial and temporal resolution. Surprisingly, we find an initial disruption of nucleosomes across the entire gene within 30 s after activation, faster than the rate of Pol II transcription, followed by a second further disruption within 2 min. This initial change occurs independently of Pol II transcription. Furthermore, the rapid loss of nucleosomes extends beyond Hsp70 and halts at the scs and scs' insulating elements. An RNAi screen of 28 transcription and chromatin-related factors reveals that depletion of heat shock factor, GAGA Factor, or Poly(ADP)-Ribose Polymerase or its activity abolishes the loss of nucleosomes upon Hsp70 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2012676995,"Background When our PC goes on strike again we tend to curse it as if it were a human being. Why and under which circumstances do we attribute human-like properties to machines? Although humans increasingly interact directly with machines it remains unclear whether humans implicitly attribute intentions to them and, if so, whether such interactions resemble human-human interactions on a neural level. In social cognitive neuroscience the ability to attribute intentions and desires to others is being referred to as having a Theory of Mind (ToM). With the present study we investigated whether an increase of human-likeness of interaction partners modulates the participants' ToM associated cortical activity. Methodology/Principal Findings By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (subjects n = 20) we investigated cortical activity modulation during highly interactive human-robot game. Increasing degrees of human-likeness for the game partner were introduced by means of a computer partner, a functional robot, an anthropomorphic robot and a human partner. The classical iterated prisoner's dilemma game was applied as experimental task which allowed for an implicit detection of ToM associated cortical activity. During the experiment participants always played against a random sequence unknowingly to them. Irrespective of the surmised interaction partners' responses participants indicated having experienced more fun and competition in the interaction with increasing human-like features of their partners. Parametric modulation of the functional imaging data revealed a highly significant linear increase of cortical activity in the medial frontal cortex as well as in the right temporo-parietal junction in correspondence with the increase of human-likeness of the interaction partner (computer<functional robot<anthropomorphic robot<human). Conclusions/Significance Both regions correlating with the degree of human-likeness, the medial frontal cortex and the right temporo-parietal junction, have been associated with Theory-of-Mind. The results demonstrate that the tendency to build a model of another's mind linearly increases with its perceived human-likeness. Moreover, the present data provides first evidence of a contribution of higher human cognitive functions such as ToM in direct interactions with artificial robots. Our results shed light on the long-lasting psychological and philosophical debate regarding human-machine interaction and the question of what makes humans being perceived as human."

Odor space is largely conserved between two dissimilar olfactory systems. One of the great challenges of neuroscience is to understand the rules by which sensory input is translated into behavioral output. Enormous progress has been made in elucidating principles by which sensory information is encoded by receptors and cells of the peripheral nervous system. Less is known, however, about the internal representations of sensory stimuli at each successive level of circuitry. Anatomical studies have traced synaptic connections in early stages of some circuits, and electrophysiological or imaging studies have revealed how representations of stimuli are transformed at some of these stages. However, the overall logic by which sensory information dictates a particular behavioral response in an organism remains largely unknown. An important long-term goal is the ability to predict the behavior of an organism from the activity of its sensory receptors. In the case of olfaction, a major impediment to understanding how sensory input is translated into behavior is the numerical complexity of olfactory systems. A full molecular description of the sensory input into the system requires a functional analysis of the entire receptor repertoire. Olfactory systems of mammals and C. elegans contain hundreds of different receptors (Ache and Young, 2005Ache B.W. Young J.M. Olfaction: diverse species, conserved principles.Neuron. 2005; 48: 417-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and a functional analysis of an entire repertoire has not been possible with the available technology. In Drosophila, a large-scale analysis recently described the coding of odors by 24 antennal receptors (Hallem and Carlson, 2006Hallem E.A. Carlson J.R.

In this study, we present an analysis of the full receptor repertoire of an olfactory system and the behavior that it generates. The analysis concerns the olfactory system of the Drosophila larva, which is morphologically and developmentally distinct from that of the adult. Odors are sensed by the larval dorsal organ, a dome of cuticle at the anterior end of the larva that is perforated by pores through which odors can pass (Hertweck, 1931Hertweck H.

The dome is innervated by the dendrites of 21 olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). As in the adult fly and vertebrates, each ORN expresses one or a small number of receptors (Fishilevich et al., 2005Fishilevich E. Domingos A.I. Asahina K. Naef F. Vosshall L.B. Louis M.

Each ORN projects to a discrete region of the larval antennal lobe that is referred to as a glomerulus (Python and Stocker, 2002aPython F. Stocker R. Adult-like complexity of the larval antennal lobe of D. melanogaster despite markedly low numbers of odorant receptor neurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 445: 374-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Each glomerulus appears to be innervated by one projection neuron, which in turn sends an axon to one or two glomeruli in the mushroom body (Ramaekers et al., 2005Ramaekers A. Magnenat E. Marin E.C.

Biol. 2005; 15: 982-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The glomeruli of the antennal lobe are interconnected by local interneurons that arborize throughout the antennal lobe. Of the 60 Odor receptor (Or) genes of Drosophila, a subset was found to be expressed in the larva, and 11 of these were demonstrated to encode functional odor receptors (Kreher et al., 2005Kreher S.A. Kwon J.Y. Carlson J.R. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila larva.Neuron. 2005; 46: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The odor response spectra of these receptors were examined using the “empty neuron” system, an in vivo expression system based on a mutant ORN of the fly that lacks an endogenous receptor. Individual larval Or genes were expressed in this ORN, and the odor responses that they conferred were determined by electrophysiological recordings. These 11 genes represent less than half of the total larval odor receptor repertoire, however. Expression studies (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J.

Domingos A.I. Asahina K. Naef F. Vosshall L.B. Louis M. Chemotaxis behavior mediated by single larval olfactory neurons in Drosophila.Curr.

Approximately half of these larval Or genes are also expressed in the adult olfactory organs. Olfactory responses of fly larvae have inspired investigation since the 17th century (Cobb, 1999Cobb M.

Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Some odors elicit strong attractive responses, whereas others are repellent. A recent study showed that when ORNs expressing the Or1a, Or42a, or Or49a genes were genetically ablated, larval responses to subsets of odorants were defective (Fishilevich et al., 2005Fishilevich E. Domingos A.I. Asahina K. Naef F. Vosshall L.B. Louis M. Chemotaxis behavior mediated by single larval olfactory neurons in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2086-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Conversely, larvae containing only an Or42a-functional ORN, i.e., larvae in which the only functional ORN is one that expresses Or42a, were able to respond to a subset of stimuli. This study further showed that, although larvae containing only Or1a- or Or49a-functional ORNs did not chemotax toward any tested odors, larvae containing both an Or42a-functional ORN and either an Or1a-functional ORN or an Or49a-functional ORN responded to a somewhat different subset of odorants than did larvae containing only an Or42a-functional ORN. These data supported a model in which the larval behavioral response depends on the combined input from multiple odor receptors. The results illustrate the value of a systematic analysis of the role of the entire larval receptor repertoire in generating behavior. To investigate the logic by which sensory input is converted to behavioral output, we first define odor response spectra for the full larval odor receptor repertoire. We measure behavioral responses to all odorants of the panel and find that the responses show a smooth distribution from strong attractive responses to repellent responses. We then examine the perceptual relationship among odors. A 21-dimensional odor space is constructed from the responses of the 21 receptors, and the distance between two odors in the space correlates with the likelihood that one odor will mask the other. We then examine how the responses of multiple receptors are integrated to generate behavior. Using mutants of receptor genes, we show that responses to different concentrations of an odorant depend on different receptors. Or42b, which in electrophysiological analysis has a low threshold for ethyl acetate, is required for behavioral response to low concentrations of ethyl acetate; Or42a, which has a high threshold, is required for behavioral response to high concentrations. We next consider responses to all odors of the panel and find that the summed receptor input across the entire receptor repertoire shows a modest correlation with the behavioral response index. We then find that the behavioral response can be predicted with surprising accuracy from the responses of a small subset of receptors. Moreover, odors that inhibit many receptors are more likely to be repellents, and a discriminant function is able to distinguish repellents from nonrepellents on the basis of receptor responses. Finally, we provide evidence that odor space is largely conserved between two dissimilar olfactory systems: those of the larva and the adult. A consensus set of 25 larval Or receptors was identified on the basis of three studies of Or gene expression (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J.

The expression of these 25 genes in larval ORNs has been documented either by in situ hybridization (Fishilevich et al., 2005Fishilevich E. Domingos A.I. Asahina K. Naef F. Vosshall L.B. Louis M.

The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila larva.Neuron. 2005; 46: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We have expressed all 25 genes in the empty neuron system and tested them with a diverse panel of odorants. Previous work found that the response spectrum, response mode, i.e., excitation or inhibition, and temporal dynamics of antennal receptors were the same in the empty neuron as in the ORN in which they were normally expressed (Hallem et al., 2004bHallem E.A. Ho M.G. Carlson J.R. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Cell. 2004; 117: 965-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The present analysis includes 14 receptors that were not tested in our earlier study of larval odor receptors (Kreher et al., 2005Kreher S.A. Kwon J.Y. Carlson J.R. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila larva.Neuron. 2005; 46: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and it extends the analysis of the other 11 receptors. Of the 25 Or genes, 21 conferred odor responses. Alleles of the remaining four genes (Or1a, Or33a, Or63a, and Or83a) in our laboratory Canton-S strain appeared to be nonfunctional. They did not confer a regular pattern of spontaneous action potentials, and they did not confer any odor-evoked responses when expressed from genomic constructs in the empty neuron system. Or1a and Or33a each contain an amino acid polymorphism, in comparison to another wild-type strain, Oregon-R. The Oregon-R alleles conferred a regular pattern of spontaneous action potentials; the Oregon-R allele of Or33a did not confer strong responses (≥100 spikes/s) to any odorant of our panel or to mixtures representing 100 odorants (Figure S1A available online and data not shown). The Oregon-R allele of Or1a yielded a response >50 spikes/s only to a mixture containing methyl benzoate, which activates an Or1a-expressing ORN in that strain (Fishilevich et al., 2005Fishilevich E. Domingos A.I. Asahina K. Naef F. Vosshall L.B. Louis M. Chemotaxis behavior mediated by single larval olfactory neurons in Drosophila.Curr.

Bilateral olfactory sensory input enhances chemotaxis behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Not only did Or63a not function when expressed from Canton-S genomic DNA, but it did not function when expressed from Canton-S cDNA or from Oregon-R genomic DNA. We recovered a second allele of Or83a from Canton-S that contains a premature stop codon. In summary, the simplest interpretation of our results is that, in our Canton-S laboratory strain, 21 Or genes encode functional odor receptors. The 21 receptors were systematically tested with 26 diverse odorants, each examined at two concentrations, and CO2; thus, 1113 receptor-odorant combinations were tested (Figure 1). The odorants were selected to include ketones, aromatics, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, a terpene, and an organic acid, and they include compounds of varying chain lengths. We initially tested the odorants as “10−2” dilutions (see Experimental Procedures); this dosage has been used in many previous studies (De Bruyne et al., 2001De Bruyne M. Foster K. Carlson J.R.

Lower concentrations were administered as 10−4 dilutions (Hallem and Carlson, 2006Hallem E.A. Carlson J.R. Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.Cell. 2006; 125: 143-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). At the higher concentration tested, 19% of the receptor-odorant combinations yielded an excitatory response of ≥50 spikes/s; 12% yielded a strong response, defined here as ≥100 spikes/s; 8% yielded a response of ≥150 spikes/s; and 4% yielded a response of ≥200 spikes/s (Figures 1A and S2A). Receptors varied a great deal in the number of odorants that excited them strongly. At one extreme, Or67b was strongly excited by eight odorants (30% of the panel), and Or42a and Or85c were strongly excited by seven at the higher concentration. At the other extreme, four of the 21 receptors were not strongly excited by any odorants. The receptors showed a smooth distribution between these two extremes (Figure S2A). Odorants varied according to the number of receptors that they strongly excited. 1-hexanol elicited a strong excitatory response from six receptors at the higher concentration, whereas four compounds did not strongly excite any receptor (Figure 1A). Inhibitory responses, defined as a reduction in the firing rate to ≤50% of the spontaneous level, were also observed (Figures 1 and S2A). At the higher doses, most odorants inhibited at least one receptor, and most receptors were inhibited by at least one odorant. Our estimate of the extent of inhibition should be regarded as an approximation. For example, it is difficult to observe inhibition in the receptors with low spontaneous firing rates. We also note that we have adopted a conservative definition of inhibition. A small fraction of the odorant-receptor combinations tested here were also evaluated in a previous study of antennal receptors (Hallem and Carlson, 2006Hallem E.A. Carlson J.R. Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.Cell. 2006; 125: 143-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The results are generally in good agreement (see Experimental Procedures). At lower odorant concentrations, strong excitatory responses are much more sparse. When the concentration was reduced by two orders of magnitude, the percentage of combinations producing ≥50 spikes/s fell from 19% to 4%, the percentage producing ≥100 spikes/s fell from 12% to 2%, and the percentage producing ≥200 spikes/s fell from 4% to 1% (Figure 1B). Of the nine receptors that responded strongly to at least one odorant at low concentrations, six responded strongly to one odorant only. No odorant elicited a strong response from more than one receptor. We have established tuning curves for each receptor of the larval repertoire, at each concentration tested (Figure 2). When tested with 10−2 dilutions, the tuning curves showed a range of tuning breadths, with some receptors appearing very broadly tuned. By contrast, when tested with 10−4 dilutions, none of the receptors appeared broadly tuned, and many appeared more narrowly tuned. Having thus examined the physiological responses generated by each odor of the panel, we then measured the behavioral responses of the larva to each odor. We used a simple behavioral paradigm in which larvae migrate across a Petri plate toward a source of odorant (Figure 3A). A response index (RI) was calculated at the end of a 5 min test period, as in earlier studies (Monte et al., 1989Monte P. Woodard C. Ayer R. Lilly M. Sun H. Carlson J. Characterization of the larval olfactory response in Drosophila and its genetic basis.Behav. Genet. 1989; 19: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, Rodrigues and Siddiqi, 1978Rodrigues V. Siddiqi O. Genetic Analysis of Chemosensory Pathway.Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences Section B. 1978; 87: 147-160Google Scholar), by counting the number of animals, S, on the half of the plate containing the odorant, subtracting the number, C, on the control half, and dividing by the total; thus, RI = (S − C)/(S + C). The RI ranges from 1 (complete attraction) to 0 (no response) to −1 (complete repulsion). The odors of the panel elicited a broad range of responses (Figure 3B). Most odors were attractive at the test concentration, with E2-hexenal eliciting the strongest response: RI = 0.74 ± 0.07 (n = 10 trials). Among repellents, the strongest was geranyl acetate: RI = −0.40 ± 0.07 (n = 10 trials; for statistical analysis of repellency, see Experimental Procedures). Odorants of diverse chemical classes elicited strong responses of the same response mode, i.e., the strongest attractants (E2-hexenal, propyl acetate, 2-heptanone) are an aldehyde, ester, and ketone, respectively. Likewise, the repellents included a terpene, a ketone, an alcohol, and aromatics. We used the responses of the receptor repertoire to examine perceptual relationships among odorants. We constructed a 21-dimensional odor space in which each dimension represents the response of one odor receptor in spikes/s. Odorants were plotted in this space based on the responses they elicited at a 10−2 dilution. We then calculated distances pairwise between all odorants. Two kinds of distances were determined. First, Euclidean distances were calculated pairwise between all odorants. Second, angular distances were calculated, based on the angle between the two vectors that extend from the origin of the 21-dimensional space to each of the two odorants (see Experimental Procedures). From the matrix of distances, we constructed two separate three-dimensional projections of odor space, one based on the Euclidean distances and one based on the angular distances, using multidimensional scaling (MDS; Figure 4A). The closest and most distant pairs of odorants in terms of Euclidean distance are shown in Figure 4B. Members of the closest pairs are structurally related. (We exclude from consideration three odorants that fail to elicit a response of >50 spikes/s from any receptor and that map near each other for this reason.) The most distant relationships, by contrast, are in each case between an aliphatic and an aromatic odorant. In the case of angular distance, the most closely related pairs are again structurally related, and the distant pairs are again structurally dissimilar (Figure 4C). The two closest pairs in angular distance are also two of the closest in Euclidean distance. Overall, the Euclidean and angular distances were generally concordant for pairs of odors that were close in odor space but showed less agreement for pairs of odors that were more distant (Figure S3). We note that in general the Euclidean distance is more sensitive to the magnitudes of receptor responses, whereas the angular distance is more sensitive to the “pattern” of receptor firing, i.e., to the identity of the responding receptors. (Consider, for example, two vectors in a three-dimensional space whose directions are very similar; increasing the magnitude of one vector will have an effect on the Euclidean distance but not on the angular distance.) The Euclidean distances among odors were used as the basis of a hierarchical cluster analysis (Figure S4), which shows that in a number of cases structurally similar odors clustered together, although in no case did all odorants of a particular structural class cluster together. We then asked whether two odorants that are close in odor space are close in perceptual qualities. There are several paradigms for examining perceptual relationships between two odorants. We have examined odor masking, a phenomenon that is convenient to measure and may be of direct importance to animals in their natural environment by affecting what odors they perceive. The odor masking paradigm is based on the behavioral paradigm shown in Figure 3A. Responses to a point source of odorant A are measured in the presence of a background of odorant B; odorant B is uniformly distributed across a filter that covers nearly the entire lid of the Petri dish in which the assay is conducted. We then determine whether the background of odorant B decreases the response of the animals to odorant A. This paradigm was used in a previous study of Drosophila larvae (Rodrigues, 1980Rodrigues V. Olfactory behavior of Drosophila melanogaster. Plenum, New York1980Google Scholar), and a very similar paradigm has been used in C. elegans (L'Etoile and Bargmann, 2000L'Etoile N.D. Bargmann C.I.

Bargmann C.I. C. elegans odour discrimination requires asymmetric diversity in olfactory neurons.Nature. 2001; 410: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar): if the worms responded to odor A in a background of B, then they were inferred to be able to discriminate A from B; if they cannot discriminate A from B, then a background of A was expected to block the response to B. We will interpret the results not in terms of discrimination but in terms of masking. The ability to identify odors in a background of other odors has also been described as odor segmentation (Wilson and Mainen, 2006Wilson R.I. Mainen Z.F. Early events in olfactory processing.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). As an initial test, we asked whether the response to a point source of odorant A was decreased by the presence of a background of odorant A. We found that the response to a 10−4 dilution of ethyl acetate was in fact decreased by a background of ethyl acetate (Figure 5A). The mean response to the ethyl acetate source decreased progressively as the dose of the background odor was increased, over six orders of magnitude: a severe decrease was observed when the dilution of the masking odoran"
https://openalex.org/W2052456480,"The Arp2/3 complex is an actin nucleator that plays a critical role in many cellular processes. Its activities are regulated by nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) that function primarily during plasma membrane dynamics. Here we identify a mammalian NPF called WHAMM (WASP homolog associated with actin, membranes, and microtubules) that localizes to the cis-Golgi apparatus and tubulo-vesicular membrane transport intermediates. The modular organization of WHAMM includes an N-terminal domain that mediates Golgi membrane association, a coiled-coil region that binds microtubules, and a WCA segment that stimulates Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. Overexpression and depletion studies indicate that WHAMM is important for maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating anterograde membrane transport. The ability of WHAMM to interact with microtubules plays a role in membrane tubulation, while its capacity to induce actin assembly promotes tubule elongation. Thus, WHAMM is an important regulator of membrane dynamics functioning at the interface of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons."

We report that the stochastic and monoallelic expression of the IFN-β gene depends on interchromosomal associations with three identified distinct genetic loci that could mediate binding of the limiting transcription factor NF-κB to the IFN-β enhancer, thus triggering enhanceosome assembly and activation of transcription from this allele. The probability of a cell to express IFN-β is dramatically increased when the cell is transfected with any of these loci. The secreted IFN-β protein induces high-level expression of the enhanceosome factor IRF-7, which in turn promotes enhanceosome assembly and IFN-β transcription from the remaining alleles and in other initially nonexpressing cells. Thus, the IFN-β enhancer functions in a nonlinear fashion by working as a signal amplifier.

The human antiviral response is triggered by the transcriptional activation of type I interferon genes (20 IFN-α, 5 IFN-ω, and 1 IFN-β) (Paun and Pitha, 2007Paun A. Pitha P.M. The innate antiviral response: new insights into a continuing story.Adv. Virus Res. 2007; 69: 1-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2002Taniguchi T. Takaoka A.

Immunol. 2002; 14: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This leads to the production and secretion of IFN proteins that bind to type I IFN receptors on the surface of both infected and uninfected cells, leading to the expression of a large number of antiviral genes (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006Stetson D.B. Medzhitov R. Types I interferons in host defense.Immunity. 2006; 25: 373-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the human IFN-β gene requires an enhancer element located immediately upstream of the core promoter. The IFN-β enhancer is recognized by three distinct sets of transcription factors (NF-κB, IRFs, and ATF-2/cJun) and by the architectural protein HMGI(Y). Virus infection leads to the coordinate activation of all three types of transcription factors, which assemble on the IFN enhancer to form a multiprotein complex known as the IFN-β enhanceosome (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995Thanos D. Maniatis T. Virus induction of human IFN beta gene expression requires the assembly of an enhanceosome.Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Enhanceosome assembly occurs only after viral infection and not in response to other signals that can separately activate each of the transcription factors (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995Thanos D.

Thanos D. Modifying gene expression programs by altering core promoter chromatin architecture.Cell. 2002; 110: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This combinatorial mechanism is based on the fact that virus infection is the only known signal that can activate all of the IFN-β transcriptional activators simultaneously (Maniatis et al., 1998Maniatis T. Falvo J.V. Kim T.H. Kim T.K. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Wathelet M.G. Structure and function of the interferon−beta enhanceosome.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant.

Biol. 1999; 64: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Following its assembly on the nucleosome-free enhancer, the enhanceosome instructs the ordered recruitment of chromatin modifiers and basal transcription factors to the nearby promoter (Agalioti et al., 2000Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Ordered recruitment of chromatin modifying and general transcription factors to the IFN-beta promoter.Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). This recruitment program culminates with sliding of a nucleosome masking the core promoter, thus allowing the binding of RNA polymerase II and the initiation of transcription (Lomvardas and Thanos, 2001Lomvardas S. Thanos D. Nucleosome sliding via TBP DNA binding in vivo.Cell. 2001; 106: 685-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The cooperative assembly of the enhanceosome and the organization of nucleosomes in the enhancer/promoter region ensure a high degree of specificity in the transcriptional response. Thus, aberrant transcription from individual transcription factors that are each activated by a variety of other signals (TNF-α, IFNs, stress, etc.) is prevented (Lomvardas and Thanos, 2002Lomvardas S. Thanos D. Modifying gene expression programs by altering core promoter chromatin architecture.Cell. 2002; 110: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Previous biochemical and structure determination experiments revealed an unexpected complexity in the mechanisms driving enhanceosome assembly. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a stepwise assembly of the enhanceosome (Munshi et al., 2001Munshi N. Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G. Thanos D. Coordination of a transcriptional switch by HMGI(Y) acetylation.Science. 2001; 293: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, Lomvardas and Thanos, 2002Lomvardas S. Thanos D.

More specifically, NF-κB is initially detected at the IFN-β enhancer at 2 hr after virus infection together with IRF-1, whereas ATF-2 is recruited to the enhancer an hour later followed by the arrival of IRF-3 and c-Jun. IRF-7 is incorporated into the enhanceosome just before initiation of transcription (5–6 hr post-infection). The enhanceosome remains intact for 6 additional hours, and this correlates with the peak of transcriptional activation. The three-dimensional structure of the intact enhanceosome, as deduced from the assembly of separate structures of pairs of transcription factors bound to their sites, revealed that cooperative assembly derives from binding-induced changes in DNA conformation and to a lesser extent from protein-protein interactions (Escalante et al., 2007Escalante C.R. Nistal-Villan E. Shen L. Garcia-Sastre A. Aggarwal A.K. Structure of IRF-3 bound to the PRDIII-I element of the human interferon−βeta enhancer.Mol.

This observation is in agreement with the stepwise assembly of the enhanceosome in vivo (Munshi et al., 2001Munshi N. Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G. Thanos D.

This heterogeneity is not due to mixed populations of producing and nonproducing cells but rather is a stochastic phenomenon, as revealed by cell cloning experiments (Zawatzky et al., 1985Zawatzky R.

An additional characteristic of cytokine gene expression is that gene activation is predominantly monoallelic, thus further underscoring the stochastic mode of gene regulation. A recent study applying single cell RT-PCR analysis and stochastic model simulation provided initial evidence for allelic imbalance of virus-induced IFN-β gene transcription (Hu et al., 2007Hu J.

Chromosome-specific and noisy IFNB1 transcription in individual virus-infected human primary dendritic cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5232-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of stochastic IFN-β gene expression and allelic imbalance remain elusive. What transcription mechanism can assure the random choice of cells expressing IFN-β after virus infection? One attractive model invokes the transcription process itself and therefore is likely associated with the inherent complexity of enhanceosome assembly on the IFN-β enhancer/promoter. Since enhanceosome assembly is a cooperative process, we asked whether limiting concentrations of one or some of the IFN-β activators accounts for the stochastic assembly of enhanceosomes thus leading to binary transcriptional switches. We present evidence for a model in which virus infection induces the stochastic expression of the IFN-β gene from a single allele in a small population of cells. The choice of the allele to be expressed depends on interchromosomal associations with three identified distinct genetic loci that could mediate binding of the limiting transcription factor NF-κB to the IFN-β enhancer promoting enhanceosome assembly and activation of transcription from this allele. The secreted IFN-β protein induces high-level expression of the enhanceosome factor IRF-7, which in turn promotes enhanceosome assembly and IFN-β transcription from the remaining alleles and in other initially nonexpressing cells. Thus, the IFN-β enhancer functions in a nonlinear fashion and works as a signal amplifier. To investigate whether individual enhanceosome components are present in cells at suboptimal concentrations, we transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors producing each of the IFN-β activators, followed by virus infection for 6 hr and hybridization with an antisense IFN-β digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe. Control experiments using GFP reporters have indicated that under our conditions approximately 90% of HeLa cells can be transfected (data not shown). Figures 1A and 1B show that only 20% of the cells in the population transcribe the IFN-β gene in response to virus infection, a result consistent with previous studies (Zawatzky et al., 1985Zawatzky R.

Remarkably, the percentage of IFN-β-producing cells after virus infection increases to 75%, when the cells were transfected with an expression vector producing the p65 subunit of NF-κB and to 55% after IRF-7 expression. Smaller increases were observed when either ATF-2/cJun, IRF-1, or IRF-3 were expressed, whereas increasing the concentration of HMGI(Y) did not affect the number of cells expressing IFN-β (Figures 1A and 1B). In control experiments we showed that hybridization with a sense IFN-β RNA probe did not produce a signal (data not shown). The increase in the number of IFN-β-producing cells is also reflected in the amount of total IFN-β mRNA produced, as seen by the RT-PCR experiment shown in Figure 1C. These experiments suggest that NF-κB, IRF-7, IRF-3, and to a lesser extent ATF-2/cJun and IRF-1 exist at suboptimal concentrations within the cells and the failure of some cells to express IFN-β can be bypassed by increasing the cellular concentration of these proteins. The increase of IFN-β-expressing cells is not observed in uninfected cells (not shown), indicating that overexpression of these factors did not bypass the requirement for enhanceosome assembly after virus infection. To test whether NF-κB overexpression increases not only the percentage of IFN-β-expressing cells but also the amount of IFN-β mRNA produced per cell, we carried out the experiment shown in Figure 1D. HeLa cells were transfected with the NF-κB expression vector along with a GFP vector and the cells were either mock or virus infected. GFP-positive cells were isolated by cell sorting, and the amount of IFN-β mRNA was determined by real-time RT-PCR. As seen in the figure, the increase in IFN-β mRNA production (4.1-fold) is similar to the increase of the number of cells (3.5-fold) producing IFN-β expression following NF-κB overexpression (Figure 1B). Thus, the IFN-β expression levels per cell are not significantly affected by NF-κB overexpression. The low concentration of NF-κB within cells (approximately 50.000 molecules, Hottiger et al., 1998Hottiger M.O. Felzien L.K. Nabel G.J.

Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G. Thanos D. Coordination of a transcriptional switch by HMGI(Y) acetylation.Science. 2001; 293: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) poses a major question regarding the mechanism by which NF-κB locates the IFN-β gene and nucleates enhanceosome assembly in the context of the human genome. We hypothesized that there exist “specialized” NF-κB sites that might be capable of interacting with NF-κB immediately and preferentially after its entry into the nucleus. Next, NF-κB could associate with the promoters of target genes via inter- and/or intrachromosomal interactions, thus “delivering” the factor to the correct site. Since interchromosomal interactions are stochastic in nature (de Laat and Grosveld, 2007de Laat W. Grosveld F. Inter-chromosomal gene regulation in the mammalian cell nucleus.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Misteli, 2007Misteli T. Beyond the sequence: cellular organization of genome function.Cell. 2007; 128: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), such a model could explain some of the features of IFN-β expression discussed above. To test this idea we employed circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) (Ling et al., 2006Ling J.Q. Li T. Hu J.F. Vu T.H. Chen H.L. Qiu X.W. Cherry A.M. Hoffman A.R.

Genet. 2006; 38: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (Figure 2A). The 4C method is based on the proximity ligation principle, in which DNA-protein complexes existing in trans will generate circular DNA molecules (3C) (Dekker et al., 2002Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Capturing chromosome conformation.Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Sequences interacting with a known gene (IFN-β) can be cloned by inverse PCR using gene-specific primers without any prior knowledge of their identities. HeLa cells were mock or virus infected for 4 hr, followed by formaldehyde crosslinking. The crosslinked chromatin was digested with EcoRI (flanking the IFN-β gene), followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation using a p65-specific antibody. The precipitated and digested chromatin was diluted and DNA ligase was added to covalently link DNA sequences that colocalize in the nucleus independent of their location. After removing the protein, nested PCR primers were used to detect interacting sequences. Using a pair of nested PCR primers (Figure 2A) we detected sequences from a wide range of sizes in the crosslinked chromatin (Figure 2B, lane 4) derived from virus-infected cells but not in any of the controls, including genomic DNA (Figure 2B, lane 1), EcoRI-cleaved but not ligated chromatin DNA (lane 2) derived from virus-infected cells, or EcoRI-cleaved and -ligated chromatin DNA derived from uninfected cells (lane 3). Subsequent sequence analysis of the 4C samples from virus-infected cells identified three unique sequences that appear to interact with IFN-β (Figures 2C and S1 available online). Remarkably, all three clones possess specialized Alu repeats, known as AluSX and AluY (Polak and Domany, 2006Polak P. Domany E. Alu elements contain many binding sites for transcription factors and may play a role in regulation of developmental processes.BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 133Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which contain the putative NF-κB binding site GGGTTTCACC deviating from the consensus GGGRNYYCC in two nucleotides (underlined). Clones #14 and #9 contain two copies of the specialized NF-κB motif (Figure S1). Clone #21 resides on chromosome 4, #14 on chromosome 9, and #9 on chromosome 18. Of note, the IFN-β gene resides on chromosome 9 (9p21). Thus, #14 and IFN-β reside near the two ends of chromosome 9 in humans. To examine whether the three identified loci interact with the IFN-β locus, we performed 3C assays using primers specific for IFN-β and for each of the clones. Figure 2D (lanes 1, 7, and 13) shows that in uninfected cells there is no detectable PCR product generated using primer pairs either from #21, or #14, or #9 and IFN-β. However, PCR products were detected when the chromatin DNA used was prepared from virus-infected cells (Figure 2D, lanes 2–4, 8–10, and 14–16). The products were detected as early as 2 hr after virus infection, peaked at 4 hr, and were decreased at 6 hr post-infection, indicating that these interactions occur primarily during enhanceosome assembly at the IFN-β locus. In each instance, the size of the PCR products was that predicted for the ligation of IFN-β with each of the clones and the identity of the products was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (data not shown). Furthermore, the specificity of the interactions between the IFN-β locus and at least one of the clones (#21) was verified in 4C-ChIP experiments using inverse PCR-nested primers from the genomic locus of #21. In this experiment we cloned the IFN-β locus three times, underscoring the strength and the specificity of these interactions (data not shown). To further validate the 4C data and to demonstrate the physical colocalization of IFN-β with clones #21, #9, and #14, we performed three-dimensional DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using HeLa cells that were either mock or virus infected for 4 hr. Figure 3A shows that the IFN-β probe detects six or seven IFN-β genes, whereas probes for #21, #9, and #14 detect three, three, and six or seven loci in HeLa cells, respectively. This is due to the fact that HeLa cells are polyploid. In mock-infected cells we detected no evidence of colocalization between IFN-β and any of the clones (Figure 3A, left column). Remarkably, in some virus-infected cells, one allele of IFN-β is specifically colocalized with one allele of #21, or #14, or #9 (Figure 3, right column). FISH experiments using a BAC clone containing different AluSX repeats fail to detect colocalization with the IFN-β locus before or after virus infection (not shown). These FISH experiments confirmed our results obtained using the 3C technique (Figure 2). FISH experiments performed on nuclei from virus-infected cells for different amounts of time indicated that these interactions are transient since they appear 2 hr post-infection, peak at 4 hr, and decline significantly at 8 hr post-infection (Figure 3B), a result consistent with the 3C analysis of Figure 2D. Thus, interchromosomal associations between the IFN-β locus and these loci occur at maximal frequencies before initiation of transcription and during enhanceosome assembly (2–6 hr), and they are significantly reduced at the time of initiation and propagation of transcription (6–8 hr). In control experiments, FISH was performed with the IL-8 gene (a known NF-κB target virus-inducible gene) and clones #21, #14, and #9 in mock- or virus-infected cells. No specific colocalization was detected between these loci and the IL-8 gene, nor between the IFN-β and IL-8 genes (data not shown). By contrast, the 4C clone #21 (#14 and #9 not shown) was colocalized with the IκBα gene (another NF-κB target) (Figure S2). The interaction between IκBα and our 4C clones prompted us to examine whether the IFN-β and IκBα genes are colocalized after virus infection. As seen in Figure S2, 11% of virus-infected cells show colocalization between the IFN-β and IκBα genes. Thus, the IFN-β and IκBα genes, which are activated by NF-κB, colocalize after virus infection. These colocalizations appear to be gene specific since not all NF-κB-regulated genes colocalize either with the 4C clones or between them. To test whether the 4C isolated genomic loci colocalize before or after virus infection, we carried out FISH experiments using probes for each 4C clone. The results showed a markedly high frequency of colocalization between 4C clones #14 and #21 even before virus infection (Figure 3C). These interactions are specific since the IFN-β gene located on the same chromosome as #14 does not colocalize with any of these clones before virus infection. The interchromosomal interactions are further increased upon virus infection (Figure 3C). Remarkably, triple FISH experiments revealed the simultaneous interaction of IFN-β with these 4C loci, albeit in a lower percentage of cells (Figures 3D and 3E). These results showed that the widely separated 4C clones colocalize before virus infection and interact together with the IFN-β gene after virus infection. We have shown that one IFN-β allele interacts with one allele from each of the 4C clones only in response to virus infection (Figure 3). At the peak of interaction (Figure 3B), the total percentage of IFN-β interacting alleles in the cell population is 27%, a number that is similar to the percentage of cells expressing IFN-β following virus infection (Figure 1). Therefore, we asked whether these interchromosomal interactions correlate with IFN-β RNA production. We combined DNA FISH with RNA FISH to determine whether the 4C clones colocalize with the transcribed IFN-β gene following virus infection. Figure 4A shows that only one IFN-β allele is transcribed at 6 hr following virus infection. Remarkably, this allele colocalizes with a single allele from the 4C clones (Figures 4B–4D) with frequencies similar to those described in Figure 3B for the 6 hr time point. The triple RNA/DNA FISH experiment of Figure 4E shows that the single IFN-β allele interacting with the 4C clone #21 is the one expressing IFN-β mRNA. As a control we showed that the IFN-β RNA is not detected in uninfected cells and that the IFN-β RNA signal is lost when virus-infected cells are treated with RNase A (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that interchromosomal associations occurring between single alleles from the 4C clones and IFN-β in a cell population correlate with monoallelic IFN-β transcription. The total percentage of cells showing maximal monoallelic interchromosomal interactions at 4 hr post-infection (27.1%, Figure 4F) correlates to the total percentage of cells expressing the IFN-β gene from a single allele at 6 hr (22%, Figure 4A). These experiments suggest that the IFN-β RNA is transcribed from a single IFN-β allele interacting with a single allele from any of the 4C isolated loci. Since the experiments described above have been carried out in HeLa cells that are polyploid, we repeated the DNA, DNA-RNA FISH, and the triple FISH experiments in diploid human epithelial cells (HCT-116) and obtained qualitatively similar results (Figure S3), thus indicating the biological significance of our observations. The experiments of Figure 4 were performed using cells infected with virus for 6 hr. This is the time point at which IFN-β transcription begins. However, at this time point there is a decreased interaction between IFN-β and the 4C clones, and this interaction is lost at the peak of IFN-β transcription (Figure 3). Since there are no interchromosomal interactions at later time points (not shown) we can't further correlate IFN-β RNA expression with interaction with the 4C clones. However, when we repeated the DNA-RNA FISH using IFN-β probes and cells infected with Sendai virus for longer times we found that gradually the remaining IFN-β alleles begin to express IFN-β RNA (Figure 5A), a result consistent with the gradual decrease of intrinsic noise of IFN-β expression reported recently (Hu et al., 2007Hu J.

We demonstrate with dynamic imaging that loss of EphBs results in reduced motility of filopodia in cultured cortical neurons and brain slice. EphB knockdown and rescue experiments during different developmental time windows show that EphBs are required for synaptogenesis only when filopodia are most abundant and motile. In the context of EphB knockdown and reduced filopodia motility, independent rescue of either motility with PAK or of Eph-ephrin binding with an EphB2 kinase mutant is not sufficient to restore synapse formation. Strikingly, the combination of PAK and kinase-inactive EphB2 rescues synaptogenesis. Deletion of the ephrin-binding domain from EphB2 precludes rescue, indicating that both motility and trans-cellular interactions are required. Our findings provide a mechanistic link between dendritic filopodia motility and synapse differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2064073119,"Both reward- and punishment-related stimuli are motivationally salient and attract the attention of animals. However, it remains unclear how motivational salience is processed in the brain. Here, we show that both reward- and punishment-predicting stimuli elicited robust bursting of many noncholinergic basal forebrain (BF) neurons in behaving rats. The same BF neurons also responded with similar bursting to primary reinforcement of both valences. Reinforcement responses were modulated by expectation, with surprising reinforcement eliciting stronger BF bursting. We further demonstrate that BF burst firing predicted successful detection of near-threshold stimuli. Together, our results point to the existence of a salience-encoding system independent of stimulus valence. We propose that the encoding of motivational salience by ensemble bursting of noncholinergic BF neurons may improve behavioral performance by affecting the activity of widespread cortical circuits and therefore represents a novel candidate mechanism for top-down attention."
https://openalex.org/W2097642599,"Background Osteoporosis is the most prevalent skeletal disorder, characterized by a low bone mineral density (BMD) and bone structural deterioration, leading to bone fragility fractures. Accelerated bone resorption by osteoclasts has been established as a principal mechanism in osteoporosis. However, recent experimental evidences suggest that inappropriate apoptosis of osteoblasts/osteocytes accounts for, at least in part, the imbalance in bone remodeling as occurs in osteoporosis. The aim of this study is to examine whether aspirin, which has been reported as an effective drug improving bone mineral density in human epidemiology studies, regulates the balance between bone resorption and bone formation at stem cell levels. Methods and Findings We found that T cell-mediated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC) impairment plays a crucial role in ovariectomized-induced osteoporosis. Ex vivo mechanistic studies revealed that T cell-mediated BMMSC impairment was mainly attributed to the apoptosis of BMMSCs via the Fas/Fas ligand pathway. To explore potential of using pharmacologic stem cell based intervention as an approach for osteoporosis treatment, we selected ovariectomy (OVX)-induced ostoeporosis mouse model to examine feasibility and mechanism of aspirin-mediated therapy for osteoporosis. We found that aspirin can inhibit T cell activation and Fas ligand induced BMMSC apoptosis in vitro. Further, we revealed that aspirin increases osteogenesis of BMMSCs by aiming at telomerase activity and inhibits osteoclast activity in OVX mice, leading to ameliorating bone density. Conclusion Our findings have revealed a novel osteoporosis mechanism in which activated T cells induce BMMSC apoptosis via Fas/Fas ligand pathway and suggested that pharmacologic stem cell based intervention by aspirin may be a new alternative in osteoporosis treatment including activated osteoblasts and inhibited osteoclasts."

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR), an element participating in immunity against phages' invasion, is composed of short repeated sequences separated by unique spacers and provides the basis of the spoligotyping technology. In the present research, three CRISPR loci were analyzed in 125 strains of Y. pestis from 26 natural plague foci of China, the former Soviet Union and Mongolia were analyzed, for validating CRISPR-based genotyping method and better understanding adaptive microevolution of Y. pestis.Using PCR amplification, sequencing and online data processing, a high degree of genetic diversity was revealed in all three CRISPR elements. The distribution of spacers and their arrays in Y. pestis strains is strongly region and focus-specific, allowing the construction of a hypothetic evolutionary model of Y. pestis. This model suggests transmission route of microtus strains that encircled Takla Makan Desert and ZhunGer Basin. Starting from Tadjikistan, one branch passed through the Kunlun Mountains, and moved to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Another branch went north via the Pamirs Plateau, the Tianshan Mountains, the Altai Mountains and the Inner Mongolian Plateau. Other Y. pestis lineages might be originated from certain areas along those routes.CRISPR can provide important information for genotyping and evolutionary research of bacteria, which will help to trace the source of outbreaks.

https://openalex.org/W2002016207,"Olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) in mice express only 1 of a possible 1,100 odor receptors (OR) and axons from OSNs expressing the same odor receptor converge into ∼2 of the 1,800 glomeruli in each olfactory bulb (OB) in mice; this yields a convergence ratio that approximates 2∶1, 2 glomeruli/OR. Because humans express only 350 intact ORs, we examined human OBs to determine if the glomerular convergence ratio of 2∶1 established in mice was applicable to humans. Unexpectedly, the average number of human OB glomeruli is >5,500 yielding a convergence ratio of ∼16∶1. The data suggest that the initial coding of odor information in the human OB may differ from the models developed for rodents and that recruitment of additional glomeruli for subpopulations of ORs may contribute to more robust odor representation."

During rodent active touch, whisker kinematics influences how objects activate sensory receptors. In order to fully characterize whisker motion, we reconstructed whisker position in 3D and decomposed whisker motion to all its degrees of freedom. We found that, across behavioral modes, in both head-fixed and freely moving rats, whisker motion is characterized by translational movements and three rotary components: azimuth, elevation, and torsion. Whisker torsion, which has not previously been described, was large (up to 100 degrees), and torsional angles were highly correlated with whisker azimuths. The coupling of azimuth and torsion was consistent across whisking epochs and rats and was similar along rows but systematically varied across rows such that rows A and E counterrotated. Torsional rotation of the whiskers enables contact information to be mapped onto the circumference of the whisker follicles in a predictable manner across protraction-retraction cycles."

Given the promiscuity of most tyrosine kinases, it is remarkable that the C-terminal tails of the Src family kinases are the only known targets of Csk. We have determined the crystal structure of a complex between the kinase domains of Csk and c-Src at 2.9 A resolution, revealing that interactions between these kinases position the C-terminal tail of c-Src at the edge of the active site of Csk. Csk cannot phosphorylate substrates that lack this docking mechanism because the conventional substrate binding site used by most tyrosine kinases to recognize substrates is destabilized in Csk by a deletion in the activation loop."

Despite the magnitude of problem, no documented evidence exists in Pakistan which reveals the awareness and practices of the country's adult population regarding dengue fever, its spread, symptoms, treatment and prevention. This study was conducted to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding dengue fever in people visiting tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted among people visiting tertiary care hospitals in Karachi. Through convenience sampling, a pre-tested and structured questionnaire was administered through a face-to-face unprompted interview with 447 visitors. Knowledge was recorded on a scale of 1–3. Results About 89.9% of individuals interviewed had heard of dengue fever. Sufficient knowledge about dengue was found to be in 38.5% of the sample, with 66% of these in Aga Khan University Hospital and 33% in Civil Hospital Karachi. Literate individuals were relatively more well-informed about dengue fever as compared to the illiterate people (p<0.001). Knowledge based upon preventive measures was found to be predominantly focused towards prevention of mosquito bites (78.3%) rather than eradication of mosquito population (17.3%). Use of anti- mosquito spray was the most prevalent (48.1%) preventive measure. Television was considered as the most important and useful source of information on the disease. Conclusion Adult population of Karachi has adequate knowledge related to the disease ‘dengue’ on isolated aspects, but the overall prevalence of ‘sufficient knowledge’ based on our criteria is poor. We demonstrated adequate prevalence of preventive practices against the disease. Further studies correlating the association between knowledge and its effectiveness against dengue will be helpful in demonstrating the implications of awareness campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2073951840,"Birdsong is a widely used model for vocal learning and human speech, which exhibits high temporal and acoustic diversity. Rapid acoustic modulations are thought to arise from the vocal organ, the syrinx, by passive interactions between the two independent sound generators or intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of sound generating structures. Additionally, direct neuromuscular control could produce such rapid and precisely timed acoustic features if syringeal muscles exhibit rare superfast muscle contractile kinetics. However, no direct evidence exists that avian vocal muscles can produce modulations at such high rates. Here, we show that 1) syringeal muscles are active in phase with sound modulations during song over 200 Hz, 2) direct stimulation of the muscles in situ produces sound modulations at the frequency observed during singing, and that 3) syringeal muscles produce mechanical work at the required frequencies and up to 250 Hz in vitro. The twitch kinematics of these so-called superfast muscles are the fastest measured in any vertebrate muscle. Superfast vocal muscles enable birds to directly control the generation of many observed rapid acoustic changes and to actuate the millisecond precision of neural activity into precise temporal vocal control. Furthermore, birds now join the list of vertebrate classes in which superfast muscle kinetics evolved independently for acoustic communication."
https://openalex.org/W2055287357,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the potential to differentiate into all cell types and are considered as a valuable source of cells for transplantation therapies. A critical issue, however, is the risk of teratoma formation after transplantation. The effect of the immune response on the tumorigenicity of transplanted cells is poorly understood. We have systematically compared the tumorigenicity of mouse ES cells and in vitro differentiated neuronal cells in various recipients. Subcutaneous injection of 1×106 ES or differentiated cells into syngeneic or allogeneic immunodeficient mice resulted in teratomas in about 95% of the recipients. Both cell types did not give rise to tumors in immunocompetent allogeneic mice or xenogeneic rats. However, in 61% of cyclosporine A-treated rats teratomas developed after injection of differentiated cells. Undifferentiated ES cells did not give rise to tumors in these rats. ES cells turned out to be highly susceptible to killing by rat natural killer (NK) cells due to the expression of ligands of the activating NK receptor NKG2D on ES cells. These ligands were down-regulated on differentiated cells. The activity of NK cells which is not suppressed by cyclosporine A might contribute to the prevention of teratomas after injection of ES cells but not after inoculation of differentiated cells. These findings clearly point to the importance of the immune response in this process. Interestingly, the differentiated cells must contain a tumorigenic cell population that is not present among ES cells and which might be resistant to NK cell-mediated killing."
https://openalex.org/W2071324979,"Central processing of acoustic cues is critically dependent on the balance between excitation and inhibition. This balance is particularly important for auditory neurons in the lateral superior olive, because these compare excitatory inputs from one ear and inhibitory inputs from the other ear to compute sound source location. By applying GABAB receptor antagonists during sound stimulation in vivo, it was revealed that these neurons adjust their binaural sensitivity through GABAB receptors. Using an in vitro approach, we then demonstrate that these neurons release GABA during spiking activity. Consequently, GABA differentially regulates transmitter release from the excitatory and inhibitory terminals via feedback to presynaptic GABAB receptors. Modulation of the synaptic input strength, by putative retrograde release of neurotransmitter, may enable these auditory neurons to rapidly adjust the balance between excitation and inhibition, and thus their binaural sensitivity, which could play an important role as an adaptation to various listening situations.

Balanced excitation and inhibition determine spike timing during frequency adaptation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Dynamic adjustment of the balance between excitation and inhibition is especially important for auditory neurons that rely on precise comparison of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, such as the neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO). The LSO is an auditory brainstem nucleus that encodes interaural sound level differences (ILDs), which is one of the main cues used for sound localization (Finlayson and Caspary, 1989Finlayson P.G. Caspary D.M. Synaptic potentials of chinchilla lateral superior olivary neurons.Hear. Res. 1989; 38: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, Park et al., 1996Park T.J. Grothe B.

Analysis of ILDs is accomplished by a direct subtraction of an inhibitory, glycinergic input, activated by sound arriving at the contralateral ear, from an excitatory input, activated by sound arriving at the ipsilateral ear (Boudreau and Tsuchitani, 1968Boudreau J.C.

Synaptic potentials of chinchilla lateral superior olivary neurons.Hear. Res. 1989; 38: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A key question is how this neuronal circuit adjusts the balance between excitation and inhibition to adapt to changes in the sensory environment. On a cellular level, adjustments to the synaptic strength of the inputs, or the integrative properties of the neurons, could control the complex interplay between excitation and inhibition. One possible candidate for this task is GABAB receptors, which are present presynaptically on the inputs to LSO neurons (Kotak et al., 2001Kotak V.C. DiMattina C. Sanes D.H. GABA(B) and Trk receptor signaling mediates long-lasting inhibitory synaptic depression.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 536-540PubMed Google Scholar). Such G protein-coupled receptors are able to modulate both synaptic inputs and postsynaptic properties (reviewed by Miller, 1998Miller R.J. Presynaptic receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 201-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and could therefore be important for the fine-tuning of sensory networks. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that LSO neurons adjust their ILD sensitivity by regulating the balance of their excitatory and inhibitory inputs via GABAB receptors. By using a combined in vivo and in vitro approach, we show that the LSO neurons release GABA, which acts as a retrograde transmitter on presynaptic GABAB receptors. Furthermore, activation of the presynaptic GABAB receptors differentially controls the excitatory and inhibitory terminals in the LSO. This results in a shift of the dynamic range of the ILD function (i.e., the ILD sensitivity), thus narrowing the binaural receptive field of the neurons. We propose that by adjusting the balance between excitation and inhibition, LSO neurons can rapidly adapt their binaural response properties and thereby accommodate the current acoustic environment. The spike response of single LSO neurons to sounds with various ILDs, presented via earphones, was recorded in adult anaesthetized gerbils. The LSO neurons responded strongly to sound stimulation that favored the ipsilateral ear (positive ILDs) and were progressively inhibited by increasing the sound level at the contralateral ear (negative ILDs) (Figure 1A, left panel). To examine the role of GABAB receptor activation on ILD processing, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen and the antagonists CGP35348 and CGP55845 were applied iontophoretically while recording the spike response to sounds with various ILDs. For further analysis the spike response was fitted with a sigmoid function. Baclofen (50 mM; n = 13) generally decreased the maximal discharge rate evoked by sounds favoring the ipsilateral, excitatory ear by 34.2% ± 6.7% (Figure 1E). Importantly, activation of GABAB receptors also resulted in a suppression of the ILD response such that more suppression was exerted at more positive ILDs (Figure 1A, right panel, closed arrows). This relative decrease in spike number, induced by GABAB receptor activation, resulted in a systematic shift of the normalized ILD function toward more positive ILDs, thereby narrowing the binaural response area of the neuron toward ILDs that correspond to more ipsilateral sound positions (Figure 1B). Conversely, iontophoretic application of the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP35348 (100 mM; n = 19) or CGP55845 (5 mM; n = 3) resulted in the opposite effect (Figures 1C and 1D). Spike numbers for sounds favoring the ipsilateral, excitatory ear increased by 90.2% ± 30.5% (Figure 1E). As during GABAB receptor activation, this increase in spike count was dependent on the spike rate during ILD presentation. GABAB receptor blockade caused a substantial spike response at ILDs where only a weak spike response had been observed under control conditions (Figure 1C, open arrows). This resulted in a shift of the normalized ILD functions toward more negative ILDs, thus expanding the binaural response area of the neurons to include ILDs that correspond to more contralateral sound source locations (Figure 1D). This negative shift of the ILD function also confirms the specificity of the opposite ILD shift during GABAB receptor activation. For all neurons tested, the ILD shift measured at the ILD where the spike response had decreased to 50% of the maximum response was 5.3 ± 1.7 dB (p ≤ 0.001; n = 22) toward positive ILDs during GABAB receptor activation and 3.6 ± 1.1 dB (p ≤ 0.001; n = 13) toward negative ILDs during GABAB receptor blockade (Figure 1E). Neurons with binaural response areas extending more towards contralateral sound locations (negative ILDs) were more affected by baclofen than neurons with binaural response areas closer to the ipsilateral side (positive ILDs) (Figure S1, available online). To assess whether GABAB receptor activation or inactivation resulted in a gain change of the ILD response, the steepness of the sigmoid function was analyzed (Figures 1B and 1D, insets). On average, the slope of the ILD function increased by 181.8% ± 74.9% (p ≤ 0.05; n = 22) during GABAB receptor blockade, whereas GABAB receptor activation had the opposite effect on the slope (Figure 1E), indicating that GABAB receptors exert a divisive (multiplicative) gain control function on the ILD coding of LSO neurons. Since there is no morphological evidence for GABAB receptors in the gerbil LSO in the literature, a conventional antibody staining was performed in order to demonstrate the presence of the receptors. It confirmed that GABAB receptors are abundant on LSO neurons throughout the nucleus (Figure 1F) but could not determine the subcellular location of the receptor. Taken together, these data demonstrate that endogenous GABAB receptor activation in the LSO systematically influences the ILD sensitivity by modulating the binaural response properties of the LSO neurons. Moreover, GABAB receptor activation in the LSO also scales the spike rates in a divisive manner, which is compatible with the concept of neural gain control. On an operational level, the ILD sensitivity of LSO neurons is determined by comparing the excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the two ears. Hence, the opposite shifts of the ILD function during GABAB receptor activation and inactivation suggest that the excitatory inputs from the ipsilateral ear and the inhibitory inputs from the contralateral ear are differentially controlled by GABAB receptors. Mechanistically, the modulation of LSO neurons described above could occur through activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors on the excitatory or the inhibitory terminals, where they control transmitter release. Alternatively, modulation may be due to activation of postsynaptic GABAB receptors, which might modulate the integration of these inputs to the LSO (reviewed by Nicoll, 2004Nicoll R.A. My close encounter with GABAB receptors.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we made whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from putative LSO principal neurons, selected according to their physiological properties (Figure S2A), in acute brainstem slices of post-hearing-onset gerbils. Presynaptic GABAB receptors at the LSO synapses were investigated by recording either pharmacologically isolated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), evoked by stimulating the cochlear nucleus fibers from the ipsilateral ear, or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), evoked by stimulating the trapezoid fiber bundle (input from the contralateral ear) (Figure 2A). Cesium was included in the pipette to block GABAB receptor-activated K+ channels. Bath application of baclofen (1 μM), a GABAB receptor agonist, reversibly reduced the amplitude of evoked AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs as well as glycinergic IPSCs (Figure 2B). To verify that the reduction in amplitude was caused exclusively by GABAB receptors, we repeated the same experiment in the presence of specific GABAB receptor antagonists (CGP55845, 3 μM or SCH50911, 10 μM). Bath application of the GABAB receptor antagonists blocked the baclofen-induced reduction of the EPSCs and the IPSCs (Figure 2D), confirming that the effects of the agonist are mediated by stimulation of GABAB receptors. The fact that the GABAB receptor antagonists had no effect per se (Figure 2D) suggests that there is no tonic activation of the GABAB receptors by ambient GABA in the slice. The dose-response relationship of baclofen-mediated inhibition revealed a significantly more potent activation of GABAB receptors at the excitatory synapses (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 0.56 μM) than at the inhibitory synapses (IC50 = 1.52 μM) (Figure 2C), which is in line with our in vivo finding that GABAB receptor blockade favors excitation rather than inhibition (Figure 1). Furthermore, baclofen (10 μM) increased the paired-pulse ratio (PPR), a measure of the probability of transmitter release, of the EPSCs (control, 0.83 ± 0.04; baclofen, 1.38 ± 0.36; p < 0.05, n = 6) and IPSCs (control, 0.78 ± 0.04; baclofen, 0.93 ± 0.03; p < 0.01, n = 5), providing evidence for a presynaptic mechanism of action. To determine whether activation of postsynaptic GABAB receptors elicits a response in these neurons, we applied exogenous baclofen (10 μM) by puffing the agonist directly onto the neuron (n = 10). Application of baclofen would be expected to generate an outward current recorded at −60 mV with a K+-based intracellular solution, but we could not observe such a response (Figure 2E). To make sure that the lack of response was not related to some technical issue, we puffed baclofen from the same pipette onto medial vestibular neurons (n = 3), known to have postsynaptic GABAB receptors (Dutia et al., 1992Dutia M.B. Johnston A.R. McQueen D.S. Tonic activity of rat medial vestibular nucleus neurones in vitro and its inhibition by GABA.Exp. Brain Res. 1992; 88: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, Holstein et al., 1992Holstein G.R. Martinelli G.P. Cohen B. L-baclofen-sensitive GABAB binding sites in the medial vestibular nucleus localized by immunocytochemistry.Brain Res. 1992; 581: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in the same slice. Under voltage clamp, baclofen triggered a long-lasting outward current, and under current clamp, baclofen induced a membrane hyperpolarization accompanied by a cessation of spontaneous action potential discharges (data not shown). To exclude that GABA could exert a postsynaptic effect on the intrinsic excitability of the LSO neurons via GABAB receptors, spike trains were elicited by injecting 50 Hz trains of excitatory postsynaptic conductances (EPSGs) into the cells before and during baclofen (3 μM) application. There was no qualitative change in the neurons' spiking activity during bath application of baclofen (3 μM) (Figure 2G), and a quantification of spike threshold (control, −43 ± 2 mV; baclofen, −43 ± 2 mV), spike amplitude (control, 67 ± 3 mV; baclofen, 66 ± 4 mV), and spike width (control, 0.51 ± 0.04 ms; baclofen, 0.51 ± 0.05 ms) did not reveal any further effects of GABAB receptor activation in these cells (n = 5). The fact that input resistance did not change upon application of baclofen in the LSO (control, 51 ± 16 MΩ; baclofen, 52 ± 16 MΩ; p = 0.58, n = 10) lends further support to a presynaptic mechanism of action. We therefore conclude that, in the LSO, postsynaptic GABAB receptors do not modulate postsynaptic voltage-dependent ion conductances, such as K+ and Ca2+ currents, or have immediate effects on the intrinsic excitability. However, postsynaptic GABAB receptors could be involved in long-term plastic changes, as shown before hearing onset (Kotak et al., 2001Kotak V.C. DiMattina C. Sanes D.H. GABA(B) and Trk receptor signaling mediates long-lasting inhibitory synaptic depression.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 536-540PubMed Google Scholar, Chang et al., 2003Chang E.H. Kotak V.C. Sanes D.H. Long-term depression of synaptic inhibition is expressed postsynaptically in the developing auditory system.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1479-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have shown that GABA exerts a strong influence on LSO neurons through presynaptic GABAB receptors. A critical question is, “Where does the GABA come from?” Many of the LSO neurons are GABAergic (Roberts and Ribak, 1987Roberts R.C. Ribak C.E.

Neurol. 1996; 372: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and one possible scenario is that the LSO neurons themselves release GABA, which affects their synaptic inputs in an autocrine or paracrine fashion (reviewed by Ludwig and Pittman, 2003Ludwig M. Pittman Q.J. Talking back: dendritic neurotransmitter release.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, Zilberter et al., 2005Zilberter Y. Harkany T. Holmgren C.D. Dendritic release of retrograde messengers controls synaptic transmission in local neocortical networks.Neuroscientist. 2005; 11: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We evaluated this hypothesis by investigating what effect depolarization of the LSO neurons had on pharmacologically isolated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). After several minutes of stable EPSP responses (control), the synaptically evoked potentials were paired with a preceding 100–200 Hz train of action potentials (conditioning), which was induced by somatic current injections (Figure S2A). Conditioning trains of action potentials rapidly decreased the EPSP amplitude. This effect was reversible and could be induced again after recovery (Figure 3A). There was a significant reduction in EPSP amplitude (control, 4.3 ± 1.9 mV; conditioning, 2.9 ± 1.9 mV; p < 0.001, n = 13), accompanied by an increase in the PPR (control, 0.80 ± 0.12; conditioning, 1.45 ± 0.93; p < 0.001, n = 13), suggesting a decrease in transmitter release in response to the conditioning. To obviate the contribution of postsynaptic voltage-gated ion channels to these effects, two experimental designs were employed. First, we determined the increase in failure rate in response to conditioning trains when the stimulation of the excitatory inputs was adjusted to just above the threshold for an evoked response with only a few failures (∼10% failure rate). Again, after several minutes of stable responses (control), the synaptically evoked potentials were paired with a 100–200 Hz preceding train of action potentials (conditioning). Conditioning rapidly increased the probability of failure of the EPSPs (control, 6.4% ± 8.3%; conditioning, 35.4% ± 17.3%; p < 0.001, n = 13). This effect was dependent on the frequency of the conditioning train (Figure S2B) and the intensity of the somatic current injection (Figure S2C). The increase in failures during conditioning also resulted in a striking reduction of the mean EPSP amplitude in 31 of 43 (or 72% of) LSO neurons and a corresponding increase in the PPRs of EPSPs, in a very similar manner to that of the larger-amplitude EPSPs and the classical baclofen-induced increase in the PPR. A summary of the effects of conditioning on EPSPs is given in Figure 3C. This form of short-term presynaptic depression of the EPSPs was effectively blocked by the three different GABAB receptor antagonists: CGP35348 (100–200 μM), CGP55854 (3 μM), or SCH50911 (10 μM) (Figures 3B and 3C), which strongly indicates that GABA acts as a retrograde transmitter on presynaptic GABAB receptors in the LSO. Moreover, the input resistance of the neurons remained stable during the conditioning stimuli (control, 64 ± 22 MΩ; conditioning, 65 ± 23 MΩ; p = 0.83, n = 10), also supporting the concept of a presynaptic mechanism. In a second approach, EPSCs evoked in the same way as in the current-clamp recordings were measured in voltage-clamp mode under control conditions and with a preceding depolarization of the neuron (duration: 500 ms, to 0 mV). As for the EPSPs, the preceding depolarization caused a significant reduction of the EPSC amplitude (control, 1002 ± 182 pA; depolarization, 797 ± 167 pA; p < 0.001, n = 7) (Figure 3D) and an increase in the PPR (control, 0.75 ± 0.05; depolarization, 0.84 ± 0.05; p < 0.01, n = 7) (Figure 4D). Bath application of GABAB receptor antagonists to the same neurons prevented the decrease in EPSC amplitude (control, 905 ± 180 pA; depolarization, 868 ± 180 pA; n = 7) and the increase in the PPR (control, 0.8 ± 0.05; depolarization, 0.77 ± 0.05; n = 7), indicating a similar mechanism for the amplitude reduction of the excitatory currents as for the EPSPs following a preceding train of action potentials. It is, however, essential to know whether the reduced EPSP/EPSC amplitude during conditioning is related to lessened synaptic release of transmitter or due to a failure to activate the axon/synaptic bouton. To elucidate this, the effect of 500 ms depolarizing voltage steps to +30 mV on spontaneous release of transmitter was investigated in voltage-clamped LSO neurons. The frequency of pharmacologically isolated spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) decreased by 21% (control, 3.6 ± 0.7 Hz; depolarization, 2.8 ± 0.64 Hz; p < 0.01, n = 14) (Figure 3E), whereas the amplitude of the sEPSCs remained stable (control, 64 ± 7 pA; depolarization, 63 ± 7 pA). Also, the reduction of sEPSC frequency with depolarizing conditioning was blocked by the GABAB receptor antagonist SCH50911 (control, 2.6 ± 0.38 Hz; conditioning, 2.5 ± 0.38 Hz; n = 11) (Figure 3E). These results demonstrate that the most likely reason for the decrease in EPSP amplitude and the increase in failure rate observed during conditioning is a decrease in the release of transmitter from the presynaptic bouton in response to the presynaptic GABAB receptor activation. GABA could be released either from the dendrites of the LSO neurons themselves or from axon collaterals projecting back to the cell as autapses. These possibilities were tested by adding either QX314 (a sodium channel blocker), BAPTA (a calcium chelator) or botulinum neurotoxin D light chain (BoNT D) to the intracellular recording solution. Addition of QX314 (5 mM) effectively prevented the cell from firing action potentials within a few minutes. The conditioning trains thus only depolarized the cell and activated their Ca2+ channels. Nevertheless, we still observed a decrease in EPSP amplitude accompanied by an increase of the PPR during conditioning stimuli (Figure 4A), which indicates that GABA is most probably not released from back-projecting axon collaterals. In contrast, BAPTA (10 mM) effectively prevented the EPSP amplitude reduction and the PPR increase during conditioning trains of action potentials (Figure 4B), pointing toward a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. BoNT D is known to cleave synaptobrevin, a protein that is part of the plasma membrane SNARE protein complex, which is essential for Ca2+-induced vesicle exocytosis (Schoch et al., 2001Schoch S. Deak F. Konigstorfer A. Mozhayeva M. Sara Y. Sudhof T.C. Kavalali E.T. SNARE function analyzed in synaptobrevin/VAMP knockout mice.Science. 2001; 294: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Inclusion of BoNT D (1–2 μg/ml) into the pipette also blocked the effect of conditioning on the EPSP amplitude and the PPR (Figure 4C). Taken together, this is consistent with the hypothesis that GABA is released via exocytosis in a Ca2+-dependent manner from the LSO dendrites (or somas). If GABA is exocytosed from LSO dendrites, the vesicles should contain vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). Accordingly, we performed a triple immunostaining against VGAT (red), MAP2 (green),and Nissl (blue), which colabeled the dendrites and somata of LSO neurons (Figures 4D–4F). Based on the knowledge that the major inhibitory input to the LSO is glycinergic (Moore and Caspary, 1983Moore M.J. Caspary D.M. Strychnine blocks binaural inhibition in lateral superior olivary neurons.J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 237-242PubMed Google Scholar, Sanes et al., 1987Sanes D.H. Geary W.A. Wooten G.F. Rubel E.W. Quantitative distribution of the glycine receptor in the auditory brain stem of the gerbil.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3793-3802PubMed Google Scholar), and that VGAT is also identified as a vesicular glycine transporter (Chaudhry et al., 1998Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Danbolt N.C. Osen K.K. Edwards R.H. Storm-Mathisen J. The vesicular GABA transporter, VGAT, localizes to synaptic vesicles in sets of glycinergic as well as GABAergic neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9733-9750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), most of the VGAT staining was of presynaptic origin and localized to putative glycinergic terminals (Figure 4D, arrow). However, many LSO neurons displayed a clear colocalization of the VGAT puncta and the MAP2 staining, suggesting presence of VGAT in the dendrites as well (Figures 4D and S3A). This was further confirmed by scrutinizing overlays of the VGAT and MAP2 staining at high magnification and 3D reconstructions, which revealed the presence of VGAT puncta inside the dendrites of LSO principal neurons (Figures 4E and 4F). This finding corroborates a post-embedding immunogold labeling study that demonstrated that the somata of LSO neurons are weakly immunopositive to VGAT in the rat (Chaudhry et al., 1998Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Danbolt N.C. Osen K.K. Edwards R.H. Storm-Mathisen J. The vesicular GABA transporter, VGAT, localizes to synaptic vesicles in sets of glycinergic as well as GABAergic neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9733-9750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditioning trains of action potentials also affected glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), evoked by stimulation of the fibers of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. A postsynaptic 100–200 Hz stimulation induced a reduction of the IPSP amplitude (control, 4.4 ± 2.3 mV; conditioning, 3.5 ± 2.0 mV; p < 0.001, n = 21), which was paralleled by an increase in the PPR (control, 0.86 ± 0.10; conditioning, 1.15 ± 0.25; p < 0.01, n = 10), in 26 of 74 (or 35% of) LSO neurons tested (Figures 5A and 5C). Similar to the evoked excitation, this effect could be effectively blocked by addition of GABAB receptor antagonists to the bath (Figures 5B and 5C). A quantitative comparison of the effect of conditioning between EPSPs and IPSPs revealed several differences (Figure 5D). First, the total number of neurons in which this effect was triggered was more than twice as large for EPSPs as it was for IPSPs. Second, the reduction in amplitude (EPSPs: 40.3% ± 8.8%, n = 26; IPSPs: 20.6% ± 20.3%, n = 21; p < 0.01), as well as the increase of the PPR (EPSPs: 109.7% ± 61.9%, n = 26; IPSPs: 31.1% ± 24.2%, n = 10; p < 0.05), was significantly larger for EPSPs than it was for IPSPs (Figure 5D). These results indicate that, during ongoing stimulation, activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors shifts the balance between the inputs to the LSO by attenuating the excitation relative to the inhibition, which is compatible with our in vivo findings. An important question that remains is, “What mechanism underlies these differential effects on the excitatory and the inhibitory inputs to the LSO?” It is well known that presynaptically located GABAB receptors modulate neurotransmitter release (reviewed by Miller, 1998Miller R.J. Presynaptic receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 201-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Since changes in the frequency of miniature events are generally thought to reflect modulation of the release machinery, we examined the effects of baclofen on miniature (m)EPSCs/IPSCs (in the presence of 1 μM TTX) and spontaneous (s)EPSCs/IPSCs (in the absence of TTX). Baclofen (10 μM) strongly reduced both the frequency of mEPSCs and sEPSCs (Figures 6A and 6B). In marked contrast, no effect of baclofen was observed on the frequency of mIPSCs (Figure 6A). However, the frequency of the sIPSCs was reduced in the presence of baclofen, in a similar fashion to the sEPSCs (Figure 6B). These results suggest that GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition of IPSCs is, in contrast to that of the EPSCs, due to inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ increases in the presynaptic terminals. To confirm this, we recorded sEPSCs and sIPSCs in the presence of Cd2+ (100 μM), a nonspecific Ca2+ channel blocker. Cd2+ completely blocked the decrease in sIPSC frequency, whereas it caused a less severe decrease in frequency of the baclofen-induced sEPSCs (Figure 6C). It is unlikely that these effects are due to some form of postsynaptic action of baclofen, because the agonist"

Here we provide novel evidence that galectin-4 is selectively expressed and secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and binds potently to activated peripheral and mucosal lamina propria T-cells at the CD3 epitope. The carbohydrate-dependent binding of galectin-4 at the CD3 epitope is fully functional and inhibited T cell activation, cycling and expansion. Galectin-4 induced apoptosis of activated peripheral and mucosal lamina propria T cells via calpain-, but not caspase-dependent, pathways. Providing further evidence for its important role in regulating T cell function, galectin-4 blockade by antisense oligonucleotides reduced TNF-alpha inhibitor induced T cell death. Furthermore, in T cells, galectin-4 reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion including IL-17. In a model of experimental colitis, galectin-4 ameliorated mucosal inflammation, induced apoptosis of mucosal T-cells and decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our results show that galectin-4 plays a unique role in the intestine and assign a novel role of this protein in controlling intestinal inflammation by a selective induction of T cell apoptosis and cell cycle restriction. Conclusively, after defining its biological role, we propose Galectin-4 is a novel anti-inflammatory agent that could be therapeutically effective in diseases with a disturbed T cell expansion and apoptosis such as inflammatory bowel disease."

The aim of this study was to examine whether a diet-induced weight reduction result in changes in the extended plasma lipid profiles (lipidome) in subjects with features of metabolic syndrome in a 33-week intervention. Methodology/Principal Findings Plasma samples of 9 subjects in the weight reduction group and 10 subjects in the control group were analyzed using mass spectrometry based lipidomic and fatty acid analyses. Body weight decreased in the weight reduction group by 7.8±2.9% (p<0.01). Most of the serum triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines were reduced. The decrease in triacylglycerols affected predominantly the saturated short chain fatty acids. This decrease of saturated short chain fatty acid containing triacylglycerols correlated with the increase of insulin sensitivity. However, levels of several longer chain fatty acids, including arachidonic and docosahexanoic acid, were not affected by weight loss. Levels of other lipids known to be associated with obesity such as sphingolipids and lysophosphatidylcholines were not altered by weight reduction. Conclusions/Significance Diet-induced weight loss caused significant changes in global lipid profiles in subjects with abnormal glucose metabolism. The observed changes may affect insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in these subjects. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00621205"
https://openalex.org/W1999571080,"Fishes living in icy seawater are usually protected from freezing by endogenous antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that bind to ice crystals and stop them from growing. The scattered distribution of five highly diverse AFP types across phylogenetically disparate fish species is puzzling. The appearance of radically different AFPs in closely related species has been attributed to the rapid, independent evolution of these proteins in response to natural selection caused by sea level glaciations within the last 20 million years. In at least one instance the same type of simple repetitive AFP has independently originated in two distant species by convergent evolution. But, the isolated occurrence of three very similar type II AFPs in three distantly related species (herring, smelt and sea raven) cannot be explained by this mechanism. These globular, lectin-like AFPs have a unique disulfide-bonding pattern, and share up to 85% identity in their amino acid sequences, with regions of even higher identity in their genes. A thorough search of current databases failed to find a homolog in any other species with greater than 40% amino acid sequence identity. Consistent with this result, genomic Southern blots showed the lectin-like AFP gene was absent from all other fish species tested. The remarkable conservation of both intron and exon sequences, the lack of correlation between evolutionary distance and mutation rate, and the pattern of silent vs non-silent codon changes make it unlikely that the gene for this AFP pre-existed but was lost from most branches of the teleost radiation. We propose instead that lateral gene transfer has resulted in the occurrence of the type II AFPs in herring, smelt and sea raven and allowed these species to survive in an otherwise lethal niche."
https://openalex.org/W2144181601,"Tens of thousands of biomedical journals exist, and the deluge of new articles in the biomedical sciences is leading to information overload. Hence, there is much interest in text mining, the use of computational tools to enhance the human ability to parse and understand complex text. Tens of thousands of biomedical journals exist, and the deluge of new articles in the biomedical sciences is leading to information overload. Hence, there is much interest in text mining, the use of computational tools to enhance the human ability to parse and understand complex text. Imagine that a graduate student enters the U.S. Library of Congress with the goal of retrieving all texts relevant to protein glycosylation. Her problem is straightforward, known among text miners as information retrieval (IR). If the student must not only find the books but also flag the most important concepts she encounters in each, she is performing named entity recognition (NER). Undaunted by her workload, imagine she decides to identify relations between concepts, such as “protein BAD binds to protein BAX” (called information extraction or IE). Then she takes on additional tasks such as question/answer (QA) and text summarization (TS). Computational IR, NER, IE, QA, and TS are all part of text mining and belong to the larger field of natural language processing (NLP), which itself is a part of artificial intelligence (AI) that aims to recreate or surpass the computational ability of the human brain. Although multiple definitions exist, text mining is typically associated with information retrieval, extraction, and synthesis, with a special emphasis on gaining new knowledge (Table 1).Table 1Text Mining Web ResourcesBLIMP (Biomedical Literature-Mining Publications)http://blimp.cs.queensu.ca/Alexander Morgan's compilation of BioNLP resources and referenceshttp://compbio.uchsc.edu/corpora/bcresources.htmlResource links compiled by Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmannhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/Rebholz/resources.htmlText-mining resources compiled by Robert Futrellehttp://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/futrelle/bionlp/A list of links to current NER, IR, and IE engineshttp://www.bork.embl.de/Docu/literature_mining/Marti Hearst's What Is Text Mining?http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/∼hearst/text-mining.html Open table in a new tab Text mining has an established formula for joining the computational and linguistics modules together (IR + NER + IE + QA + TS). The first step is identification and retrieval of relevant documents (IR) (although this step is optional and is sometimes substituted with indiscriminate analysis of documents regardless of their relevance). Once documents are available for computational analysis, an NER module is put to work, followed by an IE module to extract relations between entities. The extracted nuggets of information can then be used for TS, QA, and a higher-order analysis capable of proposing new conclusions. To retrieve information properly, an application has to “know” the relations and entities mentioned in the documents it is searching. Therefore, the boundary between NER, IR, and IE is fuzzy and can be encapsulated in an application that attempts to do all three tasks jointly. Here, we present some of the key considerations common to any text-mining approach, discuss how these relate to the changing landscape of scientific information, and give an overview of current and future applications of text mining to the scientific literature. Information Retrieval (IR). Every scientist is familiar with IR: we use various incarnations of IR when we conduct computer-aided searches for articles, books, and Internet sites. Indeed, PubMed and Library of Congress searches and Google Scholar are among the most visible IR instantiations. The ideal IR system should be able to deduce what we are looking for, even if we are somewhat fuzzy in the question we pose. It should retrieve and rank the results by their relevance to our question. It should also extract text-encoded facts and compactly summarize them, as a capable and tireless assistant would do. It is difficult to benchmark the efficiency of IR engines, especially their recall, because the complete set of documents relevant to almost any search is inherently ill defined. Nevertheless, estimates show that the most popular search engines, such as Google, have both precision and recall below 0.3 (Shafi and Rather, 2005Shafi, S.M., and Rather, R.A. (2005). Webology 2, Article 12. http://www.webology.ir/2005/v2n2/a12.html.Google Scholar). In other words, every time we do a search, more than 70% of the documents in the output are irrelevant, whereas more than 70% of all relevant documents never appear in the engine's output. Information Extraction (IE). To “comprehend” text, a computer program has to map words and phrases to objects, concepts, and symbols. For example, if the program encounters the phrase “pray for elves,” it must decide if these words refer to separate entities (e.g., a gene named “elves”), an English directive, a single gene with a three-word name (the eponymous gene does exist in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster), or something entirely different. Similarly, when it encounters the sequence of characters “Alzheimer,” it needs to “decide” if the word refers to Dr. Alois Alzheimer who first described Alzheimer's disease or to the disease itself. This problem in text analysis is typically referred to as named entity recognition (NER) and has proved particularly challenging for biomedical prose. Although NER engines that mine news articles regularly achieve accuracy above 90%, their biomedical counterparts are more likely to perform at 80% or below (text miners typically compute the F-measure rather than accuracy) (Cohen and Hersh, 2005Cohen A.M. Hersh W.R. Brief. Bioinform. 2005; 6: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar; see Table S1 available online). This is because biology and medicine are unusually rich in terminology: the collective vocabulary used by biomedicine incorporates many millions of terms. The exact number is unknown and constantly in flux. Because this vocabulary is large and dynamic, new terms emerge rapidly and erratically. As a result, the same real-world object may have numerous names (synonyms), whereas distinct objects can be identified with the same name (homonyms). The terms that most notoriously suffer from synonym and homonym abundance are gene and protein names (Hirschman et al., 2002Hirschman L. Morgan A.A. Yeh A.S. J. Biomed. Inform. 2002; 35: 247-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Wilbur et al., 1999Wilbur, W.J., Hazard, G.F., Jr., Divita, G., Mork, J.G., Aronson, A.R., and Browne, A.C. (1999). Proceedings / AMIA Annual Symposium, 176–180.Google Scholar). A given gene may be denoted by several dozen synonymous names—for example, the Drosophila genes br and mod(mdg4) have 82 and 64 aliases, respectively. Even worse, vastly different and incompatible naming systems are used in different species, and gene aliases themselves merge into intricate semantic networks that connect gene names, pop-culture catch phrases, idioms, and common everyday utterances borrowed from multiple languages. From Co-occurrence to Deep Parsing. Imagine that you have to find out as much as possible about processes involving glycosylation—the enzymatic attachment of sugars to proteins and lipids. Spotting and listing most mentions of glycosylation in the literature is an unbearably tedious task for a human, not because any single mention is hard to find or understand, but because there are millions of biomedical articles, many of which describe glycosylation. Imagine now that you seek only four pieces of information for each glycosylation description: which molecule is being glycosylated, at which position, by which enzyme, and what kind of sugar is being added. Thus, the automated extraction of the following quartet is a perfect job for a typical IE engine. Glycosylate (What, at Which Position, by Which Enzyme, with Which Sugar)? Unlike a human curator, an IE engine would not capture the nuances of individual articles, such as an out-of-date experimental procedure or a questionable connection between experimental results and article conclusions. However, an IE engine could process enormous volumes of texts without succumbing to fatigue or ennui. To perform tasks like this, simple IE engines use only the co-occurrence of terms in the same sentence, paragraph, or article (with a statistical filter superimposed to distinguish coincidence from significant hits). Such co-occurrence IE engines are typically fast but not very precise. Increasing sophistication (and precision) in IE engines usually involves borrowing methods from computational linguistics. For example, so-called chunking (shallow parsing) can help us to identify syntactically related groups of words (such as noun and verb phrases) and subsequently improve downstream processes, such as NER. The more challenging slice of the IE engine spectrum (deep parsing) is built on formal mathematical models describing how text is generated in the human mind, the so-called formal grammars. The most popular formal grammars are deterministic or probabilistic context-free grammars (Ananiadou et al., 2006Ananiadou S. Kell D.B. Tsujii J. Trends Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar; Table S1). Grammar-based IE is computationally expensive because it requires the evaluation and ranking of a large number of alternative ways to generate the same sentence (alternative parses); it is therefore considerably slower but potentially much more precise. Synthesizing and Finding New Connections. Moving beyond information retrieval and extraction, some proportion of published assertions can be repackaged to form “synthetic ideas,” that is, new compound concepts that are significantly more valuable to the scientific community than the sum of their original assertions. Even with current text-mining capabilities, such synthetic ideas can be discovered automatically. A more distant but nonetheless realistic aim of the field is to trace and map more sophisticated ideas (idea isomorphisms) that are expressed differently in different scientific fields yet represent identical problems or their solutions. If such idea mappings were made instantly available through an Internet interface, the result could be truly impressive. The diffusion of innovations across science could be markedly increased by making solutions developed in one area visible to specialists still searching for them in a different field. Computationally pairing problems and solutions generated by different fields is a type of automated creativity (systematic search for synthetic ideas) that computers almost certainly will do for us in the not too distant future. Question Answering (QA). Information retrieval/extraction and summarization are often married in a single application, a question-answer system. Perhaps the first operational question-answer system was START, designed and launched at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1993 (http://start.csail.mit.edu/). START remains operational today and serves as a general encyclopedia (try it!). But there are limitations with current question-answer systems. You can ask START to list all cities within a 250 mile radius of Chicago (or another city), which it does promptly, listing the actual distance between Chicago and every city in the list. START, however, has only limited knowledge about molecular biology. With current tools, given a large collection of molecular interactions, it would be relatively easy to write a similar engine that answers biological questions like “list all molecular interactors of protein X with property Y.” Such a question-answer system would surpass abilities of both human experts and currently available encyclopedias. Technological advances demand quality control. In text mining, we can ask: how effective are the tools that are currently available? Text miners typically evaluate their own methods, but it is difficult to evaluate rival methods applied to different test data (Krallinger and Valencia, 2005Krallinger M. Valencia A. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Jensen et al., 2006Jensen L.J. Saric J. Bork P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). These considerations have spurred competitions where researchers can pit different methods against one another while processing identical data sets. The KDD Cup (Knowledge Discovery and Data mining), TREC Genomics (Text Retrieval Conference – Genomics track), and BioCreAtIvE (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology) are examples of such contests (see Table S2). These competitions share a similar underlying design. Organizers choose a well-defined technical task, such as the identification of a gene or protein name embedded within a collection of text snippets. The competitors—research groups around the globe—receive the same challenge, test data, and information. To evaluate the participants' success, the organizers recruit a group of experts that judge the participants' individual submissions or perform the competition task themselves to manually generate a gold standard against which to compare the computational submissions. Aside from their obvious value in advancing text-mining techniques, these competitions have an important ancillary outcome: they offer the community a glimpse of the uneven complexity of various test-annotation tasks for human experts. Even well-defined tasks like normalizing gene and protein names are easier in some model organisms (e.g., yeast) than others (e.g., fly, mouse, and human) (Colosimo et al., 2005Colosimo M.E. Morgan A.A. Yeh A.S. Colombe J.B. Hirschman L. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Agreement among expert annotators varies from 90% to 70% depending upon the species considered. Thus, the perceived performance of automated tools strongly depends upon the test data selected, and when really tough tasks are considered, even human experts sometimes cannot agree. Text mining has important implications for the structure of scientific publishing itself. In the past decade, electronic databases have revolutionized the way that scientists access information. Today, digital repositories accommodate vast amounts of data, storing primary and ancillary records, functional annotation, and conservation information. Equally important, they allow updates to stored information, a luxury routinely exercised as sequences are corrected and revised. The current format of scientific journals follows a model established long before the era of computers, cheap electronic storage space, and digital publishing. This arguably outdated format limits scientific communication. Ideally, scientists should record and share all useful findings, but in reality results sometimes do not coincide with the “standard ration” suitable for journal publication. Some facts are simply too trivial to merit a paper, and isolated findings or negative results are often withheld from the published record. Conversely, some data sets are too large to include in the text-based article format; for example, in two studies of whole-organism protein-protein interaction networks or regulatory pathways, the manuscripts presented highlights of the results and discussion whereas the data sets themselves are stored in databases or on laboratory websites. By contrast, scientific databases are highly structured and machine readable. They require significant effort to establish and resist changes in focus because of the rigidity of their structure. Moreover, databases often lack true peer review, and because no uniform citation system exists to track the database contributions of a given researcher, there are few incentives to populate, annotate, or revise information stored in databases. Also, databases have not yet been optimized for discussion, to allow disagreement, or to represent uncertainty. Thus, journals and databases are historically positioned to handle different types and amounts of data. Journal articles are optimized for human consumption and incorporate authoritative peer review. However, they are not suited to handle very large or very small results, they lack the consistent and rigid data structure required for easy computational access, and third-party indexing of full-text material is difficult. The roles of journals and databases are blurring (Bourne, 2005Bourne P. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: 179-181PubMed Google Scholar) as articles are accessed increasingly through database-type portals, and databases store article-like textual data (Hamosh et al., 2000Hamosh A. Scott A.F. Amberger J. Valle D. McKusick V.A. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although it is still impossible to compute with unstructured text as easily as with structured databases, there is a possible combination of community efforts and computational advances that can help to bridge the gap called the semantic web (Berners-Lee and Hendler, 2001Berners-Lee T. Hendler J. Nature. 2001; 410: 1023-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The semantic web is a new iteration of the World Wide Web in which a formal representation of the semantics (meaning) of each piece of information is provided along with the information itself, allowing computers to reason across text in human-like fashion. The semantic web can be particularly useful in connection with text mining, as it provides a way to mark up text with systematic and structured meta-information. Text miners hope to convince publishers to enrich the plain text of manuscripts with computer-readable annotations. For example, the authors could be required to annotate gene, protein, and disease names within the text with a set of journal-specified tags (in the same way as a new gene sequence needs to be submitted to a central database prior to manuscript publication). The text-mining community could provide publishers with a set of tools that would automatically pre-annotate manuscripts before publication, subject to approval of authors (Seringhaus and Gerstein, 2007Seringhaus M.R. Gerstein M.B. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This change undoubtedly may be hard to implement but would benefit science because the resulting semantic-web-enabled articles would be much easier to use both for information retrieval and extraction, as well as for the generation of knowledge. Researchers will be able to extract more value from a data set by analyzing experimental data jointly with textual information, for example, the analysis of full-text articles in combination with gene expression data (Natarajan et al., 2006Natarajan J. Berrar D. Dubitzky W. Hack C. Zhang Y. DeSesa C. Van Brocklyn J.R. Bremer E.G. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the prediction of the subcellular localization of new proteins (Shatkay et al., 2007Shatkay H. Hoglund A. Brady S. Blum T. Donnes P. Kohlbacher O. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 1410-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Frequencies of word use in everyday English (and other languages) follow Zipf's distribution, also known to economists as the Pareto distribution of wealth among people and to physicists as the power law. In a nutshell, Zipf's law in linguistics states that there is a very small subset of words that occur very frequently (“rich words”) and a large subset of words that are rare (“poor words”).The same Zipfean regularity may operate over frequencies of statements and arguments that people use in everyday reasoning and in scientific thinking. There is a tiny set of facts that is known to virtually everyone (think about the “rich” memes double helix and E = mc2), and there is a rapidly growing number of facts that are known to smaller and smaller groups of people. An experienced biologist can readily spot inconsistencies in a small map of molecular interactions. The biologist looks for logical inconsistency across multiple statements that are each perfectly reasonable when viewed in isolation but that cannot all be true simultaneously. For example, consider the problem inherent in accepting as true the following three statements about genes A and B: “A inhibits B,” “B inhibits A,” and “A and B are both active simultaneously.” Such simple problems are easy to spot, but as a pathway model grows, tracking down inconsistencies becomes progressively more difficult. For that task, we will need an appropriately trained pathway tool similar to the common spellchecker that tags conflicting pieces of information with a different degree of certainty and then finds the most likely resolution of inconsistencies. This approach would not replace data analysis by biologists but may save time in refining models (just as a good spellchecker does not replace a writer but allows us to produce prose free of typos faster). Now that essentially all of science is recorded in electronic journals and online data, a new type of historical analysis is possible. One can use text mining not only to look for new connections in different fields but also to study the structure of science itself. Most dramatically, one can watch the birth of a new field by observing time slices of databases. For instance, it is possible to see the birth of the field of RNA interference from its 1997 conception to the present. We can also study the overrepresentation of certain fields relative to others, such as the preponderance of Nobel prizes in a particular field (e.g., crystallography) compared with the number of papers on the topic stored in public databases. Such approaches enable us to study the ways in which scientists develop and transmit ideas. We can also chart maps looking at the broad interconnections between different scientific fields (Shiffrin and Borner, 2004Shiffrin R.M. Borner K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 5183-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Through text mining, one can also study the different structures of scientific collaborations, contrasting those that are close-knit with others that are more disparate. Eventually, such meta-analysis of publication structure could help to determine how to structure large-scale collaborations. To some degree, this is already underway with citation analyses that look for publications and authors that are cited many times over. Many handcrafted (as opposed to automatically generated) knowledge bases operate under the assumption that the most recently published facts are the most reliable. Although this assumption is reasonable in many (even most) cases, there are exceptions including errors made by leaders in the field and occasionally the publication of fabricated facts. With automated text-mining tools, we can keep in our analysis all instances of contradictory statements related to the same issue, ordered chronologically and linked to their textual sources. Statements about the same problem published at different time points are by no means independent: researchers use prior publications in interpreting their experiments, thus introducing unwilling bias. Once the published statements are unlocked from their textual shells and deposited into computer-accessible media, they can be used for statistical analysis. Using a large collection of text-derived facts and a proper statistical model, we could potentially use computation to deconvolute errors associated with the subconscious bias that results in gradual distortion of experimental results in publications. It should be possible, both in terms of modeling and computation, to assign a quality value (such as the probability that the statement is true) to every published statement in the scientific “bibliome.” The process by which we acquire instruments for our intellectual toolbox—the facts and beliefs that we use in making inferences about the world—resemble in a sense the maturation of our immune system, which early on learns to distinguish self from non-self. A similar process of intellectual maturation allows us to streamline our thinking and avoid questioning every step of our mental process anew; the downside, however, is that, like the immune system, our early implanted antigens (or, beliefs) can later prove harmful by forming blind spots in our immune or mental landscape. Text-mining tools, which merge the precision and data handling of the computer with nascent technologies to parse human language, can synthesize information across broad fields of inquiry and may one day provide a way to lift the veil from the blind spots in our thinking."
https://openalex.org/W2146282882,"There is lack of neuroscientific studies investigating music processing with naturalistic stimuli, and brain responses to real music are, thus, largely unknown.This study investigates event-related brain potentials (ERPs), skin conductance responses (SCRs) and heart rate (HR) elicited by unexpected chords of piano sonatas as they were originally arranged by composers, and as they were played by professional pianists. From the musical excerpts played by the pianists (with emotional expression), we also created versions without variations in tempo and loudness (without musical expression) to investigate effects of musical expression on ERPs and SCRs. Compared to expected chords, unexpected chords elicited an early right anterior negativity (ERAN, reflecting music-syntactic processing) and an N5 (reflecting processing of meaning information) in the ERPs, as well as clear changes in the SCRs (reflecting that unexpected chords also elicited emotional responses). The ERAN was not influenced by emotional expression, whereas N5 potentials elicited by chords in general (regardless of their chord function) differed between the expressive and the non-expressive condition.These results show that the neural mechanisms of music-syntactic processing operate independently of the emotional qualities of a stimulus, justifying the use of stimuli without emotional expression to investigate the cognitive processing of musical structure. Moreover, the data indicate that musical expression affects the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of musical meaning. Our data are the first to reveal influences of musical performance on ERPs and SCRs, and to show physiological responses to unexpected chords in naturalistic music."
https://openalex.org/W2135206202,"Background Automatic identification of notifiable diseases from electronic medical records can potentially improve the timeliness and completeness of public health surveillance. We describe the development and implementation of an algorithm for prospective surveillance of patients with acute hepatitis B using electronic medical record data. Methods Initial algorithms were created by adapting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for acute hepatitis B into electronic terms. The algorithms were tested by applying them to ambulatory electronic medical record data spanning 1990 to May 2006. A physician reviewer classified each case identified as acute or chronic infection. Additional criteria were added to algorithms in serial fashion to improve accuracy. The best algorithm was validated by applying it to prospective electronic medical record data from June 2006 through April 2008. Completeness of case capture was assessed by comparison with state health department records. Findings A final algorithm including a positive hepatitis B specific test, elevated transaminases and bilirubin, absence of prior positive hepatitis B tests, and absence of an ICD9 code for chronic hepatitis B identified 112/113 patients with acute hepatitis B (sensitivity 97.4%, 95% confidence interval 94–100%; specificity 93.8%, 95% confidence interval 87–100%). Application of this algorithm to prospective electronic medical record data identified 8 cases without false positives. These included 4 patients that had not been reported to the health department. There were no known cases of acute hepatitis B missed by the algorithm. Conclusions An algorithm using codified electronic medical record data can reliably detect acute hepatitis B. The completeness of public health surveillance may be improved by automatically identifying notifiable diseases from electronic medical record data."
https://openalex.org/W2068775387,"Background Classification of eukaryotes provides a fundamental phylogenetic framework for ecological, medical, and industrial research. In recent years eukaryotes have been classified into six major supergroups: Amoebozoa, Archaeplastida, Chromalveolata, Excavata, Opisthokonta, and Rhizaria. According to this supergroup classification, Archaeplastida and Chromalveolata each arose from a single plastid-generating endosymbiotic event involving a cyanobacterium (Archaeplastida) or red alga (Chromalveolata). Although the plastids within members of the Archaeplastida and Chromalveolata share some features, no nucleocytoplasmic synapomorphies supporting these supergroups are currently known. Methodology/Principal Findings This study was designed to test the validity of the Archaeplastida and Chromalveolata through the analysis of nucleus-encoded eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) and cytosolic heat-shock protein of 70 kDa (HSP70) sequences generated from the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa, the cryptophytes Goniomonas truncata and Guillardia theta, the katablepharid Leucocryptos marina, the rhizarian Thaumatomonas sp. and the green alga Mesostigma viride. The HSP70 phylogeny was largely unresolved except for certain well-established groups. In contrast, EEF2 phylogeny recovered many well-established eukaryotic groups and, most interestingly, revealed a well-supported clade composed of cryptophytes, katablepharids, haptophytes, rhodophytes, and Viridiplantae (green algae and land plants). This clade is further supported by the presence of a two amino acid signature within EEF2, which appears to have arisen from amino acid replacement before the common origin of these eukaryotic groups. Conclusions/Significance Our EEF2 analysis strongly refutes the monophyly of the Archaeplastida and the Chromalveolata, adding to a growing body of evidence that limits the utility of these supergroups. In view of EEF2 phylogeny and other morphological evidence, we discuss the possibility of an alternative eukaryotic supergroup."
https://openalex.org/W2150982668,"Voltage-driven activation of Kv channels results from conformational changes of four voltage sensor domains (VSDs) that surround the K(+) selective pore domain. How the VSD helices rearrange during gating is an area of active research. Luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) is a powerful spectroscopic ruler uniquely suitable for addressing the conformational trajectory of these helices. Using a geometric analysis of numerous LRET measurements, we were able to estimate LRET probe positions relative to existing structural models. The experimental movement of helix S4 does not support a large 15-20 A transmembrane ""paddle-type"" movement or a near-zero A vertical ""transporter-type"" model. Rather, our measurements demonstrate a moderate S4 displacement of 10 +/- 5 A, with a vertical component of 5 +/- 2 A. The S3 segment moves 2 +/- 1 A in the opposite direction and is therefore not moving as an S3-S4 rigid body."
https://openalex.org/W1988172265,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) degrades mutant mRNAs containing premature termination codon (PTC-mRNAs). Here we evaluate the consequence of NMD activity in colorectal cancers (CRCs) showing microsatellite instability (MSI) whose progression is associated with the accumulation of PTC-mRNAs encoding immunogenic proteins due to frameshift mutations in coding repeat sequences. Inhibition of UPF1, one of the major NMD factors, was achieved by siRNA in the HCT116 MSI CRC cell line and the resulting changes in gene expression were studied using expression microarrays. The impact of NMD activity was also investigated in primary MSI CRCs by quantifying the expression of several mRNAs relative to their mutational status and to endogenous UPF1 and UPF2 expression. Host immunity developed against MSI cancer cells was appreciated by quantifying the number of CD3epsilon-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). UPF1 silencing led to the up-regulation of 1251 genes in HCT116, among which a proportion of them (i.e. 38%) significantly higher than expected by chance contained a coding microsatellite (P<2x10(-16)). In MSI primary CRCs, UPF1 was significantly over-expressed compared to normal adjacent mucosa (P<0.002). Our data provided evidence for differential decay of PTC-mRNAs compared to wild-type that was positively correlated to UPF1 endogenous expression level (P = 0.02). A negative effect of UPF1 and UPF2 expression on the host's anti-tumor response was observed (P<0.01). Overall, our results show that NMD deeply influences MSI-driven tumorigenesis at the molecular level and indicate a functional negative impact of this system on anti-tumor immunity whose intensity has been recurrently shown to be an independent factor of favorable outcome in CRCs."
https://openalex.org/W2129860207,"The haptic perception of the curvature of an object is essential for adequate object manipulation and critical for our guidance of actions. This study investigated how the ability to perceive the curvature of an object is altered by Parkinson's disease (PD).Eight healthy subjects and 11 patients with mild to moderate PD had to judge, without vision, the curvature of a virtual ""box"" created by a robotic manipulandum. Their hands were either moved passively along a defined curved path or they actively explored the curved curvature of a virtual wall. The curvature was either concave or convex (bulging to the left or right) and was judged in two locations of the hand workspace--a left workspace location, where the curved hand path was associated with curved shoulder and elbow joint paths, and a right workspace location in which these joint paths were nearly linear. After exploring the curvature of the virtual object, subjects had to judge whether the curvature was concave or convex. Based on these data, thresholds for curvature sensitivity were established. The main findings of the study are: First, 9 out 11 PD patients (82%) showed elevated thresholds for detecting convex curvatures in at least one test condition. The respective median threshold for the PD group was increased by 343% when compared to the control group. Second, when distal hand paths became less associated with proximal joint paths (right workspace), haptic acuity was reduced substantially in both groups. Third, sensitivity to hand trajectory curvature was not improved during active exploration in either group.Our data demonstrate that PD is associated with a decreased acuity of the haptic sense, which may occur already at an early stage of the disease."

Linking rules based on dynamical criteria are followed in the attachment process to force phase locking of the network with the external pacemaker. We show that the eventual locking occurs in correspondence to the arousal of a scale-free degree distribution in the original graph."
https://openalex.org/W2007646613,"Rickettsia raoultii is a novel Rickettsia species recently isolated from Dermacentor ticks and classified within the spotted fever group (SFG). The inability of R. raoultii to spread within L929 cells suggests that this bacterium is unable to polymerize host cell actin, a property exhibited by all SFG rickettsiae except R. peacocki. This result led us to investigate if RickA, the protein thought to generate actin nucleation, was expressed within this rickettsia species.Amplification and sequencing of R. raoultii rickA showed that this gene encoded a putative 565 amino acid protein highly homologous to those found in other rickettsiae. Using immunofluorescence assays, we determined that the motility pattern (i.e. microcolonies or cell-to-cell spreading) of R. raoultii was different depending on the host cell line in which the bacteria replicated. In contrast, under the same experimental conditions, R. conorii shares the same phenotype both in L929 and in Vero cells. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of infected cells showed that non-motile bacteria were free in the cytosol instead of enclosed in a vacuole. Moreover, western-blot analysis demonstrated that the defect of R. raoultii actin-based motility within L929 cells was not related to lower expression of RickA.These results, together with previously published data about R. typhi, strongly suggest that another factor, apart from RickA, may be involved with be responsible for actin-based motility in bacteria from the Rickettsia genus."
https://openalex.org/W2050019798,"In the present study we analyze the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) and future health care costs. On the basis of the relation between these anthropometric measures and mortality, we hypothesized that for all levels of BMI increased WC implies added future health care costs (Hypothesis 1) and for given levels of WC increased BMI entails reduced future health care costs (Hypothesis 2). We furthermore assessed whether a combination of the two measures predicts health care costs better than either individual measure.Data were obtained from the Danish prospective cohort study Diet, Cancer and Health. The population includes 15,334 men and 16,506 women 50 to 64 years old recruited in 1996 to 1997. The relationship between future health care costs and BMI and WC in combination was analyzed by use of categorized and continuous analyses. The analysis confirms Hypothesis 1, reflecting that an increased level of abdominal fat for a given BMI gives higher health care costs. Hypothesis 2, that BMI had a protective effect for a given WC, was only confirmed in the continuous analysis and for a subgroup of women (BMI<30 kg/m(2) and WC <88 cm). The relative magnitude of the estimates supports that the regressions including WC as an explanatory factor provide the best fit to the data.The study showed that WC for given levels of BMI predicts increased health costs, whereas BMI for given WC did not predict health costs except for a lower cost in non-obese women with normal WC. Combining WC and BMI does not give a better prediction of costs than WC alone."
https://openalex.org/W2053117659,"Genomic regions participating in recombination events may support distinct topologies, and phylogenetic analyses should incorporate this heterogeneity. Existing phylogenetic methods for recombination detection are challenged by the enormous number of possible topologies, even for a moderate number of taxa. If, however, the detection analysis is conducted independently between each putative recombinant sequence and a set of reference parentals, potential recombinations between the recombinants are neglected. In this context, a recombination hotspot can be inferred in phylogenetic analyses if we observe several consecutive breakpoints. We developed a distance measure between unrooted topologies that closely resembles the number of recombinations. By introducing a prior distribution on these recombination distances, a Bayesian hierarchical model was devised to detect phylogenetic inconsistencies occurring due to recombinations. This model relaxes the assumption of known parental sequences, still common in HIV analysis, allowing the entire dataset to be analyzed at once. On simulated datasets with up to 16 taxa, our method correctly detected recombination breakpoints and the number of recombination events for each breakpoint. The procedure is robust to rate and transitionratiotransversion heterogeneities for simulations with and without recombination. This recombination distance is related to recombination hotspots. Applying this procedure to a genomic HIV-1 dataset, we found evidence for hotspots and de novo recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1999591743,"Background Music-syntactic irregularities often co-occur with the processing of physical irregularities. In this study we constructed chord-sequences such that perceived differences in the cognitive processing between regular and irregular chords could not be due to the sensory processing of acoustic factors like pitch repetition or pitch commonality (the major component of ‘sensory dissonance’). Methodology/Principal Findings Two groups of subjects (musicians and nonmusicians) were investigated with electroencephalography (EEG). Irregular chords elicited an early right anterior negativity (ERAN) in the event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The ERAN had a latency of around 180 ms after the onset of the music-syntactically irregular chords, and had maximum amplitude values over right anterior electrode sites. Conclusions/Significance Because irregular chords were hardly detectable based on acoustical factors (such as pitch repetition and sensory dissonance), this ERAN effect reflects for the most part cognitive (not sensory) components of regularity-based, music-syntactic processing. Our study represents a methodological advance compared to previous ERP-studies investigating the neural processing of music-syntactically irregular chords."
https://openalex.org/W1990565123,"Social insects exhibit a variety of caste-specific behavioral tendencies that constitute the basis of division of labor within the colony. In termites, the soldier caste display distinctive defense behaviors, such as aggressively attacking enemies with well-developed mandibles, while the other castes retreat into the colony without exhibiting any aggressive response. It is thus likely that some form of soldier-specific neuronal modification exists in termites. In this study, the authors compared the brain (cerebral ganglion) and the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) of soldiers and pseudergates (workers) in the damp-wood termite, Hodotermopsis sjostedti. The size of the SOG was significantly larger in soldiers than in pseudergates, but no difference in brain size was apparent between castes. Furthermore, mandibular nerves were thicker in soldiers than in pseudergates. Retrograde staining revealed that the somata sizes of the mandibular motor neurons (MdMNs) in soldiers were more than twice as large as those of pseudergates. The enlargement of MdMNs was also observed in individuals treated with a juvenile hormone analogue (JHA), indicating that MdMNs become enlarged in response to juvenile hormone (JH) action during soldier differentiation. This enlargement is likely to have two functions: a behavioral function in which soldier termites will be able to defend more effectively through relatively faster and stronger mandibular movements, and a developmental function that associates with the development of soldier-specific mandibular muscle morphogenesis in termite head. The soldier-specific enlargement of mandibular motor neurons was observed in all examined species in five termite families that have different mechanisms of defense, suggesting that such neuronal modification was already present in the common ancestor of termites and is significant for soldier function."

https://openalex.org/W1986854452,"In controlling animal behavior the nervous system has to perform within the operational limits set by the requirements of each specific behavior. The implications for the corresponding range of suitable network, single neuron, and ion channel properties have remained elusive. In this article we approach the question of how well-constrained properties of neuronal systems may be on the neuronal level. We used large data sets of the activity of isolated invertebrate identified cells and built an accurate conductance-based model for this cell type using customized automated parameter estimation techniques. By direct inspection of the data we found that the variability of the neurons is larger when they are isolated from the circuit than when in the intact system. Furthermore, the responses of the neurons to perturbations appear to be more consistent than their autonomous behavior under stationary conditions. In the developed model, the constraints on different parameters that enforce appropriate model dynamics vary widely from some very tightly controlled parameters to others that are almost arbitrary. The model also allows predictions for the effect of blocking selected ionic currents and to prove that the origin of irregular dynamics in the neuron model is proper chaoticity and that this chaoticity is typical in an appropriate sense. Our results indicate that data driven models are useful tools for the in-depth analysis of neuronal dynamics. The better consistency of responses to perturbations, in the real neurons as well as in the model, suggests a paradigm shift away from measuring autonomous dynamics alone towards protocols of controlled perturbations. Our predictions for the impact of channel blockers on the neuronal dynamics and the proof of chaoticity underscore the wide scope of our approach."
https://openalex.org/W2139170896,"Little is known about the possible function of the bulk of the human genome. We have recently shown that long-range regular oscillation in the motif non-T, A/T, G (VWG) existing at ten-nucleotide multiples influences large-scale nucleosome array formation. In this work, we have determined the locations of all 100 kb regions that are predicted to form distinctive chromatin structures throughout each human chromosome (except Y). Using these data, we found that a significantly greater fraction of 300 kb sequences lacked annotated transcripts in genomic DNA regions ≥300 kb that contained nearly continuous chromatin organizing signals than in control regions. We also found a relationship between the meiotic recombination frequency and the presence of strong VWG chromatin organizing signals. Large (≥300 kb) genomic DNA regions having low average recombination frequency are enriched in chromatin organizing signals. As additional controls, we show using chromosome 1 that the VWG motif signals are not enriched in randomly selected DNA regions having the mean size of the recombination coldspots, and that non-VWG motif sets do not generate signals that are enriched in recombination coldspots. We also show that tandemly repeated alpha satellite DNA contains strong VWG signals for the formation of distinctive nucleosome arrays, consistent with the low recombination activity of centromeres. Our correlations cannot be explained simply by variations in the GC content. Our findings suggest that a specific set of periodic DNA motifs encoded in genomic DNA, which provide signals for chromatin organization, influence human chromosome function."
