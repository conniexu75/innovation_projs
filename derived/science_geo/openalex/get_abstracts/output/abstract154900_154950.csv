A full-length mouse ABC1 cDNA was used to investigate the mechanisms of lipid efflux to apoA-I or HDL in transfected 293 cells. ABC1 expression markedly increased cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apoA-I but had only minor effects on lipid efflux to HDL. The increased lipid efflux appears to involve a direct interaction between apoA-I and ABC1, because ABC1 expression substantially increased apoA-I binding at the cell surface, and chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation analysis showed that apoA-I binds directly to ABC1. In contrast to scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), another cell surface molecule capable of facilitating cholesterol efflux, ABC1 preferentially bound lipid-free apoA-I but not HDL. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed that ABC1 is primarily localized on the cell surface. In the absence of apoA-I, cells overexpressing ABC1 displayed a distinctive morphology, characterized by plasma membrane protrusions and resembling echinocytes that form when there are excess lipids in the outer membrane hemileaflet. The studies provide evidence for a direct interaction between ABC1 and apoA-I, but not HDL, indicating that free apoA-I is the metabolic substrate for ABC1. Plasma membrane ABC1 may act as a phospholipid/cholesterol flippase, providing lipid to bound apoA-I, or to the outer membrane hemileaflet.

It has been proposed that HDL promotes reverse cholesterol transport by facilitating transfer of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for disposal (2Tall A.R. J. Clin.

A breakthrough in our understanding of this process came recently from studies of Tangier disease and familial HDL deficiency, in which the molecular defect was shown to be mutations in the ATP binding cassette transporter 1 (ABC1) gene (3Brooks-Wilson A.

Tangier disease is a rare recessive genetic disorder characterized by extremely low HDL levels, accumulation of cholesterol esters in macrophages, and, in some cases, premature coronary heart diseases (6Schaefer E.J. Zech L.A. Schwartz D.E. Brewer Jr., H.B. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). ABC1 is a 240-kDa protein belonging to a large family of conserved transmembrane proteins that transport a wide variety of substrates, including ions, drugs, peptides, and lipids, across cell membranes (7Croop J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The finding that fibroblasts from Tangier disease patients have a marked defect in efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apoA-I (8Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin.

Another membrane protein that binds HDL and mediates HDL cholesterol ester (HDL CE) uptake (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

SR-BI is primarily expressed in liver and steroidogenic tissues and mediates HDL CE and free cholesterol uptake (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 2411-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). However, the function of SR-BI in macrophages is yet to be defined. In the present study, we characterized the ABC1 cDNA in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells. In contrast to the published ABC1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession numbers X75926 and NM005502), we found an additional 60-amino acid at the amino terminus of ABC1 that is required for it to mediate cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux. We also demonstrate, by binding and chemical cross-linking studies, that apoA-I directly interacts with ABC1. Human apoA-I was commercially obtained (BioDesign). Anti-FLAG antibodies were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and anti-SR-BI antibodies were from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) was from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Murine ABC1 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using murine RAW cell total RNA and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, CA). The 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR of human ABC1 mRNA of THP1 cells, isolation, and characterization of novel ABC1 transcripts, and isolation and determination of human ABC1 promoter and exon/intron structures of human ABC1 gene have been described (18Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3.1/mABC1Δ contained a murine ABC1 cDNA from bp 254 to 6869 according to the published mouse ABC1 mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number X75926). pcDNA3.1/mABC1 had the murine ABC1 cDNA from bp 49 to 6869. Compared with ABC1Δ, this results in a putative extra amino-terminal 60-amino acid sequence (MACWPQLRLLLWKNLTFRRRQTCQLLLEVAWPLF- IFLILISVRLSWPPYEQHECHFPNKA). ABC1 with the FLAG epitope incorporated at its carboxyl terminus was constructed using PCR and primers encoding the amino acid sequence of the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM media plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. 1 day before transfection, the cells were plated on 6- or 24-well plates coated with collagen. The next day, cells at about 95% confluence were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) and corresponding plasmid constructs. For lipid efflux assays, cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml 1,2-[3H]cholesterol or 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline on the same day as cell transfection. 24 h after transfection and labeling, the cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with DMEM media plus 0.2% fatty acid free bovine albumin (DMED/BSA). The media were then replaced with fresh DMED/BSA in the presence or absence of the indicated amount of apoA-I or HDL3 and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The media were collected and counted for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting in cholesterol efflux assay or extracted with hexane/isopropanol (3:2) solution and then counted in phospholipid efflux assay. Cells were dissolved with 0.1n NaOH and 0.2% SDS in cholesterol efflux assays or extracted with hexane/isopropanol solution in phospholipid efflux assays and residual radioactivity remaining in cells was determined. ApoA-I or HDL3 (d = 1.12–1.21 g/ml) isolated from human plasma were iodinated with [125I]iodide by IODO-GEN (Pierce) to a specific activity of ∼1325 cpm/ng apoA-I or ∼1246 cpm/ng HDL3 protein. Cells grown on 24-well plates were incubated on ice for 2 h in DMEM/BSA with 1.0 μg/ml labeled apoA-I or HDL3 in the presence or absence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled ligands. Cells were then washed rapidly four times with ice-cold DMED/BSA. Cells were dissolved with 0.1 nNaOH and 0.2% SDS. Protein content was measured with a modified Lowry method, and bound iodinated ligands were determined by gamma counting. Cells grown on 6-well plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 1 μg/ml iodinated apoA-I or HDL3 in DMEM/BSA in the presence or absence of 50-fold excess of unlabeled ligands. Cells were then placed on ice for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. DSP was dissolved immediately before use in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted to 250 μm with PBS, and 1.5 ml was added per well. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h; the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were lysed at 4 °C with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, GmbH, Germany) and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were centrifuged at top speed in a microcentrifuge for 15 min. The supernatant was collected, 40 μg of normal goat IgG and 10 μl of Protein AG Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) were added to it, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. After a brief spin, 15 μg of monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody or 50 μg of polyclonal anti-SR-BI antibody was added to the preabsorbed cell lysates and incubated by rotating at 4 °C overnight. Protein AG Plus-agarose was then added, and incubation was continued for 2 h by rotating the tubes. The samples were centrifuged briefly, and the pellet was washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer and twice with PBS. The bound proteins were eluted from the agarose beads by incubation and boiling with Laemmli sample buffer in the presence or absence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The eluted proteins were loaded onto 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels for electrophoresis followed by electrotransfer to a nitrocellulose sheet for autoradiography and Western analysis. Cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 10 min and then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with primary antibody in 4 mg/ml normal goat globulin, 0.1% saponin in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa 568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. After washing and postfixing with 3% formaldehyde, cells were examined by confocal microscopy as described previously (19Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). During recent studies to identify the promoter of the human ABC1 gene, we found a 5′-extension of the cDNA sequence, compared with the published cDNA (GenBank™ accession numbers X75926 and NM005502) (18Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). This contained a new upstream start codon with a strong Kozak consensus sequence (20Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) and is in-frame with the previously published ATG located 60 amino acids downstream (21Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The strong homology of this new amino-terminal amino acid sequence of ABC1 with the amino-terminal amino acid sequences of ABCR and ABC3, two other ABC1 family members (22Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A. Chidambaram A. Gerrard B. Baird L. Stauffer D. Peiffer A. Rattner A. Smallwood P. Li Y. Anderson K.L. Lewis R.A. Nathans J. Leppert M. Dean M. Lupski J.R. Nat.

Genomics. 1997; 39: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the prediction of a signal peptide with a cleavage site between residues 45 and 46 (using the program SignalP (25Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar), suggested that this newly identified upstream start codon is the authentic translation initiation site for ABC1. To test this hypothesis, we made plasmid constructs expressing ABC1 with or without the putative amino-terminal 60 amino acids (pcDNA3.1/ABC1 versuspcDNA3.1/ABC1Δ). To facilitate expression analysis, a FLAG epitope was incorporated into the carboxyl terminus of ABC1 or ABC1Δ. Cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by apoA-I was determined in HEK 293 cells transfected with the expression constructs. Addition of apoA-I in the control cells only slightly increased cholesterol efflux (mock versus mock + apoA-I; Fig.1). In contrast, apoA-I markedly increased cholesterol efflux in ABC1-transfected cells. The apoA-I-specific enhancement of cholesterol efflux (apoA-I present minus apoA-I absent) increased 10.5-fold (0.4% efflux in mock cellsversus 4.2% in ABC1-transfected cells). ABC1-FLAG was as equally effective as ABC1 in promoting cholesterol efflux, showing that the FLAG epitope does not interfere with the function of ABC1 (Fig. 1). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis showed that ABC1-FLAG migrated with a M r ∼ 240 kDa (data not shown). In contrast, expression of ABC1Δ had no effect on apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux, indicating that the amino-terminal 60 amino acids of ABC1 (18Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) are essential for function. To test for the expression of ABC1Δ, we also transfected HEK 293 cells with ABC1Δ-FLAG. Immunofluorescence microscopy detected the expression of ABC1Δ-FLAG in the transfected cells (data not shown) even though this construct failed to increase apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. Some previous studies have suggested that both apoA-I- and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux are impaired in fibroblasts from Tangier disease patients (8Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 26Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the ability of apoA-I and HDL to mediate cholesterol efflux in ABC1-transfected or control cells. ApoA-I markedly increased ABC1-dependent cholesterol efflux, in a process that was saturated at low apoA-I concentrations (Fig. 2 a). The EC50 for apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux in ABC1-transfected cells was approximately 2.0 μg/ml. HDL3did promote cellular cholesterol efflux in the control cells (Fig.2 b). However, this effect was largely ABC1-independent, because ABC1 expression only slightly increased cholesterol efflux by HDL3. These results indicate that apoA-I is the preferred acceptor for ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux.Figure 2ABC1 expression markedly increases apoA-I - but not HDL3-mediated lipid efflux. a, the protocol was similar to that in Fig. 1 except that a series of different apoA-I concentrations was used; b, similar toa except that HDL3 was used; c, cells were transfected and labeled with [3H]choline chloride. For PC efflux, DMEM/BSA media in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml apoA-I or HDL3 were added and incubated with cells for 4 h at 37 °C. Media or cells were extracted to separate [3H]PC from free [3H]choline and counted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined ApoA-I- and HDL3-mediated phosphatidyl choline (PC) efflux. ABC1 transfection substantially increased apoA-I mediated PC efflux (Fig. 2 c). However, HDL3-mediated PC efflux was only slightly increased in ABC1-transfected cells relative to the control (mock + HDL). To determine if ABC1 increases binding of ligands to the cell surface, [125I]apoA-I and [125I]HDL3binding to HEK 293 cells was examined. ABC1 transfection markedly increased the binding of apoA-I to cells at 4 °C (Fig.3 a). However, HDL3binding to the cell surface did not change in ABC1-transfected cells relative to the control (Fig. 3 b). In contrast to ABC1, SR-BI expression in HEK 293 cells was found to increase both apoA-I and HDL binding (Fig. 3), as previously reported (27Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Williams D.L. de la Llera-Moya M. Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The increased binding of apoA-I in HEK 293 cells overexpressing ABC1 could be due to direct interactions between apoA-I and ABC1, or it could be secondary to other changes in the cell membrane resulting from ABC1 overexpression. To address this, we performed chemical cross-linking studies using [125I]apoA-I or [125I]HDL3 and the homobifunctional cross-linker DSP. To facilitate the isolation of the cross-linked complexes by immunoprecipitation, we transfected HEK293 cells with the ABC1-FLAG cDNA, which was indistinguishable from the ABC1 cDNA in promoting cellular cholesterol efflux (Fig.1). [125I]apoA-I was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG from the lysate of ABC1-FLAG-transfected cells and migrated as a broad band at an apparent molecular mass of approximately 260–320 kDa when cross-linked with DSP (Fig. 3 c, lane 2), whereas the control cells did not yield any detectable band (Fig.3 c, lane 1). This indicates that apoA-I directly binds to ABC1. The size of the complex suggests that ABC1 is monomericin vivo. In the absence of cross-linker (lane 3) or in the presence of 50-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I (lane 4), this high molecular mass band was abolished. Reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol can break the -S-S- bridge of DSP and therefore separate the components cross-linked by DSP. Upon 2-mercaptoethanol treatment the [125I]apoA-I, migrating as a high molecular mass band in lane 2, now migrated at the position of monomeric apoA-I (Fig. 3 c, lanes 5and 6). Corroborating a recent report showing that apoA-I binds directly to SR-BI (28Williams D.L. de la Llera-Moya M. Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we found that [125I]apoA-I bound and cross-linked to SR-BI (Fig. 3 c, lane 7) and migrated as a high molecular mass broad band. This is consistent with the hypothesis that SR-BI forms homodimers in vivo(28Williams D.L. de la Llera-Moya M. Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast to apoA-I, [125I] HDL3 was not co-immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG from ABC1-FLAG-transfected cells treated with DSP (Fig. 3 d, lane 2), although the lipoprotein particles were bound and cross-linked to SR-BI (Fig. 3 d, lane 7). These results demonstrate that apoA-I directly interacts with ABC1, whereas HDL does not. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to determine the localization of ABC1 with anti-FLAG antibody in permeabilized ABC1-FLAG-transfected HEK 293 cells. Confocal microscopy revealed a strong cell surface signal (Fig.4), indicating that ABC1 is localized primarily on the cellular plasma membrane. There were also a few intracellular punctate structures with positive FLAG signals. They probably represent ABC1 at intracellular sites as reported previously (29Orso E. Broccardo C. Kaminski W.E. Bottcher A. Liebisch G. Drobnik W. Gotz A. Chambenoit O. Diederich W. Langmann T. Spruss T. Luciani M.F. Rothe G. Lackner K.J. Chimini G. Schmitz G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Frequently we found that FLAG-positive cells had long thin projections from the cell body, containing strong immunofluorescent signals for ABC1 (Fig. 4 b). Approximately 25% of FLAG-positive cells displayed such morphological changes. In contrast, the percentage was reduced to ∼4% when 40 μg/ml apoA-I was added during transfection (data not shown). ApoA-I did not affect the transfection efficiency, because the expression of green fluorescence protein was unchanged in the presence of apoA-I. In this study we have demonstrated that ABC1 facilitates apoA-I-mediated cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux. ABC1 expression specifically increases binding of apoA-I, but not HDL3, to the cell surface. The chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation analysis reveal that apoA-I directly interacts with ABC1. Compared with HDL, apoA-I is the preferred acceptor for ABC1-promoted cholesterol and phospholipid efflux. ABC1 is primarily localized on the cellular plasma membrane. It is likely that the direct interaction between apoA-I and ABC1 at the cell surface is required for the lipid efflux facilitated by these two proteins. Increased apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux by ABC1 expression has been reported by other groups, but in these studies the requirement for an additional 60 amino acids at the amino terminus was apparently not appreciated. One group used ABC1 cDNA equivalent to ABC1Δ in this study (29Orso E. Broccardo C. Kaminski W.E. Bottcher A. Liebisch G. Drobnik W. Gotz A. Chambenoit O. Diederich W. Langmann T. Spruss T. Luciani M.F. Rothe G. Lackner K.J. Chimini G. Schmitz G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), whereas the 5′-end of the ABC1 cDNA used by another group was not clearly defined (30Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R25-R31Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). ABC1Δ failed to increase apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux under the experimental conditions of this study. We cannot explain the apparent discrepancy of these findings. The necessity of this amino-terminal 60-amino acid sequence has also been suggested recently by DNA sequence analysis (31Fielding C.J. Kane J.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 271: 451-455Google Scholar), although no functional studies were conducted. The binding of apoA-I to fibroblasts from Tangier disease patients has been reported to be abnormal in some studies (8Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) but not in others (26Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The great heterogeneity of ABC1 mutations and therefore the different biochemical bases for Tangier disease could potentially explain these different findings. In addition to apoA-I, cholesterol efflux mediated by other apolipoproteins such as apoA-II, apoA-IV, apoC-I, and apoC-III are all decreased in Tangier cells (26Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Based on this, doubt has been raised as to whether a single receptor really binds apoA-I in the process of lipid efflux (26Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Our findings unambiguously demonstrate that apoA-I directly binds to ABC1. In contrast, ABC1 overexpression fails to increase the cell surface binding of HDL3 and minimally affect HDL3-mediated cholesterol efflux. Together, these findings suggest that direct interaction of ligand (i.e. lipid-free apolipoproteins) with ABC1 is necessary for the stimulation of cholesterol efflux. The inverse ability of ABC1 and SR-BI to bind apoA-I and HDL3 has implications for their physiological rolesin vivo. Although this and other studies (28Williams D.L. de la Llera-Moya M. Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have shown the binding of both apoA-I and HDL to SR-BI, recent studies demonstrate that lipid-free apoA-I or preβ-1 HDL binds to SR-BI less efficiently than native HDL (32Liadaki K.N. Liu T. Xu S. Ishida B.Y. Krieger J.P. Kane J. Krieger M. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21262-21271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Indeed, the binding affinity of native HDL is inversely correlated with the density of the lipoprotein particles, suggesting that SR-BI binds most tightly to large, relatively low density, CE-rich HDL particles to maximize the efficiency of CE uptake (32Liadaki K.N. Liu T. Xu S. Ishida B.Y. Krieger J.P. Kane J. Krieger M. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21262-21271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, the current study demonstrates that ABC1 binds lipid-free apoA-I with high affinity but binds HDL3 poorly. Furthermore, it is notable that, unlike HDL, lipid-free apoA-I fails to promote cholesterol efflux mediated by SR-BI even though it binds SR-BI (12Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that in vivo newly synthesized apoA-I from liver and intestine circulates and interacts with ABC1 on the cell surface, recruiting phospholipids and cholesterol from peripheral cells. Accumulation of lipids on apoA-I may reduce the affinity for ABC1 and promote dissociation from the transporter. These nascent lipoprotein particles are further converted into larger HDL particles by accepting more lipids from peripheral cells, by phospholipid transfer protein-mediated lipid transfer from triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles (33Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-mediated cholesterol esterification. The mature large, CE-rich HDL circulates back to liver and preferentially binds SR-BI. This process may be facilitated by apoE on such particles (34Arai T. Rinninger F. Varban L. Fairchild-Huntress V. Liang C.P. Chen W. Seo T. Deckelbaum R. Huszar D. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Following selective uptake of HDL CE by SR-BI, the particles become smaller and have reduced affinity for SR-BI. In addition to secretion of apoA-I by the liver and small intestine, CETP and hepatic lipase also participate in the remodeling of HDL to generate free apoA-I. The anti-atherogenic effect of CETP in CETP-apoC-III double transgenic mice may be related to the increased production of small HDL particles and release of free apoA-I from HDL (35Hayek T. Masucci-Magoulas L. Jiang X. Walsh A. Rubin E. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2071-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition to apoA-I, other apolipoproteins also may function as acceptors for ABC1-mediated lipid efflux, because, in contrast to ABC1 knockout mice (29Orso E. Broccardo C. Kaminski W.E. Bottcher A. Liebisch G. Drobnik W. Gotz A. Chambenoit O. Diederich W. Langmann T. Spruss T. Luciani M.F. Rothe G. Lackner K.J. Chimini G. Schmitz G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), apoA-I knockout mice do not accumulate cholesterol esters in macrophages (36Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Besides apoA-I, apoA-IV appears to be a potential physiological acceptor. Indeed, lipoprotein-deficient serum from apoA-IV transgenic mice has markedly increased cholesterol efflux in J774 cells only after treatment with cAMP, a condition that increases expression of ABC1 (37Fournier N. Atger V. Paul J.L. Sturm M. Duverger N. Rothblat G.H. Moatti N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This could potentially explain the reduced atherosclerosis in apoA-IV transgenic mice (38Duverger N. Tremp G. Caillaud J.M. Emmanuel F. Castro G. Fruchart J.C. Steinmetz A. Denefle P. Science. 1996; 273: 966-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In contrast, the serum from apoA-IV transgenic mice does not increase cholesterol efflux from Fu5AH cells (37Fournier N. Atger V. Paul J.L. Sturm M. Duverger N. Rothblat G.H. Moatti N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a cell line with a high level of SR-BI expression (12Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). These observations imply that apoA-IV resembles apoA-I in ABC1- and SR-BI-mediated lipid efflux. The low EC50 (∼2 μg/ml) for apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux in cells expressing ABC1 and the direct binding of apoA-I to ABC1 suggest a high affinity of ABC1 for apoA-I. In humans, the average plasma concentration of free apoA-I and lipid poor preβ HDL has been estimated to be 60–120 μg/ml (39Ishida B.Y. Frolich J. Fielding C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bovet P. Darioli R. Essinger A. Golay A. Sigwart U. Kappenberger L. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 80: 41-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the availability of apoA-I is not normally rate-limiting for ABC1-mediated cholesterol efflux. However, the real concentration of lipid-free apoA-I available to ABC1 in atherosclerotic lesions is likely to be much lower. ApoA-I transgenic mice have markedly increased apoA-I production and greatly reduced atherogenesis (41Plump A.S. Scott C.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9607-9911Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), suggesting that apoA-I synthesis is a rate-limiting factor in reverse cholesterol transport. The up-regulation of ABC1 expression upon cholesterol loading in macrophages (42Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E. Schmitz G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 257: 29-33Google Scholar) could be another physiological responsein vivo to remove excess of cellular cholesterol. However, this response is mediated by liver X receptors and involves responses to specific oxysterols, which are probably not abundant in atheroma foam cells (18Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). This suggests that macrophage ABC1 expression is also rate-limiting for reverse cholesterol transport from atheroma foam cells. Cells overexpressing ABC1 assumed a striking morphology (Fig. 4), resembling echinocytes. Echinocytes are red blood cells containing spiky plasma membrane protrusions, which form upon addition of phospholipids or other amphipathic molecules to the outer leaflet of plasma membrane (43Sheetz M.P. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Platelets also form similar plasma membrane projections upon activation or addition of phospholipids (44Sune A. Bienvenue A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6794-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 45Ferrell Jr., J.E. Lee K.J. Huestis W.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The distinctive morphological changes and inhibition of these changes by addition of apoA-I suggest that they arise from an increased quantity of lipid, probably phospholipid and cholesterol, in the outer leaflet of the plasma membranes. Together with an example of mdr2, an ABC transporter that acts as a phospholipid translocase at the canalicular membranes (46Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A. Ottenhoff R. van der Lugt N.M. van Roon M.A. et al.Cell. 1993; 75: 451-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 47Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), these results suggest that ABC1 acts at the plasma membrane as a lipid translocase. Like the multi-drug resistance P-glycoprotein, ABC1 is a full transporter containing two clusters of six transmembrane domains and internal loops with nucleotide binding motifs. A detailed electron microscopy study suggests that the overall shape of P-glycoprotein approximates a cylinder of about 10 nm in diameter with a large central chamber of about 5 nm in diameter (48Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The aqueous pore is open at the extracellular face of the membrane but closed at the cytoplasmic face. In addition, an opening to the lipid phase, within the plane of the membrane, is also apparent. A working hypothesis is that lipids enter the protein channel by lateral diffusion in the plane of the inner leaflet hemimembrane and the polar headgroup is then flipped across the bilayer with the consumption of ATP (47Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). If ABC1 assumes a similar structure to the P-glycoprotein, lipid-free apoA-I could enter the chamber of the transporter and recruit flipped lipids. The limiting diameter of the pore could explain the poor binding and cholesterol efflux mediated by HDL3. In conclusion, our studies provide evidence for a direct interaction between apoA-I and ABC1 but not between HDL and ABC1, suggesting that lipid poor apoA-I or other lipid poor apolipoproteins such as apoA-IV is/are the physiological acceptor(s) for ABC1-mediated lipid efflux. The availability of free apoA-I, as well as the expression of ABC1 in atheroma foam cells, may both be rate-limiting for reverse cholesterol transport. We thank Drs. Jonathan D. Smith and Ping Zheng for providing the ABC1Δ plasmid for this study."
https://openalex.org/W2053365325,"Lipid-poor high density lipoprotein apolipoproteins remove cholesterol and phospholipids from cells by an active secretory pathway controlled by an ABC transporter called ABCA1. This pathway is induced by cholesterol and cAMP analogs in a cell-specific manner. Here we provide evidence that increased plasma membrane ABCA1 accounts for the enhanced apolipoprotein-mediated lipid secretion from macrophages induced by cAMP analogs. Treatment of RAW264 macrophages with 8-bromo-cAMP caused parallel increases in apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux, ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels, incorporation of ABCA1 into the plasma membrane, and binding of apoA-I to cell-surface ABCA1. All of these parameters declined to near base-line values within 6 h after removal of 8-bromo-cAMP, indicating that ABCA1 is highly unstable and is degraded rapidly in the absence of inducer. Thus, ABCA1 is likely to be the cAMP-inducible apolipoprotein receptor that promotes removal of cholesterol and phospholipids from macrophages."

A classic problem is the determination of the optimal arrangement of spheres in three dimensions in order to achieve the highest packing fraction; only recently has it been proved that the answer for infinite systems is a face-centred-cubic lattice. This simply stated problem has had a profound impact in many areas, ranging from the crystallization and melting of atomic systems, to optimal packing of objects and the sub-division of space. Here we study an analogous problem--that of determining the optimal shapes of closely packed compact strings. This problem is a mathematical idealization of situations commonly encountered in biology, chemistry and physics, involving the optimal structure of folded polymeric chains. We find that, in cases where boundary effects are not dominant, helices with a particular pitch-radius ratio are selected. Interestingly, the same geometry is observed in helices in naturally occurring proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2144377792,"Recent data suggest that sterol regulatory-binding protein (SREBP)-1c plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of different lipogenic genes mediating lipid synthesis as a key regulator of fuel metabolism. SREBP-1c regulates its downstream genes by changing its own mRNA level, which led us to sequence and analyze the promoter region of the mouse SREBP-1c gene. A cluster of putative binding sites of several transcription factors composed of an NF-Y site, an E-box, a sterol-regulatory element 3, and an Sp1 site were located at −90 base pairs of the SREBP-1c promoter. Luciferase reporter gene assays indicated that this SRE complex is essential to the basal promoter activity and confers responsiveness to activation by nuclear SREBPs. Deletion and mutation analyses suggest that the NF-Y site and SRE3 in the SRE complex are responsible for SREBP activation, although the other sites were also involved in the basal activity. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that SREBP-1 binds to the SRE3. Taken together, these findings implicate a positive loop production of SREBP-1c through the SRE complex, possibly leading to the overshoot in induction of SREBP-1c and its downstream genes seen in the livers of refed mice.

A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In contrast to other members of this family, SREBPs are synthesized as precursor proteins that remain bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope in the presence of sufficient sterol concentrations. Upon sterol deprivation, the precursor protein undergoes a sequential two-step cleavage process to release the NH2-terminal portion (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This mature SREBP then enters the nucleus and activates the transcription of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis by binding to sterol regulatory elements (SREs) or to palindromic sequences called E-boxes within their promoter regions (4Wang X. Briggs M. Hua X. Yokoyama C. Goldstein J. Brown M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T.

Currently, there are three forms of SREBP that have been characterized; SREBP-1a and -1c are derived from a single gene through the use of alternate promoters and SREBP-2 from a different gene. SREBP-1a is the more common isoform and is a stronger activator of transcription with a wider range of target genes than SREBP-1c because of a longer transactivation domain (6Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Transgenic mouse studies have shown that SREBP-1c plays a more active role in regulating the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis than those involved in cholesterol synthesis, whereas SREBP-1a activates both (6Shimano H.

Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 is known to be actively involved in the transcription of cholesterogenic enzymes (8Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that all cultured cells analyzed to date exclusively express SREBP-2 and the -1a isoform of SREBP-1, whereas most organs, including the liver, express predominantly SREBP-2 and the 1c isoform of SREBP-1 (9Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, are a group of genes involved in energy storage through synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides (10Goodridge A.G. Annu.

Excess amounts of carbohydrates taken up by cells are converted to triglycerides through these enzymes in lipogenic organs such as liver and adipose tissue.

Up regulation of hepatic SREBP-1 was observed in rodent livers on a fasting-refeeding regimen, a chronic high carbohydrate diet, and in primary hepatocytes with a high glucose medium. Meanwhile, down regulation of SREBP-1c was observed in livers from fasted rodents, insulin-depleted diabetic rats with streptozotocin treatment, and mice on a diet containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. In contrast to SREBP-2, which mediates sterol regulation completely at the cleavage level through interaction with SCAP and site-1 protease, SREBP-1c seems to control the transcriptional regulation of lipogenic enzymes by self-regulating the nuclear concentration of its mature form, which is highly correlated to its precursor and mRNA levels. These observations prompted us to analyze the promoter of SREBP-1c to understand the regulation of SREBP-1c itself and, thus, that of lipogenic enzymes. Standard molecular biology techniques were used. We obtained cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol from Sigma, Redivue [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs. Plasmid DNAs for transfection were prepared with EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kits (Qiagen). A SacI fragment of mouse SREBP-1 genomic DNA that contains most of 5′-flanking region of SREBP-1c exon 1 was sequenced from the transcription start site that was tentatively assigned from 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends of mouse SREBP-1c (28Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A BamHI-AvrII fragment (0.55 kb) extending from 5′-untranslated region to the promoter region was subcloned into SmaI site of pGL2 basic vector (Promega) (pBP1c550-Luc). The adjacent upstream BamHI fragment (2 kb) was further cloned into pBP1c550-Luc to generate a 2.6-kb fragment construct (pBP1c2600Luc). Other constructs were produced by PCR using this construct as DNA template and subcloning the PCR products into the pGL2 basic vector. The primers used for PCR were as follows: 3′ primer, 5′-TAAGAGCTCGGTACCTCCCCTAGGGC-3′; 5′ primer, pBP1c400-Luc 5′-GGGCCAGGAGTGGGTAAA-3′; pBP1c150-Luc, 5′-GGGAGAAACCCGAGCT-3′; pBP1c-90(NESSp)-Luc, 5′-CTGCTGATTGGCCAT GTG-3′; pBP1c-ESSp-Luc, 5′-CCATGTGCCCTCACCCGA-3′; pBP1c-SSp-Luc, 5′-CGCTCACCCGAGGGGCGGGGCA-3′; pBP1c-Sp-Luc, 5′-CGGGGCACGGAGGCG ATC-3′; pBP1c-mE-Luc, 5′-CTGCTGATTGGCAAAGTGCGCTCACCCGAG-3′; pBP1c-mSRE-Luc, 5′-CTGCTGATTGGCCATGTGCGCTACACCGAGGGGCGGGGCA-3′; pBP1c-mES-Luc, 5′-CTGCTGATTGGCAAAGTGCGCTACACCGAGGGGCGGGGC A-3′; and pBP1c-mSp-Luc, 5′-CTGCTGATTGGCCATGTGCGCTCACCCGAGTTTCGGGGCACGGAGGCG-3′. The primers were tailed with SmaI site (5′ primers) orKpnI site (3′ primer). The PCR products were digested withSmaI and KpnI and subcloned into the pGL2 basic vector. Human embryonic kidney 293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. On day 0, cells were plated on a 12 well plate at 4.5 × 104cells/well. On day 2, each luciferase reporter plasmid (0.5 μg), and an SV-β-galactosidase reference plasmid (pSV-β-gal, Promega, 0.5 μg) were transfected into cells using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In some experiments, expression plasmid (CMV-SREBP-1a, -1c, or -2 or their respective YR mutant versions) (0.5 μg) or basic plasmid CMV7 as negative control (29Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also co-transfected. 5 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in the condition as indicated for an additional 16 h prior to harvest. For the suppressed condition, DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum with cholesterol (10 μg/ml) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (1 μg/ml) was used to suppress endogenous SREBP activity. For induced condition, DMEM with 10% delipidated calf serum with 10 μm pravastatin was used. The amount of luciferase activity in transfectants was measured and normalized to the amount of β-galactosidase activity as measured by standard kits (Promega). The DNA probe was prepared by annealing both strands of the SRE complex, TGCTGATTGGCCATGTGCGCTCACCCGAGGGGCGGGG, and was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow enzyme, followed by purification on G50 Sephadex columns. The labeled DNA was incubated with a recombinant SREBP-1 protein (100 ng) in a mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 8.5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml nonfat milk for 30 min on ice. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4.6% polyacrylamide gel. We sequenced and analyzed 550 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site of the mouse SREBP-1c gene (Fig. 1). A computer-assisted search (the TFSEARCH program based upon the TRANSFAC data base (30Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 26: 364-370Google Scholar)) of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SREBP-1c promoter revealed some elements that have potential roles in its transcriptional regulation. It did not pick up any TATA box; however, there was a TATA-like sequence (CTTTAAAG) 25 bp upstream from the putative initiation site. No CAAT box has been found to lie within the expected distance from the start site. Two Sp1-binding sites were found at −102 and −59 bp. Adjacent to the downstream Sp1 site, there was a sequence highly similar (9 of 10 bp) to one of classic sterol regulatory elements, SRE3 (CTCACCCCAG), which was found in the farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene promoter and was extensively analyzed in terms of sterol regulation (31Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 32Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24359-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this SRE3-Sp1 sequence was directly connected to an E-box (CATGTG), which was found as a core sequence of the two SREBP-binding sites of the fatty acid synthase promoter (33Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Following the E-box was the NF-Y-binding site (inverted CCAAT box). Thus, this cluster consisting of the NF-Y, E-box, SRE3, and Sp1 sites has a very high probability of being SREBP-binding and activation site and was tentatively designated an SRE complex. To determine the location of functionally essential sequences required for maximal promoter activity, especially in relation to the SRE complex, we utilized deletional analysis using luciferease gene reporter assays in 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, the luciferase gene fused to the 2.6-kb flanking fragment, the longest of the promoter fragments used in this study, gave substantial luciferase activity in 293 cells. The SREBP-1c promoter activities of different length promoters were compared in the cells cultured at subconfluency in DMEM containing high (25 mm) glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum without addition of cholesterol derivatives as a basal condition. Shorter versions containing 0.55, 0.4, and 0.15 kb of the promoter showed essentially the same activity as the 2.6-kb fragment. The 90-bp construct containing the intact SRE complex but not the upstream Sp1 site showed approximately 50% of the activity of the 2.6-kb construct. This suggests that although the first Sp1 site contributes to some considerable promoter activity, the 90-bp promoter region contains nearly maximal activity in this cell culture condition. The deletion of the NF-Y site completely abolished the basal activity, demonstrating that this NF-Y site is essential for basal promoter activity of SREBP-1c.Figure 1DNA sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SREBP-1c gene.

This DNA was used for the luciferase reporter gene construct designated pBP1c550-Luc (Fig. 2). The TATA-like box is located at −25 bp. There are two putative Sp1 sites and E-boxes and a p300 site. At −90 bp, there is a region with high probability of being an SREBP target, designated SRE complex that is composed of an NF-Y site (inverted CCAAT), an E-box, an SRE3-like (31Ericsson J.

The initial deletion study suggests that the components of the SRE complex are crucial for both basal activity and sterol regulation. Therefore, we focused on the 90-bp construct. We constructed sequential deletion and mutant versions for each component, the NF-Y site, the E-box, SRE-3, and the Sp1 site and measured their promoter activities to evaluate their contributions. First, each luciferase construct was tested in presence of nuclear SREBP-1a that was highly expressed by cotransfection (Fig. 3). Medium was supplemented with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol to minimize the effects of endogenous SREBPs. As predicted, co-expression of SREBP-1a robustly (20-fold) increased the luciferease activities of the intact 90-bp construct (NESSp-Luc). Deletion of the NF-Y site (ESSp-Luc) caused a marked reduction in the basal activity and a complete disappearance in the SREBP-1a induction, suggesting that NF-Y is indispensable for SREBP-1 activation. Deletion of both the NF-Y-binding site and the E-box (SSp-Luc), leaving just the SRE-3 and the Sp1 site also caused a complete loss of both basal activity and SREBP-1a induction, indicating that the SRE3 and adjacent Sp1 sites, which would appear to be a complete functioning SREBP target site, are not sufficient for SREBP activation. Interestingly, mutation of E-box (mE-Luc) caused a 3-fold decrease in a basal activity but retained a high induction level similar to that of native 90-bp construct after SREBP-1a overexpression, rendering this E-box mutant construct the highest responder (40-fold) to SREBP-1a induction. These data demonstrate that the E-box is involved in some basal activity by a factor(s) other than SREBP. In contrast, when a mutation was introduced into the SRE3 site (mSRE-Luc), the basal activity was minimally affected, but SREBP-1a induction was completely abolished. Additional mutation in the E-box (mES-Luc) did not cause any further change in SREBP-1a induction. Finally, introduction of a mutation in the Sp1 site, which abolished Sp1-binding (mSp1-Luc), caused a substantial decrease in the basal activity but did not affect the fold change by SREBP-1a activation. Together, these data clearly demonstrate that SREBP induction of the SREBP-1c promoter is completely attributed to the NF-Y site and SRE3 and not to the E-box or the Sp1 site. Meanwhile, both E-box and Sp1 sites contribute to the basal promoter activity independent of SREBP. Next, the promoter activities of those constructs were compared in transfection studies in which the cells were cultured in suppressed and induced conditions for sterol regulation to see the effects of endogenous SREBPs in the cells. As shown in Fig.4, the promoter activity of the basic 90-bp construct (NESSp-Luc) in induced condition was three times higher than that in suppressed condition. The same set of deletion and mutation analysis in this endogenous regulation gave essentially the same data as from SREBP-1a co-expression, confirming the importance of NF-Y and SRE3 for SREBP activation. The only exception was that mutated E-box construct gave the same fold activation in inducedversus suppressed condition as the wild type construct. Luciferase reporter assays for the 90-bp construct indicated that SREBP-1a can activate the SREBP-1c promoter activity through the SRE complex. To demonstrate the direct binding of SREBP to SRE complex, gel mobility shift assay was performed. Fig.5 shows that the SRE complex probe was shifted after the addition of SREBP-1 protein (lane 2). The specificity of the binding was confirmed by its supershift by SREBP1 antibody (lane 6). In competition assays, the shifted band disappeared after addition of excess amount of the unlabeled SRE complex probe (lane 3) or its E-box mutant version (lane 4). In contrast, addition of the same excess amount of SRE complex probe with a mutation in SRE3 did not compete binding of SREBP-1 to native SRE complex probe (lane 5). Furthermore, labeled E-box mutated probe bound to SREBP-1 (lane 7), but the SRE3 mutated probe did not (lane 8). These data are consistent with the results of the luciferase assays and indicate that SREBPs activate the SREBP-1c promoter through binding to the SRE3 in the SRE complex. Nuclear SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2 were compared in the transcriptional activities for the 90-bp construct of SREBP-1c promoter. Interestingly, all SREBP isoforms elicited similar activation when overexpressed in 293 cells (Fig. 6). Replacement of arginine for the conserved tyrosine residue in the basic region of SREBP family has been shown to abolish SREBP binding to SRE and not to E-box (5Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The effect of this mutation on the 90-bp construct activity was estimated in each SREBP isoform. This mutation in each SREBP isoform essentially caused them to lose their activity, supporting that activation of native SREBP is mediated through binding to SRE3 and not to E-box (Fig.6). The basic 90-bp construct contains an SRE and seems to be involved in activation of SREBP-1c expression by SREBPs and also in sterol regulation. To see whether the sterol regulation of this construct can be reflected in the longer and, thus, more physiological promoter, we estimated sterol regulation of longer versions of endogenous and exogenous SREBPs. Interestingly, in suppressed conditions with both cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol in the medium, the longer promoter (400 bp to 2.6 kb) constructs showed 5-fold higher activity than the 90-bp construct in both SREBP-1a co-expression and induced/suppressed experiments (Fig.7). This contrasts to the observation in the experiment done in just fetal bovine serum without cholesterol where the difference was only 2-fold (Fig. 2), suggesting that sequence upstream of the SRE complex (between −400 and −90 bp) contains some promoter activity that could be induced by sterols. Co-expression of SREBP-1a increased luciferase activity of the 90-bp construct approximately 20-fold. This fold increase was substantially reduced in the 2.6-, 0.5-, and 0.4-kb constructs (6Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). This tendency was more clear in induced versus suppressed conditions (Fig. 7,right panel). In suppressed condition, activity of the longer version was three times higher than that of the 90-bp construct, whereas there was no essential increase in the activity by addition of upstream sequences to the 90-bp construct in induced condition. These data suggest that there is a regulatory sequence between −400 and −90 bp (upstream of the 90-bp construct) that activates the promoter activity in suppressed condition and not in induced condition. To confirm this, the promoter DNA fragment between −400 and −150 bp was fused to SV40 promoter containing luciferase reporter gene (pGL2 promoter). As shown in Fig. 8, luciferase activity of this construct was increased 6-fold by addition of cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol, demonstrating that the region contains an element(s) that confers sterol inducibility.Figure 8Presence of sterol-induced region upstream of the SRE complex in the SREBP-1c promoter. The DNA fragment upstream of the SRE complex (between −150 and −400 bp) was subcloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid that contains SV40 promoter (pGL2 promoter vector). The plasmid was transfected with pSV-β-gal into 293 cells and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum in presence or absence of sterols (1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μg/ml cholesterol). Empty pGL2 promoter vector was also transfected as negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The current study clearly demonstrates that mouse SREBP-1c promoter contains a sterol regulatory element and can be induced by SREBPs and leads us to the speculation that nuclear SREBP-1c protein can autoregulate its own SREBP-1c precursor. In short, as long as cleavage of SREBP is active, it can further activate SREBP-1c expression to form a positive feedback loop (Fig. 9). This positive loop may partially explain the overshooting phenomenon of induction of lipogenic enzyme genes in the refed state. Refeeding with low fat/high carbohydrate diet after fasting causes a marked induction of SREBP-1 mRNA and active protein (17Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 18Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), resulting in the activation of most hepatic lipogenic enzyme genes, often referred to overshooting. The molecular identity of the initial lipogenic signal is currently unknown, although it is likely to be some glucose metabolite. Once it starts induction of SREBP-1c, the autoregulatory loop of SREBP-1c induction could cause the overshooting. It is also possible that another factor or system could be responsible for the overshooting of SREBP-1c and downstream lipogenic genes. However, even if so, this positive loop should contribute to the supply of precursor protein to maintain the overshooting of SREBP-1 and thus, lipogenesis. Supporting this idea, SREBP-1 knock-out mice, in which induction of hepatic lipogenic genes is severely impaired, also exhibit substantially low level of hepatic aberrant SREBP-1 mRNA, which is derived from an intact SREBP-1c promoter of the disrupted SREBP-1 gene (12Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Studies with a knock-in animals in which only the SRE3 in the promoter is disrupted would be required to test this hypothesis. An autoregulation mechanism has been known in the modulation of gene expression of C/EBP family members (38Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which play an important role in adipogenesis where SREBP-1c might be also involved (5Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The presence of an SRE in the promoter of SREBP-1c places SREBP-1c expression at least partially under sterol regulation. The current transfection studies with the 90-bp construct in induced and suppressed conditions for sterol regulation supports this. However, the extent of sterol regulation for SREBP-1c expression seems limited in vivo. The longer versions that reflect more physiological regulation showed much less sterol regulation (Fig. 7) because of the concomitant upstream sterol-inducible element. Consistent with these complex results from the current promoter analysis, hepatic SREBP-1 mRNA is not decreased (or even increased) by feeding mice a diet enriched with cholesterol and cholic acid, which causes huge accumulation of cholesterol in the livers, a situation that mimics a sterol suppressed condition in cultured cells and abolishes the SREBP-2 mature form. Therefore, the physiological relevance of the SRE complex in the SREBP-1c promoter may be inducibility of SREBP-1c by SREBPs rather than sterol regulation. Current transfection studies comparing sterol regulation of the 90-bp construct and longer versions suggest that upstream of the SRE complex in the SREBP-1c promoter, there is a cis-element that induces SREBP-1c expression in suppressive conditions, presumably by cholesterol and/or oxysterols. The region somewhere between −400 and −150 bp seems responsible. This would explain why sterol regulation of SREBP-1c expression in vivo is obscure, because there are both sterol-suppressive and -inducible elements in the promoter. Currently, the physiological relevance of two elements in the same promoter that have opposite ways of cholesterol regulation is unknown. It can be speculated that sterol regulation by the SREBP cleavage system, which potentially inhibits lipogenesis, can be counterbalanced by this element and ensures lipogenesis even in the presence of sterols. Currently, studies are underway to specify the exact sequence of the cis-element and transcription factors responsible for this new regulation of SREBP-1c. This will help in understanding of the mechanism by which both sterol and fatty acid regulation are linked through SREBP-1c transcription. An important question remains to be answered about the high carbohydrate diet-responsive element in the SREBP-1c promoter. It has been shown that hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA is induced by high carbohydrate diet and refeeding regiment after fasting. Although our finding of possible feed-positive loop of SREBP1c induction might partially explain the robust and prolonged induction of SREBP-1c in vivo, there must be a mechanism of transcription that responds to the initial lipogenic signal. We could not detect a significant induction of SREBP-1c promoter activity by increased glucose concentration in the medium in HepG2 cells and saw only a 3-fold activation in 293 cells, which hampered further analysis of possible carbohydrate response elements. There are some possible reasons why we could not reproduce the dietary in vivo observation in reporter gene assays in cultured cells. The 2.6-kb promoter that we currently used might not contain the responsible element that could reside far upstream or downstream such as in an intron or the 3′-flanking region, or the dietary response of SREBP-1c might be partially post-transcriptional. It is also possible that in luciferase assays, the considerable amount of transfected DNA containing SRE complex consumed endogenous SREBP and prevented the autoloop formation, which would indicate that reporter gene assays are intrinsically inappropriate to detect this kind of autoloop phenomenon. To address this question, further studies including transgenic mice harboring different longer SREBP-1c promoter reporter genes or finding a better cell culture system are required. The current study revealed that the mouse SREBP-1c promoter contains multiple and complex regulatory elements through which both cholesterol and carbohydrates might be involved in the gene regulation of SREBP-1c. Further analysis on these elements might open up the new aspect of linkage between cholesterol, fatty acids, and fuel metabolism. We are grateful to Drs. Joseph L. Goldstein and Michael S. Brown for continuous support of the project."

The MDR3 P-glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein that translocates phosphatidylcholine. The MDR1 P-glycoprotein related transports cytotoxic drugs. Its overexpression can make cells resistant to a variety of drugs. Attempts to show that MDR3 P-glycoprotein can cause MDR have been unsuccessful thus far. Here, we report an increased directional transport of several MDR1 P-glycoprotein substrates, such as digoxin, paclitaxel, and vinblastine, through polarized monolayers of MDR3-transfected cells. Transport of other good MDR1 P-glycoprotein substrates, including cyclosporin A and dexamethasone, was not detectably increased. MDR3 P-glycoprotein-dependent transport of a short-chain phosphatidylcholine analog and drugs was inhibited by several MDR reversal agents and other drugs, indicating an interaction between these compounds and MDR3 P-gp. Insect cell membranes from Sf9 cells overexpressing MDR3 showed specific MgATP binding and a vanadate-dependent,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive nucleotide trapping activity, visualized by covalent binding with [α-32P]8-azido-ATP. Nucleotide trapping was (nearly) abolished by paclitaxel, vinblastine, and the MDR reversal agents verapamil, cyclosporin A, and PSC 833. We conclude that MDR3 P-glycoprotein can bind and transport a subset of MDR1 P-glycoprotein substrates. The rate of MDR3 P-glycoprotein-mediated transport is low for most drugs, explaining why this protein is not detectably involved in multidrug resistance. It remains possible, however, that drug binding to MDR3 P-glycoprotein could adversely affect phospholipid or toxin secretion under conditions of stress (e.g. in pregnant heterozygotes with oneMDR3 null allele).

Two P-gp genes have been identified in humans. The human MDR1 gene encodes a drug transporting P-gp that can actively extrude a range of cytotoxic anticancer drugs from the cytoplasm. Overexpression of this P-gp gene results in a decreased intracellular accumulation of these drugs and renders the cell multidrug resistant (1Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A.

Nevertheless, two studies suggest a role for MDR3 P-gp in drug transport: 1) analysis of B-cell leukemias showed a correlation between MDR3 overexpression and daunorubicin transport (13Nooter K.

The function of the murine homolog of human MDR3 P-gp, Mdr2 P-gp, became clear when Smit et al. (16Smit J.J.M. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A.A.M.

These mice were unable to excrete phospholipids (PL) into their bile, indicating that Mdr2 P-gp is a PL translocator or flippase, translocating PL from the cytosolic leaflet to the luminal leaflet of the canalicular membrane. The excretion of phosphatidylcholine (PC; the major PL in the bile) into the bile can be restored in these mice by expression of the human MDR3 gene in the hepatocytes (18Smith A.J. de Vree J.M.

Further evidence for the PC translocator function of the MDR3/Mdr2 P-gps came from studies in yeast and cultured mammalian cells. Gros and co-workers showed that secretory vesicles from yeast transformed with Mdr2 cDNA can accumulate fluorescent short chain PC (20Ruetz S. Gros P.

We demonstrated increased translocation of PC through the plasma membrane of cells overproducing the MDR3 P-gp (22Smith A.J. Timmermans-Hereijgers J.L.P.M. Roelofsen B.

Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Whereas the MDR1 P-gp was found to translocate a variety of PL analogs, the MDR3 P-gp proved highly selective, only translocating PL with a choline head group and a diacyl glycerol backbone. Even a PC with two short acyl chains (C8-C8-PC) was not transported (23van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). This selectivity seemed an adequate explanation for the inability of the MDR3/Mdr2 type of P-gp to contribute to MDR. It remains puzzling, however, that transport of a PC analogue by the MDR3 P-gp could be inhibited by verapamil, a known substrate and inhibitor of MDR1 P-gp (20Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 23van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G.

To resolve this paradox, we reinvestigated drug transport by the MDR3 P-gp, using monolayers of polarized kidney cells transfected with a MDR3 minigene (23van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), in which the transporter localizes in the apical membrane. We found that the transfected cells transport digoxin, a substrate of the MDR1 P-gp (24Tanigawara Y. Okamura N. Hirai M. Yasuhara M. Ueda K. Kioka N. Komano T. Hori R. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Moreover, these drugs appear to interact directly with the MDR3 P-gp, since they are able to inhibit vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping by MDR3 P-gp produced in insect cells. Here we present a detailed analysis of these unexpected results.

Cells were seeded on microporous polycarbonate membrane filters (pore size 3.0 μm, diameter 24.5 mm, TranswellTM, CostarR) at a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/filter. The cells were grown in complete medium for 3 days with a medium replacement the day after seeding. One hour before the start of the experiment, medium at both sides of the monolayer was replaced. The experiment was started by replacing the medium at either the apical or the basolateral side by medium containing 3H-labeled substrate drugs (0.25 μCi/ml) and inulin[14C]carboxylic acid (0.025 μCi/ml, 4.2 μm). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and 50-μl aliquots were taken from both compartments at t = 1, 2, 3, and 4 h. The appearance of radioactive drug in the opposite compartment was measured and presented as the fraction of total radioactivity added at the beginning of the experiment. Directional transport was measured in duplicate. The paracellular flow was monitored by the appearance of [14C]inulin in the opposite compartment and was always less than 1.5% of total radioactivity per hour. Inhibition of transport was measured similarly. One hour before the start of the experiment, the medium at both sides of the monolayer was replaced by complete medium containing the appropriate concentration of reversal agent. At t = 0, medium in one of the compartments was replaced by medium with radioactive drug and the indicated amount of reversal agent. Transport of C6-NBD-PC and C6-NBD-glucosylceramide (C6-NBD-GlcCer) was measured as described (23van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G.

Lipid precursors, C6-NBD-PA or C6-NBD-ceramide, were complexed to 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.35) (HBSS) to the following concentrations: 25 μm C6-NBD-PA and 5 μmC6-NBD-ceramide. To discriminate surface synthesized C6-NBD-PC (30van Helvoort A. van't Hof W. Ritsema T. Sandra A. van Meer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from transport of intracellularly synthesized C6-NBD-PC, cells were preincubated with 10 μCi of [3H]choline/ml HBSS for 1 h at 37 °C, after a 1-h choline depletion in HBSS at 37 °C. Incubation with the lipid precursors in HBSS plus BSA followed for 3 h at 15 °C in the presence of 10 μCi of [3H]choline. For inhibition studies, the appropriate concentration of reversal agents was present 1 h before and during the 3-h incubation at 15 °C. During the incubations, short-chain lipid products appearing on the cell surface were depleted into the medium by the BSA. After 3 h, the apical and basolateral medium were collected, and the cells were washed in HBSS plus BSA for 30 min on ice. The apical and basolateral washes were pooled with the respective incubation media, the filters were cut from the wells, and the lipids from media and cells were analyzed. Lipids were extracted from the cells and media by a modified Bligh and Dyer extraction (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The upper phase contained 20 mm acetic acid. The organic (lower) phase was dried under N2, and the lipids were applied to TLC plates. Lipid products were separated in two dimensions by borate-TLC as described (32van Genderen I. van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) but over 20 cm in the first (alkaline) dimension. In the case of C6-NBD-[3H]PC in cellular lipid extracts, the fluorescent spot was circled, and the plate was exposed to a film to allow accurate separation of C6-NBD-[3H]PC and long-chain [3H]PC. Fluorescent spots were quantitatively analyzed in a fluorimeter, radiolabeled spots were detected by fluorography, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting as described (33van der Bijl P. Lopes-Cardozo M. van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were cultured and infected with baculovirus vectors as described in Ref. 34Germann U.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2295-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar. Baculotransfer virus for MDR3 was constructed as follows: The plasmid constructs harboring human MDR3 cDNA were pJ3Ω-MDR3 and pJ3Ω-MDR3-NotI. Since the MDR3cDNA was found to be unstable in several baculovirus transfer vectors in E. coli, an alternative approach has been developed, which does not involve bacterial propagation of the recombinant vector. MDR3 cDNA and pieces of the appropriate transfer vector containing essential segments for homologous recombination with the viral DNA were ligated, and this ligation mix was used for cotransfection of insect cells. The 5′ region of the MDR3 cDNA (−33 to 1621) was removed from pJ3Ω-MDR3-NotI by NotI and ApaI digestion, and the 3′ region (1621–4002) was removed from the pJ3Ω-MDR3 by ApaI and XbaI digestion. Two segments of the pVL 1392 baculovirus transfer plasmid (Invitrogen) were isolated; the first one extends from 4154 to 8361 (obtained by XbaI and BglI digestion), and the second one covers the region from 9479 to 4138 (obtained by BglI and NotI digestion). The two MDR3 fragments were ligated with the two pVL1392 fragments, and this “ligation mix” was used for generating recombinant viruses with the Baculogold Transfection Kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Sf9 insect cells were infected and cultured as described previously (34Germann U.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2295-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The virus-infected Sf9 cells were suspended in a low ionic strength medium (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and disrupted using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. Membrane fractions were isolated by repeated centrifugations and homogenizations, and the membrane protein concentrations determined as described in Ref. 35Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C.

Quantitative estimation of the expression of human MDR3 and MDR1 P-gps was performed using the monoclonal antibody C219 (27Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hooijberg J.H. de Jong M.C. Wijnholds J. Mol C.A.A.M. van Helvoort A. Paulusma C.C. de Vree J.L.M. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Borst P. Scheper R.J. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40: 667Google Scholar), and polyclonal anti-MDR1 antisera 4077 and 4007 were applied. Anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-conjugated IgGs (10,000 × diluted, Jackson Immunoresearch), were used for secondary antibodies as described (37Tanaka S. Currier S.J. Bruggemann E.P. Ueda K. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-dependent luminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was determined by luminography and quantitated by a Bio-Rad Phosphor Imaging System. Binding of ATP to MDR3 P-gp was measured by incubation of isolated Sf9 cell membranes (100 μg of protein) for 5 min at 4 °C in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, in a final volume of 50 μl, in the presence of 5 μm Mg-8-azido-ATP, containing 0.2 MBq of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP. The solution was irradiated for 10 min with a UV lamp (λmax ∼250 nm) at a distance of 3 cm. The membranes were washed three times with 500 μl of ice-cold Tris-EGTA-MgATP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgATP) and collected in 40 μl of the electrophoresis buffer. Samples were run and electroblotted as described above. The blots were subjected to autoradiography in a phosphor imager, and the identity of the32P-azidonucleotide labeled bands was verified by immunostaining of the same blot. Isolated Sf9 cell membranes (100 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 s to 10 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate) in a final volume of 50 μl, in the presence of 5–200 μmMg-8-azido-ATP, containing 0.2 MBq of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP. The reaction was stopped with 500 μl of ice-cold Tris-EGTA-MgATP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgATP, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate), the membranes were washed twice in this buffer, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of Tris-EGTA. The membranes were irradiated and collected in 40 μl of electrophoresis buffer. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE and electroblotted, and the blot was processed further as described above. The effects of various cytotoxic agents on vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping was measured by the addition of the drugs to the reaction mixture. The effect of phospholipids was assessed by the addition of sonicated liposomes. In the transport experiments, two replicate slopes were measured per experiment. Statistical analysis of the experiments was performed by a one-way analysis of variance approach with the individual slopes as experimental units. The slope of the line through the four time points of each well was determined, resulting in two estimations of the slope per experiment. Because we assumed that the random variation of the slope was equal in all experiments, we used the differences between the two independent estimations of all experiments to determine this random variation. Allp values are two-sided. Differences are considered significant if p is <0.05. Fig.1 shows the transport of several MDR1 P-gp substrate drugs through monolayers of polarized pig kidney epithelial cell lines. LLC-PK1 is the untransfected parent cell line, LLC-M3.4.44 (23van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) is a subclone of the MDR3 transfectant LLC-M3.4, and LLC-1.1 is the MDR1-transfected LLC-PK1 clone (25Schinkel A.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A.A.M. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Directional transport of the cardiac glycoside digoxin; of the cytostatic drugs paclitaxel, daunorubicin, and vinblastine; and of the antihelmintic drug ivermectin to the apical compartment is significantly increased in the MDR3-transfected cells compared with the parental cell line (two-sided p < 0.00001 for all drugs using one-way analysis of variance). With the exception of paclitaxel, the net transport rate (flow from basolateral to apical minus the flow from apical to basolateral) of these drugs is lower in the MDR3-transfected cells than in the MDR1 transfectant (two-sided p < 0.00001 for daunorubicin, vinblastine, and ivermectin; two-sidedp = 0.001 for digoxin), whereas the P-gp expression levels are comparable (see Fig. 2). The transport rate of paclitaxel is extremely high in both cell lines, and this makes it difficult to compare the activities of the transporters. The transport experiments are performed twice for ivermectin and three times or more for the other drugs with various batches of the cell lines. The statistically significant differences were comparable in the various experiments showing that the increased transport of drugs in the MDR3-transfected cell line is reproducible (results not shown). It should be noted that the expression of MDR3 is rather heterogeneous (23van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), in contrast to the expression of MDR1 (25Schinkel A.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A.A.M. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar); this might influence the transport efficiency through the monolayers. These results were reproduced in an independentMDR3 transfectant clone LLC-M3.1 (e.g. see Fig.2 A). The transport rate of digoxin in several subclones of LLC-M3.4 with various MDR3 expression levels correlated with the amount of MDR3 P-gp determined on immunoblot (Fig. 2).Figure 2Net transport of 2 μm digoxin through monolayers of LLC-PK1-derived cells correlates with the amount of MDR3 P-gp in the cells. A, left, directional transport of digoxin through monolayers of various subclones of MDR3transfectant LLC-M3.4 (3.4.1 (1), 3.4.11 (11), 3.4.44 (44), and 3.4.45 (45)). Right, directional transport of digoxin through monolayers of two independentMDR3 transfectants, LLC-M3.1 (3.1) and LLC-M3.4.44 (3.4.44), and one MDR1 transfectant, LLC-1.1 (1.1). Depicted is the difference in the absolute amounts of drug transported from the basolateral to the apical compartment and vice versa in 4 h (mean ± range in two independent experiments). Each compartment contained 2 ml of tissue culture medium (B). Protein blot analysis is shown of total cell lysates of the corresponding subclones. Detection of P-gp content was with the monoclonal antibody C219, which recognizes all mammalian P-gps tested (27Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, we identified a transmembrane protein, Cbp (Csk-binding protein), that, when phosphorylated, can recruit Csk to the membrane where the SFKs are located. The Cbp-mediated relocation of Csk to the membrane may play a role in turning off the signaling events initiated by SFKs. To further characterize the Csk-Cbp interaction, we have generated a reconstituted system using soluble, highly purified proteins. Csk and phosphorylated Cbp were co-purified as a large protein complex consisting of at least four Csk·Cbp units. The addition of the phosphorylated, but not nonphosphorylated, Cbp to an in vitro assay stimulated Csk activity toward Src. Csk was also activated by a phosphopeptide containing the tyrosine in Cbp that binds to Csk (Tyr-314). Kinetic analysis revealed that Cbp or the phosphopeptide induced up to a 6-fold reduction in the Km for Src, indicating that the Csk·Cbp complex has a greater affinity for Src than free Csk. These findings suggest that Cbp is involved in the regulation of SFKs not only by relocating Csk to the membrane but also by directly activating Csk.

Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). SFKs are known to act as molecular switches that regulate a variety of cellular events, including cell growth and division, cell attachment and movement, differentiation, survival, or death (2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). SFKs are ordinarily present in an inactive state in which the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal regulatory tyrosine binds to its own SH2 domain (3Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). In response to an external stimulus, an SFK is activated through dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine or through binding to another protein that displaces the intramolecular interaction. The phosphorylation of the regulatory tyrosine of SFK is known to be catalyzed by another PTK, Csk (4Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H.

In contrast, the phosphatases that activate SFKs have not yet been positively identified, although some candidate molecules have been proposed (6Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr.

To understand the regulation of SFKs, it is essential to clarify the regulation mechanism controlling the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the critical carboxyl-terminal tyrosine.Csk is a cytoplasmic PTK consisting of an SH3, an SH2, and a kinase domain. Because it lacks an amino-terminal acylation signal and a carboxyl-terminal tyrosine, the regulatory mechanisms of Csk itself have remained unknown. A line of evidence has suggested that the SH2 and/or SH3 domain of Csk is essential for SFK regulation (8Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The importance of the SH2 domain of Csk further suggested that such a membrane factor might be a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein.To test the hypothesis presented above, we searched for phosphoproteins that can bind tightly to the SH2 domain of Csk and identified a transmembrane phosphoprotein, Cbp (Csk-bindingprotein) (12Kawabuchi M.

Cbp is involved in the membrane localization of Csk as well as in the Csk-mediated inhibition of Src. When phosphorylated on Tyr-314, Cbp can bind to Csk. Within the plasma membrane, Cbp is exclusively localized in the GM1 ganglioside-enriched detergent-insoluble membrane (DIM) domain, which is thought to play an important role in receptor-mediated signaling and where the majority of SFKs are localized (13Simons K.

Ras is switched from the inactive GDP-bound state to the active GTP-bound state by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). We report here the cloning and characterization of RasGRP2, a longer alternatively spliced form of the recently cloned RapGEF, CalDAG-GEFI. A unique feature of RasGRP2 is that it is targeted to the plasma membrane by a combination of N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation. In vivo, RasGRP2 selectively catalyzes nucleotide exchange on N- and Ki-Ras, but not Ha-Ras. RasGRP2 also catalyzes nucleotide exchange on Rap1, but this RapGEF activity is less potent than that associated with CalDAG-GEFI. The nucleotide exchange activity of RasGRP2 toward N-Ras is stimulated by diacylglycerol and inhibited by calcium. The effects of diacylglycerol and calcium are additive but are not accompanied by any detectable change in the subcellular localization of RasGRP2. In contrast, CalDAG-GEFI is localized predominantly to the cytosol and lacks Ras exchange activity in vivo. However, prolonged exposure to phorbol esters, or growth in serum, results in localization of CalDAG-GEFI to the cell membrane and restoration of Ras exchange activity. Expression of RasGRP2 or CalDAG-GEFI in NIH3T3 cells transfected with wild type N-Ras results in an accelerated growth rate but not morphologic transformation. Thus, under appropriate growth conditions, CalDAG-GEFI and RasGRP2 are dual specificity Ras and Rap exchange factors.

The amount of active GTP-bound Ras is in turn controlled by the actions of two classes of regulator, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) which activate and deactivate Ras, respectively. A number of RasGEFs have been cloned, which share a core catalytic exchange domain and probably release GDP from Ras via a common mechanism (1Boriack-Sjordan P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J.

Sos is normally localized to the cell cytosol, but is recruited to the plasma membrane in response to growth factor receptor activation.

Although plasma membrane recruitment of Sos is sufficient to activate Ras, it is also clear that more complex intermolecular interactions also influence the activity of this exchange factor (15Chen R.

A second family of RasGEFs comprises the related proteins RasGRF1 and RasGRF2 (19Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 20Fam N.P. Fan W.T. Wang Z. Zhang L.J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). RasGRF1 is expressed only in the central nervous system, specifically in the synaptosomal fraction of neuronal cells (21Sturani E. Abbondio A. Branduardi P. Ferrari C. Zippel R. Martegani E. Vanoni M. Denis Donini S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) where it plays a role in the establishment of long term memory (22Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi Arnaud C. Grant S.G. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.P. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). RasGRF2 is expressed both within and without the central nervous system (20Fam N.P. Fan W.T. Wang Z. Zhang L.J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast to Sos, RasGRF1 is constitutively localized to the plasma membrane, probably anchored through its N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (23Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). RasGRF1 exchange activity is quiescent until activated by a rise in intracellular calcium (23Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). RasGRF2 is also regulated by calcium, but unlike RasGRF1, RasGRF2 is localized to the cytosol in resting cells until a rise in intracellular calcium levels causes relocalization of RasGRF2 to the cell periphery and activation of its exchange activity (20Fam N.P. Fan W.T. Wang Z. Zhang L.J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A feature common to Sos and RasGRF is the presence of Dbl homology domains comprising the catalytic core sequences of exchange factors for the Rho family of small GTPases (25Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The binding of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate to a pleckstrin homology domain flanking the Dbl homology domain of Sos1 activates exchange activity toward Rac (26Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), indicating that such RasGEFs coordinate activation of Ras and Rho family proteins. Most recently, a new family of Ras subfamily GEFs have been identified that are regulated by diacylglycerol and calcium. RasGRP (also referred to as CalDAG-GEFII) activates N-, Ha-, and Ki-Ras with varying efficiencies (27Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L., R.J., D. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 28Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), whereas the closely related CalDAG-GEFI (also referred to as HCDC25L (Ref. 29Kedra D. Serossi E. Fransson I. Trifunovic J. Clark M. Lagercrantz J. Blennow E. Mehlin H. Dumanski J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) activates Rap1 but not Ha-Ras (30Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In generating a transcript map of chromosome 11q13 (31Bergman L. Silins G. Grimmond S. Hummerich H. Stewart C. Little P. Hayward N.K. Genomics. 1999; 55: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), we independently cloned CalDAG-GEFI and identified an additional 5′-coding exon. We report here the characterization of RasGRP2: the widely expressed, longer isoform of CalDAG-GEFI. We show that RasGRP2 is constitutively localized to the plasma membrane by N-terminal acylation, a feature not previously described for any RasGEF. A consequence of constitutive plasma membrane localization is that RasGRP2 operates as an exchange factor for N-Ras and Ki-Ras in addition to being an activator of Rap1. RasGRP2, like CalDAG-GEFI, cannot activate Ha-Ras. CalDAG-GEFI and RasGRP2 also show quite distinct responses to calcium, diacylglycerol, and serum stimulation revealing a series of interesting possibilities for co-ordinate regulation of Ras and Rap function. Cosmid cSRL-20 h12, derived from a chromosome 11 cosmid library that contained the human MCG7(RASGRP2) gene (31Bergman L. Silins G. Grimmond S. Hummerich H. Stewart C. Little P. Hayward N.K. Genomics. 1999; 55: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), was sequenced and the sequence data aligned to the GenBank™ Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base using the program BLASTN (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The cDNA clones for matching EST entries T78563 (clone 113434) and AA035643 (clone 471819) were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. and sequenced to completion with gene-specific and vector-specific primers. The data base entry of a third matching EST clone, HIBBP12, contained an additional stretch of nucleotides upstream of the sequences of the other ESTs, and was therefore suspected to contain an additional upstream exon of RASGRP2,but since this clone was not commercially available the new exon was sought by PCR from a genomic template, bacterial artificial chromosome clone 137C7 (Genome Systems Inc). The composite cDNA sequence ofRASGRP2 was suspected to contain a single nucleotide error originating from within clone 471819 and the correct nucleotide sequence was therefore sought by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the cDNA fragment from a human cDNA pool. The resulting PCR product was ligated into pGEM-T (Promega) and the clone, designated MCG7-pGEM, sequenced. The corrected nucleotide sequence ofRASGRP2 was translated in all possible reading frames and compared with the non-redundant protein data base using the program BLASTX (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). One open reading frame (ORF), encoding RasGRP2–609, was assigned on the basis of homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans protein F25B3.3 (GenBank™ accession no. Z70752) and is identical to HCDC25L (GenBank™ accession no. Y12336) (29Kedra D. Serossi E. Fransson I. Trifunovic J. Clark M. Lagercrantz J. Blennow E. Mehlin H. Dumanski J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and CalDAG-GEFI (GenBank™ accession no. U78170) (30Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Conceptual translation of the ORF from the alternate translation start site upstream of the one utilized in RasGRP2–609, contained in the sequence from bacterial artificial chromosome clone 137C7, was designated RasGRP2–671. These sequences have been deposited under GenBank™ accession nos. AF043723 and AF043722, respectively. A Myc tag was cloned onto the N terminus of RasGRP2–609 by recombination of MCG7-pGEM, EST clone 113434, and pGEM-11Z-Myc-tag (33Evan G. Lewis G. Ramsey G. Bishop J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) to give clone Myc-RasGRP2–609 (referred to as Myc-CalDAG-GEFI hereafter). Myc-CalDAG-GEFI was digested with BamHI to remove the Myc tag and ligated into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The final construct has an ORF that fuses GST to the front of RasGRP2–609. A C-terminal Flag-tagged RasGRP2–671 cDNA was generated by PCR. The final Flag-tagged construct contains an ORF with the amino acids DYKDDDDKstop (Flag) added immediately after the last residue of RasGRP2 (hereafter referred to as RasGRP2-Flag). The Myc- and Flag-tagged constructs were directionally cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector EXV. In vitroand in vivo nucleotide exchange assays were performed as described previously (34Porfiri E. Evans T. Chardin P. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22672-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Frozen cells were lysed in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mm TrisCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. 10 μl of the supernatant was reserved for later immunoblotting; the remainder was diluted in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm TrisCl pH7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl) and incubated for 90 min, rotating at 4 °C with 20 μg of GST-RafRBD-K85A protein fused to Sepharose (50% suspension). Samples were washed three times with binding buffer before the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins from the bead capture and 10 μl of cleared supernatant were resolved on 15% acrylamide gels, blotted with anti-Ras or anti-HA (Rap) antisera and visualized by chemiluminescence. Blots were quantified by phosphorimaging. The amount of GTP-Rap or GTP-Ras captured by the GST-RafRBD-K85A beads was expressed as a percentage of the Ras or Rap present in the supernatant (estimated from the 10-μl input). Expression of RasGRP2-Flag or Myc-CalDAG-GEFI was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-Flag or anti-Myc antisera, respectively. COS cells were transfected by electroporation and BHK cells by lipofection (36Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine was carried out for 4 h in methionine-free DMEM containing [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml). Labeling with [3H]palmitic acid (0.5 mCi/ml) or [3H]myristic acid (0.5 mCi/ml) was carried out for 4 h in DMEM supplemented with 5 mm sodium pyruvate. Cleared lysates, normalized for protein content, were immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-Flag Sepharose or 9E10-coated protein G-Sepharose as required. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography (for details, see Ref. 37Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Macdonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Where indicated, gels were agitated in 1 m neutral hydroxylamine or 1 mTrisCl, pH 7.5, for 1 h at room temperature prior to fluorography. Indirect immunofluorescence for Myc and Flag epitopes was performed as described (36Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Prior to harvesting for fractionation studies, COS cells were serum-starved for 4–16 h as indicated. Hypotonic lysis, homogenization, and centrifugation were carried out as described previously (38Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (39Huang D.C.S. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2420-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To generate polyclonal populations, cells seeded on 10-cm plates were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pSV-hyg, together with 1.5 μg of EXV expression plasmids for N-Ras, RasGRP2-Flag, Myc-CalDAG-GEFI, or empty vector. After 48 h, cultures were selected with 300 μg/ml hygromycin. Surviving cells were pooled and grown continually in hygromycin. For growth assays, 104 cells (per well) were plated in multiwell dishes in DMEM containing 5%, 1%, or 0.1% serum. Cells were trypsinized and counted every 24 h for 4 days with each time point counted in triplicate. Three independent transfections were analyzed. Expression of RasGRP2-Flag or Myc-CalDAG-GEFI was confirmed by immunoblotting or indirect immunofluorescence using anti-Flag or anti-Myc antisera, respectively. Expression of N-Ras was verified by immunoblotting using Y13-259. The coding sequence for a human RasGEF was discovered during the generation of a transcript map of a region of human chromosome band 11q13 (31Bergman L. Silins G. Grimmond S. Hummerich H. Stewart C. Little P. Hayward N.K. Genomics. 1999; 55: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The gene, originally designatedMCG7, was subsequently assigned the locus nameRASGRP2 by the human genome project nomenclature committee. A cDNA corresponding to RASGRP2 was independently isolated by two other groups (29Kedra D. Serossi E. Fransson I. Trifunovic J. Clark M. Lagercrantz J. Blennow E. Mehlin H. Dumanski J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A.

A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and subsequently characterized as a 609-amino acid RapGEF referred to as CalDAG-GEFI. However, during our independent isolation of a full-length cDNA for RASGRP2, we identified an additional EST that contained sequence 5′ to that previously reported to constitute the N terminus of CalDAG-GEFI (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). This additional sequence together with the general layout of the full-length RASGRP2gene product is shown in Fig. 1. The core exchange factor domains comprising the Ras exchange motif and the SCR1, SCR2, and SCR3 motifs plus the diacylglycerol binding (DGB) domain and EF hands have been described previously (27Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L., R.J., D. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 30Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A novel feature of the N terminus of full-length RasGRP2 is the presence of potential consensus sequences for co-translational myristoylation and posttranslational palmitoylation. Northern blot analysis showed thatRASGRP2 was expressed predominantly as 2.4-kilobase pair transcripts in all tissues tested: heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Expression was highest in heart, brain, and kidney as variously reported previously (29Kedra D. Serossi E. Fransson I. Trifunovic J. Clark M. Lagercrantz J. Blennow E. Mehlin H. Dumanski J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), but in contrast to the published data we also detected additional transcripts of 0.8 kilobase pairs in heart and 4.7 kilobase pairs in heart, lung, and placenta (results not shown). For the sake of brevity, we will refer to the short form of the RASGRP2 gene product as CalDAG-GEFI because this is the previously published name, and the full-length gene product as RasGRP2, after the name assigned to the gene by human genome project nomenclature committee. The N-terminal sequence of full-length RasGRP2 comprises MGTQRLCGR. Although the common consensus sequences for myristoylation include serine or threonine at amino acid +6, small hydrophobic residues are also tolerated, as in the myristoylation motifs of Arf, A kinase, Arg, and Abl. Moreover, the presence of cysteine at amino acid +7 suggested that the N terminus of RasGRP2 may also be palmitoylated (40Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether RasGRP2 was lipid-modified in vivo. To this end, a Flag epitope was engineered onto the C terminus of the protein leaving the N-terminal sequences intact (=RasGRP2-Flag) (Fig.1). A second construct, which represents the shorter alternative spliced form of RasGRP2, was also engineered by replacing the N-terminal 62 amino acids of RasGRP2 with a Myc epitope (=Myc-CalDAG-GEFI). RasGRP2-Flag and Myc-CalDAG-GEFI were transiently expressed in COS cells and the relative hydrophobicity of the two proteins assessed in a Triton X-114 partitioning assay (41Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows that 60% of RasGRP2-Flag partitions into the detergent phase of Triton X-114, whereas Myc-CalDAG-GEFI partitions exclusively into the aqueous phase of Triton X-114. Thus, a significant proportion of RasGRP2-Flag is hydrophobic, whereas all Myc-CalDAG-GEFI is hydrophilic. This result is consistent with the N terminus of RasGRP2 being lipid-modified. COS cells expressing RasGRP2-Flag or Myc-CalDAG-GEFI were then metabolically labeled with [3H]myristic or [3H]palmitic acid and cell lysates analyzed by immunoprecipitation and fluorography. Fig. 2 B shows that RasGRP2-Flag incorporated label from [3H]myristic and [3H]palmitic acid, whereas Myc-CalDAG-GEFI incorporated neither label. The metabolic labeling of RasGRP2-Flag was repeated and the immunoprecipitated proteins divided between two gels, which were soaked in 1 m hydroxylamine or TrisCl prior to fluorography. Fig. 2 B shows that hydroxylamine treatment caused loss of the palmitate label but not the myristate label from RasGRP2-Flag. This result indicates that palmitate, but not myristate, is attached to RasGRP2-Flag via a thioester linkage and therefore shows that the palmitate labeling is not a consequence of metabolism of the palmitate label to myristate. The preceding results demonstrate that RasGRP2-Flag is N-terminally myristoylated and palmitoylated: a combination of lipid modifications that constitutes a plasma membrane targeting sequence (42Resh M. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular localization of RasGRP2, BHK cells expressing RasGRP2-Flag or Myc-CalDAG-GEFI were examined using indirect immunofluorescence. Fig.2 C shows that RasGRP2-Flag localizes extensively to the plasma membrane, although there is also some soluble cytosolic staining. In contrast, Myc-CalDAG-GEFI is confined to the cytosol with no evidence of plasma membrane staining. Similarly, when COS cells expressing the epitope-tagged variants of RasGRP2 were fractionated and immunoblotted for the Flag or Myc epitopes, RasGRP2-Flag was found to be distributed approximately equally between the P100 (membrane) and S100 (cytosolic) fractions (Fig. 3), consistent with the proportion shown to be lipidated by Triton X-114 partitioning (Fig. 2 A). Myc-CalDAG-GEFI was found predominantly in the S100 fraction (Fig. 3). RasGRP has been shown to translocate from cytosol to membrane when cells are treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 2 min (27Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L., R.J., D. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 28Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether TPA would affect the subcellular localization of RasGRP2. Fig. 3 shows that there was no detectable change in the subcellular distribution of either RasGRP2-Flag or Myc-CalDAG-GEFI in response to a 2-min exposure to either TPA or a calcium ionophor (A23187), or both agents together. However, a substantial proportion of Myc-CalDAG-GEFI did translocate to the P100 fraction when cells were treated with TPA for 15 min (Fig. 3). The presence or absence of calcium ionophor during exposure to TPA did not significantly affect the translocation of Myc-CalDAG-GEFI (Fig. 3). Prolonged exposure to TPA did not alter the subcellular distribution of RasGRP2 (data not shown). We next investigated the ability of RasGRP2 to catalyze Ras nucleotide exchange in intact cells. COS cells were transfected with expression plasmids for wild type N-, Ki-, and Ha-Ras, alone and in combination with RasGRP2-Flag or Myc-CalDAG-GEFI. The cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and the relative amounts of GTP and GDP captured in anti-Ras immunoprecipitates determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and phosphorimaging. Fig.4 A shows that in the conditions of this assay RasGRP2-Flag stimulated GTP loading of N-Ras and Ki-Ras but not Ha-Ras. The -fold increase in GTP loading of N-Ras by RasGRP2 is of a similar magnitude to that reported recently on Ha-Ras by RasGRP (27Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L., R.J., D. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Importantly, in control experiments using co-transfected mSos1, Ha-Ras was efficiently loaded with GTP (to 21 ± 1.65%, n = 3) showing that Ha-Ras is"
https://openalex.org/W2025666847,"In Escherichia coli, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is known to esterify tRNATyr with tyrosine. Resulting d-Tyr-tRNATyr can be hydrolyzed by ad-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. By monitoring E. coli growth in liquid medium, we systematically searched for other d-amino acids, the toxicity of which might be exacerbated by the inactivation of the gene encodingd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. In addition to the already documented case of d-tyrosine, positive responses were obtained with d-tryptophan, d-aspartate,d-serine, and d-glutamine. In agreement with this observation, production of d-Asp-tRNAAspand d-Trp-tRNATrp by aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, respectively, was establishedin vitro. Furthermore, the two d-aminoacylated tRNAs behaved as substrates of purified E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. These results indicate that an unexpected high number of d-amino acids can impair the bacterium growth through the accumulation ofd-aminoacyl-tRNA molecules and thatd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase has a specificity broad enough to recycle any of these molecules. The same strategy of screening was applied using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase of which also producesd-Tyr-tRNATyr, and which, like E. coli, possesses a d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity. In this case, inhibition of growth by the various 19d-amino acids was followed on solid medium. Two isogenic strains containing or not the deacylase were compared. Toxic effects ofd-tyrosine and d-leucine were reinforced upon deprivation of the deacylase. This observation suggests that, in yeast, at least two d-amino acids succeed in being transferred onto tRNAs and that, like in E. coli, the resulting twod-aminoacyl-tRNAs are substrates of a samed-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase. In Escherichia coli, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is known to esterify tRNATyr with tyrosine. Resulting d-Tyr-tRNATyr can be hydrolyzed by ad-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase.

In agreement with this observation, production of d-Asp-tRNAAspand d-Trp-tRNATrp by aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, respectively, was establishedin vitro. Furthermore, the two d-aminoacylated tRNAs behaved as substrates of purified E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. These results indicate that an unexpected high number of d-amino acids can impair the bacterium growth through the accumulation ofd-aminoacyl-tRNA molecules and thatd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase has a specificity broad enough to recycle any of these molecules. The same strategy of screening was applied using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase of which also producesd-Tyr-tRNATyr, and which, like E. coli, possesses a d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity. In this case, inhibition of growth by the various 19d-amino acids was followed on solid medium. Two isogenic strains containing or not the deacylase were compared. Toxic effects ofd-tyrosine and d-leucine were reinforced upon deprivation of the deacylase. This observation suggests that, in yeast, at least two d-amino acids succeed in being transferred onto tRNAs and that, like in E. coli, the resulting twod-aminoacyl-tRNAs are substrates of a samed-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase. high performance liquid chromatography d-Amino acids are widely distributed in living organisms (1Friedman M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1999; 47: 3457-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Examples of d-amino acid natural occurrence include d-Ala- and d-Glu-containing peptidoglycans of bacterial cell walls, d-amino acid-containing natural peptide antibiotics (1Friedman M. J. Agric.

In the case of d-Glu production, a racemase or a transaminase is involved, depending on the bacterium. Small amounts of d-amino acids can also possibly appear as side products of various biosynthetic pathways. Conversion of the l- to the d-stereoisomer of tryptophan was observed in the presence of tryptophan synthase (11Miles E.W. Phillips R.S. Yeh H.J.C. Cohen L.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4240-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Ahmed S.A. Martin B. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the case of methionyl-tRNA synthetase, a weak catalysis of α-carbon hydrogen-deuterium exchange of l-methionine was evidencedin vitro (13Williams J.S. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6412-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Such an exchange suggests possible conversion of l-methionine into d-methionine at the surface of an amino acid-binding enzyme. As discussed earlier (14Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar),d-tyrosine might arise at the step of the addition of an amino group to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. Moreover, d-amino acids are likely to be nonspecifically formed as side reaction products in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzymes or of pyridoxal phosphate alone (15Kumagai H. Kashima N. Yamada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commmun. 1970; 39: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Metzler D.E. Ihawa M. Snell E.E. J. Am. Chem.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5549-5559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Possible causes of this toxicity are multiple. For instance, in the case of Escherichia coli,d-amino acids can be lethal because they are erroneously incorporated in peptidoglycan (23Tsuruoka T. Tamura A. Miyata A. Takei T. Iwamatsu K. Inouye S. Matsuhashi M. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 889-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Caparros M. Torrecuadrada J.L.M. de Pedro M.A. Res.

In the case ofBacillus subtilis, strains capable of efficiently pumpingd-tyrosine have been described. The growth of such strains is decreased upon addition of this d-amino acid to the culture medium (19Jensen R.A. Stenmark S.L. Champney W.S. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1972; 87: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Inhibition of prephenate dehydrogenase and the consequent curtailment of l-tyrosine biosynthesis may account for this behavior (18Champney W.S. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 104: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, incorporation ofd-tyrosine into proteins could be evidenced with the aboveB. subtilis strains (18Champney W.S. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 104: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, several studies indicated-tyrosyl-tRNATyr formation in E. coli (27Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 28Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Soutourina J. Plateau P.

Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, to recycle tRNATyr esterified byd-tyrosine and/or to minimize d-tyrosine incorporation into proteins, E. coli and S. cerevisiae harbor a gene (dtd or DTD1, respectively) encoding a deacylase capable of hydrolyzingd-Tyr-tRNATyr into free tRNATyr andd-tyrosine. In vitro, the E. colideacylase also hydrolyzes d-Phe-tRNAPhe and, to a lesser extent, Gly-tRNAGly (28Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Upon inactivation of these genes, cell growth becomes sensitive to the presence ofd-tyrosine in the culture medium (14Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol.

In the present study, the possibility thatd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase could be involved in the deacylation of other d-aminoacyl-tRNAs distinct fromd-Tyr-tRNATyr was investigated in vivo. In a first experiment, toxicities of eachd-amino acid on the growth of E. coli dtd + and Δdtd strains were systematically compared. An involvement of the dtd product in the protection of E. coli against the toxicity ofd-Trp, d-Asp, d-Ser, andd-Gln was revealed. In the case of d-Trp andd-Asp, in vitro studies established thatd-Trp-tRNATrp andd-Asp-tRNAAsp could be produced by the corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Moreover, the twod-aminoacyl-tRNAs were efficient substrates of purifiedd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. In the case of S. cerevisiae, comparison of the growth ofDTD1 and dtd1 strains indicated protection against d-leucine afforded by thed-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase gene. l-[5-3H]Tryptophan (740 GBq/mmol),l-[2,3-3H]aspartic acid (703 GBq/mmol),d-[2,3-3H]aspartic acid (666 GBq/mmol), and [32P]-PPi (300 GBq/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Non-radioactive d- andl-amino acids were from Sigma. Q-Sepharose and Superose 6 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hydroxylapatite was from Bio-Rad. 214TP5215 C4 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 5-μm particles) was from Vydac. Bakerbond Wide-Pore Butyl (C4) (15 μm particles) was from Baker. Crude E. coli tRNA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. To overproduce tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, the trpS gene of plasmid pCH17 (Table I) was inserted into pBluescript under the control of the lacZ promoter. For this purpose, the 3.2-kilobase pair SalI-EcoRI fragment of pCH17 was subcloned between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript(−)KS. Cells transformed by the resulting plasmid (pBStrpS) were used as a source of enzyme.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this studyStrains and plasmidsGenotypeSource (ref.)E. coli strains K37galK rpsL(59Miller H.I.

A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1992Google Scholar) medium containing 200 μg of ampicillin/ml. Crude extract preparation, nucleic acid precipitation with streptomycin sulfate, and ammonium sulfate precipitation of proteins were performed as described previously (29Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After the ammonium sulfate precipitation, the protein pellet was dissolved in 20 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.75), containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), and dialyzed against 2 liters of the same buffer. The resulting sample was applied on a Q-Sepharose column (2.6 × 16 cm), which was eluted at a flow rate of 180 ml/h with a 1.35-liter linear gradient from 0 to 300 mm KCl in buffer A. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase was recovered at 120 mmKCl. Fractions showing tryptophan-dependent ATP-PPi exchange activity were directly applied on a hydroxylapatite column (2.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. This column was eluted at a flow rate of 20 ml/h using a 2-liter linear gradient from 20 to 500 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.75). Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase activity was recovered at 220 mm potassium phosphate and concentrated by an ammonium sulfate precipitation (70% saturation). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 60% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and stored at −20 °C. 230 mg of enzyme were recovered from 15.2 g of cells (wet weight), with a yield of 70%. According to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, purified tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase was at least 95% homogeneous. Concentration of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase was calculated using aM r of 2 × 37,497 and a light absorption coefficient of 0.739 A 280 units mg−1 ml, as deduced from the amino acid sequence of the protein. Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase was purified from E. coli strain JM101TR transformed by plasmid pBluescript(−)KSaspS (pBSaspS) (31Eriani G. Dirheimer G. Gangloff J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7109-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C, in 1 liter of 2× TY medium containing 500 μg of ampicillin/ml. Crude extract preparation and streptomycin sulfate and ammonium sulfate precipitations followed the protocol described previously (29Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After the ammonium sulfate precipitation, the protein pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl (buffer B), and dialyzed against 2 liters of the same buffer for 2 h. Then, the protein sample was applied on a Superose 6 column (2 × 50 cm) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 12 ml/h with 112 ml of buffer B. Fractions showing aspartyl-tRNA synthetase tRNA aminoacylation activity were pooled and directly applied on a Q-Sepharose Hi-Load column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 150 ml/h with a 260-ml linear gradient from 50 to 400 mm KCl in buffer B. Enzyme activity was recovered at 275 mm KCl. After ammonium sulfate precipitation (70% saturation) and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 60% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and stored at −20 °C. 30 mg of enzyme were recovered from 2.6 g of cells (wet weight) with a yield of 45%. Recovered aspartyl-tRNA synthetase was at least 95% homogeneous, according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Enzyme concentration was determined using a M r of 2 × 65,913 and a light-absorption coefficient of 0.589A 280 units mg−1 ml, as calculated from the amino acid sequence of the protein. The E. coli tRNATrp gene (trpT) was constructed and overexpressed in strain JM101TR (Table I) from a pBSTNAV derivative, according to a previously described method (32Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8095-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since E. coli tRNATrp renaturation requires exposure to heat in the presence of Mg2+ (33Gartland W.J. Sueoka N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 948-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34Lindahl T. Adams A. Fresco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the crude tRNA extract from the above cells was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 10 mmMgCl2 and 0.1 mm EDTA, and heated for 5 min at 60 °C. Upon this treatment, the l-tryptophan acceptance of the tRNA sample increased from 370 to 600 pmol ofl-tryptophan/A 260 unit. The tRNATrp sample was further purified on a preparative C4 column. A set of 10 samples of 70A 260 units each were successively chromatographed on a 20-ml Bakerbond C4 column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated in 1 m sodium formate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 10 mmNaH2PO4 and 8 mm MgCl2(solution C). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with (i) a 15-ml linear gradient from 0% to 20% of a solution containing 10 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 5.5) plus 10% methanol (solution D), (ii) a 20-ml linear gradient from 20% to 60% of solution D, and (iii) a 10 ml linear gradient from 60% to 100% of solution D. Three peaks of l-tryptophan acceptance activity were recovered at 640, 440, and 140 mm sodium formate concentrations (36%, 56%, and 86% of solution D, respectively). With a crude tRNA extract from a non-overproducing strain, one single peak was observed at 140 mm sodium formate. Therefore, the first two peaks are likely to reflect undermodified stages of the overproduced tRNATrp and were discarded. After dialysis against 3 liters of a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mmEDTA, the tRNA sample corresponding to 140 mm sodium formate was precipitated with ethanol and stored. Before use, the tRNATrp pellet was recovered by centrifugation, dissolved in the above buffer, and heated for 5 min at 60 °C. Purified tRNATrp accepted 1400 pmol ofl-tryptophan/A 260 unit. The E. coli tRNAAsp gene (aspT) was constructed and overexpressed in JM101TR cells as described above in the case of tRNATrp. The resulting crude tRNA extract accepted 700 pmol of l-aspartic acid/A 260 unit. The tRNAAsp sample was further purified on a 20-ml Bakerbond C4 column, as described above for tRNATrp. One single peak of l-Asp acceptance activity was recovered in agreement with the already described full post-transcriptional modification of overproduced tRNAAsp(35Martin F. Eriani G. Eiler S. Moras D. Dirheimer G. Gangloff J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After C4 chromatography, the tRNA sample was precipitated with ethanol and stored. Purified tRNAAspaccepted 1000 pmol of l-aspartic acid/A 260 unit. Tryptophan-dependent ATP-PPiexchange activity was assayed during 10 min at 28 °C in 100 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mml-tryptophan, 2 mm[32P]PPi (20–80 MBq/mmol), and catalytic amounts of enzyme. After quenching of the reaction, labeled ATP was adsorbed on charcoal, filtered, and counted as described previously (36Blanquet S. Fayat G. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation of tRNATrp with l- ord-tryptophan was assayed during 10 min at 28 °C in 100 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.8–3.6 μml- or d-tryptophan, 0.35 μmpurified tRNATrp, and catalytic amounts of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5) plus 55 μl of phenol saturated with a 20 mm sodium acetate solution (pH 5.3). After vigorous shaking and centrifugation, the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol. The samples were chromatographed on a C4 HPLC1 column as described below. Light absorption of the elution profile was measured at 260 nm. Concentrations of aminoacylated and non-aminoacylated tRNATrp were deduced from the areas of the corresponding absorption peaks. Aminoacylation of tRNATrp withl-[3H]tryptophan (2500 Ci/mol) was also measured by scintillation counting. In this case, the reaction was quenched by the successive addition of 2.5 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%, w/w) containing 0.5% tryptophan, and of 10 μl of carrier RNA from yeast (4 mg/ml). The precipitate was recovered on a Whatman GF-C filter, and the retained radioactivity was measured in a Beckman LS1801 scintillation counter. Aminoacylation of tRNAAsp by aspartyl-tRNA synthetase was assayed by scintillation counting, as described above for tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, except that 5 μmtRNAAsp and 1 μm either l- ord-[3H]aspartic acid (500 Ci/mol) were used in the assay. Ice-cold trichloroacetic acid without amino acid was added to quench the reaction. The tRNA samples (0.025–2 A 260 units) were dissolved in 100 μl of a 3 m sodium formate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 10 mm NaH2PO4 and 8 mmMgCl2. Then, each sample was loaded on C4 HPLC column (2.1 × 150 mm) equilibrated with solution C. To recover the tRNA and its aminoacylated derivative, the eluant of the column was progressively changed to solution D, through a 6.75-ml linear gradient from 0% to 30% of solution D, followed by a 12-ml linear gradient from 30% to 100% of solution D. The absorbance of the column effluent was measured at 260 nm. Ford-Trp-tRNATrp preparation, a reaction mixture (4 ml) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 7 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.35 μm of purified tRNATrp, 3.6 μmd-tryptophan, and 2 μmtryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase was incubated at 28 °C for 10 min. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the sample was purified by C4 HPLC, as described above. Fractions containing d-Trp-tRNATrp were pooled and precipitated with ethanol.l-[3H]Trp-tRNATrp was prepared under the same conditions, except that the reaction mixture (1.2 ml) contained 0.35 μm purified tRNATrp (0.3A 260 units), 10 μml-[3H]tryptophan (100 Ci/mol), and 1 μm tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. For l-[3H]Asp-tRNAAsppreparation, a reaction mixture (300 μl) containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mmATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm purified tRNAAsp, 30 μml-[3H]aspartic acid (500 Ci/mol), and 1.5 μm aspartyl-tRNA synthetase was incubated at 28 °C for 10 min. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the product was purified by chromatography on a Trisacryl GF05 column, as described previously for Tyr-tRNATyr (29Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F.

Because the d-aspartic acid sample was contaminated byl-aspartic acid (see “Results”), the preparation ofd-aspartyl-tRNA was achieved in two steps. First, the reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 60 μmd-[3H]aspartic acid (500 Ci/mol), 5 μm purified tRNAAsp, and 0.325 μm aspartyl-tRNA synthetase was incubated at 28 °C for 10 min. Under these conditions, most of the contaminatingl-aspartic acid was exhausted through rapid transfer onto the tRNA and practically no d-aspartic acid was consumed for aminoacylation. After precipitation with ethanol, the supernatant containing l-Asp-freed-[3H]aspartic acid was lyophilized, suspended in water, and further used in an aminoacylation reaction at 28 °C for 20 min with 5 μm purified tRNAAsp and 6.5 μm aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (second step). After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the sample was purified on a Trisacryl GF05 column, as described (29Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol.

Initial rates of d- orl-Trp-tRNATrp deacylation were measured for 5 min at 28 °C in 100-μl assays containing 0.1–0.3 μmd-Trp-tRNATrp orl-[3H]Trp-tRNATrp, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and catalytic amounts of purified E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase (29Soutourina J.

Then, the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by C4 HPLC. Initial rates ofl-[3H]Trp-tRNATrp hydrolysis were also measured by scintillation counting, as described previously for tyrosyl-tRNA hydrolysis (29Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A.

Preliminary experiments suggested that the growth of a Δdtd strain exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the presence of d-tryptophan, when compared with an isogenicdtd + strain (29Soutourina J.

This behavior was confirmed by plating strains K37ΔTyrH (Δdtd::kan, TableI) and K37 (dtd +) on M9 minimal medium agar plates (30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1992Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 5 mmd-tryptophan. In these conditions, the growth of the Δdtd strain was almost completely abolished, while the dtd + strain still grew (Fig.1). Therefore, it could be suspected that d-tryptophan, similarly to d-tyrosine (29Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol.

To determine whether the d-tyrosyl-tRNA deacylase protected E. coli cells against d-amino acids other thand-tyrosine or d-tryptophan, we studied the effect of 18 d-amino acids on the growth of strains K37 (dtd +) and K37ΔTyrH (Δdtd::kan) (TableII). Because of its limited solubility,d-tyrosine could not be included in this toxicity test. Bacteria were inoculated at a final OD650 of 0.003 in liquid M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and various concentrations of the d-amino acid under study (0–25 mm). After an 8-h incubation at 37 °C, the optical density of the culture was compared with that of a control culture without added d-amino acid.Table IIEffect of various d-amino acids on the growth of E. coli strains K37 and K37ΔTyrHd-Amino acid addedE. colistrainK37K37ΔTyrHd-Ala,d-Pro,d-ArgNE 2-aAddition of the amino acid (up to 25 mm) had no effect (NE).NEd-Asn, d-His, d-Ile,d-Leu, d-Met,d-Phe>25 mm 2-bLittle growth inhibition was observed at 25 mm.

The binding of IF1 to ATP synthase depends on pH values, and below neutrality, IF1 forms a stable complex with the enzyme. Bovine IF1 has two oligomeric states, dimer and tetramer, depending on pH values. At pH 6.5, where it is active, IF1 dimerizes by formation of an antiparallel α-helical coiled-coil in its C-terminal region. This arrangement places the inhibitory N-terminal regions in opposition, implying that active dimeric IF1 can bind two F1 domains simultaneously.

At present, it is not known whether IF1 can bring about the dimerization of the F1F0-ATPase complex. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The F1F0-ATP synthase complex (also called F1F0-ATPase) plays a central role in energy transformation in most living organisms. It is composed of two major domains, a globular F1 catalytic domain and a membrane-bound F0 proton-translocating domain linked together by a central stalk. The synthesis of ATP requires an electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is driven by the transport of protons back into the matrix through the F0 domain. When a cell is deprived of oxygen, the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane collapses, and the enzyme switches its catalytic activity from ATP synthesis to ATP hydrolysis. Under these conditions, F1-ATPase, the catalytic domain of ATP synthase, catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate. In mitochondria, this hydrolytic activity is regulated by a natural inhibitor protein, IF1. In bovine mitochondria, IF1 is a basic protein of 84 amino acids long (1Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The binding of IF1 to ATP synthase depends on pH values and, below neutrality, its inhibitory capacity increases (2Panchenko M.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that bovine IF1 has two oligomeric states, tetramer and dimer, favored by pH values above and below 6.5, respectively (3Cabezon E. Butler P.J.G. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25460-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Activation is accompanied by a decrease in IF1 helicity relative to the inactive form between residues 35 and 47, which are involved in the formation of the inactive tetramers. At a pH value of about 6.5, IF1 forms an active antiparallel dimer, and this arrangement places the inhibitory N-terminal regions in opposition. At higher pH values, two dimers associate into the inactive tetramer. An important implication of this model is that dimeric IF1 is capable of binding to two F1 domains simultaneously. In this paper, we describe experiments using gel filtration chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, and electron microscopy that validate this prediction. The purification of bovine F1-ATPase (4Orris G.L. Leslie A.G.W. Braig K. Walker J.E. Structure. 1998; 6: 831-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and recombinant bovine IF1 (3Cabezon E. Butler P.J.G. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25460-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were carried out as described previously. The IF1-F1 complex was prepared as follows: purified F1-ATPase (25 mg), stored as an ammonium sulfate precipitate, was collected by centrifugation (31,000 ×g) at 4 °C, re-dissolved in minimal buffer (20 mm MOPS1-NaOH, pH 6.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The enzyme was mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of IF1 over F1 and kept for 20 min at 37 °C. A portion of MgATP was added at 5, 10, and 15 min to give a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Then, the mixture was loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column to separate the IF1-F1 complex from F1-ATPase and free IF1. Protein samples (5 mg/ml; 100 μl) prepared as described above were chromatographed at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mmMOPS-NaOH, pH 6.5, 10 mm magnesium sulfate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide,10% glycerol, and 0.001% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The absorbance of the eluant was monitored at 280 nm. Thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, and aldolase (molecular masses of 669, 440, 232, and 158 kDa, respectively) were used to calibrate the column. Its void volume (V 0) was determined using blue dextran 2000. TheK av for the individual proteins was calculated from the following expression: K av = (Ve −V 0)/(Vt −V 0), where Vt andVe are the elution volume for the protein and the total bed volume, respectively. A plot ofK av versus log(molecular weight) with standards gave a straight line with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. Linear regression gave the equation log(molecular weight) = −2.239 K av + 3.427, which was used to calculate the apparent molecular weight. Denaturing SDS-PAGE gels containing a 12–22% (w/v) acrylamide gradient separating gel and a 4% (w/v) stacking gel (acrylamide:N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide), 30:0.8 (w/w) were cast in 10-cm × 10-cm × 0.6-mm format and run in the buffer system of Laemmli (5Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity runs were performed at 20.0 °C and at various rotor speeds (finally using 40,000 rpm for F1-ATPase and 30,000 rpm for the IF1-F1 complex) in a Beckman AN-60Ti rotor and a Beckman XL-A ultracentrifuge. The samples were dissolved in buffer consisting of 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.5, 10 mmmagnesium sulfate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and 0.001% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Scans were taken as frequently as possible (i.e. with a zero-interval setting, which gives∼4.5 min with 3 cells in the rotor). Data were analyzed initially by plotting g(s*) against s*, where g(s*) is the fraction of material sedimenting betweens* and (s* + δs*) (6Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 7Stafford III, W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), using the DCDT+ software package (Version 1.05) (8Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This software was also used for direct fitting of simple Gaussian functions to dc/dt versus s curves (9Stafford III, W.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to test for the number of components giving a ”best fit“ to the data. Sedimentation coefficients were converted from s* tos 20,w, taking values of 0.759 ml/g for the partial specific volume, 1.00213 g/ml for the solvent density, and 1.0103 (entipoise) for the viscosity, calculated with SEDNTERP (Version 1.03) (10Laue T.M.

Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, U.K.1992: 90-125Google Scholar). All plots were produced from the data using the program ProFit (QuantumSoft). For plots of the original scans, scans at equal time intervals were selected (630 s for F1 alone and 666 s for F1-IF1complex), to give visual separation between the traces drawn. Grids were prepared by evaporating carbon onto 400-mesh copper/rubidium grids (Maxtaform, Graticules, Tombridge, U.K.). They were covered by a thin film of a 0.5% Formvar solution and then washed with chloroform. Grids were glow-discharged for 30 s to make the carbon film hydrophilic. A solution of the purified IF1-F1 complex (5 μl, 0.01 mg/ml) was applied to the grid and left for 2 min. Then the grid was washed with three drops of gel filtration buffer and stained with a solution of 4% (w/v) methylamine tungstate (Agar, Stansted, U.K.) in water (pH 6.5). Images were recorded at a magnification of 67,000 on a Philips Tecnai 12 electron microscope operating at 100 kV using low dose conditions (approximately 10 e−/Å2). The quality of the images was checked on an optical difractometer. The defocus was about 1000 nm. The images were collected with a Zeiss-SCAI scanner using a step size of 7 μm (pixel size, 1.04 Å). Images were demagnified by linear interpolation on the computer to a pixel size of 5.2 Å. The apparent molecular masses of F1-ATPase and IF1-F1complex in solution were determined by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1) and sedimentation velocity analysis (see Fig. 3). F1-ATPase eluted from a Superose 6 column as a single peak of 367 kDa, whereas under the same conditions, the IF1-F1 complex eluted at 696 kDa. The small shoulder contains monomeric F1-ATPase (Fig. 1 A). Fractions from both peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). The gels confirmed the presence of IF1 (9.6 kDa) in the IF1-F1complex. The separation of the F1 and IF1-F1 complexes by gel filtration has been observed before (11Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M.

The data are shown (at equal time intervals for each sample) as A 280against radius for each sample.

Panels A and B, fractions from peaks A and B, respectively, in Fig. 1. The apparent molecular masses of the standard proteins are: 83, 62, 47.5, 32.5, 25, and 16.5 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sedimentation velocity data for F1-ATPase and the IF1-F1 complex are summarized in Fig.3. Direct dc/dtanalysis showed that F1 alone hads 20,w = 12.1 (± 0.7) S and F1-IF1 complex hads 20,w = 17.0 (± 0.1) S. To test whether there might be more than one component in the boundary, plots of g(s*) against s*20,w were also made. As a further test, model fitting of the dc/dt data with models with either one or two components was carried out. The best fits were given by the single-component model for both data sets, and plots of the fit residuals against radius are shown (Fig. 3). This increase in sedimentation coefficient is compatible with IF1 binding two F1-ATPase units in the complex, and this is the only possibility, as any shape change that produced such an increase in sedimentation would have led to a lower apparent molecular mass during elution from the column. Thus all of the hydrodynamic data are only explained by a dimerization of F1-ATPase on forming a complex with IF1. Samples of the IF1-F1 were diluted in the gel filtration buffer to a protein concentration of 0.01 mg/ml and stained with methylamine tungstate (4%, w/v). Methylamine tungstate, which has a pH value of 6.5 in water solution, has been reported to preserve delicate complexes such as viruses, and pH 6.0–6.5 is optimal for formation of the IF1-F1complex (12Faberge A.G. Oliver R.M. J. Microscopie (Paris). 1974; 20: 241-246Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis of the samples (Fig.4) revealed the presence of dimeric F1 complexes. They represented about 70% of the particles present in the fields that were examined, the other particles being mostly monomeric F1-ATPase. As the starting material was the main peak obtained by gel filtration of the F1-IF1 complex, it was devoid of monomeric F1-ATPase. Therefore, the monomers must have arisen by disruption of the dimeric complex during the dilution and staining procedures. A few particles appear to be trimeric. As there was only evidence for dimer formation by gel filtration and sedimentation analysis, these apparent trimers in the electron microscopy pictures are unlikely to represent biologically significant assemblies. In a control experiment, particles of F1 alone were examined in the same way. About 94% of them were clearly monomeric. Bovine IF1 exists in two oligomeric states depending on the pH value. At low pH values, IF1 forms an active dimer held together by an antiparallel α-helical coiled-coil from residues around 46–84 (3Cabezon E. Butler P.J.G. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol.

Neuhaus, manuscript in preparation. In this arrangement, the N-terminal inhibitory domains are exposed, and each is capable of interacting with an F1-ATPase complex, as the results presented here now demonstrate. It is thought that the interaction between IF1 and F1 involves the C-terminal region of one or more of the β-subunits (14Jackson P.J. Harris D.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). At present, it is not known whether IF1 can bring about the dimerization of the F1F0-ATPase complex and whether it is involved in formation of dimeric complexes of bovine and yeast F1F0-ATPases that have been detected by native gel electrophoresis in mild detergents (13Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 15Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schagger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The dimeric yeast enzyme contains membrane bound subunits (e and g) that are not present in the monomer, and they appear to be necessary for dimerization to take place. However, the possible involvement of the inhibitor protein (and of two other proteins known as 9 and 15K proteins, which are both required for the action of the yeast IF1) have not been investigated. It may be that dimeric F1F0-ATP synthase forms specific supramolecular complexes with the respiratory complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane (13Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). We thank M. Montgomery for excellent technical assistance."

The pathway plays a fundamental role in breaking down stored lipid reserves to provide metabolic energy and carbon skeletons during processes such as oilseed germination, leaf senescence, and starvation (1Kindl H. Stumpf P.K. The Biochemistry of Plants. 9. Academic Press, Inc., New York1987: 31-50Google Scholar, 2Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couee I. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 657-660Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). β-Oxidation may also play a constitutive role in membrane lipid turnover and be involved in the synthesis of important fatty acid-derived signals such as jasmonic acid (3Wasternack C. Parthier B. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and traumatin (4Farmer E.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recently an Arabidopsis mutant (aim1) has been isolated that is deficient in a multifunctional protein isoform (5Richmond T.A. Bleeker A.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1911-1923PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that aim1displays an altered inflorescencemeristem phenotype has lead to the suggestion that β-oxidation may be involved in flower development (5Richmond T.A. Bleeker A.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1911-1923PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxisomal β-oxidation consists of three components: (i) acyl-CoA oxidase, (ii) the multifunctional protein (which exhibits 2-trans-enoyl-CoA hydratase, l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase, and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activities), and (iii) l-3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. Together these enzymes are capable of the complete degradation of both saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs to acetyl-CoA (6Kleiter A.E. Gerhardt B. Planta. 1998; 206: 125-130Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The process involves the repeated cleavage of acetate units from the thiol end of the fatty acid. Acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX,1 EC1.3.3.6) catalyzes the conversion of fatty acyl-CoAs to trans-2-enoyl-CoAs. The reaction requires FAD as a cofactor, which is subsequently re-oxidized by O2 to form H2O2. This first step is believed to be predominant in exerting control over the rate of carbon flux through the pathway (7Holtman W.L. Heistek J.C. Mattem K.A. Bakhuisen R. Douma A.C.

The preferred substrate of AtACX1 is myristoyl-CoA (C14:0), whereas that of AtACX2 is oleoyl-CoA (C18:1). In addition Hayashi et al. (16Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Ciurli A. Kondo M. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have recently described a gene (referred to here as AtACX4) that encodes an enzyme with specificity for the short-chain substrate hexanoyl-CoA (C6:0). A comparison of the substrate specificities of known acyl-CoA oxidases from Arabidopsis suggests that a gene encoding a medium-chain acyl-CoA oxidase with a preference for decanoyl-CoA (C10:0) and lauroyl-CoA (C12:0) remains to be discovered (15Hooks M.A. Kellas F. Graham I.A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Three acyl-CoA oxidase genes, a multifunctional protein, and a 3-keto acyl-CoA thiolase are up-regulated co-ordinately duringArabidopsis seed germination and post-germinative growth, correlating with the period of most rapid fatty acid degradation (Refs.15Hooks M.A. Kellas F. Graham I.A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Ciurli A. Kondo M. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol.

In addition genes encoding glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis enzymes are also induced during oilseed germination (19Zhang J.Z. Santes C.M. Engel M.L. Gasser C.S. Harada J.J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Kim D.J. Smith S.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although transcription is known to play a major role in the regulation of the glyoxylate cycle (19Zhang J.Z. Santes C.M. Engel M.L. Gasser C.S. Harada J.J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Graham I.A. Smith L.M. Leaver C.J. Smith S.M. Plant Mol.

Genet. 1996; 250: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the level at which peroxisomal β-oxidation is regulated has not yet been determined. The regulation of β-oxidation in plants may be important for a variety of biotechnological applications. In the majority of cases where crops have been genetically engineered to produce novel fatty acids, the accumulation of these products is much lower than that required for commercial exploitation (23Eccleston V.S. Cranmer A.M. Voelker T.A. Ohlrogge J.B. Planta. 1996; 198: 46-53Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Broun P. Boddupalli S. Somerville C.R. Plant J. 1998; 13: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is believed that in these plants the novel fatty acids are synthesized at significant rates but are subsequently degraded by peroxisomal β-oxidation (25Eccleston V.S. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 613-621PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hooks M.A. Fleming Y. Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Planta. 1999; 207: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, Eccleston and Ohlrogge (25Eccleston V.S. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 613-621PubMed Google Scholar) provide evidence that in the case of plants producing medium-chain fatty acids, medium-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity is up-regulated to facilitate this degradation. The down-regulation of acyl-CoA oxidases may therefore promote the accumulation of unusual fatty acids in genetically modified crops. In this study we identify and characterize a promoter-trappedArabidopsis mutant disrupted in a gene encoding a new member of the acyl-CoA oxidase family with medium-chain substrate specificity. This gene is up-regulated at the level of transcription during seed germination. Combined with the three genes previously identified and characterized, our data reveal that Arabidopsis comprises a family of isoforms that together are capable of utilizing the full range of fatty acyl-CoA chain lengths present in vivo. A T-DNA-mutagenizedA. thaliana (ecotype Wassilewskija) population consisting of 10,000 lines (27Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Paris ). 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar) transformed with the pGKB5 vector designed for promoter trapping (28Bouchez D. Camilleri C. Caboche M. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Paris ). 1993; 316: 1188-1193Google Scholar) was screened for transformants exhibiting GUS expression in the roots. Seeds were surface-sterilized and germinated on modified Hoagland solution (1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm Ca(NO3)2, 1.7 mmKNO3, 0.5 mmNH4H2PO4, 1.6 mmFeSO47H2O, 46.2 μmH3BO3, 9.1 μm MnCl2, 0.87 μm ZnSO4, 0.32 μmCuSO4, and 1.03 μmNa2MoO4) plus 0.8% (w/v) agar. After 7 days of growth in a 16-h photoperiod (23 °C light/18 °C dark) seedlings were stained for GUS as described below. For subsequent analysis of line Rm 328, seeds were germinated in continuous light on 0.8% (w/v) agar plates containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog media (29Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-496Crossref Scopus (53693) Google Scholar) (plus 1% (w/v) sucrose where indicated) at 20 °C after 4 days of imbibition at 4 °C in the dark. For experiments with etiolated seedlings, plates were transferred back to the dark at 20 °C after 30 min exposure to white light. The sequence flanking the right border of the T-DNA inserts in lines displaying GUS expression in the roots was obtained by inverse PCR. Genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. PCR was then carried out using the primers GUS1 (5′-CCAGACTGAATGCCCACACGCCGTC) and inverse PCR 2200 (5′-GTATCACCGCGTCTTTGATCGCGTC). The conditions for amplification were 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C, repeated 38 times followed by a 2-min extension. The products were sequenced directly using the nested primer GUS2 (5′-TCACGGGTTGGGGTTTCTACAGGAC). A partial clone ofAtACX3 was isolated from a λZAPII cDNA library constructed from 3-day-old etiolated hypocotyls (30Kieber J.J. Rothenburg M. Roman G. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar) by 3′ RACE using the gene specific primer ACX3S (5′-AGGAGTATTTATCACAAACTCTTCAG) in combination with the T7 primer. The library was then screened by colony hybridization according to Sambrook et al. (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 320-328Google Scholar) using the partial clone as a probe (15Hooks M.A. Kellas F. Graham I.A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Four full-length clones were identified and sequenced. RNA was prepared from 2-day-old seedlings (see below), and the 5′-UTR was mapped by 5′ RACE using the 5′ RACE System Version 2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocols. GSP1 and GSP2 were (5′-ACTTTACAGCATTACCCCACAGGA) and (5′-GTGATCATAAATCCCGCAAACCT), respectively. Three 5′ RACE products from separate PCR reactions were cloned and sequenced. One AtACX3 cDNA clone was determined to be in-frame with the N terminus of the pBluescript β-galactosidase gene and could be expressed as a fusion protein following induction of Escherichia coli XL1-blue MRFTM cells with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm in Luria broth media. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (0.4 mm) was then added to the culture, and the cells grown overnight at 28 °C. The culture was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (150 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm FAD, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The cells were lysed by sonication using a Soniprep 150 ultrasonic disintegrator (Sanyo Gallenkamp PLC, Leicester, UK), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 10 min. Assays were performed on the supernatant. Crude tissue extracts were prepared from approximately 2000 2-day-old seedlings. The tissue was ground in 1 ml of extraction buffer using a glass homogenizer. The extract was then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was desalted using a Sephadex G-50 spin column as described by Hooks et al.(15Hooks M.A. Kellas F. Graham I.A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For subcellular fractionation experiments, approximately 10,000 2-day-old seedlings were homogenized in 3 ml of a medium containing: 150 Tricine/KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 msucrose using an Ultra-Turrax (Janke and Kunkel KG). The homogenate was filtered through four layers of mira cloth, and 2 ml of homogenate was layered on top of a gradient consisting of a 1-ml cushion of 60% (w/v) sucrose plus 8 ml of a 60 to 30% linear sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 30,000 × gfor 3 h in a Sorvall OTD55B centrifuge using a TST 41.14 swing out rotor. 0.5-ml fractions were removed and assayed for various enzyme activities. The sucrose concentration of the fractions was determined using a refractometer. ACX assays were performed on plant tissue and bacterial cell extracts according to the method of Hryb and Hogg (32Hryb D.J. Hogg J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) using 50 μm acyl-CoAs as substrate. GUS assays and histochemical staining were carried out as described by Jefferson (33Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). Catalase and cytochrome c oxidase were assayed according to Takahashi et al. (34Takahashi H. Chen Z. Du H. Liu Y. Klessig D.F. Plant J. 1997; 11: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Denyer and Smith (35Denyer K. Smith A.M. Planta. 1988; 173: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), respectively. Protein content was determined as described by Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fatty acids were measured using the method of Browse et al. (37Browse J. Mc Court P.J. Somerville C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Total RNA from various tissues was isolated using the Purescript RNA isolation kit (Flowgen) or the hot phenol method (38Kay R. Chan A. Daly M. McPherson J. Science. 1987; 236: 1299-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis using a 1.1% formaldehyde gel and alkaline-blotted onto Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad) using 50 mm NaOH. Genomic DNA was purified using the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Flowgen). Three μg of DNA were digested using EcoRI, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and blotted using 0.4 mNaOH. Probes were prepared from AtACX3 and gusA, and membranes were hybridized using the digoxygenin system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer protocols. Bands were detected using a ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using the Reverse-iT kit from Advanced Biotechnologies Ltd. The primers used were GUS1, ACX3S, and ACX3A (5′-GAAACATCAGCAACTGCATTCAAC). As part of a research program focused on root-rhizosphere interactions, Arabidopsis promoter trapped lines that displayed GUS expression in the roots of 7-day-old seedlings were isolated from the INRA-Versailles T-DNA-mutagenized population (27Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Paris ). 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar). Genomic DNA sequences that flank the right borders of the T-DNAs were obtained by inverse PCR. One of two inverse PCR products from a line with GUS expression in the root meristem (Rm 328) was found to be homologous to acyl-CoA oxidases. These enzymes catalyze the first step in the pathway of peroxisomal β-oxidation and are known to be highly active in the root tips of maize (2Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couee I. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 657-660Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This putative acyl-CoA oxidase was different from those previously identified inArabidopsis, and the new gene and mutant were designatedAtACX3 and acx3, respectively. A partial AtACX3 cDNA clone was isolated by performing 3′ RACE on a cDNA library constructed from 3-day-old etiolated seedling hypocotyls (30Kieber J.J. Rothenburg M. Roman G. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). This clone was used as a homologous probe to screen the same library by colony hybridization. Four full-length cDNAs were isolated and sequenced. Finally the 5′-UTR was mapped using 5′ RACE. The assembled sequence was submitted to the GenBank data base. The cDNA was 2246 bp long and contained a 2028-bp putative open reading frame (Fig.1). The 5′-UTR extended 53 bp 5′ of the start of translation. The 3′-UTR contained a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) 96 bp 3′ of the stop codon. The deduced protein was 675 amino acids long (Fig. 1) with a calculated molecular mass of 75676.33 Da and an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.17. Both the molecular weight and pI values are similar to those of long-chain acyl-CoA oxidases from Arabidopsis (15Hooks M.A. Kellas F. Graham I.A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A similarity search of available data bases revealed that expressed sequence tags homologous to AtACX3 (>70% amino acid identity) are present in a variety of plant species including Glycine maxand Gossypium hirsutum. Comparison of theArabidopsis acyl-CoA oxidase proteins shows that AtACX3 shares 28, 23, and 14% identity at the amino acid level with AtACX2, AtACX1 (15Hooks M.A. Kellas F. Graham I.A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and AtACX4 (16Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Ciurli A. Kondo M. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), respectively. All fourArabidopsis acyl-CoA oxidases have regions homologous to the mammalian acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein signatures PS1 ((G/A/C)(L/I/V/M)(S/T)EX 2(G/S/A/N)GSDX 2(G/S/A)) and PS2 (Q/E)X 2G(G/S)XG(L/I/V/M/F/Y)X 2(D/E/N)X 4(K/R)X 3(D/E)) (39Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In the AtACX3 sequence, 7 of the 9 positions in PS1 and 7 of 8 positions in PS2 are conserved (Fig. 1). Consensus motifs characteristic of type 1 or 2 peroxisomal targeting signals (14Hayashi H. De Bellis L. Hayashi M. Yamaguchi K. Kato A. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8301-8307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Wimmer C. Schmid M. Veenhuis M. Gietl C. Plant J. 1998; 16: 453-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are not obvious in the AtACX3 amino acid sequence. Southern analysis using a probe to gusA revealed that acx3 contained three copies of the T-DNA (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, one copy was segregated out by back-crossing acx3. The remaining two copies formed a tandem inverted repeat inserted inAtACX3. In Fig. 2 B this was demonstrated by a PCR experiment on acx3 genomic DNA. Primers 5′ or 3′ of the site of insertion in AtACX3 were used in combination with a gusA primer to demonstrate that gusA is present at both borders. The PCR products were sequenced, and comparison with the AtACX3 cDNA sequence revealed that the insertion is situated in an exon, 806 bp 3′ of the putative start of transcription. In Fig. 2 B a reverse transcriptase-PCR experiment using the same primer combinations on RNA from 2-day-old acx3seedlings demonstrated also that the 5′ end of AtACX3 is expressed in vivo as a gusA transcriptional fusion. In contrast, the gusA copy bordering the 3′ end ofAtACX3 was not expressed. No product was detected when primers specific to a region of AtACX3 that is 3′ of the insertion site were used in combination (data not shown). These data showed that wild type transcripts are absent from acx3mutant seedlings. Arabidopsis mutants defective in peroxisomal β-oxidation have previously been selected by their resistance to 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid (2,4-DB) (18Hayashi H. Toriyama K. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lange P.R. Hooks M.A. Ahmed M. Rylott E.L. Eastmond P.J. Graham I.A. Sanchez J. Advances in Plant Lipid Research. Secretariado de Publicaciones, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain1998: 343-345Google Scholar). This compound is bio-activated to the herbicide and auxin analogue 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) by β-oxidation (5Richmond T.A. Bleeker A.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1911-1923PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hayashi H. Toriyama K. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lange P.R. Hooks M.A. Ahmed M. Rylott E.L. Eastmond P.J. Graham I.A. Sanchez J. Advances in Plant Lipid Research. Secretariado de Publicaciones, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain1998: 343-345Google Scholar). To investigate whether acx3 is impaired in β-oxidation, seeds were germinated on media containing 1.5 μm 2,4-DB (41Lange P.R. Hooks M.A. Ahmed M. Rylott E.L. Eastmond P.J. Graham I.A. Sanchez J. Advances in Plant Lipid Research. Secretariado de Publicaciones, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain1998: 343-345Google Scholar), and root growth was used as an indicator of resistance. As shown in Fig. 3, homozygous acx3seedlings were significantly more resistant to 2,4-DB than the wild type. In contrast, heterozygous acx3 seedling were sensitive to 2,4-DB, showing that the phenotype is recessive (Fig. 3). Bothacx3 and wild type seedlings were susceptible to 2,4-D (Fig.3). It has also been demonstrated that the post-germinative growth ofArabidopsis mutants disrupted in storage lipid breakdown can be prevented if exogenous sugars are not supplied to the seedling (18Hayashi H. Toriyama K. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar,42Eastmond P.J. Germain V. Lange P.R. Bryce J.H. Smith S.M. Graham I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5669-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To determine if the germination or post-germinative growth ofacx3 is impaired, the rate of hypocotyl elongation and fatty acid breakdown were measured in etiolated seedlings in the absence of exogenous sucrose. The data in Fig. 4show that the rate of hypocotyl growth and fatty acid breakdown were not significantly different from wild type over the course of 5 days following germination. Furthermore, no visible vegetative or reproductive phenotype was observed throughout the life cycle ofacx3 plants. To investigate whether the acx3mutant displayed altered acyl-CoA oxidase activity, the enzyme was measured in 2-day-old germinating seedlings (TableI). Saturated acyl-CoAs ranging from 4 to 20 carbons in length were used at a saturating concentration (50 μM). The acx3 mutant was almost deficient in medium-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity (<5% wild type), whereas short- and long-chain activities were unchanged (Table I). The maximal difference between mutant and wild type activity was observed using lauroyl-CoA (C12:0) as substrate (Table I). In wild type seedlings, acyl-CoA oxidase activity declined with increasing substrate chain length. Long-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity was approximately 8- and 10-fold lower than that of medium- and short-chain activities, respectively (Table I).Table IAcyl-CoA oxidase activity in 2-day-old acx3 and wild type seedlingsSubstrate carbon chain lengthActivityWild type activity minus acx3 activityacx3Wild typenmol mg −1 protein min −1 46.6 ± 0.16.6 ± 1.1NS 633.8 ± 3.742.9 ± 7.4NS 82.5 ± 0.314.8 ± 1.412100.6 ± 0.118.8 ± 2.218123.6 ± 1.330.3 ± 4.327145.5 ± 1.39.6 ± 1.04162.8 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.3NS182.4 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.2NS202.4 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.2NSActivity was measured using saturated acyl-CoAs of varying chain length at a saturating concentration of 50 μm.

Values are the mean ± S.E. of measurements made on three separate batches of seedlings. NS, not significant (p > 0.01). To confirm the function of AtACX3, the cDNA was expressed in E. coli as a β-galactosidase fusion protein transcribed from the pBluescript cloning vector upon induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. As previously reported (15Hooks M.A. Kellas F. Graham I.A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), no inducible acyl-CoA oxidase activity was observed in extracts of E. coli harboring pBluescript without insert and endogenous levels of acyl-CoA oxidase activity were below the limits of detection. There was also no induction when the AtACX3cDNA is in the antisense orientation (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 A, AtACX3expressed in the correct orientation encoded a protein with medium-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity. The optimum substrate was lauroyl-CoA (C12:0). No activity was detected with substrates of chain length greater than C14:0. In Fig. 5 B, kinetic analysis of recombinant AtACX3 showed that the apparent K m value of the enzyme for lauroyl-CoA was 3.7 μm. The optimum pH was between 8.5 and 9.0 and activity was dependent on the provision of the cofactor FAD (data not shown). To investigate whether AtACX3 is a peroxisomal protein, the subcellular location of medium-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity was determined. The acx3 mutant specifically lacks this activity (Table I), making it a reliable marker for the subcellular localization of the protein in wild type. A homogenate of two-day-old wild type seedlings was fractionated on a sucrose density gradient by centrifugation to separate the subcellular compartments. Catalase and cytochrome c oxidase activities were used as peroxisomal and mitochondrial markers, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, medium-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity co-localized with that of catalase (fraction 16), suggesting that the majority of AtACX3 is located in the peroxisome. Both activities were present in the supernatant as well as in the peroxisomal fraction. This is likely to be due to a proportion of the organelles rupturing during the tissue homogenization step. In Fig. 7, Northern blot analysis of total RNA from imbibed seeds, germinating seedlings, and various tissues from wild type plants showed thatAtACX3 is expressed at low levels in all tissues but is up-regulated strongly during germination and leaf senescence.AtACX3 transcripts were detectable in imbibed seeds before radicle emergence. Steady-state AtACX3 mRNA levels increased during germination to a maximum between 2 and 3 days after imbibition (DAI) and subsequently decreased (Fig.7 A). The analysis of GUS expression in acx3, displayed in Fig.8 A, revealed that theAtACX::gusA tra"

Activated microglia are intimately associated with plaques and appear to facilitate Aβ deposition, an event believed to contribute to pathogenesis. It is unclear if microglia can modulate pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by secreting lipoprotein particles. Here we show that cultured BV2 murine microglial cells, like astrocytes, secrete apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apolipoprotein J (apoJ) in a time-dependent manner. To isolate and identify BV2 microglial particles, gel filtration chromatography was employed to fractionate BV2-conditioned medium. Analyses by Western blot, lipid determination, electron microscopy, and native gel electrophoresis demonstrate that BV2 microglial cells release spherical low density lipoprotein (LDL)-like lipid-containing particles rich in apoJ but poor in apoE. These microglial particles are dissimilar in size, shape, and lipoprotein composition to astrocyte-derived particles. The microglial-derived particles were tested for functional activity. Under conditions of suppressed de novo cholesterol synthesis, the LDL-like particles effectively rescued primary rat cortical neurons from mevastatin-induced neurotoxicity. The particles were also shown to bind Aβ. We speculate that the LDL-like apoJ-rich apoE-poor microglial lipoproteins preferentially bind the lipoprotein receptor, recognizing apoJ, which is abundant in the choroid plexus, facilitating Aβ clearance from the brain. BV2 cells also secrete an apoE-rich lipid-poor species that binds Aβ. Consistent with the role of apoE in Aβ fibril formation and deposition, this microglial species may promote plaque formation.

Activation of microglia is thought to induce an inflammatory response in the brain and to mediate the amyloid-associated neurodegeneration in AD. For instance, microglial response to Aβ leads to expression of important inflammatory mediators: interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (5Murphy Jr., G.M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16084-16089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and are likely to contribute to the total cerebral Aβ burden. Emerging data support a role for microglia in plaque progression in AD (2Griffin W.S.T. Sheng J.G. Royston M.C. Gentleman S.M McKenzie J.E. Graham D.I. Roberts G.W. Mrak R.E.

Neuroimmunol. 1989; 24: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Response of quiescent microglia to Aβ appears to represent the first step of an activation cascade (12Griffin W.S.T. Sheng J.G. Roberts G.W. Mark R.E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 13Rozemuller J.M. Eikelenboom P. Stam F.C. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Acta Neuropathol. 1999; 97: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since Aβ has been demonstrated to act as a chemotactic stimulus for microgliain vitro (16Davis J.B. McMurray H.F. Schubert D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it may signal to recruit microglia to the vicinity of extracellular Aβ in vivo. This is supported by the observation that reactive microglia co-localize with diffuse nonfibrillar Aβ only in brain regions that are involved in AD pathology (17Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S.T. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The acquisition of a tertiary fibrillar structure by Aβ and the development of neuritic plaques can be correlated with the intimate association of activated microglia. This is in contrast to the appearance of reactive astrocytes, which encircle but are not in immediate physical proximity to neuritic plaques (2Griffin W.S.T. Sheng J.G. Royston M.C. Gentleman S.M McKenzie J.E. Graham D.I. Roberts G.W. Mrak R.E. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The close physical association of reactive microglia with the different stages of plaque formation strongly suggests that activation of microglia facilitates conversion of diffuse Aβ to fibrillar Aβ. It has been proposed that once proto-fibrils have formed, endosomal compartments in microglia could serve as efficient sites for the growth of amyloid fibrils (18Chung H. Brazil M.I. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32301-32308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Glial-neuronal interactions also contribute to plaque progression. For example, overexpression of interleukin-1α by plaque-associated microglia may contribute to plaque development by increasing production of astrocyte-derived S100β. This neurite growth-promoting cytokine has been implicated as contributing to the formation of dystrophic neurites within plaques (2Griffin W.S.T. Sheng J.G. Royston M.C. Gentleman S.M McKenzie J.E. Graham D.I. Roberts G.W. Mrak R.E. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 4Sheng J.G. Ito K. Skinner R.D. Mrak R.E. Rovnaghi C. Van Eldik L.J. Griffin W.S.T.

Neurol. 1995; 54: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Neuronal injury arising from these cytokine-induced neuronal insults can further activate microglia with increased expression of interleukin-1, thus producing feedback amplification of this cytokine cycle (2Griffin W.S.T. Sheng J.G. Royston M.C. Gentleman S.M McKenzie J.E. Graham D.I. Roberts G.W. Mrak R.E. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Although microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of senile plaques and apoE has been shown to co-localize with specific plaque types (19Sheng F.G. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S.T. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1996; 22: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), implying a role in plaque progression, it is unclear whether microglia can modulate the progression of AD through de novo synthesis and secretion of apoE. Since apoE is a major risk factor for AD (20Schmechel D.E. Sauders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Crain B.J. Hulette C.M. Joo S.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lancet. 1996; 348: 90-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), this is an important issue. Analyses using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situhybridization indicate that microglia express apoE mRNA (23Nakai M. Kawamata T. Taniguchi T. Maeda K. Tanaka C. Neurosci.

Science. 1983; 219: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we asked whether microglia synthesize and secrete apoE protein and/or apolipoprotein-containing lipoprotein particles. As an initial step to answering this question, we investigated the immortalized microglial cell line, BV2, which possesses many of the features of primary microglia (5Murphy Jr., G.M. Yan L. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20967-20971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Blasi E. Barluzzi R. Boccini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J.

Using size exclusion chromatography, electrophoretic separation, electron microscopy, and native gel electrophoresis, we have found that BV-2 cells secrete apoE and apoJ, as well small spherical LDL-like lipoproteins. We also demonstrate that this microglial LDL-like lipoprotein can function in delivering cholesterol to neurons and can associate with Aβ. The BV2 immortalized murine microglial cell line was generated by Dr. Virginia Bocchini (26Blasi E. Barluzzi R. Boccini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 27: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) and has been described previously (5Murphy Jr., G.M. Yan L. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20967-20971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Bitting L. Naidu A. Cordell B. Murphy Jr., G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16084-16089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, BV2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Inc, Logan, UT), 4 mm l-glutamate, 0.2 mm penicillin, 0.05 mm streptomycin, and 20 mm HEPES at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 95%/5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2. Once confluent, typically 1 day after initial seeding at ∼105/ml, cells were washed once and grown in serum-free medium for 12, 24, or 48 h. Conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 700 × g. The medium was stored under argon at 4 °C until use. For both purification of lipoprotein particles, neuronal rescue, and Aβ binding experiments, a total of 1400 ml of conditioned medium was used. To preserve the protein composition of lipoproteins during fractionation, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was chosen over salt density centrifugation to isolate native microglial lipoprotein particles. Serum-free BV2 microglial medium conditioned for 24 h was concentrated using Centricon-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) before fractionation using Superose 6 HR 10/30 columns in tandem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), operated by a HP1050 Chemstation (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). The columns were equilibrated in elution buffer consisting of 0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.05 m NaCl, and 0.03% EDTA (29Reardon C.A. Blachowicz L. Watson K.M. Barr E. Getz G.S. J.

Two milliliters of concentrated medium (originally ∼1400 ml) at roughly 5 mg/ml were injected via a 2-ml sample loop and fractionated in elution buffer at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Fractions were collected 48 min after sample injection at 0.4 ml/fraction until free proteins were eluted from the columns. The protein elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 275 nm. To characterize BV2 microglial particles, the column system was calibrated using fresh human plasma (Pacific Blood Center, San Francisco, CA) and mouse plasma (Harland Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis, IN) to determine the elution of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), and free protein. Positioning of free protein peak was based on the albumin elution profile determined by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). All experiments involving gel filtration chromatography were performed at room temperature. Fractionated samples were stored under argon at 4 °C until use. Two gel systems, including reducing SDS-PAGE and non-denaturing PAGE, were employed. For protein analysis in reducing SDS-PAGE, proteins in conditioned media or fractions after SEC were denatured in reducing SDS-PAGE buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.4% SDS, 6% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. For protein analysis in native PAGE, proteins were electrophoresed on non-denaturing 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 25 mmTris, pH 8.3, and 192 mm glycine. To determine relative particle size, a mixture of protein standards of known radii was loaded (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), including thyroglobulin (8.5 nm), ferritin (6.1 nm), catalase (4.6 nm), lactate hydrogenase (4.1 nm), and albumin (3.55 nm) (29Reardon C.A. Blachowicz L. Watson K.M. Barr E. Getz G.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1372-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoretic separation, proteins in reducing SDS-PAGE gels were electroblotted on to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20% methanol, 20 mm Tris, and 50 mm glycine. To electroblot the proteins after native PAGE, the gel was soaked with 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 15 min. Afterward, the polyvinylidine difluoride membranes were split; a portion of the membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue to position protein standards, and the remainder of the blot was used for Western analysis. Rabbit anti-murine apoE, apoAI, apoAII, and apoC antibodies (with apoCIII as a major determinant) were purchased from Biodesign International (Kennebunk, ME), and sheep anti-rat apoJ was purchased from Quidel (San Diego, CA). The antigen-antibody reaction was visualized by using a secondary antibody conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blots were quantified by densitometric analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoprecipitation of apoE was performed using 5 ml of conditioned BV2 microglial medium in the presence of 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 μl of rabbit anti-rat apoE serum with an overnight incubation at 4 °C. After immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose pellets were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% nonidet P-40 and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Protein A-Sepharose pellets were rinsed twice with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. The sample was heat-denatured in SDS-PAGE buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.4% SDS, 6% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. Immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoretically separated, blotted to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The polyvinylidine difluoride membranes were destained with 50% methanol and rinsed with deionized water. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems sequencer (Foster City, CA). Two hundred-microliter aliquots of fractionated plasma or BV2 microglial medium were used to determine total cholesterol and phospolipid. Total cholesterol in fractionated samples was measured after enzymatic reactions by cholesterol oxidase in the presence of cholesterol esterase using a commercially available kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Phospholipid levels were determined enzymatically using a commercially kit (Wako, Richmond, VA). For electron microscopy, fractions originating from microglial-conditioned medium was dialyzed against a volatile buffer composed of 0.125 m ammonium acetate, 2.6 mmammonium carbonate, 0.26 mm EDTA at a pH of 7.6 overnight at 4 °C in a 10-kDa cutoff Slide-A-lyzer cassette (Pierce). This volatile buffer causes disc-like particles to form rouleaux, a desirable alignment that allows unequivocal discrimination from spheres. Selected fractions were concentrated 8–10-fold using 10-kDa cutoff Microcon concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and then negatively stained on carbon-filmed grids using 2% neutral sodium phosphotungstate. Carbon films were freshly made and particle suspensions were allowed to adsorb to these for one minute before being “wicked” off. Just before air drying was complete, negative stain was applied, left in place for 30 s, and then wicked off, leaving enough residue to create clear negative contrast. Grids were immediately examined, and electron micrographs taken in a JEM 100CX transmission electron microscope (JEOL Inc., Tokyo, Japan) operated at 80 kV. Prints at a final magnification of 100,000× were prepared and captured via video camera into an Image1/AT image analyzer (Universal Imaging Corp, West Chester, PA). After thresholding the particles, size frequencies and particle counts were made by automated quantitative morphometry. Samples of 500–1000 particles were routinely analyzed. Primary cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (32Li Y.H. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 33Michikawa M. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the uteri were removed from the gravid rat under anesthesia. Cortices were dissected and diced into small pieces. Cells were dissociated and maintained in minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For mevastatin-induced neuronal toxicity assays, cells were seeded on polylysine-coated 96-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well in a growth medium. One day after the initial plating, the growth medium was replaced with minimum essential medium supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum. Triplicate wells of neuronal cells were then treated with 50 μm mevastatin (Sigma) with or without additions of isolated BV2 microglial particles for 48 h. Quantification of apoE levels in BV2 apoE-containing particles was performed by Western analysis against purified mouse apoE. Neuronal cell viability was assayed 48 h after the start of the treatments using an MTS assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Loss of cell viability was quantified by the decrease in the ability of cells to metabolize the dye 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS). In this system, MTS is bioreduced by living cells into soluble formazan. The quantity of formazan product is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. Scios is certified with the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care; hence, these experiments were reviewed by an Institutional Animal Use Care Committee to ensure justification of animal use and proper handling of animals. Aβ association with lipoproteins was assessed using previously published procedures (34LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, 250 μm synthetic Aβ1–40 (Bachem, Torrance, CA) was incubated with BV2-conditioned medium for 2 h at 27 °C, after which the material was fractionated by SEC as described above. Equal volumes of fractions eluting from the column were analyzed by Western blot using a human Aβ-specific monoclonal antibody (Senetek, Maryland Heights, MO). Twelve percent reducing Tricine urea SDS-PAGE and non-reducing Tricine urea SDS-PAGE (not equivalent to native PAGE) were employed to electrophoretically separate the proteins in each fraction. The BV2 cell line was established by immortilization of murine microglia by infection with the J2 retrovirus (25Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Science. 1983; 219: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and has been shown to retain properties of microglia (5Murphy Jr., G.M. Yan L. Cordell B. J. Biol.

To determine if BV2 microglia synthesize and secrete any apolipoproteins, serum-free media were harvested after conditioning for 12, 24, and 48 h and subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-murine apoE antibody and an anti-rat apoJ antibody as well as immunological probes for other apolipoproteins. Western blot analysis revealed that there was a time-dependent accumulation of a 33-kDa apoE in the medium from BV-2 cells incubated from 12 to 24 h (Fig.1). Prolonged conditioning up to 48 h resulted in a slight increase in 33-kDa apoE, but with prominent accumulation of apoE fragments, most notable at 21 kDa, which we presume to be degradative products of the 33-kDa protein. The size of the immunoreactive 33-kDa protein is consistent with the molecular mass of apoE. To ensure anti-murine apoE antibodies recognize authentic apoE synthesized and released from BV2 cell cultures, immunoprecipitation was performed, and the protein species at 33 kDa corresponding to the apparent molecular mass of mature apoE was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The sequence analysis revealed that the 33-kDa species had an N terminus, 1EGEPEVT, that matched the terminus of the mature apoE sequence. Western blotting the same amount of medium with anti-apoJ antibody detected a protein species with apparent molecular mass at 70 kDa, the size of uncleaved apoJ holoprotein (36Jordan-Starck T.C. Lund S.D. White D.P. Aronow B.J. Ley C.A. Stuart W.D. Swertfeger D.K. Clayton L.R. Sells S.F. Paigen B. Harmony J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 194-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (also called clusterin, SP40, 40, or sulfated glycoprotein-2). Similar to apoE, there was a time-dependent accumulation of apoJ in the medium (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the majority of apoJ remained stable, in contrast to apoE, which showed degradation in the 48-h-conditioned medium. Additional Western analyses failed to detect other apolipoproteins, including apoAI, apoAII, or apoCIII (data not shown). Thus, apoE and apoJ appear to constitute the major apolipoproteins synthesized and released by the BV2 murine microglial cells. This observation is supported and extended by results with human primary microglia from both AD and non-demented elderly individuals, which were also shown to synthesize and secrete apoE and apoJ. 2B. Cordell, Q. Xu, and J. Rogers, unpublished observation. To fractionate the BV2 microglial medium in a manner that would allow for the isolation of intact lipoproteins, we adapted SEC utilizing tandem Superose-6 columns. The columns were first evaluated for their ability to fractionate defined sizes of lipoproteins present in mouse and human plasma. To determine the distribution of defined sizes of lipoproteins, aliquots of isolated fractions were assayed for phospholipid and total cholesterol across the elution profile, whereas albumin, a marker for free protein elution, was monitored by Coomassie Blue staining. As seen in Fig. 2, this SEC system clearly separates the various classes of lipoproteins in both human and mouse plasma from free protein. These profiles are comparable with previous reports for the distribution of plasma lipoproteins (37Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To isolate and identify lipoprotein particles released by BV2 microglial cells, we chose to use 24-h-conditioned medium that we previously determined to have an accumulation of intact apolipoproteins. Concentrated serum-free conditioned medium was fractionated using the above-described system, and selected samples were separated on reducing SDS-PAGE for probing with apoE and apoJ antibodies across the elution profile (Fig.3 A). Elution of albumin, indicative of free protein, peaked around fraction 53 (data not shown). Although apoE was detectable as early as fraction 9, the majority of apoE immunoreactivity eluted in fractions 43–51, which corresponds to an HDL-like size particle. In contrast, apoJ eluted from fractions 25–47, with the peak located at fraction 35, which corresponds to a small LDL-like size particle. Elution of these discrete apolipoprotein peaks ahead of the free protein peak suggests that apoJ and apoE are associated with lipoprotein particles. It has been shown that apoJ is often associated with HDL-like particles in human plasma (38De Silva H.V. Stuart W.D. Duvic C.R. Wetterau J.R. Ray M.J. Ferguson D.G. Albers H.W. Smith W.R.

However, the precise mechanisms by which individual pathways induce oncogenesis are not well understood. We have investigated the roles of individual signaling pathways in v-Src-dependent cell growth and survival by inhibiting one particular pathway. v-Src induced constitutive activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Ras in murine Ba/F3 cells and led to factor-independent proliferation. Dominant-negative mutants of STAT3 (STAT3D) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Δp85) inhibited v-Src-dependent growth by ∼60 and ∼40%, respectively. Moreover, dominant-negative Ras (N17) induced severe apoptosis, which was accompanied by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-3. Although cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or caspase-3 inhibitors remained viable even when N17 was expressed, the growth was reduced by ∼85%. During N17- and STAT3D-induced growth suppression, expression of cyclin D2,cyclin D3, c-myc, and c-fos was suppressed by N17, whereas that of cyclin D2,cyclin E, and c-myc was suppressed by STAT3D. Thus, v-Src-activated Ras and STAT3 are involved in distinct but partly overlapping transcriptional regulation of cell cycle regulatory molecules. These results suggest that the full oncogenic activity of v-Src requires simultaneous activation of multiple signalings, in which Ras is particularly required for survival.

These stimuli are transmitted to intracellular signal transducers and trigger activation of signaling cascades including Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),1 Janus family of protein-tyrosine kinases/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathways. A number of previous studies have shown that deregulated intracellular signaling pathways are closely related with various types of malignancies. Indeed, many of the oncogene products that contribute to tumor formation and/or progression have been identified as constitutively activated forms of signaling molecules. The v-src oncogene, which was first identified from the transforming gene of Rous sarcoma virus, encodes a constitutively activated form of c-Src nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, which is involved in signal transduction pathways associated with several growth factors and cytokines (as reviewed in Ref. 1Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). v-Src has been shown to activate a number of signaling proteins (2Chaturvedi P. Sharma S.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms by which oncogenic Src promotes cell transformation are still not well understood. Ras, one of the downstream signal transducers of v-Src, is a 21-kDa guanine nucleotide binding protein and is implicated as a critical signal mediator for many kinds of stimuli. The activated GTP-bound Ras directly stimulates specific downstream cascades consisting of Raf/MAPK, PI3-K/Akt, Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator families and others (as reviewed in Refs. 9Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar and 10Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Ras also participates in the malignant transformation of various types of cells. Gain-of-function mutations in ras gene have been found in many human malignancies including leukemia, pancreatic, gastric, and lung cancers (11Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hirai H. Tanaka S. Azuma M. Anraku Y. Kobayashi Y. Fujisawa M. Okabe T. Urabe A. Takaku F. Blood. 1985; 66: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of oncogenic Ras into rodent fibroblast cell lines induces pleiotropic responses such as alteration in cell morphology, loss of contact inhibition, decreased serum-dependence, and anchorage-independent growth (13Lloyd A.C.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2586-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ras has been shown to drive the cells to leave a quiescent state (G0) and to pass through the G1/S boundary via the induction of Cyclin D1 (15Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D.

Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ras is profoundly involved in cell survival signals from growth factors because it has been demonstrated that a C-terminal truncated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, which is unable to activate Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway, cannot prevent cell death in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 cells (19Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Ras is capable of protecting cells from apoptosis through the induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expression (20Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2207-2212PubMed Google Scholar). The STAT family of transcription factors, another set of signal transducers activated by v-Src, has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in growth factor- and hormone-induced signal transduction (for reviews see Refs. 21Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar and 22Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar).

Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In addition, many lines of evidence suggest a close association between deregulated activation of STATs and oncogenesis in various types of tumors. Constitutive activation of STATs has been found in breast carcinoma and hematologic malignancies (26Gouilleux-Gruart V. Gouilleux F. Desaint C. Claisse J.F. Capiod J.C. Delobel J. Weber-Nordt R.

STAT3, particularly, has been found to be constitutively activated in the bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with multiple myeloma and in a human myeloma cell line U266, which is inherently resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis (29Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated that point-mutated, constitutively active STAT3 (STAT3-C) confers anchorage-independent growth on a fibroblastic cell line 3Y1, and injection of STAT3-C-expressing 3Y1 cells into nude mice led to tumor formation (23Bromberg J.F.

Although a growing number of studies elucidate the function of various signal transducers, it is hard to assign a specific contribution of an individual signaling pathway to the induction of each aspect of the transformed phenotype, because many different signaling pathways are activated simultaneously by a single oncogene product. To investigate the role of individual signaling pathways, we utilized dominant-negative forms of signaling molecules to inhibit activation of one particular signal transduction pathway. In this study, we inducibly expressed dominant-negative forms of Ras (N17), STAT3 (STAT3D), and PI3-K (Δp85) in v-Src-transformed Ba/F3 cells and examined their effects on v-Src-induced cell growth and survival in association with the expression and function of cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory molecules. Highly purified recombinant murine IL-3 was provided by Kirin Brewery (Tokyo, Japan). The antibodies (Abs) against STAT1, STAT3, STAT5b, and PI3-K p110α were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-pan-Ras Ab was purchased from Oncogene Research Product (Cambridge, MA), anti-PI3-K p85α Ab was from Medical & Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan), anti-Bcl-2 Ab from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and anti-MAPK and anti-phospho-MAPK Abs from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). The anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) Ab 4G10 was provided by Dr. B. Druker (Oregon Health Science University, Portland, OR). A murine IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, was obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Ba/F3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Flow, North Ryde, Australia) and 1 ng/ml IL-3.

Kiyokawa (University of Illinois, Cancer Center, Chicago, IL); and human cdc2 from Dr. E. Harlow (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). To construct expression vectors of v-src, bcl-2, cIAP1, and cIAP2, these cDNAs were subcloned into multicloning site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, De Schelp, The Netherlands). To generate an expression vector of v-srcΔSH2, a SmaI fragment corresponding to amino acids 169–264 was excised from the plasmid pcDNA3-v-Src and self-ligated. To construct a Lac-inducible expression vector of Δp85, its cDNA was subcloned intoEcoRV site of pOPRSVI (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Δp85 is a mutant 85-kDa subunit of PI3-K that cannot bind the 110-kDa catalytic subunit (30Kotani K. Yonezawa Y. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Nishiyama M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The construction of Lac-inducible expression vectors of STAT3D and N17 (Ha-RasS17N) were described previously (33Matsumura I. Nakajima K. Wakao H. Hattori S. Hashimoto K. Sugahara H. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Hirano T. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). STAT3D bears mutations in the DNA-binding domain and inhibits binding of endogenous STAT3 with the response element on target DNA (34Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). N17 is the Asn-17 mutant of Ha-Ras, which blocks multiple downstream signalings including the activation of c-Raf-1 and subsequent phosphorylation of MAPK (35Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for constitutively active STAT5 (pcDNA3–1*6-STAT5A), Ha- RasG12V (pOPRSVI-Ha-RasG12V), Ha-RasV12S35 (pSG5-Ha-RasV12S35), Ha-RasV12C40 (pSG5-Ha-RasV12C40), and Ha-RasV12G37 (pSG5- Ha-RasV12G37) were described in previous papers (36Matsumura I.

Cell. 1995; 80: 535-541Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (628) Google Scholar). To express a target cDNA, we used a LacSwitchTM II inducible expression system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In short, Ba/F3 cells were initially transfected with expression vectors of Lac repressor (LacR), pCMV-LacI, by electroporation. The transfected cells were screened by culturing with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin (Sigma). Out of several hygromycin-resistant clones, one clone in which LacR was most intensely expressed was further transfected with pOPRSVI containing STAT3D, Δp85, or N17. The expression vector of pOPRSVI contains Rous sarcoma virus promoter linked to the Escherichia coli lactose operon, and expression of target cDNA is suppressed by LacR through the lactose operon. When isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is added to the culture medium, LacR is released from lactose operon, and transcription of the target cDNA is initiated. After selection with 1.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), the induction levels of the target proteins in each clone were examined by Western blot analyses before and after the treatment with 0.5 mm of IPTG. To further transfect the plasmid (pcDNA3-Bcl-2, pcDNA3-cIAP1, or pcDNA3-cIAP2) into hygromycin- and G418-resistant Ba/F3 cells, an expression vector of blasticidin S deaminase (Kaken Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) was cotransfected. After the selection with 30 μg/ml of blasticidin S hydrochloride (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan), several blasticidin-resistant cells were cloned and subjected to further analyses. Four tandem repeats of APRE sequence (40Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and three tandem repeats of AP-1-binding sequence (41Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were linked to the murine minimal JunB promoter (−42 to +136) and subcloned into pGL3-Basic-Luc (Promega, Madison, WI) to construct reporter genes for STAT3 and Ras/MAPK activities, respectively. Luciferase assays were performed by using Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega), in which transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfected pRL-CMV-Rluc, an expression vector of Renilla reniformis luciferase. In short, cultured cells (1 × 107 cells/sample) were electroporated (300 V, 960 microfarad) with 10 μg of an appropriate reporter gene together with 2 μg of pRL-CMV-Rluc. After a 12-h recovery period in the culture medium, the cells were serum- and IL-3-starved for 24 h and subjected to luciferase assays. To analyze the effects of IL-3 on AP-1 activities, the serum- and IL-3-deprived cells were stimulated with IL-3 (1 ng/ml) for 6 h and subjected to luciferase assays. To examine the effects of dominant-negative mutants, the cells were pretreated with 0.5 mm of IPTG for 24 h before electroporation and cultured with IPTG during the assay. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer supplied by the manufacturer, followed by the measurement of firefly (Photinus pyralis) and Renilla luciferase activities on luminometer LB96P (Berthold Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The relative firefly luciferase activities were calculated by normalizing transfection efficiency according to the Renilla luciferase activities. The isolation of total cellular RNA and the method for Northern blot were described previously (42Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed according to the methods described previously (42Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (NEN Life Science Products). Cells (5 × 106) were solubilized in lysis buffer, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PY (2 μg) at 4 °C for 2 h and subsequently with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with buffer containing 0.5 m LiCl and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and finally with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.15m NaCl. Then 30 μl of 10 mm phenyl phosphate (dissolved in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was added. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C with 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 40 μm ATP, 30 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 n HCl, and the lipid layer was extracted with 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v). The extracts were washed with methanol/1 n HCl (1:1 v/v), and the lipids were separated by TLC using silica gel G60 (250 mm; Merck). The TLC was developed in chloroform/methanol/H2O/NH4OH (43:38:7:5 v/v) and visualized by autoradiography. The DNA content of cultured cells was examined by staining with propidium iodide and analyzed on FACSort (Beckon Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) with a program Modfit LT2.0 (Beckon Dickinson) as described previously (42Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). TUNEL assays were performed with In Site Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, transferred into permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate), and incubated on ice for 2 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were resuspended in TUNEL reaction mixture containing TdT enzyme and digoxigenin-nucleotide. Incorporation of nucleotides into 3′-DNA fragmented ends was detected by flow cytometry. Cells were washed with RPMI 1640 twice and resuspended in 100 μl of labeling solution containing avidin-annexin-V conjugates at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were rinsed and developed with fluorescein-conjugated avidin (Becton Dickinson) at 4 °C for 30 min. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Caspase-3 activities were measured with PhiPhiLux-G1D2 kit (OncoImmunin, College Park, MD). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 μl of substrate solution supplied by the manufacturer, which contains the caspase-3-specific substrate. After a 60-min incubation in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C, the cells were suspended in 500 μl of dilution buffer supplied by the manufacturer and subjected to flow cytometry. In this system, caspase-3 activities are measured by fluorescence that is derived from the cleaved substrate specific for caspase-3. To analyze the signaling events induced by v-src oncogene, we initially introduced an expression vector of v-src, v-srcΔSH2, which lacked the SH2 domain or an empty control vector into a murine IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3. After the selection with G418, several clones were isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis with a probe of v-src. As shown in Fig.1 A, endogenous c-src mRNA was scarcely detected with the v-src probe both in parental Ba/F3 and Mock clones. In contrast, v-src transgene was expressed intensely in v-src- and v-srcΔSH2-transfected clones at the similar levels. Next, parental Ba/F3, v-src-transfected, and v-srcΔSH2-transfected clones were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum RPMI with or without IL-3, and the total number of viable cells was counted. As shown in Fig. 1 B, parental Ba/F3 cells proliferated only in the presence of IL-3. On the other hand, v-src-transfected cells were able to proliferate even in the absence of IL-3 with a growth curve similar to that of parental Ba/F3 cells that were cultured with 0.1 ng/ml of IL-3. In contrast with v-src-transfected cells, v-srcΔSH2-transfected cells could neither proliferate nor survive in the absence of IL-3. These results imply that v-Src enables Ba/F3 cells to proliferate in the absence of IL-3 and that the SH2 domain is strictly required for its action. To evaluate the activation state of cellular proteins evoked by v-Src and v-SrcΔSH2, we performed Western blot analysis on the whole cell lysates with an anti-PY Ab 4G10 in parental Ba/F3 cells, v-src-transfected, and v-srcΔSH2-transfected cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, overall tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins induced by v-Src was much higher than that induced by IL-3, whereas significant tyrosine phosphorylation was hardly detectable in v-SrcΔSH2 expressing cells. Next, we examined the activation state of specific signaling molecules in these clones. STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and PI3-K p85α were immunoprecipitated from the total cellular lysates and subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-PY Ab. MAPK activation was assessed by Western blot analysis on the whole cell lysates with an anti-phospho-MAPK Ab, which exclusively recognized both tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated MAPK. Treatment of parental Ba/F3 cells with IL-3 led to activation of STAT5 and MAPK but not of STAT1, STAT3, and PI3-K p85α (Fig.2 B). Meanwhile, STAT1, STAT3, PI3-K p85α, and MAPK were constitutively activated in v-src-transfected cells. In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated PI3-K p110α was coimmunoprecipitated with p85α in v-src-transformed cells. In v-srcΔSH2-transfected cells, on the other hand, significant phosphorylation of STATs, PI3-K, and MAPK was not detected. These data indicate that v-Src activates STAT1, STAT3, PI3-K, and MAPK in Ba/F3 cells either directly or indirectly through its SH2 domain. To assess the function of these signaling molecules activated by v-Src, we inducibly expressed dominant-negative forms of STAT3 (STAT3D), Ras (N17), and PI3-K (Δp85) in parental Ba/F3 cells by using a Lac-inducible system, in which expression of the target protein was induced by IPTG treatment. The transfected clones were designated as Ba/F3/STAT3D, Ba/F3/N17, and Ba/F3/Δp85, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, Western blot analysis on the whole cell lysates revealed that the addition of IPTG led to induction of STAT3D, N17, and Δp85 as early as 4 h, and their expression reached a maximum at about 24 h and was retained until 48 h. Furthermore, the amount of induced dominant-negative mutant proteins were found to be far more abundant than their respective endogenous proteins. Then, these clones were further transfected with v-src, and the obtained clones were designated as v-Src/STAT3D, v-Src/N17, and v-Src/Δp85, respectively. We first evaluated the inhibitory effects of dominant-negative mutants on their respective signaling pathways. The effectiveness of STAT3D and N17 were measured by luciferase assays with reporter genes, 4x APRE-Luc and 3x AP-1-Luc, respectively. As shown in Fig.4 A (left panel), IPTG-induced STAT3D was able to disrupt v-Src-induced APRE-Luc activities (6.2-fold) almost completely in v-Src/STAT3D cells. Similarly, IPTG-induced N17 was found to repress IL-3- and v-Src-induced AP-1-Luc activities (7.8-fold for IL-3 and 10.2-fold for v-Src) to the basal level in Ba/F3/N17 and v-Src/N17 clones, respectively. We further evaluated the effects of N17 by examining phosphorylation of MAPK by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B). Phosphorylated MAPK gradually decreased as N17 protein was inducibly expressed by IPTG treatment. Next, we assessed the efficacy of Δp85 with PI3-K assays (Fig. 4 C). Without IPTG treatment, IL-3 stimulation was found to induce PI3-K activity (lane 1 versus lane 2), although we could not detect an apparent tyrosine phosphorylation of p85α and p110α on Western blot analysis (Fig.2 B). Because activation of PI3-K is sometimes difficult to detect by Western blot analysis in terms of its tyrosine phosphorylation, we assumed that PI3-K would be indeed activated in response to IL-3 in parental Ba/F3 cells. PI3-K activation was also observed in IPTG-untreated v-Src/Δp85 cells (lane 6). However, induced expression of Δp85 inhibited both IL-3- and v-Src-induced PI3-K activities (lanes 5 and 7) as efficiently as 100 nm of PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin in Δp85 and v-Src/Δp85 clones (lanes 3 and 8). These results suggest that inducibly expressed STAT3D, N17, and Δp85 are competent to inhibit their respective signaling pathways almost completely. Because of the possibility of the cross-talk among v-Src-activated signaling pathways, we investigated the effects of N17, STA"

The GFP·CTα fusion proteins were enzymatically active and capable of rescuing mutant cells with a temperature-sensitive CT. The expressed GFP·CTα fusion protein was localized to the nucleus in all cell lines and required the N-terminal nuclear targeting sequence. Serum depletion/replenishment did not cause shuttling of CTα between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, the subcellular localization of CTα was examined continuously through all stages of the cell cycle in synchronized cells. No shuttling of CTα between the nucleus and cytoplasm was observed at any stage of the cell cycle. Stimulation of cells with oleate had no effect on the localization of CTα. The GFP·CTα lacking the nuclear targeting sequence stayed exclusively in the cytoplasm. Regardless of their localization, the GFP·CTα fusion proteins were equally active for phosphatidylcholine synthesis and mutant rescue. We conclude that the nuclear localization of CTα is a biological event independent of cell cycle in most mammalian cells and is unrelated to activation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis.

CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase phosphatidylcholine green fluorescent protein Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 nutrient mixture fetal bovine serum CT without nuclear localization signal CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT)1 is the regulatory enzyme of the CDP-choline pathway for de novo synthesis of PC (1Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CT catalyzes the second reaction between choline kinase and cholinephosphotransferase. The CDP-choline pathway is present in all mammalian cells and is essential for cell survival (2Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Complete inactivation of CT by a temperature-sensitive mutation leads to apoptosis (3Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Terce F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). CTα was first purified by Weinhold and co-workers in 1986 (4Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Feldman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5104-5110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its cDNA was first cloned from rat liver by Cornell and co-workers in 1990 (5Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PC synthesis is nearly normal even when over 90% of CT is inactivated (2Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that most cellular CT remains inactive for PC synthesis. However, nearly all cellular CTα has been found localized in the nucleus (6Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although the major site of PC synthesis was found associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (7Pelech S.L. Pritchard P.H.

Because of this physical separation of CTα localization and PC synthesis, the precise localization of CTα and universality of CTα localization in the nucleus have become interesting topics for investigation. Since the nuclear localization of CTα was first reported by Kent and co-workers (6Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the subcellular localization of CTα has become increasingly controversial. A study by Houweling et. al (10Houweling M. Cui Z. Anfuso C.D. Bussiere M. Chen M.H. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that significant staining of CT was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of primary rat hepatocytes and of rat liver thin slices. Adding to this complexity, two more isoforms of CT (CTβ1 and -β2) without the N-terminal nuclear targeting signal were found in animal tissues, including liver, and were present in the cytoplasm (11Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is not known how the participation of CTα in the CDP-choline pathway is regulated, because the amino acid sequences responsible for several previously suspected mechanisms of CTα activation can be deleted without affecting its involvement in the CDP-choline pathway (12Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 325: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a recent study by Cornell and co-workers (15Northwood I.C. Tong A.H. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a novel mechanism for CTα activation was proposed. Based on the observations that activation of PC synthesis during the G0 to G1 transition was accompanied by a translocation of CTα from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in cultured IIC9 cells, it was proposed that this translocation was a mechanism for CTα activation. Yet, this proposed mechanism of translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm might not be necessary if two other isoforms of CT are already present in the cytoplasm. Therefore, it inevitably becomes important to determine the specific localization of CTα in other mammalian cells and to verify whether the observation of such a cell cycle-dependent translocation between the nucleus and the cytoplasm could be extended to other mammalian cells. In this study, we devised a new strategy of monitoring the subcellular localization of CTα directly and continuously in live mammalian cells at various stages of the cell cycle. This study was designed to address the following questions. 1) Is the nuclear localization of CTα a universal event and present in other mammalian cells? The subcellular localization of CTα was previously investigated in four types of mammalian cells: Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 and MT58) (6Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1994; 311: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2) (6Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3, L-cells, and IIC9) (6Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and primary rat liver cells (6Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Houweling M. Cui Z. Anfuso C.D. Bussiere M. Chen M.H. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar). Our current study extended observations into six additional cell lines; the study found no evidence of translocation but did find constitutive localization of CTα in the nucleus of all cell lines tested. 2) Is the CTα translocation between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in IIC9 cells during serum depletion/replenishment (15Northwood I.C. Tong A.H. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) also present in other mammalian cells? We examined CTα localization in Chinese hamster ovary cells under similar conditions and found no evidence of translocation. 3) Is the subcellular localization of CTα changed during the synchronized movement of cells through all stages of the cell cycle? Because the subcellular localization of CTα in continuous stages of the cell cycle has never been addressed before, we examined the localization of CTα in synchronized cells at different stages of the cell cycle in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Additionally, the use of GFP·CTα fusion proteins for direct visualization in cells circumvented specificity problems inherent with indirect immunofluorescence detection. In this report, we describe the findings of this study. Chinese hamster ovary cells (K1 and MT58), rat hepatoma cells (MCA-RH 7777), rat embryo fibroblasts, sheep choroid plexus cells, baby hamster kidney cells, and human hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2) and human mammary gland (MCF-10A) and human normal lung (MRC-9) cell lines were from American Type Culture Collection. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Eagle's minimal essential medium, F-12 nutrient mixture (F12), DMEM/F12, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Life Technologies, Inc. [methyl-3H]choline chloride was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-full-length GFP antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other chemicals and materials were from Fisher. Rat primary hepatocytes were obtained by collagenase perfusion (17Davis R.A. Engelhorn S.C. Pangburn S.H. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2010-2016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated culture dishes and incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10 mm Hepes buffer at 37 °C overnight prior to transfection. K1 and MT58 cells were cultured in F12 medium with 10% FBS at 33 °C. HepG2 and sheep choroid plexus cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% FBS at 37 °C. MCF-10A cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS at 37 °C. Other cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C. The cDNA for Aequorea victoria GFP (Life Technologies, Inc.) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3. For construction of GFP·CT-pCDNA3, the GFP-specific 5′ and 3′ primers withEcoN1 sequences were used to generate a polymerase chain reaction fragment of GFP with removal of the start and stop codons and addition of an EcoN1 restriction site to each end of the GFP coding region (EcoN1-GFP-EcoN1). Full-length cDNA for rat liver CTα in the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 (CT-pCDNA3) was digested with EcoN1, which cuts at a unique site between residues 58 and 59 of CTα, and treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. The treated CTα-pCDNA3 was ligated to the EcoN1-GFP-EcoN1 fragment, and correct orientation of the GFP insertion was confirmed with restriction mapping. This construction places GFP behind the nuclear targeting region (residues 8–28) (12Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) of CTα but in front of the catalytic domain (residues 72–236) (19Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) of CTα. For construction of GFP·CTΔN-pCDNA3, the GFP·CT-pCDNA3 construct was digested with XhoI restriction enzyme to obtain a template for removal of the nuclear targeting region (residues 1–40) by polymerase chain reaction. 5′-TCTAGAATGTTACGG CAGCCAGCTCCTTTTTCT primer and a 3′ primer, both containing XbaI sequences, were used to remove nucleotides 1–120 of CT and to amplify the product. The XbaI restriction sites were used to clone the construct into the pCDNA3 vector. MT58 cells were transfected with 10 μg of GFP-pCDNA3, GFP·CT-pCDNA3, and GFP·CTΔN-pCDNA3 plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation as described (18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). G418-resistant colonies were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 and maintained in 200 μg/ml G418. MT58, MT58 GFP, MT58 GFP·CT, and MT58 GFP·CTΔN cells were seeded into 6-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) at 33 °C and incubated in F12 medium at 40 °C for 4 h. Medium was replaced with 1 μCi [methyl-3H]choline chloride in fresh F12 medium and incubated for 24 h at 40 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (42681) Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in scintillation mixture. Radioactivity counts were determined by scintillation counting. Total proteins (50 μg) from each transfected cell line were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44891) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed with anti-full-length GFP antibody, washed extensively, and probed with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. GFP protein was visualized by a reaction with Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray films. Cells transfected with GFP-pCDNA3, GFP·CT-pCDNA3, and GFP·CTΔN-pCDNA3 plasmids were observed after 48 h under a Zeiss Axioplan-2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescence filter. Digital images of cells were recorded using a Spot camera. MT58 cells and transfected MT58 cells were seeded into 12-well plates and incubated in F12 medium at 33 °C for 12 h and shifted to 40 °C. Cells were harvested at desired time points and counted. MT58 cells (3 × 105) stably transfected with GFP·CT-pCDNA3 were seeded into a 35-mm culture dish and incubated in serum-free Ham's F12 medium for 36 h at 33 °C. The medium was replaced with Ham's F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 33 °C. The localization of GFP·CT fusion protein was examined with a fluorescence microscope at 2-h intervals. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells (7 × 106) were plated into a 150-mm culture dish in Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 1 h at 33 °C. The cell monolayer was washed and then incubated in Ham's F-12 medium with 0.25 μg/ml nocodazole for 16 h at 33 °C. The cells blocked at the G2/M border were either unattached or lightly attached to the dish. These cells were collected by gentle washing with the culture medium, transferred to a centrifuge tube, and spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed twice with medium, and the cells were resuspended in medium. 3 × 105 cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes and incubated at 33 °C for 1 h. The medium was replaced with medium containing 2 mm hydroxyurea and further incubated for 9 h. The medium was replaced with fresh F12 and incubated for various time periods, after which the cells were visualized by microscopy or harvested for flow cytometric analysis. Cells were prepared for flow cytometric analysis by fixing cells (5 × 105) in ethanol and suspending cells in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.6% Nonidet P40, and 37 μg/ml RNase. The stained cells were analyzed on a Coulter XL flow cytometer, which excites the cells at 488 nm and measures the red fluorescence per cell, which can be equated to the DNA content per nucleus. We made three constructs for transfections as diagrammed in Fig.1. In the first construct, expression of GFP alone was used as a control for determination of transfection efficiency and for subcellular distribution of a protein without a specific targeting signal. GFP was distributed evenly throughout cellular organelles. In the second construct, the GFP coding region was inserted in-frame between the nuclear targeting signal and the rest of CTα (between residues 58 and 59); this construct was designated GFP·CT. In the third construct, the nuclear targeting sequence of CTα was removed from the second construct; this third construct was designated GFP·CTΔN. The expression plasmids were introduced into the cultured MT58 and K1 cells to verify whether the fusion proteins were intact. Transfections were achieved by calcium phosphate precipitation, and the stably transfected cells with green fluorescence were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. Specific localization of the fusion proteins depended completely on the fusion proteins remaining intact after being expressed. Otherwise the localization of green fluorescence would not represent the localization of the fusion protein but rather of degradation fragments of the fusion protein. To verify the expression of the constructed fusion proteins, MT58 cells transfected with the plasmids were probed with specific antibodies against GFP by Western blot analysis. Fig. 2 depicts the presence of fusion proteins in the stably transfected cells. The GFP·CT construct produced a fusion protein with an apparent molecular mass (70 kDa) of the predicted fusion protein between CT (43 kDa) and GFP (27 kDa). The GFP·CTΔNconstruct produced a smaller fusion product corresponding to the removal of the 40 amino acid residues of the CTα nuclear targeting signal. There are two bands in MT58 cells that reacted nonspecifically to the GFP antibody and were not related to GFP. The control GFP construct produced a large amount of GFP protein at the predicted molecular mass. Because the efficiency of expressing GFP alone is much higher than that of larger fusion constructs, we had to reduce the amount of total protein loaded on the gel to 1/10 of the other lanes to achieve comparable exposures. Therefore, the nonspecific bands in MT58 cells did not show up in this lane. Nevertheless, both fusion proteins remained intact in the stably transfected cells, suggesting that the localization of green fluorescence represents the localization of the intact fusion protein.Figure 2Western blot analysis of the expressed fusion proteins. Fifty μg of total cellular protein from each cell line (10 μg for MT58 GFP) was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins were probed with a specific antibody to GFP and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Lane 1, MT58 GFP; lane 2, MT58 GFP·CTΔN; lane 3, MT58 GFP·CT; lane 4, MT58.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then determined whether the fusion proteins were enzymatically active for PC synthesis. The stably transfected MT58 cells were shifted to 40 °C to inactivate the endogenous CT activity. Cells were then labeled with3H-choline for 24 h, the organic phase of the labeled cells was extracted, and radioactive counts in each sample were determined. The only way for water-soluble 3H-choline to get into the organic phase was to complete all three steps of the CDP-choline pathway. In a separate experiment, we determined that PC accounted for 96% of the radioactivity in the organic phase. Thus, the incorporation of 3H-choline into the organic phase was a direct representation of the activity of the CDP-choline pathway and CT activity in MT58 cells at 40 °C. Results of this experiment showed that both fusion constructs of GFP·CTα were enzymatically active (Fig. 3). We also determined by counting cells after incubation at 40 °C that the fusion proteins were capable of rescuing MT58 cells at the non-permissive temperature. The results showed that both fusion proteins, but not GFP alone, restored the growth of MT58 cells at 40 °C, with generation times similar to that of CT expression in MT58 cells (data not shown). In summary, the GFP·CTα fusion proteins with or without the nuclear targeting sequence behaved indistinguishably from CTα alone in terms of enzyme activity and ability to rescue MT58 cells at 40 °C. Thus, the localization of the fusion proteins should represent the localization of CTα very closely. These constructs were then expressed in cells from several selected origins to determine directly the localization of the fusion proteins in live cells. This design minimized the effects of nonspecificity often seen with antibody staining and cell fixation and represented cellular localization closer to physiological conditions. After confirming that the fusion protein did retain the expected enzymatic activity and cellular function, we monitored the transfected MT58 cells by fluorescence microscopy. The main purpose of this design was to further confirm that the fusion constructs would behave similarly to the observation of CTα nuclear localization made originally by Kent and co-workers (12Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A similar nuclear localization in MT58 cells would validate that the GFP·CTα fusion construct retains critical determinants for nuclear targeting and that its localization in other cell types is a close reflection of native CTα in the physiological state. GFP·CT fusion proteins were indeed localized exclusively to the nucleus of MT58 cells (Fig.4 A) at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Upon removal of the N-terminal nuclear targeting sequence, GFP·CTΔN revealed a clear pattern of nuclear exclusion (Fig. 4 A). These results indicated that the fusion constructs displayed patterns of subcellular localization identical to that of native CTα reported previously. Because all cell lines included in our intended survey contain endogenous CT, it was important to determine whether the nuclear localization of overexpressed fusion protein is affected by endogenous CT. We expressed the fusion constructs in K1 cells in which the level of endogenous CT is at least 20-fold higher than that of MT58 at the permissive temperature. Fig. 4 B demonstrates that the patterns of the fusion proteins in K1 cells were identical to those of MT58 cells (Fig. 4 A) at various levels of expression. This result suggests that the mechanism for nuclear retention is not saturable and that the localization of the expressed fusion protein was not affected by the endogenous CT. One of the advantages of using GFP·CT fusion was that the localization could be visualized directly in live cells. This visualization required no prior selection of the transfected cells. Primary hepatocytes are quiescent cells. However GFP·CT fusion protein provided an opportunity for the nuclear or non-nuclear localization of the overexpressed protein to be directly detected in the transfected primary cells. Forty-eight h after transfection, GFP·CT fusion protein was detected exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 4 D). The nuclear localization of GFP·CT fusion protein was seen in all transfected hepatocytes. In contrast, GFP·CTΔN fusion protein was exclusively localized to the cytoplasm of all transfected hepatocytes. This suggested that the nuclear localization of GFP·CT fusion protein in hepatocytes was also directed by the N-terminal nuclear targeting sequence of CTα. A similar nuclear localization of GFP·CT fusion protein was also detected in a wide range of cell lines from different species and tissues. These cell lines included rat hepatoma cells (RH7777, Fig. 4 C), baby hamster kidney cells (Fig.4 E), human hepatoma cells (Hep G2, Fig. 4 F), sheep choroid plexus (Fig. 4 G), rat embryo fibroblast (Fig.4 H), human lung cells (MRC-9, Fig. 4 I), and human mammary gland (MCF-10A, Fig. 4 J). The exclusively cytoplasmic localization of GFP·CTΔN fusion protein was observed in all cell lines except rat embryo fibroblast, in which the fusion protein was evenly distributed throughout the cells. The cell cycle-associated regulation of PC synthesis (23Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20219-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and the recent finding of CT translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (15Northwood I.C. Tong A.H. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) raised an intriguing possibility that CT may translocate across the nuclear membrane in a cell-cycle dependent manner. Our experimental design of using GFP·CTα fusion constructs allowed us to monitor any potential movement of CT during the cell cycle. To determine whether there was a translocation of GFP·CT fusion protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during the G0 to G1transition, we repeated the serum deprivation/replenishment conditions similar to those described by Cornell and co-workers (15Northwood I.C. Tong A.H. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The stably transfected MT58 cells with GFP·CT fusion plasmid were deprived of serum for 36 h at the permissive temperature. Upon replenishment with 10% serum, the localization of GFP·CT fusion protein was examined with a fluorescence microscope continuously at 2-hour intervals. At all time points, GFP·CT fusion protein was detected exclusively in the nucleus (Fig.5 C). Because serum deprivation/replenishment has been used traditionally to prepare cells for synchronized entry into the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we examined the populations of cells in each phase of the cell cycle by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analysis. Cells stayed at the G0/G1 position induced by serum depletion and did not move synchronously into S phase upon serum replenishment (Fig. 5 D), suggesting that reentry of G0 cells into the cell cycle was not synchronized by serum replenishment. The failure of serum depletion/replenishment to synchronize cells prompted us to examine the localization of GFP·CT fusion protein in cells synchronized at different phases of the cell cycle by a different method. To achieve a highly synchronized movement of cells through the cell cycle, we used a combination of nocodazole and hydroxyurea treatments, which are capable of synchronizing cells at the G2/M boundary (25Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B.T. Cell. 1991; 66: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) and the late G1/S boundary (24Wawra E. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), respectively. The cycling cells were collected by first blocking cells at the G2/M boundary with nocodazole, a specific and reversible inhibitor of mitotic spindle assembly (26Goslin K. Birgbauer E. Banker G. Solomon F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1621-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The blocked cells were easily collected because mitotic cells were loosely attached to the culture surface. These cells were then plated onto culture dishes, and the entry into S phase was blocked by 1 mm hydroxyurea, a specific and reversible inhibitor of DNA polymerase (24Wawra E. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the presence of hydroxyurea, all cells were at the border of late G1/S (Fig. 5 A, top panel). Removal of hydroxyurea triggered the synchronous entry of the cells into the cell cycle at S phase. The combination of nocodazole and hydroxyurea provided very synchronous cell populations in all four major phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 5 B). A cell cycle analysis program (ModFit) determined that each phase contained over 70% synchrony (data not shown). Upon continuous examination, GFP·CT fusion protein was localized to the nucleus in all the cells of all phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 5 A). The current study clearly demonstrates that CTα localization in the nucleus is apparently a cell type- and cell cycle-independent event for mammalian cells. We have also demonstrated for the first time, without the influence of other isoforms of CT, that localization of CTα in primary hepatocytes is also nuclear. It is also the first localization of CTα during all phases of the cell cycle of mammalian cells. This nuclear localization was dependent solely on the permanent N-terminal nuclear targeting sequence of CTα. The mechanism of CTα nuclear targeting seemed unsaturable even in the presence of a high level of exogenous CTα. It also was clear that CTα stayed in the nucleus during all stages of the cell cycle except M phase, when the nuclear membrane is completely disintegrated (27Warren G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 323-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The complete disintegration of the nuclear membrane would allow a protein of any size without a specific targeting mechanism to be evenly distributed in the cells. The N-terminal nuclear targeting sequence-dependent nuclear localization of CTα also excluded the possibility that CT moved through the nuclear pores passively. The nuclear localization of CTα was apparently universal to all the cell types tested in the current study, because CTα was uniformly nuclear even in the asynchronized populations of cells. The subcellular localization of CT seems to have no apparent effect on the synthesis of PC. More importantly, the recently reported translocation of CT between the nucleus and the cytoplasm was not observed in any cell type or at any stages of the cell cycle in our current study. We propose two possible explanations for the difference between our current report and the previous report from Cornell and co-workers (15Northwood I.C. Tong A.H. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 1) The serum-induced translocation of CT is an event specific only to IIC9 cells and not a universal event in mammalian cells. 2) The indirect detection of CT in IIC9 cells using antibodies was not specific to CTα. A major difference between our current findings and previous findings was the CT localization in primary hepatocytes. The study by Houwelinget al. (10Houweling M. Cui Z. Anfuso C.D. Bussiere M. Chen M.H. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that significant staining of CT was detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of primary rat hepatocytes. According to the recent findings of CT isoforms (11Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we offer an explanation for why CT was detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in primary hepatocytes. The antibody used in the previous studies was raised against a conserved region of CT (164DFVAHDDIPYSSAG). This conserved region is also shared by other isoforms of CT (CTβ1 and CT) that are known to be present specifically in the cytoplasm (28Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, the detection of CT using this antibody was not specific to CTα, and this antibody is capable of recognizing cytoplasmic isoforms of CT, resulting in the detection of both nuclear and cytoplasmic CT. Another difference between our current study and previous studies is that treatment of cells with oleate did not change the subcellular localization of CTα fusion protein (data not shown). Addition of oleate to HeLa cells has been shown to induce translocation to the nuclear membrane (29Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, it is not clear if the failure of GFP·CTα fusion protein to bind nuclear membranes was affected by the fusion construction with GFP. Nevertheless, the failure of GFP·CTα fusion protein to bind to nuclear membranes upon oleate stimulation had no effect on its ability to synthesize PC and rescue MT58 cells at the non-permissive temperature. Previous constructs of CTα lacking the N-terminal nuclear targeting sequence resulted in CTα localization in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (12Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our protein fusion design of GFP·CTΔN was the first active CTα construct localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. Such an unexpected specificity for the cytoplasm allowed us to determine whether the nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of CTα would have different impacts on the ability of CTα to synthesize PC and rescue mutant cells lacking CT. The answer was clear that both nuclear CT and cytoplasmic CT were equally effective for PC synthesis and mutant rescue. This observation is consistent with the fact that the molecular weight of CDP-choline is well below the molecular weight cut-off of the nuclear membrane pores. Therefore, the movement of CDP-choline across the nuclear membrane should not be restricted. No matter where CDP-choline is synthesized, it is readily available for PC synthesis. It is not clear why certain cells may have CT present both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. The presence of isoforms of CT in the cytoplasmic compartments has diminished the possibility that CTα is required to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic compartments for PC synthesis. As previously mentioned, the endoplasmic reticulum is a primary site for PC synthesis. PC synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway has been observed to have the channeling effect (30George T.P. Morash S.C. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B. Spence M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in which PC can only be labeled by the initial substrate choline but not by cholinephosphate or CDP-choline. A possible interpretation of channeling is that the three enzymes of this pathway form a complex that is only accessible by choline. According to this hypothesis, all three enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway are expected to localize to the primary site for PC synthesis. The question of why mammalian cells need multiple isoforms of CT specifically localized to various compartments, whereas the presence of a single isoform anywhere in the cell is sufficient for its role for PC synthesis, remains intriguing and unanswered.

Thermodynamic analysis has also indicated that a thermophilic protein can be stabilized through global interaction throughout the molecule (4Hollien J. Marqusee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13674-13678Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It remains enigmatic as to how many amino acid substitutions contribute to the stability of a natural thermophilic protein (5Jaenicke R. Bohm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In some cases, a mesophilic protein only acquires the stability of the thermophilic counterpart after substantial exchanges of a linear sequence; groups of individual mutations are not sufficient (6Eidsness M.K. Richie K.A. Burden A.E. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Scott R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10406-10413Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Multiple mutations in mesophilic proteins that completely increase the stability to the levels of thermophilic counterparts would provide important information about relationships between local side chain interactions and overall protein stability and demonstrate that the thermophilic character can depend on a limited number of strong noncovalent interactions. Cytochrome c is a powerful tool for characterizing protein stability because structural information on a variety of cytochromesc is available, and heterologous expression systems for holopoteins have been established (7Sambongi Y. Stoll R. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cytochromec 551 (PAc 551)1from a mesophile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and cytochromec 552 (HT c 552) from a thermophile, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus, are 82- and 80-amino acid proteins, respectively, each with a covalently attached heme. These proteins exhibit 56% sequence identity (8Sanbongi Y. Ishii M. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 65-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and almost the same main chain foldings (9Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y., Yu, Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K.

Thermodynamic analysis showed that the quintuple mutant of PA c 551 was as stable as HTc 552. In order to provide a molecular basis for understanding protein stabilization, we have determined the solution structure of the quintuple mutant. We discuss factors contributing to protein stability in conjunction with structural analyses of HTc 552, and the wild-type and quintuple mutant PAc 551 proteins. Mutations were introduced into the PAc 551 gene with a polymerase chain reaction-based kit, Mutan-Super Express Km (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), as described previously (1Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transformed Escherichia coli JCB7120 cells harboring PA c 551 genes were harvested from an anaerobic culture, and the proteins used in this study were purified as described previously (1Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 65-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of the purified protein solutions were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients of ε551 = 25,200 cm−1m−1and ε552 = 20,400 cm−1m−1 for PAc 551 and HT c 552, respectively. The uniformly 15N- or13C/15N-labeled quintuple mutant PAc 551 protein was obtained from an anaerobic culture with (15NH4)2SO4 (99.3%), a15N-labeled Algal amino acid mixture (98.2%), and a glycerol-13C3 and13C/15N-labeled Algal amino acid mixture (97.5%) as nitrogen and carbon sources. The labeled compounds were obtained from Shoko Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Proteins (10 μg/ml) were incubated in diluted HCl water (pH 5.0) with various concentrations of GdnHCl at 25 °C for 2 h before measurements in order to equilibrate the proteins with the denaturant. The CD ellipticity at 222 nm of the protein solutions was measured using a 1-cm path length cuvette at 25 °C with a JASCO J-720 CD spectrophotometer with a PT343 thermoelectric temperature controller. The data were fitted by nonlinear least-squares analysis with KaleidaGraph 3.0 (Synergy Software) employing the Marquart-Levenberg algorithm using a linear extrapolation model as described previously (12Santoro M.M. Bolen B.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). C m was the concentration of GdnHCl at which the free energy change value, ΔG, became 0. The temperature dependence of the CD ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored using a 1-cm path length cuvette with a JASCO J-720 spectrophotometer with a PT343 thermoelectric temperature controller as described previously (1Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol.

Protein solutions (∼10 μg/ml), pH 5.0, containing 1.5 m GdnHCl were heated from 15 °C to 90 or 100 °C at a heating rate of 1 K/min. Under these conditions, the thermal transition was highly reversible (95%). The van't Hoff enthalpy, ΔH van, was determined from the CD denaturation curve according to a two-state mechanism with a temperature-independent heat capacity change, ΔC P (13Marky L. Breslauer K. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). The ΔC P values used were obtained by differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements at pH 5.0 in the presence of 1.5 m GdnHCl for each protein. The slope of the CD base line for HT c 552 in the denatured state was assumed to be the same as that in the native state. DSC measurements were carried out with the VP-DSC developed by MicroCal Inc. (14Plotnikov V.V. Brandts J.M. Lin L.-N. Brandts J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Degassed protein solutions, with a concentration of ∼1 mg/ml, were loaded into the calorimeter cell, and each sample was heated from 10 to 125 °C under approximately 3 atmospheres, with a heating rate of 1 K/min. Thermodynamic parameters, i.e. T m, ΔH, ΔS, ΔC P, and ΔG, were estimated from the heat capacity curve using nonlinear least square fitting based on the previously described method (15Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 502-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Sturtevant J.M. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar). The fitting was performed with MATHEMATICA 3.0 (Wolfram Research Inc.) employing the Marquart-Levenberg algorithm. A protein sample (∼1 mm) of the quintuple mutant was dissolved in a 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 99.99% D2O (v/v) solution (pH 5.0 adjusted with HCl), and then reduced with sodium dithionite. All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C with a Varian UNITYInova 600 spectrometer.

Stereospecific assignments of the γ-methyl protons of valines and β-methylene protons were made by analyzing HNHB (23Archer S.J. Ikura M. Torchia D.A. Bax A. J. Magn.

All proton signals from the heme moiety were assigned according to the procedure of Keller and Wüthrich (26Keller R.M. Wüthrich K. Biochim. Biophys.

Approximate interproton distances were obtained from simultaneous 13C/15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (30Pascal S.M. Muhandiran D.R. Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson.

The mixing time was 60 ms for all NOESY experiments. The distance restraints were grouped into four classes: 1.8–2.7, 1.8–3.3, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–6.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOE cross-peak intensities, respectively. The NOEs including backbone amide protons were grouped into the four classes of 1.8–2.9, 1.8–3.5, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–6.0 Å. The backbone coupling constants,3JNHα, were measured in a HNHA experiment. The φ and ψ-dihedral angle restraints were derived from3JNHα coupling constants and chemical shift indices. Values of −60 ± 30° and −40 ± 30° were used for the φ and ψ-dihedral angles, respectively, for α-helical regions. Hydrogen bond restraints were obtained by analyzing the H/D exchange rates and NOE patterns characteristic of α-helices. Two distance restraints, r NH-O (0–2.3 Å) andr N-O (0–3.3 Å), were used for each hydrogen bond. Structures were calculated using the YASAP protocol (32Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T.

ASA values were calculated using the program MSRoll (34Connolly M.L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1983; 16: 548-558Crossref Google Scholar), with a probe radius of 1.4 Å. The Protein Data Bank accession numbers for the three-dimensional structures of the native proteins were 451C and 1AYGfor PA c 551 and HT c 552, respectively. Surfaces were classified into polar and nonpolar components by regarding carbon and sulfur atoms as nonpolar and oxygen and nitrogen as polar (35Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys.

The far-ultraviolet CD spectrum of the quintuple mutant of PA c551(F7A/V13M/F34Y/E43Y/V78I) was nearly identical to that of the wild type (data not shown). A GdnHCl-induced denaturation curve of the quintuple mutant obtained by CD showed that its C m value (4.39m) was highly elevated relative to that of the wild type (Fig. 1 A and TableI) and essentially the same as that of HTc 552 (C m = 4.47m). Since PA c 551 and HTc 552 exhibit a total of 35 amino acid differences, it is noteworthy that only five of these residues are responsible for the enhanced overall stability against chemical denaturation.Table IThermodynamic parameters characterizing GdnHCl and thermal denaturationsProteinC mT mΔHΔSΔC PΔΔGΔΔG hypΔH mΔH vanΔT mm°Ckcal/molcal/mol/Kcal/mol/Kkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molkcal/mol°CWild-type PA c-5512.16 ± 0.0347.3 ± 0.537.7 ± 1.9118 ± 6720 ± 40037.7 ± 1.935.9 ± 1.8Quintuple mutant4.39 ± 0.0280.2 ± 0.546.0 ± 2.3125 ± 61070 ± 505.86 ± 0.295.7380.2 ± 2.478.3 ± 3.932.9HT c-5524.47 ± 0.0387.5 ± 0.536.7 ± 1.896 ± 5900 ± 506.03 ± 0.3073.1 ± 3.778.3 ± 3.940.3C m, ΔH m, and other values were obtained in GdnHCl and thermal denaturation experiments, respectively.

The hypothetical difference in the free energy change (ΔΔG hyp) of the quintuple mutant at the T m of wild-type PAc 551 is the sum of the ΔΔG values of the PA c 551 mutants having the F7A/V13M, F34Y/E43Y, and V78I substitutions.

ΔH, ΔS, and ΔΔG are the values at T m of the wild-type PA c 551(47.3 °C) estimated from DSC measurements. The hypothetical difference in the free energy change (ΔΔG hyp) of the quintuple mutant at the T m of wild-type PAc 551 is the sum of the ΔΔG values of the PA c 551 mutants having the F7A/V13M, F34Y/E43Y, and V78I substitutions. ΔH m is the calorimetric enthalpy change at T m of each protein. ΔH van is the van't Hoff enthalpy derived from CD measurements. Errors are estimated from three independent measurements. To address the question of how both the quintuple mutant PA c551 and HTc 552 are thermodynamically stabilized, we performed thermal denaturation experiments using CD and DSC. Fig.1 B shows thermal denaturation curves of the quintuple mutant and HT c 552 together with the wild-type PA c551 observed by CD. The ΔH vanvalues estimated from CD measurements for the three proteins were almost identical to the calorimetric enthalpy change at the denaturation temperature (T m), ΔH m, obtained from DSC measurements (see below and Table I), indicating that thermal denaturation of these proteins proceeded in a two-state manner. Fig. 2 A shows the heat capacity curves of the three proteins measured by DSC. From these curves, thermodynamic parameters were obtained as a function of temperature. We further obtained the ΔC P value of the wild-type PA c 551 fromT m-dependent ΔH(T m) measurements at pH 3.6, 3.8, and 4.0 in the absence of GdnHCl (Fig. 2, B and C) (37Privalov P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). The ΔC P value obtained from theT m-dependent ΔH value was 781 cal/mol/K, which was close to that obtained on nonlinear fitting of the C P curve at pH 5.0 in the presence of 1.5m GdnHCl (720 cal/mol/K; Table I). These results indicate that the ΔC P values obtained in this study are reliable ones. It has also been reported that the ΔC P values do not dramatically change in the presence of GdnHCl up to 2.0 m (38Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The DSC measurements (Fig. 2 A) showed that the quintuple mutant had an increased T m value of 32.9 °C and enhanced thermodynamic stability (ΔΔG) of 5.86 kcal/mol at the T m value of wild-type PAc 551 (Table I). These values were nearly the same as those of HT c 552. The quintuple mutant exhibited a large increase in ΔH compared with the wild-type PA c 551 (Table I), suggesting that the mutant was enthalpically stabilized. In contrast, HTc 552 was stabilized by a small ΔSrather than by an enthalpic factor (Table I). This is obvious from the heat capacity curve (Fig. 2 A), since the peak height and area (nearly representing ΔH m) of HTc 552 were smaller than those of the quintuple mutant although their T m values were nearly the same. These results suggest that the enhanced T mvalues of HT c 552 and the quintuple mutant are mainly due to the five residues (Ala-7, Met-13, Tyr-34, Tyr-43, and Ile-78, numbered as in the quintuple mutant of PAc 551); however, the stabilizing factors differ in the two stable proteins. We estimated ΔΔG values for the reported PAc 551 mutants (1Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) having F7A/V13M, F34Y/E43Y, and V78I substitutions, respectively, by DSC measurements (data not shown). The estimated values were as follows: F7A/V13M, 2.39; F34Y/E43Y, 2.52; and V78I, 0.82 kcal/mol. The ΔΔG value of the quintuple mutant obtained in this study was almost identical to the value for the hypothetical difference in free energy change, ΔΔG hyp, i.e. the sum of the ΔΔG values for the mutant proteins with the F7A/V13M, F34Y/E43Y, and V78I substitutions, respectively (Table I). This indicates that the mutations in each of the three regions contribute in an additive manner to the enhanced overall stability. The three mutated regions in the quintuple mutant do not interact with each other; thus, they may behave independently without nonlocal structural perturbations. We next determined the solution structure of the quintuple mutant PAc 551 protein using 1545 NOE-based distance restraints (comprising 592 intraresidue and intraheme, 300 sequential, 257 medium range, 396 long range including NOEs between the heme and polypeptide chain), supplemented with 102 dihedral and 46 hydrogen bond restraints (Fig. 3 A). The best 20 structures for the quintuple mutant satisfied the experimental constraints with small deviations from the idealized covalent geometry (Table II). The stereochemical quality of the 20 structures was determined using PROCHECK-NMR (39Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4419) Google Scholar). Ignoring all glycines and prolines, 98.5% of the remaining residues fell into the most favored and additional allowed regions of φ and ϕ spaces. The average atomic root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations for heavy atoms of residues 3–80 were 0.40 ± 0.06 Å for the main chain atoms and 0.84 ± 0.05 Å for all atoms. These values indicate that the determined structures were well converged and that the restrained energy-minimized structure could be used as a representative for comparison with those of the wild-type PA c 551and HT c 552. The main chain folding of the quintuple mutant was similar to those of the wild-type PAc 551 and HT c 552 (Fig.3 B; backbone r.m.s. deviation values were 0.84 Å for residues 3–80 of the wild-type PA c 551 and 0.99 Å for residues 3–78 of HT c 552, respectively). This indicates that the introduction of five mutations into PAc 551 does not alter the main chain folding.Table IIStatistics of the 20 structures of the quintuple mutant proteinDistance constraints〈SA〉〈SA〉rNumber of violations > 0.3 Å00r.m.s. deviation from upper bounds (Å)0.016 ± 0.0010.015Angle constraints Number of violations > 5 °00 r.m.s. deviation from upper bounds (degrees)0.102 ± 0.0470.055Energy (kcal/mol) F total182.9 ± 1.8175.31 F NOE20.02 ± 1.317.99 F tor0.077 ± 0.060.018 F vdw8.71 ± 0.729.09r.m.s. deviation from idealized geometry Bonds (Å)0.003 ± 0.0000.0026 Angles (degrees)0.628 ± 0.0070.63 Impropers (degrees)0.938 ± 0.0960.86Atom r.m.s. deviation (Å) 〈SA〉 vs. 〈SA〉r Residue 3–80 main chain atoms0.40 ± 0.06 All heavy atoms0.84 ± 0.05 〈SA〉r vs x-ray coordinates of PA c 551 Residue 3–80 main chain atoms0.84 〈SA〉r vs NMR coordinates of HT c 552 Residue 3–78 main chain atoms of HT c 5520.99〈SA〉 represents the 20 individual structures calculated with the X-PLOR program. 〈SA〉r is the refined structure obtained by energy minimization of the mean structure obtained by simple averaging of the coordinates of the SA structures.

The structure of the quintuple mutant showed that the side chains of the introduced Ala-7 and Met-13 filled a small cavity found in the wild-type (Fig. 4 A). The F7A/V13M mutations in this region also changed the Ile-18 side chain conformation to the favorable gauche plus form from the wild-type gauche minus one (Fig. 4 A). The r.m.s. deviation value for the Ala-7, Met-13, Tyr-27, and Trp-77 heavy chain atoms and the residues 5–20, 25–29, and 75–79 main chain atoms was 1.28 Å when these atoms were superimposed on the corresponding atoms of HTc 552. The two introduced Tyr-34 and Tyr-43 aromatic side chains in the quintuple mutant were adjacent, as found in HTc 552, and suggested to undergo a hydrophobic interaction and/or π−π interaction with one another (Fig.4 B). The r.m.s. deviation value for the heavy atoms of the introduced Tyr-34 and Tyr-43 and the main chain atoms of residues 34–44 in the quintuple mutant was 0.91 Å when these atoms were superimposed on the corresponding atoms of HTc 552. Molecular modeling of PAc 551 with the F34Y mutation predicts that the η oxygen atom of the introduced Tyr-34 forms a hydrogen bond with the guanidyl base of Arg-47; this was also indicated by our previous thermodynamic analysis (1Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear from the NMR data whether an extra hydrogen bond exists in the quintuple mutant, because the guanidyl base of Arg-47 in the mutant was not well defined in the NMR structure. The mutant structure also showed that the introduced Ile-78 filled a cavity around the heme, which was found in the wild-type (Fig.4 C). The r.m.s. deviation value for the Ile-48, Leu-74, Ile-78, and heme heavy atoms and residues 72–80 main chain atoms in the quintuple mutant was 0.91 Å when these atoms were superimposed on the corresponding atoms of HT c 552. These comparisons of side chain interactions in the three mutated regions of the three proteins clearly showed that the regions in the quintuple mutant became more like those in HTc 552. We further evaluated, using the structural data, the effects of the five mutations in the three regions on the total ASA (accessible surface area). The quintuple mutant and HT c 552 in their native states had larger ASA values compared with that of the wild-type PAc 551; this was due to the larger polar ASA (ASApol) value in both cases (TableIII). Thus, undefined hydrophilic and polar groups may be more exposed to the solvent. Consequently, the quintuple mutant and HT c 552 in the native states exhibited greater negative G hN compared with the wild-type PA c 551. The negativeG hN values for these two proteins may contribute to the enhanced stability, which is consistent with the results of recent statistical analyses of proteins from thermophiles (40Gromiha M.M. Oobatake M. Sarai A. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 82: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Table IIIAccessible surface area and hydration free energyProteinASAASApolASAnpΔG hNÅ 2Å 2Å 2kcal/molWild-type PA c-551443419062528−82Quintuple mutant501326532460−167HT c-552537726632714−180ΔG hN was calculated at 298 K. Open table in a new tab ΔG hN was calculated at 298 K. Our successful design of a mesophilic protein is, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of protein stabilization to the level of a natural thermophilic counterpart by means of limited amino acid substitutions (2Bogin O.

The formation of extra side chain interactions and exposure of hydrophilic and polar groups of the quintuple PA c 551 mutant caused the overall elevated stability, which was partly reflected by the increased enthalpy change. The stabilizing strategy for the mutant differed from that in the case of the cold shock protein (43Perl D. Mueller U. Heinemann U. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), in which the protein stabilization was mainly achieved through improvement of the electrostatic interaction on the molecular surface."

Immunofluorescence and immunogold have shown that most of these receptors are located in caveolae (1Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), which are 70–100 nm in diameter membrane domains that collect at actin-rich margins of the cell, and along stress fibers (2Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). PDGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple caveolae proteins but has little effect on the phosphorylation of proteins in noncaveolae membranes (1Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Incubation of caveolae-rich subcellular fractions in the presence of PDGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins and activates Erk1 and Erk2 (3Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Finally, PDGFR phosphorylates epidermal growth factor receptors that are in caveolae and thereby transmodulates the binding of epidermal growth factor to this population of receptors (4Liu P. Anderson R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A major function of caveolae, therefore, is to compartmentalize signal transduction and position PDGFR activation at specific locations on the cell surface (5Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In addition to PDGFR, numerous other signaling pathways appear to be functionally organized in caveolae (6Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). The mechanism that controls the targeting of these molecules to caveolae and organizes their signaling activities is not known. One possibility is that scaffolding protein(s) (7Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar) concentrated in caveolae attract multiple signaling molecules and hold them in the correct configuration during productive receptor stimulation. A candidate molecule is caveolin-1 (8Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many primary and secondary signaling molecules that operate from caveolae are covalently modified with lipids such as myristate, palmitate, and isoprenyl groups (9Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Mutation of the acylation sites in these proteins blocks their ability to concentrate in caveolae (10Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6518-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). This suggests that the lipid environment of the caveolae membrane plays an essential role in attracting and organizing signaling molecules. Even the clustering of epidermal growth factor receptors in caveolae and the subsequent signal transduction by this receptor do not depend on protein-protein interactions with caveolin-1 or other scaffolding proteins (11Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of PDGFR is thought to depend on PDGF-induced dimerization of the receptor followed by the transautophosphorylation of receptor tyrosine residues (12Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine (pY) groups, in turn, attract a variety of adaptors, substrates and enzymes by binding to SH2 domains in these proteins. Many of the SH2-containing proteins also have SH3 domains, which attract additional proteins to the complex that contain proline-rich regions and pleckstrin homology domains. Thus, protein-protein interactions are thought to be the primary driving force for the assembly of a macromolecular complex that controls many different signaling activities in the cell. Little is known about the role of membrane lipids in the assembly or the function of the PDGFR signaling module. Both the structure and the function of caveolae are dependent on cholesterol. Exposure of isolated plasma membranes to cholesterol-binding drugs such as nystatin causes the disassembly of caveolae (13Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). Likewise, cholesterol-depleted cells have fewer invaginated caveolae, and caveolae internalization is reduced (14Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Exposure of living human fibroblasts to the bacterial enzyme cholesterol oxidase selectively converts caveolae cholesterol to cholestenone, which causes caveolin-1 to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus (15Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 16Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochem. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used cholesterol oxidase to chemically convert cholesterol in caveolae to cholestenone and determined how this treatment affects signal transduction by PDGFR. We now report that the introduction of oxidized cholesterol into caveolae membranes potently uncouples the PDGFR from tyrosine kinase substrates. PDGF (BB), PDGFβ receptor pAb, phosphotyrosine mAb, and MAPK (Erk2) mAb were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Activated MAPK pAb was from New England Biolab (Beverly, MA).

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) grown to confluence in 150-mm plates were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin and 10% fetal bovine serum. 20 h before each experiment, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 200 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin. Caveolae were isolated by the method of Smart et al. (18Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent normal human fibroblasts were collected in hypotonic buffer and homogenized with a Dounce apparatus 20 times on ice. Plasma membrane was isolated on a 30% Percoll gradient from post-nuclear supernatant and then sonicated. The sonicated sample was mixed with OptiPrep (final OptiPrep concentration, 23%) in a TH641 tube. A linear 20% to 10% OptiPrep gradient was overlaid on the sample and centrifuged at 52,000 ×g for 90 min at 4 °C. The bottom 1 ml was designated noncaveolae membrane. The top 5 ml was collected and mixed with 4 ml of 50% OptiPrep in a second TH641 tube. 2 ml of 5% OptiPrep was overlaid and the sample centrifuged at 52,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The gradient was fractionated in 0.7-ml fractions. Fraction 3 was designated the caveolae membrane fraction. Seven preparations of caveolae membrane were combined (about 4.9 ml) and mixed with 0.7 ml of assay buffer (10× minimum essential medium, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP) plus 1.4 ml of 5% OptiPrep. 1-ml aliquots were placed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and subjected to the indicated treatments. The reaction was stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and processed for immunoblotting. Cells seeded in 150-mm dishes were grown for 20 h in minimum essential medium plus 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin containing 20 μCi of [3H]palmitate/ml or 30 μCi of [3H]acetic acid/ml. The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). An extraction mixture consisting of 1.2 ml of methanol containing 2% acetic acid and 1.2 ml of chloroform were mixed with 1 ml of sample. The mixture was vortexed three times (10 s each time) and centrifuged for 10 min in a table top centrifuge. The organic phase was collected and dried under nitrogen gas. The sample was redissolved in 40 μl of chloroform, mixed with 5 μg of cold standard and loaded onto a TLC plate. The TLC plate was developed in a solvent system consisting of chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:H2O (10:4:3:2:1 v/v/v/v/v for phospholipids) or petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v for cholesterol). The separated lipids were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by scintillation counting. The cells were washed with ice-cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) for 40 min on ice. The cells were then scrapped into 1.5-ml tubes and vortexed for 3 × 3 s before being spun for 10 min at 12,000 ×g in cold. The supernatant was mixed with 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of preblocked Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 2 h with continuous rotating. The samples were spun at 12,000 ×g for 3 min. The radioactivity in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting, and 4 μg of PDGF receptor pAb was added to equal amounts of radioactivity in the precleared cell lysates. The mixtures were rotated overnight at 4 °C. An additional 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of preblocked Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads was added to the samples, and the rotation was continued for an additional 2 h. The samples were then briefly spun for 20 s, and the beads were washed twice with TETN250 buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and four times with Tris/EDTA (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA) by briefly spinning. The beads were resuspended in 600 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer and processed for lipid extractions and gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford. Caveolae cholesterol concentrations were measured using the colormetric method of Gamble et al. (20Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When isolated caveolae are incubated in the presence of PDGF, multiple caveolar proteins become phosphorylated on tyrosine (3Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We used isolated caveolae fractions, which previously have been shown to be rich in discrete, ∼300-nm-long membrane fragments (18Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), to investigate the role of membrane integrity in this PDGF dependent activity (Fig. 1). Caveolae from normal human fibroblasts were isolated using a detergent-free fractionation procedure. Each fraction was subjected to the indicated treatment, separated by gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with a pY mAb. Initially caveolae contained few tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (lane 1); however, the addition of PDGF for 5 min stimulated the appearance of multiple proteins (lane 2). The ∼190-kDa phosphoprotein band (arrow) contains the PDGFR (1Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). When the caveolae fractions were pretreated with phospholipase C, PDGF still stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates, but the molecular weights of many of these proteins were different (comparelanes 2 and 3). This suggests that the integrity of the phospholipid bilayer influences substrate specificity in caveolae membranes. Pretreatment of caveolae with Triton X-100 at 37 °C completely abolished PDGF-dependent activation of PDGFR (lane 4). Both cholesterol and sphingomyelin are prominent caveolae lipids (21Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To determine the influence of these lipids on PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation, we pretreated caveolae fractions with either cholesterol oxidase or sphingomyelinase (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6). Whereas sphingomyelinase had little effect on the phosphorylation pattern (compare lanes 2 and 6), cholesterol oxidase markedly reduced the intensity of most of the phosphotyrosine mAb reactive bands. The combination of cholesterol oxidase and sphingomyelinase (lane 7) was even more effective at reducing pY mAb staining. Interestingly, cholesterol oxidase had little effect on the staining intensity of the band in the PDGFR region of the gel (arrow), suggesting that the enzyme did not block the ability of PDGF to activate the receptor. To confirm that these enzymes acted on the appropriate caveolae lipids, cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate, and the caveolae were isolated. The caveolae were incubated in the presence of either buffer (Fig. 2, lane 1), phospholipase C (lane 2), cholesterol oxidase (lane 4), or sphingomyelinase (lane 3), and the lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography. Compared with buffer control (lane 1), phospholipase C (lane 2) dramatically reduced phosphatidylethanolamine, PC, sphingomyelin (SM), and gangliosides and increased diacylglycerol. Sphingomyelinase (lane 3) reduced SM and increased ceramide (CM), whereas cholesterol oxidase (lane 4) decreased the amount of label that migrated with the ceramide standard (CM). We determined by direct measurement of cholesterol that exposure of isolated caveolae membranes to cholesterol oxidase caused the caveolae cholesterol levels to fall from 0.31 to 0.09 μg/μg of protein. In separate experiments, we isolated plasma membrane from cells that had been labeled with [3H]cholesterol and incubated these membranes in the presence or absence of cholesterol oxidase. The enzyme oxidized 47.6% of the cholesterol (3.8 × 105disintegrations/min of labeled cholesterol), and all of the product was recovered as cholest-4-en-3-one. The result of this lipid analysis, therefore, indicates that the conversion of cholesterol to cholestenone in caveolae potently uncouples activated PDGFR from multiple tyrosine kinase substrates.Figure 1Effects of cholesterol oxidase on PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Human fibroblasts were cultured for 20 h, and caveolae membranes were isolated and incubated in the presence of either 0.1 unit/ml phospholipase C (PLC), 1% Triton X-100, 1.8 units/ml cholesterol oxidase (CO), or 0.1 unit/ml of sphingomyelinase (SMase) at 37 °C for 1 h before adding 100 ng/ml PDGF for 30 min on ice followed by 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by precipitating the protein with trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with a pY mAb. The arrow indicates the region of the gel that contains the PDGFR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Effects of cholesterol oxidase on the lipid composition of caveolae membranes.

PLC, phospholipase C; SMase, sphingomyelinase; CO, cholesterol oxidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We found that incubation of caveolae in the presence of cholest-4-en-3-one bound to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) also uncoupled PDGFR from tyrosine kinase substrates in vitro (Fig.3). Caveolae fractions were prepared and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence of either buffer (lanes 1 and 2), cholesterol oxidase (lane 3), or 900 μm cholest-4-en-3-one plus 0.2% CD for the indicated times (lanes 4–8). Samples were then either processed directly (lane 1) or stimulated with 100 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min (lanes 2–8) before processing. With time of incubation, cholest-4-en-3-one progressively reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates but had little effect on the phosphorylation of the band in the PDGF receptor region of the gel (arrow). Both cholest-4-en-3-one and cholesterol oxidase were equally effective at 60 min of incubation (compare lanes 3 with 7). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin alone did not affect phosphorylation but was required for the uncoupling effects of cholest-4-en-3-one (data not shown). One way that cholesterol oxidase might be able to uncouple activated PDGFR is by removing the tyrosine kinase substrates from the membrane. Caveolae were isolated, incubated in the presence of cholesterol oxidase, and pelleted by high speed centrifugation. The pellets were separated by gel electrophoresis and processed to detect several caveolae-associated molecules involved in PDGF signaling (Fig.4). Cholesterol oxidase had no effect on the concentration of five different signaling molecules known to participate in PDGFR signaling (compare lanes 1 and2). Two of these molecules, PI 3-kinase and Syp, are known tyrosine kinase substrates. PDGF also did not stimulate the loss of these proteins from cholesterol oxidase-treated caveolae fractions (compare lanes 3 and 4). Another way that cholesterol oxidase could uncouple PDGFR is by causing changes in the organization of the caveolae membrane so that the receptor is no longer able to interact with its partners. We looked for relevant changes by first determining whether any lipids were associated with PDGF receptors. Cells were grown overnight in the presence of [3H]palmitate, and the lipids in either the whole cell or PDGFR immunoprecipitates were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 5). Compared with whole cell lipids (lane 1), PDGFR pAb immunoprecipitates were associated specifically with PC, SM, and gangliosides (compare lanes 1and 4). The same lipids were associated with PDGF receptors immunoprecipitated from cholesterol-depleted cells (lane 5). By contrast, none of these lipids were present in PDGFR immunoprecipitates after the cells had been incubated in the presence of cholesterol oxidase for 30 min at room temperature (lane 6). The PDGFR immunoprecipitates from untreated cells were also rich in cholesterol (Fig. 6, 0 min). There was a ∼70% drop in receptor-associated cholesterol, however, after a 2-min incubation in the presence of PDGF (2 min) and the amount of cholesterol continued to decline during a 30-min incubation. Interestingly, exposure of cells to PDGF for 15 min (Fig.7) markedly blunted the ability of cholesterol oxidase to remove PC and SM from PDGFR immunoprecipitates (compare lanes 2 and 4). Pretreatment of cells with CD to deplete cellular cholesterol had the same effect (data not shown). These results suggest that the association of cholesterol with PDGFR influences how PC, SM, and gangliosides interact with the receptor.Figure 7PDGF blunts the effects of cholesterol oxidase on loss of PDGFR-associated lipids. Normal human fibroblasts were labeled with [3H]palmitate. The cells were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 100 ng/ml PDGF for 15 min at 37 °C before treating with 1.8 units/ml cholesterol oxidase for 30 min at 25 °C. The cells were then processed as described in the legend to Fig. 5. CO, cholesterol oxidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We used cell fractionation to determine how cholesterol oxidase affected PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of caveolae substrates in intact cells (Fig. 8). Confluent, serum-starved, human fibroblasts were chilled to 20 °C to slow cholesterol traffic (22DeGrella R.F. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14256-14262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then incubated in the presence (lanes 3–6) or absence (lanes 1 and2) of cholesterol oxidase for the indicated time. One set of cells was analyzed directly (lanes 1, 3, and5), whereas the other was stimulated with PDGF (lanes 2, 4, and 6). Caveolae from each set of cells were isolated and processed for immunoblotting. Cholesterol oxidase alone had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolae proteins (compare lanes 3 and 5 with lane 1). Incubation of untreated cells in the presence of PDGF caused a robust phosphorylation of both the band in the PDGFR region of the gel (lane 2, arrow) and multiple tyrosine kinase substrates. As little as a 10-min pretreatment with cholesterol oxidase markedly reduced PDGF-stimulated substrate phosphorylation but had little effect on the phosphorylation of the PDGFR band (arrow, compare lanes 4 and 6 withlane 2). A longer exposure to cholesterol oxidase had the same effect (lanes 5 and 6). Just as we found for isolated caveolae, therefore, cholesterol oxidase appears to uncouple the PDGFR from tyrosine kinase substrates in caveolae. Cholest-4-en-3-one also uncoupled PDGFR phosphorylation of caveolae substrates in living cells (Fig. 9). Cells were incubated in the presence of 900 μmcholest-4-en-3-one in the presence (lane 7) or absence (lane 5) of 0.2% methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 1 h before PDGF was added to the dish. Cells were then assayed for tyrosine phosphorylated proteins by immunoblotting. Compared with PDGF alone (lane 2), cholest-4-en-3-one plus CD potently blocked substrate phosphorylation (lane 7). Cholesterol (900 μm) plus CD had little effect on phosphorylation (lane 6). Cholest-4-en-3-one worked more effectively when CD was present (compare lanes 7 and 5). In addition, the effect of cholest-4-en-3-one on suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation (pMAPK) was concentration-dependent (Fig.10).Figure 10Dose-dependent inhibition of PDGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation by cholestenonein vivo. Human fibroblasts were incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated concentration of cholest-4-en-3-one plus 0.2% CD at 37 °C before adding 100 ng/ml of PDGF to the dish for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were solubilized, and the proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with pY mAb and pMAPK pAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cholesterol oxidase had no effect on the association of signaling molecules with caveolae (Fig. 11). Serum-starved fibroblasts were either not treated (lanes 1and 3) or incubated in the presence of cholesterol oxidase for 1 h at 37 °C (lanes 2 and 4). One set of cells was then stimulated with PDGF (lanes 3 and4). Cholesterol oxidase caused a decline in the amount of caveolin-1 in these fractions, which is consistent with previous studies showing that these conditions cause a loss of caveolin-1 from the cell surface (15Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). By contrast, cholesterol oxidase only had minor effects on the concentration of five different signaling molecules commonly found in caveolae (compare lanes 1 and2), nor did it block the PDGF-dependent recruitment of proteins like Dok, PI 3-kinase, and Shc (comparelanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and2). To be sure that oxidized sterols had no effect on activation of the PDGFR, we used immunoprecipitation to isolate PDGFR and then immunoblotted the receptor with pY mAb (Fig.12). Untreated cells (lanes 1 and 2) or cells exposed to either cholesterol oxidase (lane 3) or cholest-4-en-3-one (lane 4) were incubated in the presence (lanes 2–4) or absence (lane 1) of PDGF before processing for immunoblotting. Neither cholesterol oxidase nor cholest-4-en-3-one had any effect on the level of PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. We have found that the presence of cholest-4-en-3-one in caveolae uncouples activated PDGFR kinase from the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, thereby interfering with PDGFR signal transduction. Unsaturated fatty acids (23Tomaska L. Resnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5317-5322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and gangliosides (24Yates A.J. Saqr H.E. Van Brocklyn J. J. Neurooncol. 1995; 24: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) also block PDGFR signaling but do so by inhibiting receptor autophosphorylation. We saw no diminution of PDGFR autophosphorylation. Either treatment with cholesterol oxidase or introduction of cholest-4-en-3-one into caveolae membranes uncoupled receptors, and these effects were seen bothin vitro and in vivo. It appears, therefore, that oxidized cholesterol prevents molecular interactions that are necessary for PDGF to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of nonreceptor proteins in caveolae. Caveolae are a cell surface location where the PDGFR and associated proteins are naturally organized in quiescent, normal human fibroblasts (1Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The effect of cholest-4-en-3-one apparently is to disrupt this organization. The isolated caveolae fractions used in these experiments are composed of discrete membrane units, and we found no evidence that cholest-4-en-3-one either disrupted membrane integrity or caused a loss of the proteins that normally become phosphorylated in response to PDGF. The mechanism of signal transduction by PDGFR involves both the direct and the indirect tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins (12Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of cholest-4-en-3-one most likely are not due to inhibiting nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Src, Fyn, and Yes because they appear not to be required for PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (25Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). We conclude, therefore, that cholest-4-en-3-one works by interfering with the ability of activated receptor to interact with multiple partners even though the molecules involved remain in close proximity and confined to the caveola compartment. Apparently the protein-protein interactions that drive the assembly of the macromolecular, PDGFR signaling complex (26Claesson-Welsh L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 37-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) cannot occur in a lipid environment containing oxidized sterols. Cholesterol oxidase affects the output from other signaling pathways. Linkage of the insulin receptor to the phosphorylation of the mitochondrial enzyme ATP citrate-lyase is markedly inhibited by cholesterol oxidase (27Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.E. Stralfors P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) in adipocytes. Interestingly, in these cells the insulin receptor appears to be preferentially located in invaginated caveolae (27Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.E. Stralfors P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), as it does in H35 hepatoma cells (28Smith R.M. Jarett L. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cholesterol oxidase also blocks the activity of a Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase found in isolated synaptic plasma membranes (29Luu B. Moog C. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1317-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, cholesterol oxidase diverts endothelin receptor type A from caveolae to clathrin coated pits (30Verhagen J.C. ter Braake P. Teunissen J. van Ginkel G. Sevanian A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1488-1502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These effects are not likely due to the nonspecific binding of cholesterol oxidase to cell membranes (31Wood W.G. Igbavboa U. Rao A.M. Schroeder F. Avdulov N.A. Brain Res. 1995; 683: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, introduction of cholest-4-en-3-one into surface membranes has widespread effects on signal transduction. The ability of cholest-4-en-3-one to uncouple PDGFR from its partners was not due to a loss of caveolin-1 from caveolae (15Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) because the same effects were observed both in vitro and in vivo. Rather, we think cholest-4-en-3-one alters the lipid environment of PDGFR, thereby preventing appropriate protein-protein interactions. PDGFR immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells contained cholesterol, PC, SM, and gangliosides (Fig. 5). The association of these lipids with the receptor was markedly reduced by cholesterol oxidase treatment, which suggests that cholest-4-en-3-one causes the PDGFR to lose essential boundary lipids (32Owicki J.C. Springgate M.W. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1616-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Owicki J.C. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4750-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins surround themselves with an annulus of lipid predominantly composed of lipid species that interact best with the protein (34Gil T. Ipsen J.H. Mouritsen O.G. Sabra M.C. Sperotto M.M. Zuckermann M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These boundary lipids may be necessary for activated receptors to interact with partners. Alternatively, the substitution of cholest-4-en-3-one for cholesterol may decrease the thickness of the phospholipid bilayer or reduce protein-lipid interactions, thereby forcing portions of the protein into a more hydrophilic environment (35Lau W.F. Das N.P. Experientia. 1995; 51: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Studies with model membranes also suggest that cholesterol oxidase causes a lateral expansion of the lipid bilayer leading to increased membrane permeability (31Wood W.G. Igbavboa U. Rao A.M. Schroeder F. Avdulov N.A. Brain Res. 1995; 683: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Even without knowing the exact mechanism, these results imply that the protein components of signaling modules that operate from caveolae cannot engage in productive signal transduction without the proper lipid environment. The cholesterol-sphingolipid-rich lipid composition of caveolae imparts special physical properties to these domains. Experiments with model membranes suggest that these lipids are in a liquid order phase where the acyl chains of the sphingolipids together with cholesterol are tightly packed (36Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). Caveolae lipids, therefore, are tightly packed into membrane platforms that act as lipid scaffolds for organizing interactions between multiple signaling molecules at the cell surface.

Further deletion of the EF hands resulted in a constitutively active enzyme, suggesting that sequences in or near the EF hands are sufficient for autoinhibition.

These DGKs also have a domain at their N termini with homology to the recoverin family of neuronal calcium sensors (Fig. 1). We term this the recoverin homology (RVH) domain.

Brain Res. 1992; 16: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have studied DGKα, a Ca2+-activated isoform highly expressed in oligodendrocytes and thymocytes. They have shown that Ca2+binds the EF hand region of the enzyme and that deletion of the EF hands results in constitutive enzyme activation (19Sakane F. Imai S. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Sakane F. Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have now examined a series of DGKα mutants in which the RVH and EF hand domains are sequentially deleted. Our results indicate that the N-terminal RVH domain is required for Ca2+ to activate this enzyme. In contrast to the constitutive activation seen with deletion of the EF hands, DGKs with deletions involving only the RVH domain expressed activity similar to that of wild-type enzyme in the absence of Ca2+. Sites within both the EF hands and RVH domain were protected from trypsin proteolysis by Ca2+, indicating that both domains participate in a Ca2+-induced conformational change. A cationic amphiphile, octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride, markedly stimulated DGKα activity in vitro. This effect, like Ca2+-dependent activation, was dependent on the RVH domain. The DGKα RVH domain does not itself bind Ca2+. However, it does appear to function together with the EF hands to couple Ca2+ binding to release of EF hand-mediated autoinhibition of DGKα.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by our campus biotechnology facility. DGKα-pBluescript II (SK+), pSRE-DGKα, and pSRE-DGKα Δ196 were provided by Drs. F. Sakane and H. Kanoh (19Sakane F. Imai S. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Sakane F. Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To prepare the DGKα Δ40 and Δ87 mutants, PCR amplification was performed using DGK α-pBluescript II (SK+) as a template. Sense primers (d40, 5′-GCGAATTCCACCATGGCTGAATATCTCCAAGGA-3′ and d87, 5′-GCGAATTCCACCATGGTAAAAAGAGATGTGGT-3′, EcoRI sites underlined) were designed based on the peptide sequences MAEYLNG (positions 39–45) and TVKRDVV (positions 87–93). Nucleotide substitutions were introduced to create the initiation codon and Kozak consensus sequence. An antisense primer (a1, 5′-CTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGG-3′) was from pBluescript II SK+. Amplification reactions were carried out using d40 plus a1 or d87 plus a1 under the following condition: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min for 25 cycles, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI and cloned into pUC19. Fragments containing DGKα and the mutant sequences were subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). To facilitate quantitation of expression, a FLAG-epitope tag was introduced at C terminus of DGKα. Primers (s-nhe1, 5′-CGAATTCTGGACATCGGCTAGCCAAGT-3′,NheI site underlined; and a-flag1, 5′-GGCTGCAGTCAGCCTGGTCCCTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCCCTCCGCACAGAAGCCAAAG-3′, stop codon underlined) were designed to amplify a FLAG-tagged DGKα fragment. PCR amplification was performed at 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for a total of 25 cycles with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified fragment was cloned into pBluescript KS+. This construct was digested with NheI and XhoI, and theNheI-XhoI fragment was inserted into DGKα-pCDNA3 in place of a 460-base pairNheI-XhoI fragment at the DGK C terminus, positions 2031–2491. The FLAG epitope was similarly inserted into the truncated DGKα constructs. COS-1 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B. Transfection of COS-1 cells was performed by the calcium-phosphate method (22Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in ice-cold 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 50 μm ATP, and 0.02% Triton X-100. After removal of undisrupted cells by brief centrifugation, the lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g (Beckman TL-100) for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet membranes. The resultant supernatants were rapidly frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −70 °C until assayed. For immunodetection, 5–10 μg of the 100,000 ×g supernatants of lysates from COS-1 cells transiently expressing DGKα or the truncation mutants was applied to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking in TBS-T buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:2000 in TBS-T) for 1 h. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution in TBS-T) for 30 min. After washing 4 times in TBS-T buffer, the horseradish peroxidase conjugates were detected by chemiluminescence. Sequences corresponding to conserved domains in the DGKα regulatory region were prepared as GST fusions in Escherichia coli. DNA fragments expressing the selected sequences were prepared by PCR amplification using DGKα-pCDNA3 as a template. Amplification reactions were run at 94 °C for 45 s, 49 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 150 s for a total of 28 cycles with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. Primers GSTN-1 (5′-TGAATTCCAAGGAGAGGGGGCTG-3′) and GSTC-1 (5′-ACTCGAGTCATTTGTCTTCTGGCCGGCCG-3′) amplified DGKα:2-110, which encompasses the RVH domain. Primers GSTN-2 (5′-TGAATTCCTGCTA CTTCTCCCTTC-3′) and GSTC-2 (5′-ACTCGAGTCAATTGTCCTTCAAGGTC-3′) amplified DGKα:99-202, which encompasses the EF hands. Primers GSTN-3 (5′-AGAATTCCTTGAAGGACAATGGGCA-3′) and GSTC-3 (5′-TCTCGAGTCAACTGGGATAGATGGAAG-3′) amplified DGKα:198-336, which encompasses the C1 domains. Primers GSTN-1/GSTC-2, GSTN-1/GSTC-3, and GSTN-2/GSTC-3 were used to amplify DGKα:2-202, DGKα:2-336, and DGKα:99-336, respectively. The DNA fragments were inserted into the PCRblunt vector and sequenced. They were then digested withEcoRI and XhoI and inserted into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All insertions were in frame with GST. The GST-fused DGKα-pGEX-4T-3 constructs were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Tranformed cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to anA 600 nm of 0.8 and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C or overnight at 25 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mmsucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF by two passes through a French press. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The GST fusions were then purified to apparent homogeneity by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. When removal of the GST moiety was desired, the recombinant protein adhering to the glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with 2 IU thrombin per mg of protein at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was then collected and incubated withp-aminobenzamidine-agarose at 1:100, v/v ratio for 1 h to remove the thrombin. The resultant supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm DTT. Aliquots were rapidly frozen and stored at −80 °C. The standard DGK assay contained in volume of 200 μl the following: 1 mm sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm triethanolamine·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (100 cpm/pmol), 20 μm sn-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol (16:0, 18:1 DAG), 1 mm DTT, and enzyme (11Walsh J.P. Suen R. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28647-28653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Jiang Y. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Walsh J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In a typical reaction, an appropriate volume of DAG stock solution (10–20 mm in CHCl3) was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen in a 16 × 100-mm glass test tube. To the DAG droplet were added the following: 50 μl of 4× assay buffer, 50 μl of 4× detergent, DTT, water, and enzyme to a final volume of 180 μl. Stock solutions of 4× sodium deoxycholate, 10× [γ-32P]ATP, and 4× aqueous buffer were as described previously (21Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by adding 20 μl of 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 25 °C and terminated by the addition of 3.0 ml of CHCl3/ethanol (2:1 v/v) containing 1.0 mg dihexadecylphosphate and 1.0 mg of sorbitan trioleate. The organic phase was washed 3 times with 2.0 ml of 1.0% HClO4 and 0.1% H3PO4 in H2O/ethanol (4:1, v/v). The volume of the final organic phase was 2.25 ml. Cerenkov counting 1.2 ml of this organic phase determined incorporation of 32P into PA. For some assays, mixed micelles of octyl glucoside and phosphatidylserine (PS) were employed instead of deoxycholate. In these assays, the total concentration of micelle components, octyl glucoside + PS + DAG, was maintained at 25 mm. Total octyl glucoside added to the assays was the sum of micellar and monomeric octyl glucoside, which was calculated as described (24Clint J.H. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday I. 1975; 71: 1327-1334Crossref Google Scholar). For purposes of these calculations, the critical micelle concentration of octyl glucoside was assumed to be 25 mm. The DAG concentration in these assays was 0.5 mm (2 mol %). Other assay components were unchanged. When Ca2+ was added to assays, the buffer contained 1 mm EDTA instead of EGTA, and the free Mg2+ was maintained at 1 mm. The total Mg2+ and Ca2+ added were calculated using published stability constants to give the desired levels of free cations (25Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other assays employing Triton and OTAC or Triton and C16SB instead of deoxycholate have been described previously (23Jiang Y. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Walsh J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All data reported are averages of at least duplicate determinations that agreed within 10% in all cases. Moreover, all results are representative of two or more independent experiments performed with completely independent enzyme preparations. Calcium binding was assessed by the 45Ca overlay method of Maruyama et al. (26Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). 1 μg of recombinant proteins or immunoprecipitated DGKα truncation mutants were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was washed free of Ca2+ in 75 ml of 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.0. It was rinsed three times with 10 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 60 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, and then incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in 30 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 250 nm45CaCl2 (1 μCi/ml). The membrane was then rinsed twice with 45% ethanol, blotted dry, and exposed to x-ray film. The nitrocellulose was stained with Amido Black to verify protein transfer. To prepare immunoprecipitates of the DGKα truncation mutants for these experiments, COS-1 cells transfected with DGKα or the truncation mutants were extracted with buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm ATP, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF. The extract was precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads to eliminate nonspecific binding. Anti-FLAG antibody was then added together with fresh protein A/G-agarose beads, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was washed with the above buffer containing only 0.1% Triton X-100, and the bound proteins were eluted into SDS reducing buffer. Recombinant GST-DGKα:2-202, which includes the RVH and EF hand domains, was expressed in E. coli, and the GST moiety removed as described above. Limited trypsin proteolysis was performed as described by Rudnicka-Nawrot et al. (27Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The reaction contained, in a volume 150 μl, 0.6 mg/ml (90 μg) of DGKα:2-202, 50 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 0.1 mm EGTA. The reaction was initiated by adding 1 μg of trypsin and incubating at 37 °C. Samples (18 μl) were withdrawn at various times and quenched by adding 2 μl of 1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To examine the effect of OTAC on proteolysis, the reaction mixture was supplemented with 0.4 mm Triton X-100, 0.4 mmTriton X-114, and 0.2 mm OTAC (20 mol %), and the trypsin concentration was halved. The Triton mixture was added together with the OTAC to simulate the conditions under which maximal activity stimulation is observed (11Walsh J.P. Suen R. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28647-28653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Jiang Y. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Walsh J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 and Triton X-114 were also included in the control reactions. Peptides from selected time points of the trypsin digests were analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using an ABI 140D solvent delivery system. Samples (5 μl, 2.7 μg of protein) were injected directly into 300-μm inner diameter fused silica capillaries packed with C18 resin (Vydac). The columns were eluted with a 60-min, 2–95% gradient of acetonitrile in H2O containing 0.2% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% acetic acid, and 0.001% trifluoroacetic acid. The solvent flow rate was 7 μl/min. The column was eluted directly into the electrospray ionization source of a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer. Nitrogen was used as the sheath gas at 35 pounds/square inch, and no auxiliary gas was used. Electrospray ionization was conducted with a spray voltage of 4.8 kV, a capillary voltage of 26 V, and a capillary temperature of 200 °C. Spectra were scanned over an m/z range of 200–2000. Base peak ions were trapped using the quadrupole ion trap and further analyzed both with a high resolution scan performed at an isolation width of 3m/z and with collision-induced dissociation scans at a collision energy of 40.0. Sequences of all eluting peptides were confirmed on the collision-induced dissociation scans. Ion currents atm/z ratios corresponding to the peptide fragments were integrated over the entire peak using Finnigan Bioworks software provided with the mass spectrometer. Calcium-dependent binding of recombinant DGKα:2-202 (RVH domain + EF hands, GST cleaved off) and DGKα:99-202 (EF hands only, GST cleaved off) to phenyl-Sepharose was assayed by a modification of the procedure of Landar et al.(28Landar A. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Zimer D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17429-17438Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 240 μg of recombinant polypeptide in a total volume of 0.5 ml was loaded onto 1 ml of phenyl-Sepharose columns in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and either 10 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA. The columns were eluted with 4 ml of the same buffer, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Purification of DGK activities from testis cytosol, salivary cytosol, NIH 3T3 cells (two activities), thymus cytosol, and testis membranes has been described (23Jiang Y. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Walsh J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Calcium stimulated the activities from testis cytosol, salivary cytosol, and one of the 3T3 activities (23Jiang Y. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Walsh J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Methods used for expression of DGK activities in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have also been described (23Jiang Y. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Walsh J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of enzyme preparations were determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Thin layer chromatography of DAG and PA was as described previously (21Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Concentrations of phospholipids used in DGK assays were confirmed by determination of organic phosphate (30Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein sequences with homology to the DGKα N terminus were identified by PSI BLAST searches and aligned using ClustalX (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar, 32Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Structural features of proteins with homology to DGKs were visualized using RasMol 2.6 (33Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). Regulatory domains of Ca2+-activated DGKs contain several conserved regions. These include EF hands and tandem C1 PKC homology domains (8Kanoh H. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Cell Signal. 1993; 5: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). EF hand-containing DGKs also contain a 70-amino acid conserved sequence at their N termini (34Goto K. Funayama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Motif searches revealed that this domain is related to the recoverin family of neuronal calcium sensors (Fig. 1). We thus refer to this region as the RVH domain. The homology between DGKs and neuronal calcium sensors extends through the EF hands (Fig. 1). To investigate the role of the RVH domain in DGKα regulation, a series of N-terminal deletion mutants was prepared (Fig.2). DGKα Δ40 lacks the first half of the RVH domain and DGKα Δ87 lacks the entire RVH region. DGKα Δ196 lacks both the RVH domain and the EF hands. A FLAG epitope attached to the C termini facilitated detection and quantification of protein expression. These mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells. Cytosol from COS-1 cells expressing DGKα or the deletion mutants showed a marked increase in DGK activity as compared with control cells transfected with vector only. The mutant activities were stable in cell lysates but were only partially recoverable from DEAE-cellulose or Mono Q columns. The 100,000 × g supernatants of COS-1 lysates were thus used for all studies. The presence of protein products with the expected molecular masses was verified by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Densitometry of the immunoblots indicated that DGKα Δ40, DGKα Δ87, and DGKα Δ196 were expressed at 1/4th, 1/4th, and 1/8th the level of wild-type DGKα. COS-1 cells express an endogenous DGK activity. Transfected cells all expressed activities at least 20-fold over this background. After subtraction of the COS-1 background and normalization for expression, the specific activities of DGKα Δ40 and DGKα Δ87, which lack RVH domains, were not significantly different from wild-type enzyme (TableI). However, deletion of the EF hands (DGKα Δ196) resulted in an 18-fold increase in specific activity. Similar results were obtained in both the deoxycholate and octyl glucoside/PS assays. All of the constructs were activated 5–10-fold as the surface concentration of PS in octyl glucoside micelles was increased from 10 to 20 mol % (Table I). As discussed below, the Δ40, Δ87, and Δ196 mutant activities were also activated by OTAC and C16SB similarly to several Ca2+-independent DGKs. To obtain further evidence that the mutants express DGK activity, we also expressed the truncated DGKs in S. cerevisiae. All of the mu"
https://openalex.org/W1996520665,"The transcriptional induction ofSPRR1B by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is mainly mediated by the first -152-base pair 5′-flanking region containing two functional AP-1 sites. In this study, we have analyzed the signaling pathways that mediate the induction in tracheobronchial epithelial cells. PKC inhibitor ablated PMA-stimulated expression of endogenousSPRR1B and reporter gene expression driven bySPRR1B promoter. PKC activator promoted the transcription. The dominant negative protein kinase Cδ (dn-PKCδ) and rottlerin (PKCδ inhibitor) completely suppressed PMA-stimulated promoter activity. dn-Ras or dn-MEKK1 inhibited PMA-stimulated promoter activity, while their corresponding constitutively active mutants augmented it. dn-c-Raf-1 did not have any effect on reporter gene expression. Since MEKK1 activates multiple parallel pathways, we examined involvement of JNK/SAPK, p38, and MKK1 in promoter regulation. Co-expression of the dominant negative forms of MKK4, MKK7, JNK/SAPK, MKK3, MKK6, or p38α did not suppress PMA-stimulated reporter gene expression. However, MKK1 inhibitors UO126 and PD98095 suppressed gene expression. Consistent with this, expression of dn-MKK1 strongly suppressed PMA-stimulated promoter activity, while the constitutively active MKK1 augmented it. However, MKK1-mediated induction ofSPRR1B probably does not depend on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, suggesting the requirement of another kinase(s). dn-c-Jun mutants abolished PMA-stimulated expression supporting an important role for AP-1 proteins in SPRR1Bexpression. Together, these results suggest that a PKCδ/Ras/MEKK1/MKK1-dependent/AP-1 pathway regulates the PMA-inducible expression of the SPRR1B in tracheobronchial epithelial cells. The transcriptional induction ofSPRR1B by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is mainly mediated by the first -152-base pair 5′-flanking region containing two functional AP-1 sites.

The dominant negative protein kinase Cδ (dn-PKCδ) and rottlerin (PKCδ inhibitor) completely suppressed PMA-stimulated promoter activity. dn-Ras or dn-MEKK1 inhibited PMA-stimulated promoter activity, while their corresponding constitutively active mutants augmented it. dn-c-Raf-1 did not have any effect on reporter gene expression. Since MEKK1 activates multiple parallel pathways, we examined involvement of JNK/SAPK, p38, and MKK1 in promoter regulation. Co-expression of the dominant negative forms of MKK4, MKK7, JNK/SAPK, MKK3, MKK6, or p38α did not suppress PMA-stimulated reporter gene expression. However, MKK1 inhibitors UO126 and PD98095 suppressed gene expression. Consistent with this, expression of dn-MKK1 strongly suppressed PMA-stimulated promoter activity, while the constitutively active MKK1 augmented it. However, MKK1-mediated induction ofSPRR1B probably does not depend on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, suggesting the requirement of another kinase(s). dn-c-Jun mutants abolished PMA-stimulated expression supporting an important role for AP-1 proteins in SPRR1Bexpression. Together, these results suggest that a PKCδ/Ras/MEKK1/MKK1-dependent/AP-1 pathway regulates the PMA-inducible expression of the SPRR1B in tracheobronchial epithelial cells. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate constitutively active chloramphenicol acetyltransferase dominant negative extracellular regulated kinase E-26 transformation specific c-Jun N-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated protein kinase tracheobronchial epithelial bisindolylmaleimide I indolactam V base pair(s) protein kinase C mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase transactivation domain DNA-binding domain leucine zipper domain glutathione S-transferase cornified envelope The expression of squamous cell function in the respiratory tract epithelium is a phenomenon that is frequently associated with injury caused by various environmental pollutants, such as phorbol ester PMA,1 tobacco smoke, and carcinogens (1Pfeifer A.M.

Physiol. 1990; 259: L38-L46PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies and others have demonstrated a close relationship between early induction of human small proline-rich protein type I (SPRR1) and squamous cell differentiation in airway epithelium (for a review, see Ref. 3Tesfaigzi J. Carlson D.M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 243-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SPRR1(now referred to as SPRR1B or cornifin) was originally identified as a vitamin A-suppressed gene from TBE cells (4An G. Huang T.H. Tesfaigzi J. Garcia-Heras J. Ledbetter D.H. Carlson D.M. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Vitamin A, which plays an important role in maintaining mucous cell differentiation, suppresses induction of squamous cell differentiation in TBE cells (5Wu R. Zhao Y.H. Chang M.M. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2398-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast to squamous tissues, such as esophagus, tongue, and skin, which contain higher levels of SPRR1B message, the presence of SPRR1B message level is very low in respiratory tract epithelia that normally express mucociliary functions (3Tesfaigzi J. Carlson D.M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 243-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4An G. Huang T.H. Tesfaigzi J. Garcia-Heras J. Ledbetter D.H. Carlson D.M. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, a variety of agents that promote squamous differentiation of TBE cells, such as phorbol ester PMA, vitamin A deprivation, tobacco smoke, and carcinogens rapidly induce SPRR1B message levels (3Tesfaigzi J. Carlson D.M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 243-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Previously, we have demonstrated a rapid increase of SPRR1Bproducts (mRNA and protein) in cultured human and monkey TBE cells (4An G. Huang T.H. Tesfaigzi J. Garcia-Heras J. Ledbetter D.H. Carlson D.M. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This increase can be reduced, mainly at a post-transcriptional level, by supplementing the culture medium with vitamin A or its synthetic retinoids (6An G. Tesfaigzi J. Carlson D.M. Wu R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Tesfaigzi J. Carlson D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PMA (4An G. Huang T.H. Tesfaigzi J. Garcia-Heras J. Ledbetter D.H. Carlson D.M. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and tobacco smoke (8Tesfaigzi J. Th'ng J. Hotchkiss J.A. Harkema J.R. Wright P.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Wu, unpublished data. which potently induce airway squamous differentiation, induce SPRR1Bexpression mainly at the transcription level. However, the molecular and cellular pathways regulating expression of SPRR1B in airway epithelial cells are not clearly understood. SPRR1B belongs to a multigene family consisting of twoSPRR1 genes (SPRR1A and -1B), sevenSPRR2 genes (SPRR2A to -2F), and oneSPRR3 gene, which is located on chromosome 1q21, now termed as an epidermal differentiation locus (9Mischke D. Korge B.P. Marenholz I. Volz A. Ziegler A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 989-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). These genes encode small molecular weight proteins exceptionally rich in proline, cysteine, and glutamate and were first identified as inducible gene products in human keratinocyte cultures after UV irradiation and PMA treatment (10Gibbs S. Fijneman R. Wiegant J. van Kessel A.G. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Hohl D. de Viragh P.A. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).SPRRsare differentially expressed in the suprabasal epithelial cell layer of various squamous tissues (3Tesfaigzi J. Carlson D.M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 243-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SPRRs are cross-linked to themselves and/or to other cornified envelope (CE) precursor proteins such as loricrin and involucrin and play an important role in modulation of biochemical properties of squamous tissues, depending upon their physical requirements and function (12Steinert P.M. Candi E. Kartasova T. Marekov L. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The terminal phenotype of squamous differentiation is the formation of a CE catalyzed by transglutaminase to form an insoluble mesh, which plays an important role in barrier function (13Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4247-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated the actual participation of SPRR1B in the cornification of TBE cells (14Deng J. Pan R. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5739-5747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the exact functional role(s) of SPRR1B in the induction of terminal squamous differentiation of TBE cells is unclear.SPRR1B is also expressed in other nonsquamous cells, such as mammary epithelium (15Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 526-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Chinese hamster ovary (16Tesfaigzi J. Carlson D.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and smooth-muscle cells (17Koizumi H. Kartasova T. Tanaka H. Ohkawara A. Kuroki T. Br. J. Dermatol. 1996; 134: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that it might play yet unidentified role(s) besides its involvement in cell cornification. SPRRs have two exons separated by a single intron (10Gibbs S. Fijneman R. Wiegant J. van Kessel A.G. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The first exon of SPRRs contains the 5′-untranslated region, while the second exon contains the complete coding region and the 3′-untranslated region in a manner similar to that found in other genes such as involucrin and loricrin (18Gandarillas A. Watt F.M. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The first 152-bp 5′-flanking region of the SPRR1B reveals overall ∼50% identity to the mouse counterpart (19An G. Tesfaigzi J. Chuu Y.J. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10977-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reddy S.P. Konkin T. Wu R. Gene (Amst. ). 1998; 224: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, there is a high degree of identity (>75%) in the promoter sequences and positions at the TATA box, Ets binding site, and AP-1 sites. Recently, Sark et al. (21Sark M.W. Fischer D.F. de Meijer E. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24683-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) isolated the genomic clone of human SPRR1A and demonstrated that the first 152-bp 5′-flanking region contains functional motifs, such as a TATA box, Ets, and an AP-1 site, in identical locations as found in the human SPRR1B promoter. Moreover, both Ets and AP-1 sites are critical for PMA-stimulatedSPRR1A gene regulation in human keratinocytes (21Sark M.W. Fischer D.F. de Meijer E. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24683-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have also observed that PMA stimulates SPRR1A mRNA levels and promoter activity in human TBE cells (data not shown). Previously, we have demonstrated that the treatment of TBE cells with PMA stimulates the expression of the SPRR1B mainly at the transcriptional level (19An G. Tesfaigzi J. Chuu Y.J. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10977-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By in vivo footprinting, deletion, and site-directed mutation analysis, we have demonstrated that the −152 to +12 bp promoter region contains two functional AP-1 sites that are required for both basal and PMA-enhancedSPRR1B promoter regulation (22Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26451-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, AP-1 proteins, such as c-Jun, bind to these sites (22Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26451-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the cellular signaling pathways that regulate PMA-stimulatedSPRR1B expression in TBE cells. We show that PMA-stimulatedSPRR1B expression and promoter regulation is mainly mediated by PKCδ/Ras/MEKK1/MKK1-dependent/AP-1 signal transduction pathway. Interestingly, ERK1/2 are not required for this process. Bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM), indolactam V (IND), genistein, PD98059, SB202190, Go6956, and PMA were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). U0126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Dominant negative Ras (Ras-N17) was generated by introducing a point mutation at the 17-position of the Ha-Ras and then cloned into kRSPA vector with a Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Constitutively active Ras (Ha-Ras-V12) was generated as described previously (23Kumar C.C. Prorock-Rogers C. Kelly J. Dong Z. Lin J.J. Armstrong L. Kung H.F. Weber M.J. Afonso A.

HumanSPRR1B promoter and its mutants fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene had been described previously (22Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26451-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have used the −152 to +12 bp SPRR1B promoter cloned into CAT reporter vector and abbreviated as 152-SPRR1B-CAT3 throughout. The normal human TBE cell line, BEAS-2B (subclone S6), immortalized by SV40-T antigen was obtained from J. F. Lechner. This cell line (passages between 22 and 30) was maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a serum-free hormone-supplemented medium as described previously (22Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26451-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with the following growth factors: transferrin (5 μg/ml; Sigma), insulin (5 μg/ml; Sigma), cholera toxin (20 ng/ml; Lists, Campbell, CA), bovine pituitary extract (20 μg/ml; Pel-Freez Biologicals, Arkansas), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml; Sigma), and epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The medium was also supplemented with 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), penicillin and streptomycin (60 units/ml), gentamycin (12.5 μg/ml), and fungizone (60 ng/ml). DNA transfections were performed using a Fugene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were grown on 12-well plates at 70–80% confluence and then transfected with 0.4 μg of promoter construct, 0.1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase (β-gal) DNA, and 0.1–0.8 μg of empty or expression plasmid vectors. After 18–20 h post-transfection, cells were treated with either Me2SO (vehicle control) or PMA (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Where indicated, cells were treated for 30 min with appropriate kinase inhibitors prior to PMA. Cells were lysed, and CAT expression was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The β-galactosidase activity was monitored as described previously (22Reddy S.P. Chuu Y.J. Lao P.N. Donn J. Ann D.K. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26451-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CAT activity of individual samples was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. For Northern blots, equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg/lane) were subjected to electrophoresis, transblotted onto Nytran membranes, and hybridized with 32P-labeled monkey SPRR1B cDNA probe as described previously (4An G. Huang T.H. Tesfaigzi J. Garcia-Heras J. Ledbetter D.H. Carlson D.M. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hybridized filters were washed and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. x-ray film. Membranes were stripped and rehybridized with 32P-labeled 18 S RNA cDNA probe. TBE cells were cultured to 70–80% confluency and treated with PMA (100 ng/ml) for 0–24 h and washed three times with chilled PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4 (sodium orthovanadate). Cells were then lysed in 750 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophospate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were sonicated for 15 s and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. Protein concentration in the lysates was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Approximately 200 μg of protein was used for immunoprecipitation analysis using 0.4 μg of antibodies derived against ERK2 (C-14), JNK1 (C-17), or p38 (C-20) kinases (all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) that were conjugated to Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4. The kinase activities of ERK2, JNK1, and p38 were determined using 2.5 μg of myelin basic protein, GST-Jun (amino acids 1–79), and GST-ATF-2, as substrates, respectively, in kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The in vitro kinase assays for ERK2 were stopped after a 15-min incubation and after 30 min for JNK1 and p38 with 2× SDS loading buffer. The reaction components were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted for kinases, and substrate phosphorylation was determined by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cell lysates prepared as above were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblot analysis was carried out using the phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody (Sigma; M8159) as described previously (35Tolwinski N.S. Shapiro P.S. Goueli S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6168-6174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Total ERK content of the samples was determined by immunoblot analysis using ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; C-14) antibodies. Protein loading was assessed by blotting for γ-tubulin (Sigma; T 6557). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The StatViewTM statistical program was used to perform analysis of variance between different samples. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. All assay samples were performed in duplicates, and each experiment was repeated at least two times. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of TBE cells with PMA (100 ng/ml) significantly enhancedSPRR1B mRNA levels (lanes 1 and2). This response was inhibited by treatment with BIM, a specific inhibitor of PKC (lanes 3 and4). In contrast, IND, a PKC activator, significantly enhanced SPRR1B mRNA levels, similar to PMA (Fig.1 A, compare lane 5 and lane 2). Treatment of cells with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, also suppressed PMA-stimulated SPRR1B mRNA levels (Fig. 1 B). We next analyzed by transient transfection analysis whether PKC regulates PMA-stimulated SPRR1Bpromoter activity. Cells were transiently transfected with a 152-SPPR1B-CAT3 chimeric construct, and transfected cells were treated with either BIM, IND, or vehicle (Me2SO) for 30 min prior to PMA treatment. Cells were lysed, and CAT expression was measured. PMA significantly stimulated (∼4–5-fold) SPRR1B promoter activity when compared with the vehicle (Fig. 1 C). However, pretreatment of cells with BIM totally suppressed PMA-stimulated CAT gene expression, while it had little or no effect on the basal expression. On the other hand, IND significantly enhanced the CAT expression comparable with that seen with PMA (Fig. 1 D). Protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, also completely suppressed PMA-stimulated gene expression (Fig. 1 E). Together, these results suggest that both the serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases regulate SPRR1B promoter. Human TBE cells mainly express PKC isoenzymes such as α, βII, δ, and ε, but not βI, γ, and η (36Liedtke C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L414-L423PubMed Google Scholar). To identify specific PKC isoenzymes involved in SPRR1B promoter regulation, we have used Go6976 and rottlerin, which were shown to specifically inhibit PKCα (37Griffiths G. Garrone B. Deacon E. Owen P. Pongracz J. Mead G. Bradwell A. Watters D. Lord J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and PKCδ (38Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isoenzymes, respectively. Cells were transiently transfected with 152-SPPR1B-CAT3 reporter and then treated with either Go6976 (5 μm) or rottlerin (1–5 μm) for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with either PMA (100 ng/ml) or Me2SO (vehicle) in the presence of inhibitors. Treatment of cells with rottlerin strongly suppressed both basal and PMA-stimulated CAT gene expression (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, Go6976 did not suppress PMA-stimulated gene expression. On the contrary, it stimulated a nearly 1-fold increase in basal expression (Fig. 2 B). Based on this observation, we used mutants of PKCα and PKCδ to study their effect on gene expression. The dn-PKCδ suppressed both the basal and PMA-stimulated promoter activities (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, dn-PKCα did not suppress PMA-stimulated promoter activity (data not shown). Together, these results indicate involvement of PKCδ in PMA-dependent SPRR1B promoter activation. Having demonstrated the involvement of PKCδ in PMA-dependentSPRR1B gene expression, we next investigated whether Ras, a downstream target of PKC (39Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 40Yamamoto T. Taya S. Kaibuchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), is also involved in the signaling cascade. Cells were co-transfected with active (Ras-V12) or mutant (Ras-N17) Ras expression vector along with SPRR1B-CAT construct. Following overnight incubation, cells were treated with either PMA or Me2SO, and the CAT expression was measured. Expression of Ras-N17 completely suppressed PMA-stimulated activity nearly to the basal level (compare bars 2 and 4 withbar 1, Fig.3 A). dn-Ras slightly reduced the basal CAT gene expression (Fig. 3 A). Coexpression of Ras-V12 significantly stimulated promoter activity (∼2.5-fold) when compared with vector-transfected controls (compare bars 1 and 2, Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, treatment of cells with PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin (5 μm) did not suppress Ras-V12-enhanced activity (compare bars 3 and 2, Fig. 3 B). Together these results indicate that PKCδ activates Ras, which in turn regulatesSPRR1B promoter activation. Ras activates multiple parallel pathways that involve Raf, MEK, and ERK kinases (39Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol.

The inhibition of Myc synthesis accounted for the drop in Myc protein, because PMA treatment had no effect on Myc turnover.

Increased MIE1 binding was independent of protein synthesis and abolished by a selective PKC inhibitor, which also prevented the effect of PMA onmyc mRNA and protein levels and Myc synthesis. PMA treatment increased RFX1 in the nuclear fraction and decreased it in the cytosol without affecting total RFX1. Transfection of HL-60 cells with myc reporter gene constructs showed that the RFX1-binding X box was required for the down-regulation of reporter gene expression by PMA.

Bryo, like PMA, binds to the zinc finger C1 domain of conventional (α, β, and γ) and novel (δ, ε, η, θ, and μ) isoforms of PKC, which turns on its kinase function and concomitantly predisposes it to ubiquitinylation and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (37Newton A.C.

In contrast to PMA, Bryo fails to induce differentiation of HL-60 cells and prevents the induction of HL-60 differentiation by PMA (40Kraft A.S. Smith J.B. Berkow R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1334-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Bryo, which is in clinical trials as an anti-cancer agent, apparently down-regulates PKC more rapidly and efficiently than PMA (41Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Bingham Smith J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C304-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that a brief activation of PKC in undifferentiated HL-60 cells decreased the Myc protein by blocking its synthesis without affecting its turnover. Studies of HL-60 cells transfected with c-myc luciferase reporter constructs suggest that the RFX-binding X box of intron 1 is essential for the down-regulation of myc by PKC. We also show, for the first time, that PMA treatment induced nuclear translocation of RFX1. Our findings suggest that nuclear translocation and binding of RFX1 to the X box contributes to the down-regulation of myc expression following acute activation of PKC.DISCUSSIONIt has been known for some time that premature termination of transcription plays a critically important role in the down-regulation of c-myc in the early phase of the response to differentiation-inducing compounds in undifferentiated HL-60 cells (11Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 12Eick D. Bornkamm G.W.

Chem. 1989; 264: 19710-19715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the later phase of differentiation of HL-60 cells; however, a loss of transcriptional initiation occurs (45Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Kelly K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this report we observed that acute activators of conventional and novel isoforms of PKC, namely Bryo and PMA, rapidly and markedly decreased the steady state level of Myc protein and mRNA in undifferentiated HL-60 cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Treatment with PMA or Bryo for 1 h strongly inhibited the rate of Myc synthesis (Fig. 3). Because the half-life of the Myc protein was unaffected by PMA (Fig. 8), the inhibition of Myc synthesis explained the decrease in the Myc level. For this inference to be correct the Myc protein must have a relatively short half-life in untreated HL-60 cells, which it does (∼20 min) (Fig. 8).Our findings indicate that PMA or Bryo markedly increased nuclear protein binding to MIE1 as determined by EMSA (Fig. 5). Protein binding depended on the MIE1 X box, because substitution of two nucleotides in the 3′ half of the X box strongly decreased the ability of the BL1+2 oligonucleotide to compete with MIE1 (Fig. 5 C). Supershift analysis with antiserum to RFX1 showed that it was present in both of the MIE1-protein complexes that were resolved by EMSA (Fig. 6). Only one of the complexes contained MIBP1, which is a 160-kDa uncharacterized MIE1-binding protein from HeLa cells (22Reinhold W. Emens L. Itkes A. Blake M. Ichinose I. Zajac-Kaye M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Increased MIE1 protein binding depended on PKC activation but was independent of protein synthesis (Figs. 5 and 7). Bis, a selective inhibitor of PKC (43Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which prevented the down-regulation of myc mRNA and protein by PMA or Bryo, also abolished their effects on MIE1 binding activity (Fig. 5 A).The mechanism by which acute activation of PKC increased protein binding to MIE1 appears to be indirect and due at least in part to the nuclear translocation of RFX1 (Fig. 7). Thus we have been unable to detect the 32P-labeled RFX1 following immunoprecipitation from 32P-labeled cells.2 Although32P labeling of MIBP1 was readily detected, PMA treatment had no effect on the labeling.2 Nuclear translocation of RFX1 could explain the PMA- or Bryo-evoked increase in the MIE1 complex that contained MIBP1, because this complex also contained RFX1 (Fig.6 A, Complex 1). In agreement with this idea, MIBP1 and RFX1 coimmunoprecipitated from HeLa cell nuclear extracts in the absence of MIE1 (22Reinhold W. Emens L. Itkes A. Blake M. Ichinose I. Zajac-Kaye M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). No RFX nuclear localization signals have been reported, and there appear to be no reports of a dynamic change in the subcellular localization of an RFX family protein. One possible explanation for nuclear translocation of RFX1 is the phosphorylation of an RFX1-associated and -cotranslocated protein in response to PKC activation.Although RFX proteins are most well known as essential transactivators of MHC class II genes and as a cellular transactivators of pathogenic viruses such as hepatitis B virus (27Mach B. Steimle V. Martinez-Soria E. Reith W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 29Ben-Levy R. Faktor O. Berger I. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1989; 9: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), RFX1 appears to be ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells (25Emery P. Strubin M. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4486-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Mach B. Steimle V. Martinez-Soria E. Reith W. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including undifferentiated HL-60 cells as determined by Western blot analysis (Figs. 6 and 7) and Northern blot analysis (28Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present results suggest that RFX1 binding to the X box of intron 1 has silencer activity toward Myc expression and are consistent with the apparent silencer function of tandem MIE1 repeats toward SV40 promoter activity in hepatocarcinoma cell lines (22Reinhold W. Emens L. Itkes A. Blake M. Ichinose I. Zajac-Kaye M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Blake M. Niklinski J. Zajac-Kaye M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6060-6066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently the interaction of RFX proteins with other DNA-bound proteins determines whether it has enhancer or silencer activity, although the determinants of the activity are unknown (36Dikstein R. Heffetz D. Ben-Neriah Y. Shaul Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 751-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).A recent report by Pan and Simpson (18Pan Q. Simpson R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8437-8444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) of the suppression of c-myc following a 2-day treatment of HL-60 cells with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 implicated MIE1 and activation of PKC, in agreement with our study using acute PKC activators. However, they suggested that the homeobox HOXB4 protein was a major MIE1-binding protein and that the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment down-regulated c-myc by increasing the level of HOXB4 (18Pan Q. Simpson R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8437-8444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is not known if HOXB4 complexes with RFX1 or other MIE1-binding proteins. The following evidence supports the view that RFX1 plays a role in the rapid down-regulation of c-myc following acute activation of PKC: 1) down-regulation of myc-driven reporter gene expression by PMA was abolished by deletion of the RFX-binding X box (Fig. 4); 2) acute treatment with a PKC activator, PMA or Bryo, increased protein binding to the X box of MIE1 (Fig. 5); 3) RFX1 was present in the MIE1-protein complexes (Fig. 6); 4) a selective inhibitor of PKC prevented PMA or Bryo from increasing MIE1 binding activity and decreasing Myc expression (Figs. 2, 3, and 5); and 5) PMA treatment increased RFX1 in the nuclear fraction and decreased it in the cytosol (Fig. 7). It is noteworthy that PMA and Bryo only transiently increased MIE1 protein binding.2 We observed no difference in MIE1 binding activity between undifferentiated and differentiated (2-day PMA treatment) HL-60 cells as reported previously (24Zhang X.Y. Supakar P.C. Wu K.Z. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6865-6869PubMed Google Scholar).2 The lack of increased MIE1 binding activity in differentiated cells is consistent with the role of transcription termination near the first exon/intron junction in the early response to a stimulus of differentiation (14Salehi Z. Taylor J.D. Niedel J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1898-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Kelly K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hence, acute induction of nuclear translocation and binding of RFX1 to the intron 1 X box produced by PMA correlates with the rapid onset of the blockade of transcription elongation following the addition of PMA or other stimuli of differentiation, in contrast to the later phases of Myc down-regulation, which involve a loss of transcriptional initiation (14Salehi Z. Taylor J.D. Niedel J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1898-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Kelly K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Bryo treatment down-regulated endogenous c-mycsimilarly to PMA (this report); however Bryo fails to induce a differentiation response and antagonizes differentiation produced by PMA (40Kraft A.S. Smith J.B. Berkow R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1334-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). PKC activation by Bryo is shorter in duration than that produced by PMA, because Bryo more rapidly and efficiently down-regulates PKC (41Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Bingham Smith J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C304-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies are needed to identify critical differences in the cellular responses to PMA and Bryo, which are subsequent to the rapid down-regulation of c-myc.In conclusion, the present findings implicate nuclear translocation of RFX1 and an intron 1 X box in the early phase of the down-regulation of c-myc produced by acute PKC activators in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Considering the pivotal role of Myc overexpression in malignant tumors (1Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 2Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), biochemical understanding of Myc regulation by RFX1 should help to devise novel strategies for silencing Myc. The c-myc proto-oncogene encodes nuclear proteins, which heterodimerize with Max and regulate the expression of genes implicated in cell growth (size), metabolism, differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, and genomic stability (1Dang C.V.

Uncontrolled expression of the normal Myc proteins is associated with a wide variety of animal and human tumors, with almost a third of breast and colon carcinomas having elevated c-myc expression (1Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express the following multiple Myc polypeptides: Myc1, Myc2, and MycS, which are produced by initiation of translation at different codons (5Hann S.R. King M.W. Bentley D.L.

A cDNA library was constructed from the spontaneously hypertensive rat parathyroid gland, which is a key regulator of serum-ionized calcium. From seven overlapping DNA fragments, a 1100-base pair novel cDNA containing an open reading frame of 224 codons was reconstituted. This novel gene, named HCaRG (hypertension-related,calcium-regulated gene), was negatively regulated by extracellular calcium concentration, and its basal mRNA levels were higher in hypertensive animals. The deduced protein showed no transmembrane domain, 67% α-helix content, a mutated calcium-binding site (EF-hand motif), four putative “leucine zipper” motifs, and a nuclear receptor-binding domain. At the subcellular level, HCaRG had a nuclear localization. We cloned the human homolog of this gene. Sequence comparison revealed 80% homology between rats and humans at the nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Tissue distribution showed a preponderance in the heart, stomach, jejunum, kidney (tubular fraction), liver, and adrenal gland (mainly in the medulla). HCaRG mRNA was significantly more expressed in adult than in fetal organs, and its levels were decreased in tumors and cancerous cell lines. We observed that after 60-min ischemia followed by reperfusion, HCaRG mRNA declined rapidly in contrast with an increase in c-mycmRNA. Its levels then rose steadily to exceed base line at 48 h of reperfusion. HEK293 cells stably transfected withHCaRG exhibited much lower proliferation, as shown by cell count and [3H]thymidine incorporation.

The major players maintaining extracellular calcium homeostasis are calciotropic hormones, parathyroid hormone (PTH),1 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcitonin, and calcium itself. Indeed, extracellular calcium regulates its own concentration as an extracellular messenger by acting on calcium receptors or calcium sensors. The calcium-sensing receptor is linked to several intracellular second messenger systems via guanylyl nucleotide-regulating G proteins and activates phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, leading to accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (1Brown E.M.

Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Even slight reductions in extracellular ionized calcium concentration (on the order of 1–2% or less) elicit prompt increases in the rate of PTH secretion and mRNA levels. Historically, research on the parathyroid gland has focused on the chemistry, regulation, synthesis, and secretion of PTH. There is growing interest in other calcium-regulating proteins of this gland that are also negatively regulated by extracellular calcium, such as chromogranin A and secretory protein-I (7Cohn D.V.

Arterial hypertension is associated with numerous disturbances of calcium metabolism manifested not only in humans but also in genetic as well as acquired models of hypertension (10Sowers J.R.

Disturbances in renal and intestinal handling of calcium in hypertension have been reported by several investigators (15Drueke T.B. Chabanis S. Roullet C. Duchambon P. LaCour B. McCarron D.A. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1994; 307 Suppl. 1: 96-101Google Scholar). Urinary calcium has generally been shown to be increased (so-called urinary leak) and intestinal calcium absorption diminished in genetically hypertensive or spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (15Drueke T.B. Chabanis S. Roullet C. Duchambon P. LaCour B. McCarron D.A. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1994; 307 Suppl. 1: 96-101Google Scholar, 16Cirillo M. Galletti F. Strazzullo P. Torielli L. Melloni M.C. Am. J. Hypertens. 1989; 2: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic free calcium concentration has most often been found to be elevated in circulating platelets, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from hypertensive animals and humans (for a review, see Ref.17Orlov S.N. Li J.M. Tremblay J. Hamet P. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 569-592PubMed Google Scholar). In SHR as well as in low renin hypertensive patients, there seems to be an inverse relationship between extracellular and intracellular calcium (18Resnick L.M. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management. 2nd. Raven Press, New York1995: 1169-1191Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that certain genetic abnormalities might be responsible for the link between some forms of hypertension, calcium homeostasis, and the parathyroid gland. To identify new genes that might be abnormally regulated by extracellular calcium in the parathyroid gland of genetically hypertensive rats, we prepared a cDNA library from the parathyroids of SHR. In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel gene, designated HCaRG (for hypertension-related,calcium-regulated gene), negatively regulated by extracellular calcium with higher mRNA levels in SHR.HCaRG is a nuclear protein with putative “leucine zipper” motifs and is potentially involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Parathyroid cells (PTC) were isolated from SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Primary cultures were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum, as described previously (9Benishin C.G. Lewanczuk R.Z. Shan J.J. Pang P.K. Am. J. Hypertens. 1999; 12: 1260-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were then maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing a low (0.3 mm) or normal (2.0 mm) total calcium concentration for 2 or 48 h. COS-7 or HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. All cell types were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. SHR were anesthetized lightly with flurane, and the right kidney was removed through a mid-abdominal incision. The rats were kept at ambient temperature during the surgery. Their core temperature, monitored by radio-telemetry, was 38 °C. The left kidney was subjected to warm transient ischemia by occlusion of the left renal artery and vein with a microclip, as described previously (19Kunes J. Jelinek J. Zicha J. Clin. Sci. 1986; 70: 185-189Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The skin incision was closed during the 60-min renal ischemia period. It was then reopened, and the clip was removed. The wound was closed with a 2“O” suture. The rats had access to water immediately after surgery. Parathyroid glands were removed from 100 12-week-old SHR and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The glands were added to a guanidinium thiocyanate solution and homogenized. Poly(A) RNA was isolated on an oligo(dT) column. The cDNA library was constructed with poly(A) RNA as template and the ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A summary of the protocol is as follows. mRNA was reverse-transcribed from anXhoI linker oligo(dT) primer using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Second strand synthesis was then produced with DNA polymerase I in the presence of RNase H. cDNA termini were blunted by incubation with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and dNTPs. EcoRI adaptors were added using T4 ligase, and the ends were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. This mixture was then digested with XhoI to release adaptors from the 3′-end of the cDNA. The resulting mixture was separated on a Sephacryl S-400 column. cDNAs were ligated into the Uni-ZAP XR vector using T4 DNA ligase and packaged into Gigapack II Gold packaging extract. The packaged products were plated onto XL1-Blue MRF′. To screen the cDNA library, phages were plated onto bacterial host plates (XL1-Blue MRF′) and incubated overnight. After chilling at 4 °C for 2 h, a nitrocellulose filter was overlaid for 2 min. The filter was then denatured and neutralized, and DNA was cross-linked to it with UV light. Hybridization was performed with digoxigenin-dUTP-labeled probes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) derived from 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) products described below. Total RNAs were prepared from rat cells and organs according to the standard guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (20Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar) and kept at −70 °C until used. mRNA was extracted from total RNA with the Poly(A)Ttract system (Promega, Nepean, Canada). cDNAs, unless stated, were synthesized with random hexamers for first strand synthesis and reverse-transcribed. Radiolabeled DNA probes were prepared by the random priming technique or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with [32P]dCTP. Four mixtures of degenerate oligonucleotide primers were initially designed according to the putative amino acid sequence of PHF with the following degenerate sequence: 5′-TA(T/C) TCI GTI TCI CA(T/C) TT(T/C) (A/C)G-3′. From initial RACE experiments (described below), one unique sequence primer TAC TCC GTG TCC CAC TTC CG was selected for its ability to generate reverse transcription (RT)-PCR DNA fragments from PTC total RNA and used subsequently as candidate primer for 3′-RACE. In brief, for 3′-RACE, total RNA from PTC was reverse-transcribed with a hybrid primer consisting of oligo(dT) (17-mer) extended by a unique 17-base oligonucleotide (adaptor). PCR amplification was subsequently performed with the adapter, which bound to cDNA at its 3′-ends, and the candidate primer mentioned above (21Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4346) Google Scholar). For 5′-RACE, RT was undertaken with an internal primer derived from the sequence of the cDNA fragment generated by 3′-RACE. A dA homopolymer tail was then appended to the first strand reaction products using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Finally, PCR amplification was accomplished with the hybrid primer described previously and a second internal primer upstream to the first one (21Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4346) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments generated from the RACE experiments were separated by electrophoresis, isolated from agarose gel, and extracted by the phenol-chloroform method (20Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar). pSP72 plasmid (Promega) was digested at the SmaI site and ligated to blunt DNA fragments with T4 DNA ligase. Transformed DH5± Escherichia coli bacteria were grown, and recombinant bacteria were selected by PCR. Similarly, HCaRG was subcloned in pcDNA1/Neo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To determine the subcellular localization of HCaRG protein in mammalian cells, the coding region of HCaRG was fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA and was transfected in the cells. Briefly, the entire coding region of HCaRG was amplified by PCR with the primers ATG TCT GCT TTG GGG GCT GCA GCT CCA TAC TTG CAC CAT CCC and TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GAC, gel-purified, and fused in frame to GFP in pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) through a blunt HindIII site. pEGFP-HCaRG was then sequenced. Similarly, the coding sequence of HCaRG was fused in frame to glutathioneS-transferase in pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) through a SmaI site and a blunt EcoRI site. Double-stranded sequencing of cloned cDNA inserts was performed with Sequenase version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). 5 μg of recombinant plasmid template were denatured, annealed with T7 or SP6 primers, and labeled with [35S]dATP by extension, using the chain termination method of Sanger according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 439-bp cDNA fragment of ratHCaRG was 32P-labeled and served as a probe for screening a human VSMC cDNA library. DNA from positive phages was purified, and the fragments were cloned in pBluescript. All fragments were sequenced. We obtained a 1355-bp fragment containing the coding region of HCaRG. 2 μg of poly(A) RNA from PTC or 10 μg of total RNA from kidneys were denatured at 68 °C and separated on denaturing formamide 1% agarose gel. After transfer onto nitrocellulose by vacuum, hybridization was performed overnight using32P-labeled probes generated from cDNA clone(s) by PCR or random labeling. 1 μg of total RNA was used in dot blot experiments. A human multiple tissue expression (MTE™) array (CLONTECH) and human fetal and tumor panel Northern Territory™ RNA blots (Invitrogen) were hybridized with32P-labeled human HCaRG cDNA according to the manufacturer's specifications. For quantitative determinations ofHCaRG mRNA, total RNA was extracted from PTC and reverse-transcribed. A HCaRG competitor was constructed using the PCR Mimic Construction Kit (CLONTECH) with the following composite primers: GCA CGA GCC ACA GCC AGC TAC CCC AGC CAC CCA TTT GTA CC (sense) and TGT GAC TGT CAG CGG GAT GGA GTC CGA GAT GTA GAG GGC (antisense). The 344-bp DNA obtained was cloned into pSP72 and transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase. The resulting RNA was quantified by photometry and subsequently used in competitive RT-PCR. The competitive reaction contained 1 or 2 μg of total RNA with increasing amounts of competitor cRNA along with32P-labeled nucleotide. Two primers, TGT GAC TGT CAG CGG GAT GG and GCA CGA GCC ACA GCC AGC TACC, flanking the HCaRGintron were employed to amplify a 186-bp cDNA fragment. PCR was performed as follows: 15 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 68 °C, 30 s at 72 °C for 30 cycles, followed by a 5-min elongation step at 72 °C. 10 μl of the PCR were loaded on 1.8% agarose gel and then dried and exposed in a PhosphorImager cassette for quantification. Tissues from SHR and WKY were rinsed in phosphate buffer, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. 3–5-μm sections were cut and mounted on microscope slides pretreated with aminopropylthiethoxysilane. The slides were first dried at 37 °C and then at 60 °C for 10 min prior to use. The probe applied was a unique 300-bp fragment (3r 290 in Fig. 1 A) that had been subcloned into theBamHI site of a pSP72 vector. The DNA was transcribed using T7 or SP6 polymerases to create sense and antisense riboprobes, which were labeled with digoxigenin-UTP. They were validated by dot blot hybridization with template DNA. Prehybridization of slides was undertaken after dewaxing in xylene, followed by progressive ethanol-water hydration (from 95 to 50%). The slides were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. After this digestion, they were rinsed successively in glycine buffer plus PBS and then dehydrated in ethanol. Actual prehybridization was done with 50% formamide, 0.2% SDS, 0.1% Sarcosyl, 5× standard sodium citrate (SSC: NaCl (0.15 m), sodium citrate (0.015 m, pH 7.0)), and 2% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 60 °C. Hybridization was performed by adding the probe (200 ng/ml) to 50 μl of 4× SSC and 50% formamide per section. The slides were incubated overnight at 60 °C in a humidified chamber. During hybridization, a coverslip was placed over the tissue section. After hybridization, it was removed, and the sections were rinsed with 4× SSC and then washed with 4× SSC for 15 min and in 2× SSC for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, the sections were washed with 0.1% SSC for 30 min at 60 °C. For coloration, they were washed with buffers 1 and 2 of the DIG Luminescent Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). They were then incubated with anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase antibody (1:500) in buffer 2 for 40 min and washed twice in buffer 1 for 15 min and in buffer 3 for 2 min. Incubation in the color solution nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate (NBT/x-phos) was carried out for 45 min, after which the slides were washed in distilled water and dry-mounted with Geltol. The full length of theHCaRG coding sequence was synthesized by RT-PCR with specific primers and inserted downstream of the T7 promoter into the pSP72 vector. In vitro transcription and translation were performed using a TNT-T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. A plasmid containing the luciferase gene supplied by the manufacturer was used as a control. The synthesized proteins were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence or presence of β-mercaptoethanol. Radioactive protein bands were detected by scanning with a PhosphorImager. E. coli cells transformed with pGEX-3X were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until A 595 = 0.5. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the cells were cultured for 2 h. Purification of glutathioneS-transferase-HCaRG was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polyclonal antisera with antibodies recognizing HCaRG were produced by immunization of rabbits with glutathione S-transferase-HCaRG protein. Rat tissues (liver, anterior pituitary, spleen, heart, and adrenal gland) were quickly removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.05% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer solution for 90 min. A part of the specimens was cryoprotected in 0.4 m sucrose phosphate buffer solution for 30 min at 4 °C and then frozen in a cold gradient of fuming nitrogen (Biogel, CFPO, Saint Priest, France) to −4 °C and immersed in liquid nitrogen, as described previously (22Lobie P.E. Sadir R. Graichen R. Mertani H.C. Morel G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ultrathin frozen sections of 80-nm thickness were obtained using a dry sectioning method at −120 °C with an Ultracut S microtome (Leica, Lyon, France). The other part of the specimens was dehydrated before embedding in Lowicryl K4M with the AFS system (Leica) (23Gomez E. Morel G. Cavalier A. Lienard M.O. Haour F. Courtens J.L. Jegou B. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 1513-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sections were mounted on 400-mesh collodion-carbon-coated nickel grids. For ultrastructural localization of HCaRG protein, the grids were first placed in buffer containing 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1% albumin, pH 7.4, for 10 min. They were then incubated for 1 h with polyclonal IgG raised against HCaRG protein at concentrations of 1:1000 and 1:50 for ultrathin frozen sections and Lowicryl sections, respectively. After 10-min washing in the same buffer, antigen-antibody complexes were revealed with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 10-nm gold particles in buffer containing 0.05 m Tris, 0.15m NaCl, 1% albumin, pH 7.6, for 1 h. The grids were washed in the same buffer and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The specificity of the immunocytological reaction was tested on sections with omission of primary antibody and incubation of the primary antibody with particle-adsorbed antigen. No signal was observed on these tissue sections. Before observation in a Philips CM 120 electron microscope at 80 kV, the cryosections were contrasted in 2% uranyl acetate and embedded in 8% methylcellulose, and the Lowicryl sections were contrasted for 20 min in 5% uranyl acetate. COS-7 cells were plated at ∼30–50% confluency 1 day prior to transfection, which was performed with 5 μg/well of pEGFP-HCaRG or pcDNA1/Neo-HCaRG, according to the calcium phosphate method. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, cells transfected with pEGFP-HCaRG or pcDNA1/Neo-HCaRG were mounted on coverslips. The cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 12 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% gelatin for 15 min, incubated withHCaRG antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h, washed in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, incubated with anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies, and washed again. Fluorescence and immunofluorescence were detected with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. HEK293 cells were plated in a 100-mm plate at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/plate. They were transfected with the control plasmid pcDNA1/Neo (Invitrogen) or with the plasmid containing rat HCaRG using a standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. 48 h after transfection, the cells were plated in 150-mm plates in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 weeks, the clones were picked, and the level of ectopic HCaRG expression was determined by Northern hybridization. The rate of stable clone cell proliferation was measured by counting the number of cells after plating. Cells were seeded at a density of 0.1 × 106 cells/six-well plate, with triplicate plates for each cell line. Every 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and counted in a hemocytometer. HEK293 cells that stably expressed either Neo control plasmid or HCaRGwere used for the estimation of DNA synthesis by [3H]thymidine incorporation. The clones were trypsinized at 90% confluency, counted in a standard hemocytometer, and inoculated at an identical initial cell density of 40,000 cells/ml in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 at 400 μg/ml. All cells were inoculated in poly-d-lysine-pretreated 24-well plates in a volume of 1 ml/well (40,000 cells/well). They were allowed to attach and grow for a period of 24–48 h. The growth media were then replaced by DMEM containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum and G418 (400 μg/ml) for a period of 48 h to synchronize the cells. After the synchronization period, the cells were supplied with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and allowed to grow for 48 h. [3H]Thymidine, 1 μCi/ml (ICN) was added to the cells for the last 4 h of the 48-h growth period. At the end of incubation, the medium was removed, and the monolayers were washed twice with PBS. The cells were then fixed with ethanol/acetic acid (3:1, v/v), and DNA was digested/extracted with 0.5 nperchloric acid at 80–90 °C for 20 min. Using sense candidate primers (from a putative amino acid sequence of PHF (24Hatton D.C. McCarron D.A. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 513-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)) and a hybrid oligo(dT) primer, 3′-RACE experiments, performed on total RNA extracted from SHR PTC cultured in low calcium medium, generated one major 700-bp fragment that was digested and cloned in the BamHI site of pSP72. Since aBamHI site was present in the 700-bp fragment, a recombinant plasmid containing a 300-bp insert was isolated and sequenced. This fragment was used to screen the PTC library and to generate new oligonucleotide primers to extend the cDNA toward the 5′- and 3′-ends by RACE. From seven overlapping DNA fragments isolated in the above experiments and from SHR PTC cDNA library screening, a 1100-bp cDNA was reconstituted (Fig.1 A). The rat 1100-bp reconstituted cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame of 224 codons preceded by two in-frame stop codons and followed by the most frequent variant of the poly(A) tail (Fig. 1 B). A 342-bp intron was localized at position −52 from the translation initiation site. Poly(A) RNA was isolated as described and analyzed by Northern hybridization with the 32P-labeled 300-bp fragment (Fig.2 A). Two bands were detected with this probe, with approximate lengths of 1.2 and 1.4 kilobase pairs. These results suggest either the existence of two genes or differential splicing. Furthermore, they indicate that the reconstituted 1100-bp cDNA is almost full-length cDNA, estimated at 1.2 kilobase pairs by the major band in the Northern hydridization experiments. Regulation of the expression of this novel gene was investigated by competitive RT-PCR assay in PTC from WKY and SHR. Cells between 5 and 12 passages were tested in these studies. In WKY PTC, lowering of ambient calcium from 2.0 to 0.3 mm induced a rapid 2-fold increase in the mRNA levels of this novel gene at 2 h, which lasted up to 48 h (Fig. 2 B). This calcium regulation was detected in WKY PTC up to about 12 passages but disappeared in long term cultures. Lowering of calcium concentrations in the cell medium also increased the mRNA levels of this novel gene in SHR PTC but to a lesser extent than in WKY cells (data not shown). We then compared its mRNA levels between two normotensive rat strains (Brown Norway, BN.lx, or WKY) and hypertensive animals (SHR). We observed that the mRNA levels of this novel gene were significantly higher in PTC derived from SHR (Fig. 2 C, left panel) compared with normotensive WKY at normal calcium. Similarly, when we extracted RNA (Fig. 2 C, right panel) or proteins (Fig. 2 D) directly from the kidneys, we found significantly higher levels of this novel gene in hypertensive rats. These results clearly show that this novel gene is negatively regulated by extracellular calcium concentrations and that its levels are significantly higher in genetically hypertensive rats compared with two normotensive strains. We therefore named this geneHCaRG (hypertension-related,calcium-regulated gene). The deduced protein contained 224 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 22,456 Da. The estimated pI of the protein was 6.0. It comprised no known membrane-spanning motif but had an estimated 67% α-helix content. The absence of a putative signal peptide sequence suggested an intracellular protein. There were two cysteines in the sequence, indicating possible intra- or intermolecular disulfide bridges (Cys64–Cys218). The protein had several putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and protein kinase A and one potential Asn-glycosylation site (Asn76). To confirm that HCaRG mRNA encodes a peptide of expected size, the HCaRG cDNA inserted into pSP72 was incubatedin vitro in a coupled transcription/translation labeling system. It was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. As shown in Fig.3 (lane 4),HCaRG mRNA directed the synthesis of a peptide with a mol"

We suggest that magnesium ions are a trans-acting factor mediating differential mRNA stability. polynucleotide phosphorylase The efficiency of gene expression depends on the stability of mRNAs by determining the pool of templates available for synthesis of the respective gene products. Gene regulation in many systems is accomplished by changing the stability of a certain message during the course of a developmental program or in response to environmental changes (1Atwater J.A. Wisdom R. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts of higher plants differential mRNA stability is responsible for controlling mRNA accumulation during chloroplast maturation (2Gruissem W. Tonkyn J.C. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1993; 12: 19-55Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 3Gruissem W. Schuster G. Brawerman G. Belasco J. Control of mRNA Stability. Academic Press, New York1993: 329-365Google Scholar). In spinach as well as in barley it has been shown that during leaf development mRNAs are stabilized in a gene-specific manner (4Klaff P. Gruissem W. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 517-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kim J. Klein P.G. Mullet J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA that is stabilized to the highest extent encodes the D1 reaction center protein of photosystem II (psbA). In recent years considerable progress has been made in elucidating the mRNA degradation mechanism in chloroplasts (6Schuster G. Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Hayes R. Kudla J. Gruissem W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 199-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In higher plants plastid mRNA degradation is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavages (8Klaff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4885-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The resulting proximal fragments are polyadenylated as a tag for rapid exonucleolytic decay (9Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1173-1178Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This mechanism implies that initiation of mRNA decay is the crucial process by which the stability of a certain message is regulated. The accessibility of the primary cleavage sites for endonucleases determines the proportion of molecules to be degraded. However, only limited information is available so far about the molecular mechanism mediating the regulation of degradation initiation, the cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors involved. Up to now, only a few cis-regulatory elements of mRNAs have been described using genetic approaches in higher plants and in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In Chlamydomonasseveral nuclear mutants have been isolated that affect the stability of a variety of chloroplast-encoded mRNAs; those mutations each interfere with the accumulation of a single defined chloroplast mRNA (11Rochaix J.-D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the nuclear mutation nac2–26, for example, the stability of the chloroplast psbD mRNA is dramatically decreased (12Kuchka M.R. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Dillewijn J.v. Rochaix J.-D. Cell. 1989; 58: 869-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Chloroplast transformation with constructs of the psbD leader fused to a reporter gene showed a destabilized chimeric transcript in the mutant background and normal accumulation in the wild type, indicating that the 74-nucleotide leader of the mRNA includes a determinant for psbDmRNA degradation (13Nickelsen J. Dillewijn J.v. Rahire M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3182-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Nickelsen J. Fleischmann M. Boudreau E. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Chloroplast lysates from wild type and mutant cells as an in vitro degradation system for the analysis of synthetic RNA transcripts reflect the observations madein vivo. The primary cleavage sites could be detected on these RNA transcripts. cis-Regulatory elements for the degradation of rbcL mRNA in Chlamydomonashave also been analyzed (15Salvador M.L. Klein U. Bogorad L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1556-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The 63 nucleotides of the rbcL5′ leader fused to the Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase gene (gus) as a reporter confer instability to the chimeric transcripts in the light. The addition of the 257 nucleotides from the adjacent coding region prevented this destabilization. InChlamydomonas the role of the 5′ untranslated region of thepetD mRNA for RNA stability and translation was studied by extensive mutational analysis. It was demonstrated that sequences essential for translation, as well as sequences that directly or indirectly affect RNA stability, reside within the 5′ untranslated region of the petD mRNA. The finding that in all mutants where translation was compromised petD mRNA accumulated to a lower level than in wild type strains indicated that mRNA stability may be linked to translatability (16Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts of higher plants a correlation of polysome association and mRNA stability was suggested for rbcL mRNA from studies of nuclear mutants in maize. Mutants in which many chloroplast mRNAs are associated with abnormally few ribosomes showed that the level of rbcL mRNA was reduced 4-fold, indicating that the rbcL mRNA is destabilized as a consequence of its decreased polysome association (17Barkan A. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 389-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further indications thatcis-regulatory elements in higher plant chloroplast mRNAs are involved in RNA accumulation come from studies with transformed chloroplasts of tobacco. Fusions of different 3′ untranslated regions to the E. coli β-glucuronidase gene, which in these constructs is preceded by the psbA promoter and the psbA 5′ untranslated region, suggested that the accumulation of the chimeric RNA is not changed dramatically by the different 3′ ends but is more likely influenced by other elements of the RNA (18Staub J.M. Maliga P. Plant J. 1994; 6: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for cis-regulatory functions of the 5′ region of higher plant chloroplast mRNAs comes from transplastomic plants carrying fusions of the gus gene withrbcL promotor/leader fragments. gus mRNA accumulation is independent of light as long as a certain element of the 5′ untranslated region is included in the construct. Lower rates ofrbcL transcription in the dark were compensated by increased mRNA stability (19Shiina T. Allison L. Maliga P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In tobacco, the 5′ untranslated region ofpsbA mRNA alone seems not to be sufficient to confer the stability of the intact mRNA to a reporter fusion construct (20Eibl C. Zou Z. Beck A. Kim M. Mullet J. Koop H.-U. Plant J. 1999; 19: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Most chloroplast mRNAs are flanked by a stem-loop structure in their 3′ untranslated region that participates in the processing of the mature 3′ end (3Gruissem W. Schuster G. Brawerman G. Belasco J. Control of mRNA Stability. Academic Press, New York1993: 329-365Google Scholar). In addition, these elements are important for impeding the progress of processive exoribonucleases (21Adams C.C. Stern D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6003-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In transformed Chlamydomonas chloroplasts in vivo, it has been shown that partial or complete deletions of the stem-loop of the atpB gene leads to a decrease in mRNA accumulation, whereas the transcription rate of this gene remains unaffected (22Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar). The stem-loop structure can be replacedin vivo by a sequence of 18 guanosines, which also serves as a barrier for a 3′→5′ exonuclease in vitro. Strains containing the polyguanosine tract instead of the stem-loop structure within the 3′ untranslated region accumulate nearly wild type levels ofatpB transcripts and the ATPase β-subunit protein (23Drager R.G. Zeidler M. Simpson C.L. Stern D.B. RNA. 1996; 2: 652-663PubMed Google Scholar). The stem-loop structures of the 3′ untranslated regions are known to bind chloroplast proteins. The petD 3′ untranslated region forms a complex with 55-, 41-, and 29-kDa RNA-binding proteins. An 8-nucleotide AU-rich sequence motif downstream of the stem-loop, termed box II, appears to be essential for RNA-protein complex formationin vitro (24Chen Q. Adams C.C. Usak L. Yang J. Monde R.-A. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2010-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the stem-loop itself is necessary for protein binding. The AU-rich box is also recognized by a 57-kDa protein, which possibly forms a stable complex together with a 33-kDa protein (25Hsu-Ching C. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4380-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These proteins may either be involved in mRNA processing or mediate stabilization against degradation. Beyond those proteins, most RNA-binding proteins that so far have been isolated, cloned, and characterized from chloroplasts of higher plants cannot be assigned to specific mRNAs but exhibit general functions. The 28-kDa ribonucleoprotein is involved in 3′ end processing of several mRNAs (26Schuster G. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); the 100-kDa ribonucleoprotein is the exonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (27Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay P. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); the ribosomal protein S1 (28Alexander C. Faber N. Klaff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2265-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the nuclease CSP41, which had previously been identified as a 3′ end binding protein (29Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar), could also be detected as part of a complex binding to the 5′ untranslated region ofpsbA mRNA. 1P. Klaff, unpublished data. 1P. Klaff, unpublished data. In this work we provide data showing that, in addition to proteins, the divalent cation Mg2+ (as a non-proteinaceous factor) is required not only for the formation of chemically stable and functional RNA in a general manner but also for gene-specific differential stabilization of chloroplast RNAs. Furthermore, we show that the concentration of free magnesium ions rises during chloroplast development within a range sufficient to confer gene-specific mRNA stability regulation. Spinach plants (Spinacea oleraceaL. cv. Monnopa) were grown on soil in the greenhouse with additional illumination during wintertime to result in 12 h of light per day. For magnesium determinations seedlings were grown in a growth chamber under conditions outlined under “Results.” DNA oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized by Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). The following oligonucleotides were used for Northern analysis: psbA-1, 5′-ATTCGCTAGAAATAGAAATTGAAAGATTGTTATT-3′ (complementary to positions −86 to −53 of the mRNA); psbA-2, 5′-TGGTTTATTTAATTTAATCATCAGGG-3′ (complementary to positions −36 to −10 of the mRNA); psbA-3, 5′-GGCTTTCGCTTTCGCGTCTC-3′ (complementary to positions 18–37 of the mRNA); rbcL-1, 5′-GGTCTACTCGACATAAATTAGG-3′ (complementary to positions −72 to −50 of the mRNA); rbcL-2, 5′-GGACTTACTCGGAATGCTGCC-3′ (complementary to positions 111–121 of the mRNA); 16 S, 5′-GTCTCAGTCCCAGTGTGGCTGATCA-3′ (complementary to positions 275–299 of the corresponding tobacco RNA); tRNAHis, 5′-GGCGAACGACGGGAATTGAAC-3′ (complementary to positions 55–75 of the genomic sequence). Numeration of the RNA sequences ofrbcL and psbA is according to Refs. 30Zurawski G. Perrot B. Bottomley W. Whitfeld P.R.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar. Intact chloroplasts were isolated according to Ref. 33Gruissem W. Greenberg B.M. Zurawski G. Hallick R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. For preparation ofin vitro degradation extracts, chloroplasts were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 20 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol and lysed by 10–15 strokes using a potter with pestle S. Extracts were adjusted to approximately 5 mg/ml protein as determined by Bradford assay. The extracts were stored at −70 °C after freezing in liquid nitrogen. Chlorophyll concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (34Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro degradation experiments were performed with 100 μl of degradation extract (5 mg/ml protein) per time point. The extract was thawed on ice, and the mixture was transferred to 25 °C for incubation. Reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl of 6.0 m urea, 1.0% SDS, and 200 μl of phenol/chloroform (8Klaff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4885-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After phenol/chloroform extraction and a subsequent chloroform extraction, nucleic acids were recovered by ethanol precipitation. Concentrations of nucleic acids were determined spectrophotometrically at A 260. For Northern analysis 2 μg of chloroplast RNA per lane were separated on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels according to Ref. 32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar. Hybridization conditions were as published (4Klaff P. Gruissem W. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 517-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that oligonucleotide probes were used. Hybridization temperatures were as follows: psbA-3, 60 °C; rbcL-1/rbcL-2 mixture, 50 °C; 16 S, 55 °C; tRNAHis, 50 °C. Filters were washed three times for 30 min at the respective hybridization temperatures in 5× SSC, pH 7.0, 0.1% SDS. Filters were exposed to Kodak X-AR x-ray films. An excess of the probe was always examined by a dilution series of total spinach RNA on each blot to ensure the quantitative Northern analysis. For high resolution Northern analysis 2 μg of chloroplast RNA per lane were separated on denaturating 5% sequencing polyacrylamide gels containing 8m urea, 0.5× TBE (10×: 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were pre-run at 100 W for 20 min to allow heating and run at 100 W for 60 min. RNA samples were dissolved in 90% formamide containing 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylenecyanole, and 1 mm EDTA, heated to 85 °C for 5 min, and chilled on ice prior to loading onto the gel. Gels were transferred to a Biodyne A nylon membrane (Pall Europe Limited, Portsmouth, United Kingdom) in 5× SSC overnight using the setup for agarose gels. The membrane was UV-treated to covalently couple the RNA (120 mJ, Stratalinker; Stratagene GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The hybridization procedure was performed as described above. The probe for high resolution Northern analysis was the psbA-1/psbA-2 mixture, which was hybridized at 40 °C. Intact chloroplasts were isolated as described above, except using buffers devoid of magnesium and EDTA. Lysis was performed by resuspension in 20 mm HEPES, 60 mmKCl, 15 mm KOH (to pH 7.9), and 20% (v/v) glycerol and 10 strokes each in a potter with first a light pistil and then a tight fitting pistil. The stromal fraction was isolated as the supernatant of a 30-min centrifugation at 20,000 rpm (Beckman JA20.1 rotor). The chloroplast stroma was filtrated through CentriconTM tubes (Amicon/Millipore, Bedford, MA) with an exclusion mass of 30 kDa. The resulting solution was directly subjected to Mg2+determination. The concentration of free Mg2+ was measured using the magnesium-selective macroelectrode ETH 7025 as described (35Zhang W. Truttmann A.C. Luthi D. McGuigan J.A. Magnes. Bull. 1997; 17: 125-130Google Scholar). Briefly, the magnesium electrode was calibrated in the “background buffer” used for chloroplast extract preparation (20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm KOH (to pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol) followed immediately by measuring up to 11 extract samples and a subsequent additional calibration to assay for drift. The calibration curves were linear from 20–0.15 mm Mg2+, with regression coefficients >0.98. Isolated intact chloroplasts were analyzed for their dimensions using a Zeiss Photomikroskop III. Photographic prints were scanned, and the images were evaluated using the ScionImage software (Scion Corp., obtained as freeware). The length l and width w of chloroplasts were determined, and the volume V was approximated by a rotational ellipsoid. V=2π·w3·l22Equation 1 X-ray films were quantified by densitometric analysis using a Hewlett Packard ScanJet 4c/T scanner. Scans were evaluated as TIFF images using the ScionImage software. Linearity of the scanned hybridization signal was ensured by dilution series of total RNA coprocessed with each quantitative Northern analysis. Relative RNA stability for magnesium-dependent stability profiles was determined by normalizing the data points obtained after 180 min of incubation to the “0” time point. To plot the relative RNA stability against concentrations of free Mg2+, the data were fitted using a modification of the Hill algorithm for binding of small ligands to a macromolecule (36Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco1980Google Scholar). Here the mathematics was applied to describe the stabilizing effect of magnesium ions, i.e. binding is replaced by the stabilizing effect in the analysis. The original Hill function,f=[L] nKn+[L] nEquation 2 where f = fraction of binding sites bound,n = Hill coefficient (n > 1 for cooperative binding), [L] = free ligand concentration, andK = apparent dissociation constant for interacting sites, is therefore modified to fit the stabilization profiles,S([Mg2+])=SO+(Smax−SO)·[Mg2+] nKn+[Mg2+] nEquation 3 where S = RNA stability in relative units as a function of magnesium concentration, S 0 = stability at 20 mm EDTA (no magnesium added to correct for the offset), S max = maximal RNA stability,n = Hill coefficient, and K = [Mg2+] of half-maximum RNA stability. Fits were performed using the Origin software (Microcal Corp.). The rbcL mRNA 5′ untranslated region had been cloned as a 216-base pair PCR fragment containing the T7 promotor fused to a BglII restriction site, and the rbcL 5′ untranslated region (−180–6, Ref.30Zurawski G. Perrot B. Bottomley W. Whitfeld P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3251-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) was cloned into BamHI/HincII sites of pUC18. The insert sequence was verified by sequencing. Radiolabeled RNA transcripts were synthesized using the T7 in vitrotranscription system (37Klaff P. Mundt S.M. Steger G. RNA. 1997; 3: 1468-1479PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of protein binding, label transfer experiments were performed according to Ref. 38Klaff P. Gruissem W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar. 12.5% polyacrylamide/SDS gels were used according to Ref. 39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar. The gels were stained with silver nitrate (40Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR x-ray films. To study chloroplast mRNA degradation we recently established an in vitro degradation system that faithfully reflects mRNA degradation in terms of cleavages and processing of degradation fragments after cleavage (8Klaff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4885-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1173-1178Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This system consists of isolated, lysed chloroplasts and allows the observation of the internal mRNA that is complexed with proteins as in the native state as well as the analysis of additionally added transcripts. Lysis of the chloroplasts enables us to vary degradation conditions externally by variation of the buffer constituents. Earlier work already showed the effect of magnesium ions on RNA stability, an effect that is destabilizing in chloroplast extracts from Chlamydomonas (13Nickelsen J. Dillewijn J.v. Rahire M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3182-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In degradation extracts of spinach chloroplasts magnesium ions have the opposite effect. They induce stabilization of internal RNAs. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 a degradation extract was prepared in the presence of 20 mm EDTA to complex the endogenous magnesium ions of the chloroplast. The Mg2+ content was reconstituted by adding MgCl2to a concentration of 25 mm. After incubation of the extract at room temperature for different periods of time as indicated in Fig. 1, total RNA was prepared and subjected to Northern analysis using gene-specific probes. As a control for ionic strength effects NaCl was added to another series of degradation experiments to a final concentration of 50 mm. We analyzed two mRNAs,psbA and the rbcL mRNA (psbA: D1 reaction center protein of photosystem II; rbcL: large subunit of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase). In spinach,psbA mRNA is stabilized during leaf development, whereas no dramatic changes can be observed in the stability of rbcLmRNA (4Klaff P. Gruissem W. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 517-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two structural RNAs, 16 S ribosomal RNA and tRNAHis, which are supposed to be stable in all stages of chloroplast development, were studied. As shown in Fig. 1 all RNAs analyzed are stabilized by the addition of Mg2+, whereas the addition of NaCl has no effect. The finding that NaCl has no stabilizing effect on chloroplast RNAs in vitro indicates that not merely an increase in ionic strength is involved here. Still the stabilizing effect of Mg2+ may be general for all RNAs.Figure 2Magnesium dependence of chloroplast RNA stability. In vitro degradation extracts prepared in the presence of 20 mm EDTA (protein concentration, 5 mg/ml) were incubated at 22 °C for 180 min in the presence of added Mg2+ as labeled and for 0 min as a control. Total RNA was purified, and 2 μg of each sample was analyzed by quantitative Northern hybridization using gene-specific oligonucleotides as indicated. Each of the RNAs exhibits a typical MgCl2concentration where stabilization can be observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Ion-dependent chloroplast RNA degradation in vitro. Degradation of internal chloroplast RNAs was observed in extracts of lysed chloroplasts from mature leaves. Extracts of a concentration of 5 mg/ml protein prepared in the presence of 20 mm EDTA were incubated at 22 °C unmodified and after reconstitution with 25 mmMgCl2 or 50 mm NaCl for the times indicated. Total RNA was purified. Two μg of RNA per time point was analyzed by quantitative Northern hybridization using gene-specific oligonucleotides as labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To approach the question of specificity, titration experiments were performed to analyze the stabilization profiles as well as the “midpoint stabilizing” Mg2+ concentration of different RNAs. Chloroplast extract was incubated at room temperature for 180 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of magnesium ions as indicated in Fig. 2 and compared with extract representing the time point 0. Total RNA was prepared from each sample and subjected to quantitative Northern analysis using the same gene-specific probes as described above. The results depicted in Fig. 2 show that magnesium ions have specific effects on the RNAs analyzed. Ribosomal 16 S rRNA and tRNAHis are already stabilized at low added Mg2+ concentrations (2.5–5 mm), whereas psbA mRNA requires concentrations of 10–15 mm Mg2+ added to the 20 mm EDTA extract to gain stability. rbcLmRNA shows an intermediate characteristic, becoming stabilized at concentrations of 5–10 mm added magnesium ions. Besides the specific concentrations of magnesium ions that result in stabilization of RNAs, the stabilization profiles as a function of Mg2+ seem to be different. To gain a more detailed insight into those stabilization profiles that have been described in a rough qualitative manner above, the data were quantitated. However, before a quantitative evaluation could be made, the concentrations of free magnesium ions at each point of the titration experiment had to be determined. This was facilitated using an electropotentiometric procedure with magnesium-specific electrodes (35Zhang W. Truttmann A.C. Luthi D. McGuigan J.A. Magnes. Bull. 1997; 17: 125-130Google Scholar). The advantage of this method compared with atom absorption spectroscopy is that only the concentration of free ionized magnesium is determined, whereas total magnesium would be measured by atom absorption spectroscopy. In chloroplasts, total concentrations of magnesium ions as high as 20–30 mm were determined earlier (41Barber J. Barber J. The Intact Chloroplast. 1. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam1976: 89-134Google Scholar). However, it is very likely that only a portion of these ions is present as free ionized Mg2+ and thereby is available for interactions with RNA. To perform the determination of free Mg2+, chloroplast degradation extracts had to be cleared from the membrane fraction by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant had to be filtered through a CentriconTM tube with a size exclusion mass of 30 kDa. Otherwise, certain components of the extracts induced a drift at the electrode that did not allow for precise measurements. In Fig. 3 A the calibration curve is shown in which measured voltage is plotted against the negative logarithm of [MgCl2]. The calibration curve shows linearity over a broad range of Mg2+ concentration. Fig. 3 B shows the concentration of free Mg2+determined in the extract plotted against [MgCl2]added in the presence of 20 mm EDTA. The first three titration points (2.5, 5.0, 7.5 mm added Mg2+) do not result in more than a micromolar increase of free [Mg2+]. Adding higher concentrations of Mg2+ results in a nearly linear increase of free [Mg2+], showing that EDTA is saturated at [Mg2+]added higher than 7.5 mm. To analyze the magnesium-dependent stabilization profiles of the different RNAs, x-ray films were densitometrically quantified. RNA amounts were expressed as percent of RNA remaining after 180 min compared with the amount of RNA at time 0 set to 100%. The percentage of remaining RNA is plotted against the concentration of free [Mg2+] as shown in Fig. 4. The qualitative observations made before are very much supported b"

Numerous studies have shown that TPO binding leads to JAK2 kinase activation and Tyr phosphorylation of c-Mpl and several intracellular signaling intermediates, events vital for the biological activity of the hormone. In contrast, virtually nothing is known of the role of Ser or Thr phosphorylation of c-Mpl. By using phosphoamino acid analysis we found that Ser residues of c-Mpl were constitutively phosphorylated in receptor-bearing cells, levels that were increased following exposure of cells to TPO. To identify which residues were modified, and to determine the functional consequences of their phosphorylation, we generated a series of Ser to Ala mutations of a truncated c-Mpl receptor (T69) capable of supporting TPO-induced cell growth. Of the eight Ser within T69 we found that at least four are phosphorylated in TPO-stimulated cells. The mutation of each of these residues alone had minimal effects on TPO-induced proliferation, but substitution of all of the phosphoserine residues with Ala reduced the capacity of the receptor to support cell growth by over 50%. Additionally, the Ser at cytoplasmic position 18 is not detectably phosphorylated. However, the mutation of Ser-18 to Ala nearly abrogates TPO-induced proliferation and co-precipitation of JAK2 with Mpl. This study provides the first systematic analysis of the role of Ser residues in c-Mpl signaling.

Blood. 1995; 86: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor for thrombopoietin, c-Mpl, is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells, immature hematopoietic progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets. The genetic elimination of either TPO1 or c-Mpl in mice reduces the levels of all of these cell types by 70–90%, establishing that TPO-induced signaling plays a major physiological role in hematopoiesis in general and megakaryopoiesis in particular (2Alexander W.S. Roberts A.W. Nicola N.A. Li R. Metcalf D. Blood. 1996; 87: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Solar G.P. Kerr W.G. Zeigler F.C. Hess D. Donahue C. de Sauvage F.J. Eaton D.L. Blood. 1998; 92: 4-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways utilized by c-Mpl have been extensively studied, focusing primarily on tyrosine phosphorylation events. After stimulation with TPO, the c-Mpl receptor is believed to alter its conformation resulting in a homodimeric receptor complex capable of supporting the transphosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and TYK2 tyrosine kinases (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Mu S.X. Xia M. Elliott G. Bogenberger J. Swift S. Bennett L. Lappinga D.L. Hecht R.

Blood. 1995; 86: 23-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated, JAK kinases phosphorylate a number of substrates, including c-Mpl itself, providing docking sites for Src homology 2- and phosphotyrosine-binding motif-containing proteins, including the latent transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5 and a number of adapter proteins including Shc, Vav, and Cbl (7Miyakawa Y. Oda A. Druker B.J. Miyazaki H. Handa M. Ohashi H. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 439-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Oda A. Ozaki K. Druker B.J. Miyakawa Y. Miyazaki H. Handa M. Morita H. Ohashi H. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1330-1338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other signaling intermediates have also been reported to be activated by TPO in various cell lines and primary cells including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase C, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (9Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen J. Herceg-Harjacek L. Groopman J.E. Grabarek J. Blood. 1995; 86: 4054-4062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the many published reports on tyrosine phosphorylation of cytokine receptors, it is apparent that other mechanisms for signal transduction must exist. For instance, a mutant receptor of c-Mpl, in which all of the tyrosine residues were eliminated by deletion or Phe substitution, is capable of supporting cellular proliferation in cytokine-responsive cell lines (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that elimination of the proximal nine residues of the Mpl receptor eliminates JAK2 activation but is capable of supporting cell growth (11Dorsch M. Fan P.D. Danial N.N. Rothman P.B. Goff S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1947-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Candidate sites for supporting alternate signaling pathways are phosphorylation of Ser and/or Thr residues. The murine c-mpl gene encodes a polypeptide predicted to contain a 25-residue secretory leader, a 457-amino acid extracellular domain, a 22-residue transmembrane domain, and a 121-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (12Skoda R.C. Seldin D.C. Chiang M.K. Peichel C.L. Vogt T.F. Leder P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2645-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of the Mpl receptor contains 5 Tyr, 8 Thr, and 13 Ser residues. However, it is clear from both in vitro and in vivo studies that distal truncation of up to one-half of the receptor cytoplasmic domain maintains its capacity to support cell proliferation and differentiation (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Luoh S.M. Stefanich E. Solar G. Steinmetz H. Lipari T. Pestina T.I. Jackson C.W. de Sauvage F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To facilitate our analysis of the Ser and Thr phosphorylation of c-Mpl, we have utilized a truncated form of the receptor bearing the membrane-proximal 69 residues of the cytoplasmic domain (T69), and site-specific Ser and Thr to Ala mutants of this receptor. T69 includes two Tyr residues that are not phosphorylated in response to TPO stimulation in BaF3/mpl cells and contains four Thr and eight Ser residues. In this study, we demonstrated that at least four of the Ser residues in T69 are phosphorylated and that the Thr residues are not modified. Furthermore, multiple substitution of all Ser(P) residues significantly reduced the capacity of the receptor to support cellular proliferation. Moreover we found that the Ser at position 18 is critical for JAK2 binding to the receptor and cellular proliferation although it is neither constitutively nor inducibly phosphorylated. These results provide the first systematic structure-function analyses of the Ser and Thr residues of the c-Mpl receptor. Purified recombinant murine TPO (rmTPO) was the generous gift of Dr. Akihiro Shimosaka (Kirin Pharmaceuticals, Tokyo, Japan). Western blot chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), containing murine c-mpl, was used as a template to make multiple Ser and Thr to Ala mutations using the Quickchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR products were sequenced to confirm the result of mutagenesis with the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The murine interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cell line BaF3 was engineered to express the full-length murine Mpl receptor (BaF3/Mpl), the T69 truncation (BaF3/T69), and the site-directed T69 mutants by electroporation and limiting dilution into 1 mg/ml G418-containing culture medium. Individual clones of each cell type were selected, and multiple clones for each receptor construct were analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA) using a rabbit anti-murine Mpl antibody (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Clones expressing similar levels of surface Mpl receptors were selected for further analysis and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), murine IL-3, and G418. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay as described previously (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with serial concentrations of rmTPO or an optimal level of murine IL-3-conditioned medium for 48 h. Proliferation was expressed as a percentage of maximal murine IL-3-induced growth. Phosphorylation of c-Mpl was studied by incubating cell lines expressing c-Mpl or its mutation in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 14 h and labeling with 2.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h. During the last 10 min of incubation, 200 μmsodium orthovanadate was added to the culture media, and the cells were treated with 25 ng/ml rmTPO or control medium. The receptor was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Mpl antibody (AMM2, a kind gift of Dr. Takashi Kato (Kirin Pharmaceuticals, Takasaki, Japan)) and size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and exposed to BioMax XR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The radioactive bands co-migrating with the 90-kDa c-Mpl or 80-kDa T69 were excised from the membrane and boiled in 6 n HCl (Pierce) for 1 h at 110 °C to allow degradation to phosphoamino acids. Products of this acid hydrolysis were analyzed by one-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis using ninhydrin-stained phosphoamino acid standards (14Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). For phosphopeptide mapping, BaF3/T69 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and T69 receptor proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and excised from the membrane following autoradiography. The radiolabeled proteins were incubated with sequence grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C for 18 h and separated on cellulose coated 20 × 20-cm thin layer chromatography (TLC) glass plates (Merck) in 10% acetic acid, 1% pyridine (v/v) buffer at 1000 V for 2 h at 10 °C. The plate was then used for TLC in the second dimension for 5 h in a buffer of 30% 1-butanol, 30% pyridine, 6% glacial acetic acid (v/v/v). The radioactive spots were visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). BaF3/T69 cells and cells bearing the S18A mutation were incubated in serum- and cytokine-free medium for 14 h, stimulated with or without 25 ng/ml rmTPO for 10 min, and lysed as described previously (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the lysate was measured using the Protein DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). Specific proteins were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described previously using anti-JAK2 and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We previously reported that two tyrosine residues in c-Mpl are phosphorylated after stimulation with TPO (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of c-Mpl includes 13 Ser and 8 Thr residues, but little is known about their phosphorylation status and functional role in TPO-induced signaling. To explore whether some of these residues were constitutively or inducibly phosphorylated, BaF3 cells were engineered to express full-length c-Mpl receptor (BaF3/mpl) or a truncation mutant containing the membrane-proximal 69 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of c-Mpl (Fig. 1, T69) and then metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The phosphorylation status of the receptor was analyzed before and after stimulation with TPO by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig.2). In BaF3/mpl cells, Ser residues were constitutively phosphorylated, and their radioactive intensities were enhanced ∼3-fold following stimulation with TPO (Fig. 2 B). Tyrosine phosphorylation was also markedly enhanced upon stimulation by TPO, but Thr phosphorylation was barely detectable in BaF3/mpl cells under any conditions. Like BaF3/mpl cells, constitutive and TPO-inducible phosphorylation of Ser was also observed in T69 cells. As anticipated from the results of our previous studies utilizing Western blotting with a Tyr(P)-specific antibody (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), neither constitutive nor inducible Tyr phosphorylation of the T69 receptor was detected.Figure 1The Mpl receptors utilized in this study.

A,murine BaF3 cells engineered to express c-Mpl (lanes 1 and2) and T69 (lanes 3 and 4) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The cells were incubated without (lanes 1 and 3) or with (lanes 2 and 4) TPO for 10 min. The receptor was immunoprecipitated with specific antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transferring to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The blot was exposed to film to detect 32P-labeled c-Mpl and T69 protein. B, the bands of c-Mpl and T69 from Awere cut out of the blot and subjected to hydrolysis with 6n HCl, and phosphoamino acid analysis was performed. The positions of serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), and tyrosine (Tyr) are shown in the same figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since one or more of the Ser residues of c-Mpl and T69 were found to be phosphorylated, we performed additional studies to identify which Ser residues were modified. As shown in Fig. 1, a predicted tryptic peptide map suggests that the complete digestion of T69 with trypsin should generate nine peptides, four of which bear one or more potential sites of Ser phosphorylation. To begin to determine the sites of Ser(P), we performed phosphopeptide mapping of BaF3/T69 cells (Fig.3). We found that seven phosphopeptides were reproducibly generated by tryptic digestion of 32P metabolically labeled T69. The intensity of all the radioactive spots was enhanced after stimulation with TPO (Fig. 3 B). Although it is possible that an extracellular domain peptide was labeled, it was more likely that incomplete digestion of the intracellular domain of Mpl was responsible for our finding more than the four predicted labeled peptides. For example, although trypsin digests polypeptides following lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) residues, it cuts poorly if the basic residue is followed by a charged residue. Since one predicted tryptic fragment (SSESTPLPL) has Ser in the first position (Fig. 1), if phosphorylated it might prevent complete trypsin digestion at that site and lead to an extra peptide. Subsequent analysis of a mutant Mpl receptor bearing multiple Ser to Ala mutations (see below) confirmed that all of the receptor phosphorylation events can be accounted for by Ser phosphorylation within the cytoplasmic domain of Mpl. To identify which of the 8 Ser residues within T69 are phosphorylated, multiple Ser to Ala T69 receptor mutants were generated, and phosphopeptide maps of each were determined (Fig.4). As the phosphopeptide map of T69/S18A was identical to T69, we established that Ser-18 was not constitutively or inducibly phosphorylated (compare Figs. 4 A and3 B). The remaining predicted tryptic phosphopeptides all contained more than a single Ser residue, requiring the generation of multiple Ser to Ala mutations. A phosphopeptide map of T69/S37A/S39A lost two radioactive spots compared with that of T69 (Fig.4 B), indicating that either one or both of Ser-37 and Ser-39 were phosphorylated in response to TPO. As this mutant retained full proliferative activity (see below), we did not further analyze these sites. Like T69/S37A/S39A, the T69/S46A/S53A double mutant also lost two 32P-radiolabeled spots in the phosphopeptide map (Fig.4 C). A single T69/S46A mutant also lost the same spots as T69/S46A/S53A (Fig. 4 D), indicating that Ser-46 is phosphorylated. This conclusion could be extended; our finding an identical phosphopeptide map of T69/S53A and T69 indicated that only Ser-46 was phosphorylated within this peptide (compare Figs.4 E and 3 B). There are three Ser residues and one Thr residue in the last predicted tryptic peptide, SSESTPLL (Fig. 1). Analysis of the T69/S61A/S62A/S64A/T65A mutant revealed the loss of two radiolabeled peptides (Fig. 4 F), consistent with at least one of the three Ser sites being phosphorylated, with partial tryptic digestion prior to Ser-61 accounting for the loss of two phosphopeptides. Additional T69 mutants were analyzed to dissect the phosphorylation status of this region. Interestingly, compared with T69, T69/S61A/S62A (Fig. 4 G) and T69/S64A/T65A (Fig.4 H) both lost the same spots as did the T69/S61A/S62A/S64A/T65A mutants (Fig. 4 F). It is possible that like the p55 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, heat shock factor-1, and rhodopsin proteins (15Van Linden A.A. Cottin V. Leu C. Riches D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6996-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the results in Fig. 4, G andH, indicate that Ser-61 (due to the partial digestion at Lys-60/Ser-61) and Ser-64 (since Thr-65 is not phosphorylated), and possibly Ser-62, are phosphorylated in TPO-stimulated BaF3 cells bearing these mutant receptors. Finally, to be certain that all of the sites of Ser phosphorylation were accounted for by Ser-37, Ser-39, Ser-46, Ser-61, Ser-62 and Ser-64, a mutant Thr-69 receptor bearing Ser to Ala changes at all these sites (and at Thr-65; referred as T69/S37A/S39A/S46A/S61A/S62A/S64A/T65A) was tested and found to be devoid of Ser(P) in 32P-labeled, TPO-stimulated BaF3 cells (Fig. 5). In these experiments the same number of 32P-labeled T69 cells were used as a positive labeling control. This result confirmed that these residues contain the sole sites for Ser phosphorylation of the proximal 69 residues of the c-Mpl receptor.Figure 532 P labeling of T69/S37A/S39A/S46A/S61A/S62A/S64A/T65A cells.

By using only clones that express the same level of the mutant receptors as seen in BaF3/T69 cells, we found that BaF3 cells bearing the S37A/S39A, S46A, S53A, S61A/S62A, and S64A/T65A mutant T69 receptors displayed a nearly identical dose-response proliferation curve as BaF3/T69 cells (Fig.6, A and C–G). To exclude the possibility that the function of these Ser residues is redundant, we also tested T69/S37A/S39A/S46A/S61A/S62A/S64A/T65A cells; we found >50% reduction of proliferation in response to TPO stimulation (Fig. 6 H). These results suggest that although any single Ser(P) may not be crucial, the presence of some Ser(P) within the first 69 cytoplasmic domain of Mpl contribute to the capacity of the Mpl receptor to support the signals responsible for cell proliferation. Fig.6 B displays the proliferation response of BaF3/T69/S18A cells; in essence, this single mutation nearly abrogated the capacity of this receptor to support BaF3 cell growth. As Ser-18 resides within box 1 of Mpl, the site of JAK2 binding, we examined the hypothesis that loss of the JAK2 signal was responsible for extremely poor response of BaF3/T69/S18A cells to TPO. JAK2 activation in BaF3/T69/S18A cells was analyzed by Western blotting. In contrast to BaF3/T69 cells, where JAK2 kinase was inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated within minutes of exposure to TPO, its phosphorylation was markedly reduced in T69/S18A cells (Fig. 7 A) despite equal protein loading (Fig. 7 B). Although JAK2 binds to T69 constitutively, and their association is increased by TPO stimulation (Fig. 7 C), we could not detect JAK2 binding to the T69/S18A receptor before or after stimulation with TPO (Fig. 7 C). These results indicate that Ser-18 contributes to JAK2 binding and is thereby responsible for cellular proliferation in BaF3 cells. A similar analysis was conducted using T69/S37A/S39A/S46A/S61A/S62A/S64A/T65A cells, to test whether their impaired response to TPO is due to altered JAK2 activation. As shown in Fig. 7, E and F, we found that JAK2 activation was reduced in the mutant cells in proportion to the level of TPO-induced proliferation. The molecular basis for cytokine responsiveness and cellular proliferation is an intensely studied topic. Several groups have worked out many of the details of the signals that emanate from c-Mpl tyrosine phosphorylation, but little is known of the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the receptor. In this study we demonstrate that both full-length c-Mpl and T69 are constitutively phosphorylated on Ser, the levels of which are enhanced following stimulation with TPO. The most important findings in the studies presented here are as follows. 1) We have mapped the Ser and Thr phosphorylation pattern of the region between the transmembrane domain and Leu-69 of the murine Mpl receptor (Ser-37 and/or Ser-39, Ser-46, Ser-61, Ser-64, and possibly Ser-62 are phosphorylated, and Ser-18 and Ser-53 are definitely not phosphorylated), a region sufficient to support cellular proliferation. 2) Phosphorylation of Ser residues of Mpl in BaF3 cells contributes substantially to the capacity of the Mpl receptor to support cellular proliferation (Figs. 6 H). 3) Ser-18 is critical for the interaction of Mpl and JAK2 and thus is vital for TPO-induced signal transduction. The erythropoietin (EPO) receptor is also known to be phosphorylated on Ser and Tyr but not on Thr residues (18Sawyer S.T. Penta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Since TPO and EPO and their receptors display sequence similarities and are almost certainly related on an evolutionary basis, our finding of a conserved phosphorylation pattern is interesting. In contrast, the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor β subunit and the interleukin (IL)-6 receptor β subunit are phosphorylated on Tyr, Ser, and Thr residues (19Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1993; 260: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 20Rao P. Mufson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6886-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the functional relevance of Ser and Thr phosphorylation of cytokine receptors is poorly understood. To explore this aspect we used Ser to Ala receptor mutants and assessed their phosphorylation and capacity to support cell proliferation. We found that although alteration of any single Ser residue (except Ser-18) failed to significantly impact the capacity of Mpl to support cellular proliferation, alteration of all sites of Ser(P) from the receptor substantially blunted BaF3 cell growth at all concentrations of TPO tested (Fig. 6 H). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the tertiary structure of the cytoplasmic domain of Mpl might be subtly altered, leading to a global reduction in function, it is also possible that only specific signals are affected. Furthermore, we found the capacity of the mutant receptor to stimulate JAK2 activation was reduced proportionately to the diminished TPO-induced proliferation of these cells. Interestingly, an observation reported by Sawyer and Penta (18Sawyer S.T. Penta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) may relate to our findings. These investigators found that only a highly modified form of the EPO receptor, which was glycosylated and phosphorylated on Ser residues, associated with JAK2. Perhaps the most surprising result to come from our studies is that alteration of Ser-18 nearly eliminated association of Mpl and JAK2 and caused a profound reduction in the capacity of this receptor to support cell proliferation. We do not feel this conclusion is due to trivial technical problems, as the conclusion is based on the following: 1) performing multiple proliferation assays employing three separate clones of BaF3/T69/S18A cells; 2) these same cell clones grew well in murine IL-3; 3) surface expression in each line was equivalent to that of the truncated but otherwise wild type T69 receptor; and 4) theM r of the immunoprecipitated receptor matched that of T69 (Fig. 7). Thus, there is ample evidence that technical reasons do not account for our failure to observe a proliferative response to TPO in these cells. Murakami and colleagues (21Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) were the first to identify the “box 1” PXXP or PXP motif conserved in the intracytoplasmic, membrane-proximal region of all members of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and recognized its importance in cytokine-induced activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. However, alignment of these sequences from multiple cytokine receptors that employ JAK2 (EPO receptor, GM-CSF receptor, Mpl, and gp130) reveals that the internal positions between the two Pro residues are poorly conserved, suggesting they play little role in JAK recruitment or activation. Although cytokine receptors were initially thought to recruit cytoplasmic JAK kinases to the receptor upon ligand-induced dimerization, more recent studies suggest that the Mpl receptor, like most hematopoietic cytokine receptors, displays a basal level of receptor-JAK interaction. The results shown in Fig. 7 indicate that mutation of Ser to Ala at position 18 eliminates all or most of the constitutive association of Mpl with JAK2, as well as that induced by TPO binding. Thus, JAK2 is very minimally phosphorylated in response to TPO stimulation of BaF3/T69/S18A cells. The loss of TPO-induced proliferation in these cells is thus consistent with the majority of studies of Mpl signaling indicating that JAK2 activation is critical for TPO-induced cell signaling (4Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Drachman J.G. Millett K.M. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13480-13484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This result contradicts that of Dorsch and colleagues (11Dorsch M. Fan P.D. Danial N.N. Rothman P.B. Goff S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1947-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in which a membrane-proximal deletion mutant of Mpl, which retained the box 1 and all distal sequence motifs but lost JAK2 activation, retained its capacity to support cellular proliferation in a TPO-dependent manner. The explanation for the discrepancy of the findings is not immediately clear, but our results add to the accumulating evidence that JAK2 activation is vital for hematopoiesis. Moreover, the structural basis for the loss of JAK2 binding and TPO-induced activation in the S18A Mpl mutant is not clear; whether the potential for hydrogen bonding through Ser exceeds that of Ala at position 18 or whether a subtle tertiary structural change was introduced by Ser to Ala substitution at this position are uncertain. The results of our Ser(P) mapping experiments might also shed some light on the process of Ser phosphorylation in cytokine receptors. For example, T69/S61A/S62A and T69/S64A/T65A cells lost the same radiolabeled phosphopeptides in mapping experiments, suggesting that phosphorylation of residues Ser-61, Ser-62, and/or Ser-64 is dependent on one or two of the other Ser(P) residues. This result is similar to that with Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the p55 TNF receptor, where phosphorylation of Thr-236 and Ser-270 enable subsequent phosphorylation of Ser-240 and Ser-244 (15Van Linden A.A. Cottin V. Leu C. Riches D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6996-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similar hierarchical and synergistic phosphorylation events were also reported for rhodopsin and heat shock factor-1 (16Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17Zhang L. Sports C.D. Osawa S. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14762-14768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that phosphorylation of Ser-61, Ser-62, or Ser-64 induces a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain of c-Mpl allowing other sites to undergo phosphorylation. In the human GM-CSF receptor β subunit, it was recently reported that Ser-538 binds to 14-3-3 ζ protein in vivo and in vitro (23Stomski F.C. Dottore M. Winnall W. Guthridge M.A. Woodcock J. Bagley C.J. Thomas D.T. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the 14-3-3 molecule is known to bind to c-Raf and lead to MAPK activation, it is possible phosphorylated Ser residues in c-Mpl also bind to 14-3-3 proteins contributing to cellular proliferation and survival. We do not yet know the Ser kinase responsible for phosphorylation of c-Mpl. Liu et al. (24Liu L. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22422-22427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) preliminarily identified an H7 and staurosporine-sensitive 110-kDa Ser/Thr kinase constitutively associated with the IL-3 receptor. Interestingly we also observed an ∼110-kDa polypeptide labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and associated with c-Mpl and T69 (Figs. 2 and 5). Based on the sequence surrounding the sites of known Ser phosphorylation of Mpl (i.e. SXX(D/E)), other candidate kinases are casein kinase (CK) I and CKII. CKI is known to phosphorylate the TNF receptor (25Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Declercq W. Van Lint J. Vandenabele P. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23293-23299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, if Ser-37 is phosphorylated, it is immediately followed by Pro and hence represents a site for a Pro-directed Ser/Thr kinase, such as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38MAPK, and p44/42MAPK. Although it is clear that p44/p42MAPK is activated by TPO stimulation (9Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the activity of CKI and CKII following exposure to TPO has not yet been studied. Further work will be necessary to establish the responsible Ser kinases for c-Mpl phosphorylation. In conclusion, we have identified a critical role for the Ser residue at position 18 of Mpl in TPO-induced cell proliferation, and we have mapped several sites of receptor Ser phosphorylation. The functional role of these individual sites appears at least partially redundant for cellular proliferation, and it remains possible that other physiologic functions of Mpl, such as receptor internalization or cellular differentiation, are also dependent on the modification of these sites. Only further studies of the Mpl receptor will provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of platelet production. We appreciate the kind gift of rmTPO from Dr. Akihiro Shimosaka and the anti-murine Mpl antibody from Dr. Takashi Kato. We also appreciate the technical assistance for flow cytometry by Kathy Allen and our discussions with Dr. Kazuo Fujikawa on phosphopeptide mapping."

However, as the inner membrane is not permeable to long chain fatty acyl-CoAs, they enter the mitochondrial matrix space via a “carnitine system” consisting of three steps (1McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab.

Because CPTI is responsible for the first rate-limiting step in oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria, considerable attention has been paid to its structural and functional features (for recent review, see Ref. 3McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of CPTI, liver type and muscle type (M-CPTI), are expressed in mammals. Although the primary structures of these CPTI isoforms are similar, their K m values for carnitine and susceptibilities to malonyl-CoA inhibition are different. Furthermore, their tissue distributions are quite different (3McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). M-CPTI is dominantly expressed in major energy consuming cells, such as heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and testis. In contrast, liver type CPTI is expressed in cells that do not show extensive energy metabolism, such as liver, kidney, lung, intestine, and pancreas. We first isolated cDNA clones of M-CPTI from rat brown adipose tissue and human heart (4Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H.

Genomics. 1998; 48: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) determined the gene structure of rat M-CPTI, in which transcription and translation are initiated at exon 1 and exon 2, respectively. In contrast, we (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and van der Leij et al.

Acta. 1997; 1352: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that, in the human M-CPTI gene, there are two additional noncoding exons 1A and 1B, which are used alternatively, in the 5′-upstream region of exon 2 containing the translation initiation codon. We suggested that the 5′ end of exon 1A and/or its upstream region as well as the 5′ end of exon 1B function are transcription initiation sites (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Yuet al. (9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) found that transcription is initiated alternatively at two noncoding exons U and M located upstream of exon 2 in the human M-CPTI gene. Exon M corresponds exactly to exon 1B, whereas the 5′ end of exon U is located about 40 base pairs downstream of the 5′ end of exon 1A. These results suggested that the transcription initiation mechanism(s) of M-CPTI is not simple. In addition, a gene encoding a choline kinase-like protein was found to be located only about 300 base pairs upstream of exon 1A of the human M-CPTI gene with the same strand direction (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Quite recently, the gene of a mouse choline kinase like protein was reported to encode choline/ethanolamine kinase-β (CK/EK-β) (10Aoyama C. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Ishidate K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 452-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the gene encoding the human choline kinase-like protein should be the human CK/EK-β gene. Because this gene is located in close proximity to the M-CPTI gene, it is possible that there is a regulatory element(s) that controls transcription of M-CPTI in the CK/EK-β gene. For understanding the transcription mechanism of the human M-CPTI gene, we studied its gene structure and found novel transcripts containing exons of both the CK/EK-β and M-CPTI gene. Human poly(A)+RNAs, genomic DNA and a placental genomic DNA library were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), and T4 RNA ligase and EX Taq polymerase were from TaKaRa Shuzo (Tokyo, Japan).

Open table in a new tab Poly(A)+ RNAs of human tissues were reverse transcribed with random hexamer, oligo(dT) primer (T17 Adp (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) or the human M-CPTI-specific primers. The nucleotide sequences of human M-CPTI-specific primers P1, P2, and P3 were based on that of the human M-CPTI gene (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After reverse transcription, the reaction mixtures were treated with NaOH to hydrolyze mRNA. The single-stranded cDNAs (ss-cDNAs) obtained were used as templates in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single strand ligation to ss-cDNA-PCR (SLIC-PCR) and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′ RACE). The cDNA clones corresponding to the 5′-upstream region of mRNA of human M-CPTI were isolated by SLIC-PCR (12Edwards J.B. Delort J. Mallet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5227-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Chen Z. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with synthetic oligonucleotides of the adapter primer A (3′-H2N-CCGTTACAGCTGGAGGGATGTTGGGCTTAAGGATGp-5′), adapter primer B (5′-GGCAATGTCGACCTCCCTACAAC-3′), and adapter primer C (5′-CTCCCTACAACCCGAATTCCTAC-3′). By using T4 RNA ligase, adapter primer A was attached to the 3′ end of ss-cDNAs of human heart and skeletal muscle obtained by reverse transcription with random hexamer or T17 Adp. For amplifying cDNAs encoding M-CPTI, the first PCR was carried out using adapter primer B/P4. For selecting M-CPTI cDNAs, the first PCR mixtures were diluted and used for the second PCR, using adapter primer C/P5. SLIC-PCR products were subcloned into plasmid vectors, and their nucleotide sequences were determined by the chain termination method. Two kinds of ss-cDNAs of human tissues were used as templates of PCR: 1) a mixture of reverse transcription products obtained with random hexamer and T17 Adp and 2) ss-cDNAs of M-CPTI obtained with the specific primers P1, P2, and P3. To amplify cDNA corresponding to the transcript containing the CK/EK-β gene and M-CPTI gene, oligonucleotide primers of P6, P7, P8, and P9 corresponding to various exons of the CK/EK-β gene were used in combination with primer P10 corresponding to exon 3 of the M-CPTI gene. The primers P11 and P12 corresponding to exon 1A/U and 1B/M of M-CPTI gene, respectively, were also used. For confirmation of the RT-PCR products using ss-cDNA obtained by reverse transcription with primer P3, Southern blot analysis was carried out using a cDNA probe corresponding to exon 2 to exon 3 of human M-CPTI (positions −1 to +261 according to Ref. 5Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Yamanaka Y. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The probe DNA was prepared by multipriming with [α-32P]dCTP. Human genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with restriction enzymes, and reaction mixtures were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Then the separated DNA fragments were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and hybridized with the probe. Human genomic DNA clone HG11 containing parts of the CK/EK-β gene (5Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Yamanaka Y. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and HindIII and used as a probe after radiolabeling by the multipriming method. The genomic DNA clone HG21 containing the human CK/EK-β gene was isolated from a human placental genomic DNA library by screening with the DNA probe used for Southern blot analysis of the human genome. The clone HG21 was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and DNA fragments were subcloned into plasmid vectors and sequenced. Three types of PCR were employed to isolate and characterize the cDNA encoding human CK/EK-β: 1) RT-PCR using ss-cDNA of human heart with a primer pair of P13/P14 prepared by comparison of the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA of human CK/EK-β with those of cDNAs of rat and mouse CK/EK-β (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); 2) for isolation of cDNA in the 3′-downstream region of P14, 3′ RACE using ss-cDNA obtained by reverse transcription with T17 Adp with a primer pair of P8/Adp (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and a subsequent second reaction using the diluted first PCR mixture with a primer pair of P15/Adp; and 3) for isolation of cDNA in the 5′-upstream region of P13, SLIC-PCR with primer pairs of the adapter primers B/P16 and C/P17. cDNAs obtained by RT-PCR, 3′ RACE, and SLIC-PCR were subcloned into plasmid vectors and sequenced. From the nucleotide sequences of cDNA and genomic DNA, the intron-exon junctions of the human CK/EK-β gene were determined. The nucleotide sequences of genomic DNA and cDNA of human CK/EK-β have been submitted to the DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Data Base under accession numbers AB029885 and AB029886, respectively. The structure of the upstream region of the human M-CPTI gene reported to date (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) is schematically summarized in Fig.1 A. In the upstream of exon 2 containing the translation initiation codon, there are two additional exons, which are used alternatively, i.e. exon 1A and 1B determined from the results of 5′ RACE by us (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or exon U and M from the results of primer extension by Yu et al. (9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Exon M corresponds to exon 1B, whereas the nucleotide of the 5′ end of exon U is the cytosine base shown by the symbol (#) located inside exon 1A. We tried to determine the exact 5′ end of the human M-CPTI message for understanding its transcription mechanism. First, we carried out SLIC-PCR. Amplified cDNAs derived from heart and skeletal muscle were obtained by reverse transcription with random hexamer and T17 Adp. These four cDNA samples showed almost the same electrophoretic patterns, and their nucleotide sequences were determined after subcloning. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the SLIC-PCR clones obtained with that of the human M-CPTI gene (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed that most cDNA clones contained either exon 1A or 1B to various extents, both being linked to exon 2, as we reported previously (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All clones containing exon 1B/M contained its 5′ terminus or more downstream region, whereas clones containing exon 1A were diverse, starting at more upstream and downstream regions of exon U. Interestingly, the clone HHR-A10 from heart mRNA was found to contain a sequence unexpected from the human M-CPTI gene. The determined nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone HHR-A10 is shown in Fig. 1 B. It contained the sequence of exon 1A from the third cytosine, and there were nucleotides unexpected from the sequence of the upstream region of exon 1A, as marked by asterisks in Fig. 1, in its 5′ region. Homology analysis showed that the unexpected sequence was derived from the 3′-untranslated region of the CK/EK-β gene located upstream of human M-CPTI, and this nucleotide chain was linked to exon 1A, conforming to the GT-AG rule of intron/exon boundary. These results suggested that HHR-A10 was derived from the mRNA, in which the 3′-untranslated region of the CK/EK-β gene is directly linked to the third cytosine base of exon 1A of the human M-CPTI gene by splicing (Fig. 1 A). To confirm the existence of a transcript(s) containing exons of both the CK/EK-β gene and M-CPTI gene, we carried out RT-PCR of mRNA of human heart and skeletal muscle using the primer pairs P6/P10 and P7/P10, as shown in Fig. 2 A. The primer P6 corresponds to the 3′-untranslated region of the CK/EK-β gene containing the nucleotide sequence of the HHR-A10 clone marked by an asterisk, P7 corresponds to a more upstream region, and P10 corresponds to exon 3 of the M-CPTI gene. On agarose gel electrophoreogram of these RT-PCR products, we detected two significant bands caused by amplified products in both heart and skeletal muscle with both the primer pairs P6/P10 and P7/P10, as shown in Fig. 2 B. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that these products from both sources contained the 3′-untranslated region of exon 11 of the CK/EK-β gene and exons of the M-CPTI gene, although their organizations were different. Namely, the PCR product 1 from the slower migration band contained the 3′-untranslated region of the CK/EK-β gene and exon 1A, exon 2, and exon 3 of the M-CPTI gene without exon 1B, as in HHR-A10. Here again, the first two nucleotides of exon 1A were deleted according to the GT-AG rule. The PCR product 2 from the faster migration band contained the same CK/EK-β gene region as that of product 1, and its 3′ end correctly linked to exon 2 and 3 of the M-CPTI gene, conforming to the GT-AG rule. All the nucleotide sequences of exons of the M-CPTI region in both products were completely the same as those reported (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results clearly showed that clone HHR-A10 from heart was not an artifact of SLIC-PCR and that transcripts containing both exons of these two genes really existed in human heart and skeletal muscle in considerable amounts. In addition, as the band intensity of product 1 was greater than that of product 2 in preparations from both sources, the splicing between exon 11 of CK/EK-β and exon 1A of M-CPTI was suggested to take place more easily than that between exon 11 and exon 2. As described above, we found transcripts containing exons of both the CK/EK-β gene and M-CPTI gene in heart and skeletal muscle. The gene structure of human M-CPTI has been well studied (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8van der Leij F.R. Takens J. van der Veen A.Y. Terpstra P. Kuipers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and its localization is reported to be on chromosome 22q13.3 (16Britton C.H. Mackey D.W. Esser V. Foster D.W. Burns D.K. Yarnall D.P. Froguel P. McGarry J.D. Genomics. 1997; 40: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the human CK/EK-β gene has not been studied extensively, but it is registered as a choline kinase isolog (384D8_3) on human chromosome 22q13 BAC clone CIT987SK-384D8 (data base accession number U62317). Therefore, before performing detailed analysis of overlapping transcripts, we characterized the human CK/EK-β gene. First, we performed Southern blot analysis of the CK/EK-β gene. A genomic DNA fragment of the 3′ region of the human CK/EK-β gene, the organization of which was estimated from the structure of the mouse gene (10Aoyama C. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Ishidate K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 452-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was prepared as a probe (Fig.3 A). This was hybridized with samples of human genomic DNA digested with various restriction enzymes. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the probe DNA was hybridized with only one DNA fragment in all samples. Furthermore, the lengths of all the hybridized DNA fragments were in agreement with those expected from the nucleotide sequence of the registered sequence in the human chromosome 22q13 BAC clone CIT987SK-384D8, as shown in Fig. 3 C. The results of Southern blot analysis showed that there is no other gene having a similar nucleotide sequence to that of the 3′ region of CK/EK-β used as a probe and that CK/EK-β is encoded only by the gene located in the upstream region of the M-CPTI gene in the human genome. Thus, we concluded that the possible formation of overlapping transcripts from the other genomic region was excluded and that the overlapping transcripts were derived from functional genes of CK/EK-β and M-CPTI located on chromosome 22q13. Comparison of the registered nucleotide sequence of the 22q13 BAC clone CIT987SK-384D8 with those of rat and mouse CK/EK-β cDNAs (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggested that there was a misreading in the registered nucleotide sequence. To determine the exact gene structure, we isolated the genomic DNA and cDNA of human CK/EK-β. Because the genomic DNA clone HG11 isolated by us (5Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Yamanaka Y. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) did not contain the whole region of the CK/EK-β gene, a human genomic DNA library was screened again and HG21 clone was isolated. By comparison of the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA with that of cDNA obtained by RT-PCR, 3′ RACE, and SLIC-PCR, we determined the structure of the human CK/EK-β gene. The gene organization and nucleotide sequence of cDNA of human CK/EK-β determined are shown in Fig. 4(A and B, respectively). In addition, the detailed structures of the 3′ region of the CK/EK-β gene and 5′ region of M-CPTI are shown in Fig. 5.Figure 5Detailed structure of the junction region of the human CK/EK-β gene and M-CPTI gene.The nucleotide sequence between the 3′ region of the CK/EK-β gene and the 5′ region of M-CPTI gene is shown. Nucleotides in exons and introns are shown by capital and lowercase letters, respectively, and the deduced amino acids are shown by the one-letter abbreviation codes under the nucleotides. Nucleotides are numbered taking the adenine base in the translation initiation codon of human M-CPTI as +1, and their numbers are shown on the left margin(7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Arrows represent splice sites in the overlapping transcript. Closed, open, and hatched boxes are as for Fig. 2. In exon 11 of the CK/EK-β gene, the translation termination codon is marked by an asterisk, the nucleotide sequence of the underlined AATAAA represents a poly(A) additional signal, and the 3′ end was determined by 3′ RACE. The transcription initiation site of exon U of the M-CPTI gene (9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) is marked by #.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The gene encoding human CK/EK-β was found to consist of at least 11 exons and was suggested to encode a protein of about 45 kDa consisting of 395 amino acids, like those of rat and mouse, which encode a protein of 45 kDa having 394 amino acids (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of human CK/EK-β was about 86% homologous with those of rat and mouse. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence determined by us with that of the 22q13 BAC clone showed that one guanine base at position +43 in exon 1 (here the nucleotide sequence was numbered taking the adenine base in the putative translation initiation codon as +1) was skipped in the BAC clone. Because of this misreading, the human CK/EK-β gene (choline kinase isolog) in the registered data has been predicted to encode a 49.7-kDa protein having 433 amino acids. In the first part of this study, we used a mixture of reverse transcription products obtained with random hexamer and T17 Adp as a template and amplified cDNA fragments containing both regions of the human CK/EK-β gene and M-CPTI gene (Fig. 2). To characterize the organization of the overlapping transcripts, RT-PCR with several primer pairs seemed to be efficient. However, the cDNA corresponding to the overlapping transcripts might also be artificially formed by PCR, when a particular region of the genomic DNA is transcribed into two different messages and reverse transcription is carried out with random primer or oligo(dT) primer, as shown in Fig.6. To determine the exact organization of these overlapping transcripts, PCR should be performed using a template prepared with several specific primers. Therefore, we prepared ss-cDNAs of human M-CPTI by reverse transcription with oligonucleotides P1, P2, and P3, which correspond to exons 4, 15, and 20 of M-CPTI, respectively (TableI), and performed PCR with these ss-cDNAs as specific templates. Namely, the messages expressed in human heart were reverse transcribed with the primer P1, P2, or P3, all of which specifically annealed the message of M-CPTI, and PCRs were performed using these ss-cDNAs as templates with various primer pairs shown in Fig. 7 A and Table I. The results of agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products stained with ethidium bromide are shown in Fig. 7 B. When ss-cDNAs obtained by reverse transcription of mRNAs with primers P1 and P2, referred to as P1 and P2 ss-cDNAs, respectively, were used as templates, only a significant band of the expected size from the gene structure of M-CPTI was observed in each amplification by primer pairs of P11/P10 and P12/P10. Nucleotide sequence analyses of these products showed that they contained exons 1A, 2, and 3 of the M-CPT1 gene and exons 1B, 2, and 3, respectively. In contrast, two bands, a significant band with lower electrophoretic mobility and a weak band with higher mobility, were detected with the primer pairs P7/P10, P8/P10, and P9/P10. After subcloning, sequencing of the products giving the strong band with P9/P10 using P1 and P2 ss-cDNAs showed that both products contained exons 9, 10, and 11 of the CK/EK-β gene and exons 1A, 2, and 3 of the M-CPTI gene. In addition, both products giving the weak band contained the same exons of both genes, but exon 1A was deleted. In these products, the 3′ end of the CK/EK-β region was connected by proper splicing to the 5′ end of the M-CPTI region in similar manners to those shown in Fig.2 B. From the electrophoretic mobilities, the products of P7/P10 and P8/P10 with P1 and P2 ss-cDNAs were expected to have similar overlapping structures. When ss-cDNA prepared by reverse transcription with P3 (P3 ss-cDNA) was used as a template, a product derived from the M-CPTI message was detected with both the primer pairs P11/P10 and P12/P10 as in RT-PCR with P1 and P2 ss-cDNA, but no clear electrophoretic bands were observed with primer pairs of P7/P10, P8/P10, and P9/P10 (Fig. 7 B). However, as shown in Fig. 7 C, two products having expected sizes in all PCRs with P3 ss-cDNA were detected by Southern blot analysis. The nucleotide sequences of the products of P9/P10 with P3 ss-cDNA showed that they contained the same sequences as those of corresponding products of P1 and P2 ss-cDNAs. Because primer P3 corresponds to exon 20 of the M-CPTI gene, the products of P9/P10 with P3 ss-cDNA should be derived from messages containing the sequence between exon 9 of the CK/EK-β gene and exon 20 of the M-CPTI gene, although their amounts were low (Fig.7 A). These messages were the most possible extended transcripts covering the entire region of the RT-PCR performed in this study. The amounts of PCR products obtained with the primer pairs P11/P10 and P12/P10 using P1, P2, and P3 ss-cDNAs were always greater than those obtained with the primer pairs P7/P10, P8/P10, and P9/P10 (Fig.7 B). Therefore, the structural gene of human M-CPTI starts mainly at either exon 1A/U or 1B/M, as reported (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, PCR products were distinctly observed with the primer pair P9/P10 with P1, P2, and P3 ss-cDNAs, showing that there were definite amounts of overlapping transcripts of the CK/EK-β gene and M-CPTI gene. In addition, the band intensities of RT-PCR products with P2 ss-cDNA were lower than those with P1 ss-cDNA, and those with P3 ss-cDNA were significantly lower than those with P1 and P2 ss-cDNAs. This could be due, at least in part, to the fact that reverse transcription became inefficient as its range became wider. Previously, we isolated a cDNA clone containing exon 1A of the human M-CPTI gene by 5′ RACE (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Yu et al.(9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.C. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) reported that transcription starts at the 5′ end of exon U located inside exon 1A. To determine the exact gene structure of human M-CPTI, in this study we isolated various cDNA clones containing the 5′-upstream region of M-CPTI by SLIC-PCR instead of 5′ RACE. Unexpectedly, we isolated a clone HHR-A10 from heart mRNA contained the 3′-untranslated region of the CK/EK-β gene. RT-PCR (Fig. 2) and Southern blot analysis of the human genome (Fig. 3) showed that there were distinct transcripts containing both exons of the functional CK/EK-β and M-CPTI genes in human heart and skeletal muscle. In the overlapping transcripts containing exon 1A of M-CPTI, the first two nucleotides adenine and guanine of exon 1A were always excluded because of splicing according to the GT-AG rule. Therefore, it is possible that the reported cDNA, which started at the 5′ end of exon 1A obtained by 5′ RACE (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was not derived from overlapping transcripts and could have been derived from another transcript initiated at exon 1A or a more upstream region. These results suggested that the transcription of M-CPTI is “loosely” controlled and is initiated at multiple sites. It should be noted that because of the existence of definite amounts of the overlapping transcripts, the amount of mRNA of human M-CPTI will be estimated as higher than it really is, when the amount is determined from a part of its message by such methods as RT-PCR and RNase protection assay. Overlapping genes are commonly observed in prokaryotes, bacteriophages, and viruses (17Normark S. Bergström S. Edlund T. Grundström T. Jaurin B. Lindberg F.P. Olsson O. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1983; 17: 499-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, they are quite rare in mammals. In 1986, Williams and Fried (18Williams T. Fried M. Nature. 1986; 322: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) first found the overlapping of two unknown mouse genes with opposite directions. In this case, both strands of a particular genomic region of 133 bases were utilized as templates for transcription. Overlapping transcription using the same DNA strand in mammals, like those of the human CK/EK-β and M-CPTI genes, was first reported for genes of the bovine myosin I heavy chain-like protein and preprotachykinin B by Hoshimaru and Nakanishi (19Hoshimaru M.

Subsequently, overlapping genes with the same strand direction were reported for the mouse RNA polymerase II promoter motif and the first intron of the β-glucuronidase gene (20Wang B. Korfhagen T.R.

Chem. 1988; 263: 15841-15844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter gene and choline acetyltransferase gene in humans and rats (21Erickson J.D. Varoqui H. Schafer M.K. Modi W. Diebler M.F. Weihe E. Rand J. Eiden L.E. Bonner T.I. Usdin T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21929-21932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bejanin S.

Of these, the genes of the myosin I heavy chain-like protein and preprotachykinin B are located close together, and the overlapping region is transcribed in both messages. However, unlike the overlapping transcripts of CK/EK-β and M-CPTI genes, the splice sites in this overlapping region are not completely the same, resulting in the formation of exons with different nucleotide sequences in both genes. There should be at least four possibilities for formation of such overlapping transcripts between CK/EK-β and M-CPTI genes, as shown in Fig. 8. Namely, 1) incomplete termination of the CK/EK-β message, in which transcription does not terminate at the 3′ end of CK/EK-β gene but proceeds to certain regions of the M-CPTI gene such as to a cluster of poly(A) additional signals in the intron between exon 7 and exon 8 (7Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (possibility A); 2) transcription of the M-CPTI gene from certain regions of CK/EK-β through the 3′ end of the M-CPTI gene (possibility B); 3) transcription initiated at certain regions of CK/EK-β gene and termination in a certain region of the M-CPTI gene such as at its intron between exons 7 and 8 (possibility C); and 4) transcription initiated from the transcription initiation site of the CK/EK-β gene to the 3′ end of the M-CPTI gene (possibility D). In the case of possibility D, a message containing both the open reading frames of CK/EK-β and M-CPTI should be produced. The results of PCRs in various regions between exon 9 of the CK/EK-β gene and exon 3 of the M-CPTI gene using specific ss-cDNAs of M-CPT as templates showed that most messages of human M-CPTI started at exon 1A/U and exon 1B/M. In addition, we obtained cDNAs containing the region between exon 9 of the CK/EK-β gene and exon 3 of the M-CPTI gene in PCR using P3 ss-cDNA (Fig. 7). Because primer P3 corresponds to exon 20 located downstream of the translation termination codon in exon 19 of the M-CPTI gene, we concluded that there are overlapping transcripts containing the region between exon 9 of the CK/EK-β gene and exon 20 of the M-CPTI gene, which is the most possible extended transcript of RT-PCR in this study. These overlapping transcripts contain the open reading frame of M-CPTI (possibilities B and D). The amounts of RT-PCR products with P3 ss-cDNA were apparently much lower than those with P1 and P2 ss-cDNAs corresponding to exon 4 and exon 15 of the M-CPTI gene, respectively. This could be due to either or both the facts that: 1) there is a 3′-splice variant lacking exon 20 of the M-CPTI gene (8van der Leij F.R. Takens J. van der Veen A.Y. Terpstra P. Kuipers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that cannot be used as a template of reverse transcription with primer P3 and 2) the production of ss-cDNA from the 3′ region of the M-CPTI transcript using P3 primer is more difficult than those using P1 and P2 primers because of a wide range of reverse transcription of more than 2 kilobases of its entire message. In addition to these overlapping transcripts, there could be overlapping transcripts that terminated between primers P1 and P2 (possibilities A and C). However, this seems unlikely from the fact that the intensities of electrophoretic bands of the products using P2 ss-cDNA were not significantly lower than those using P1 ss-cDNA. The lower amounts of the products with P2 ss-cDNA could be a result of inefficient reverse transcription covering a wider range from exon 15. Because the nucleotide chains of overlapping transcripts between exon 9 of the CK/EK-β gene and exon 3 of the M-CPTI gene were spliced as observed with “ordinary messages” of both genes with the exception of their boundary region, it is possible that the message transcribed from the transcription initiation site of the CK/EK-β gene proceeds to the region of the M-CPTI gene. Accordingly, there could be an overlapping transcript containing the region from the 5′ end of the CK/EK-β gene to the 3′ end of the M-CPTI gene (possibility D). Then how are these overlapping transcripts produced? The 3′ end of the human CK/EK-β gene is located about 300 and 1000 base pairs upstream of the 5′ ends of exon 1A and exon 2 of the M-CPTI gene, respectively. With such a proximate organization of the two genes, the transcription of the CK/EK-β gene may proceed to the M-CPTI gene, and splicing may take place between the last exon 11 of CK/EK-β and exon 1A or exon 2 of M-CPTI before addition of the poly(A) tail or without termination of transcription. Therefore, the human CK/EK-β gene and the proximate M-CPTI gene should be useful for understanding the mechanisms of transcription termination and splicing of a transcribed message. The messages of the M-CPTI region were concluded to be heterogeneous having multiple transcription initiation sites and loose transcription termination of the CK/EK-β gene. Studies on the control mechanism of gene expression of M-CPTI as well as the physiological roles of these overlapping transcripts are underway."
