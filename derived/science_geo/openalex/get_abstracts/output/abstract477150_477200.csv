https://openalex.org/W2125236750,"To achieve its precise neural connectivity, the developing mammalian nervous system undergoes extensive activity-dependent synapse remodelling. Recently, microglial cells have been shown to be responsible for a portion of synaptic pruning, but the remaining mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report a new role for astrocytes in actively engulfing central nervous system synapses. This process helps to mediate synapse elimination, requires the MEGF10 and MERTK phagocytic pathways, and is strongly dependent on neuronal activity. Developing mice deficient in both astrocyte pathways fail to refine their retinogeniculate connections normally and retain excess functional synapses. Finally, we show that in the adult mouse brain, astrocytes continuously engulf both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. These studies reveal a novel role for astrocytes in mediating synapse elimination in the developing and adult brain, identify MEGF10 and MERTK as critical proteins in the synapse remodelling underlying neural circuit refinement, and have important implications for understanding learning and memory as well as neurological disease processes."
https://openalex.org/W1969208427,"When applied in large scale to electronic medical record data, the PheWAS approach replicates GWAS associations and reveals potentially new pleiotropic associations. Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants that modulate risk for human disease; many of these associations require further study to replicate the results. Here we report the first large-scale application of the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) paradigm within electronic medical records (EMRs), an unbiased approach to replication and discovery that interrogates relationships between targeted genotypes and multiple phenotypes. We scanned for associations between 3,144 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (previously implicated by GWAS as mediators of human traits) and 1,358 EMR-derived phenotypes in 13,835 individuals of European ancestry. This PheWAS replicated 66% (51/77) of sufficiently powered prior GWAS associations and revealed 63 potentially pleiotropic associations with P < 4.6 × 10−6 (false discovery rate < 0.1); the strongest of these novel associations were replicated in an independent cohort (n = 7,406). These findings validate PheWAS as a tool to allow unbiased interrogation across multiple phenotypes in EMR-based cohorts and to enhance analysis of the genomic basis of human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2085683078,"Altered DNA methylation and associated destabilization of genome integrity and function is a hallmark of cancer. Replicative senescence is a tumour suppressor process that imposes a limit on the proliferative potential of normal cells that all cancer cells must bypass. Here we show by whole-genome single-nucleotide bisulfite sequencing that replicative senescent human cells exhibit widespread DNA hypomethylation and focal hypermethylation. Hypomethylation occurs preferentially at gene-poor, late-replicating, lamin-associated domains and is linked to mislocalization of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) in cells approaching senescence. Low-level gains of methylation are enriched in CpG islands, including at genes whose methylation and silencing is thought to promote cancer. Gains and losses of methylation in replicative senescence are thus qualitatively similar to those in cancer, and this ‘reprogrammed’ methylation landscape is largely retained when cells bypass senescence. Consequently, the DNA methylome of senescent cells might promote malignancy, if these cells escape the proliferative barrier. Cancer is associated with altered DNA methylation. Using whole-genome single-nucleotide sequencing, Adams and colleagues reveal that senescent cells, as well as cells that have bypassed senescence through p53 and pRB inactivation, exhibit methylation changes similar to those seen in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2094335760,"Despite advances in DNA sequencing technology, assembly of complex genomes remains a major challenge, particularly for genomes sequenced using short reads, which yield highly fragmented assemblies. Here we show that genome-wide in vivo chromatin interaction frequency data, which are measurable with chromosome conformation capture-based experiments, can be used as genomic distance proxies to accurately position individual contigs without requiring any sequence overlap. We also use these data to construct approximate genome scaffolds de novo. Applying our approach to incomplete regions of the human genome, we predict the positions of 65 previously unplaced contigs, in agreement with alternative methods in 26/31 cases attempted in common. Our approach can theoretically bridge any gap size and should be applicable to any species for which global chromatin interaction data can be generated."
https://openalex.org/W2024707993,"The tumour suppressor PTEN is frequently lost in human cancers. In addition to gene mutations and deletions, recent studies have revealed the importance of post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitylation, in the regulation of PTEN stability, activity and localization. However, the deubiquitylase that regulates PTEN polyubiquitylation and protein stability remains unknown. Here we screened a total of 30 deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) and identified five DUBs that physically associate with PTEN. One of them, USP13, stabilizes the PTEN protein through direct binding and deubiquitylation of PTEN. Loss of USP13 in breast cancer cells promotes AKT phosphorylation, cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, glycolysis and tumour growth through downregulation of PTEN. Conversely, overexpression of USP13 suppresses tumorigenesis and glycolysis in PTEN-positive but not PTEN-null breast cancer cells. Importantly, USP13 protein is downregulated in human breast tumours and correlates with PTEN protein levels. These findings identify USP13 as a tumour-suppressing protein that functions through deubiquitylation and stabilization of PTEN. The stability of the PTEN tumour suppressor protein is regulated by polyubiquitylation. Ma and colleagues identify USP13 as an enzyme reversing polyubiquitylation of PTEN, leading to PTEN stabilization and tumour suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1983555571,"Latrophilin-1, -2, and -3 are adhesion-type G protein-coupled receptors that are auxiliary α-latrotoxin receptors, suggesting that they may have a synaptic function. Using pulldowns, we here identify teneurins, type II transmembrane proteins that are also candidate synaptic cell-adhesion molecules, as interactors for the lectin-like domain of latrophilins. We show that teneurin binds to latrophilins with nanomolar affinity and that this binding mediates cell adhesion, consistent with a role of teneurin binding to latrophilins in trans-synaptic interactions. All latrophilins are subject to alternative splicing at an N-terminal site; in latrophilin-1, this alternative splicing modulates teneurin binding but has no effect on binding of latrophilin-1 to another ligand, FLRT3. Addition to cultured neurons of soluble teneurin-binding fragments of latrophilin-1 decreased synapse density, suggesting that latrophilin binding to teneurin may directly or indirectly influence synapse formation and/or maintenance. These observations are potentially intriguing in view of the proposed role for Drosophila teneurins in determining synapse specificity. However, teneurins in Drosophila were suggested to act as homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, whereas our findings suggest a heterophilic interaction mechanism. Thus, we tested whether mammalian teneurins also are homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, in addition to binding to latrophilins as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules. Strikingly, we find that although teneurins bind to each other in solution, homophilic teneurin-teneurin binding is unable to support stable cell adhesion, different from heterophilic teneurin-latrophilin binding. Thus, mammalian teneurins act as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules that may be involved in trans-neuronal interaction processes such as synapse formation or maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2056555106,"Germ cells divide and differentiate in a unique local microenvironment under the control of somatic cells. Signals released in this niche instruct oocyte reentry into the meiotic cell cycle. Once initiated, the progression through meiosis and the associated programme of maternal messenger RNA translation are thought to be cell autonomous. Here we show that translation of a subset of maternal mRNAs critical for embryo development is under the control of somatic cell inputs. Translation of specific maternal transcripts increases in oocytes cultured in association with somatic cells and is sensitive to EGF-like growth factors that act only on the somatic compartment. In mice deficient in amphiregulin, decreased fecundity and oocyte developmental competence is associated with defective translation of a subset of maternal mRNAs. These somatic cell signals that affect translation require activation of the PI(3)K–AKT–mTOR pathway. Thus, mRNA translation depends on somatic cell cues that are essential to reprogramme the oocyte for embryo development. The oocyte environment is critical for its development. Conti and colleagues demonstrate that, in mouse, amphiregulin-stimulated somatic cumulus cells promote translation of maternal mRNAs in the oocyte in a manner dependent on oocyte PI(3)K signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2153789584,"Mutations in LRRK2, encoding the multifunctional protein leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), are a common cause of Parkinson disease. LRRK2 has been suggested to influence the cytoskeleton as LRRK2 mutants reduce neurite outgrowth and cause an accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau. This might cause alterations in the dynamic instability of microtubules suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Here, we describe a direct interaction between LRRK2 and β-tubulin. This interaction is conferred by the LRRK2 Roc domain and is disrupted by the familial R1441G mutation and artificial Roc domain mutations that mimic autophosphorylation. LRRK2 selectively interacts with three β-tubulin isoforms: TUBB, TUBB4, and TUBB6, one of which (TUBB4) is mutated in the movement disorder dystonia type 4 (DYT4). Binding specificity is determined by lysine 362 and alanine 364 of β-tubulin. Molecular modeling was used to map the interaction surface to the luminal face of microtubule protofibrils in close proximity to the lysine 40 acetylation site in α-tubulin. This location is predicted to be poorly accessible within mature stabilized microtubules, but exposed in dynamic microtubule populations. Consistent with this finding, endogenous LRRK2 displays a preferential localization to dynamic microtubules within growth cones, rather than adjacent axonal microtubule bundles. This interaction is functionally relevant to microtubule dynamics, as mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from LRRK2 knock-out mice display increased microtubule acetylation. Taken together, our data shed light on the nature of the LRRK2-tubulin interaction, and indicate that alterations in microtubule stability caused by changes in LRRK2 might contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease.

https://openalex.org/W2107873095,"SALL4, a zinc-finger transcriptional factor for embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency, has been suggested to be involved in tumorigenesis. The role of SALL4 in human gastric cancer, however, remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that SALL4 was aberrantly expressed at both mRNA and protein levels in human gastric cancer tissues, and SALL4 level was highly correlated with lymph node metastasis. Enforced expression of SALL4 enhanced the proliferation and migration of human gastric cancer cells, whereas knockdown of SALL4 by siRNA led to the opposite effects. In addition, SALL4 overexpression promoted the growth and metastasis of gastric xenograft tumor in vivo. SALL4 overexpression induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer cells, with increased expression of Twist1, N-cadherin and decreased expression of E-cadherin. Moreover, SALL4 promoted the acquirement of stemness in gastric cancer cells through the induction of Bmi-1 and Lin28B. Taken together, our findings indicate that SALL4 has oncogenic roles in gastric cancer through the modulation of EMT and cell stemness, suggesting SALL4 as a novel target for human gastric cancer diagnosis and therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2022018442,"N-Linked protein glycosylation is a frequent post-translational modification that can be found in all three domains of life. In a canonical, highly conserved pathway, an oligosaccharide is transferred by a membrane-bound oligosaccharyltransferase from a lipid donor to asparagines in the sequon NX(S/T) of secreted polypeptides. The δ-proteobacterium Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae encodes an unusual pathway for N-linked protein glycosylation. This pathway takes place in the cytoplasm and is mediated by a soluble N-glycosyltransferase (NGT) that uses nucleotide-activated monosaccharides to glycosylate asparagine residues. To characterize the process of cytoplasmic N-glycosylation in more detail, we studied the glycosylation in A. pleuropneumoniae and functionally transferred the glycosylation system to Escherichia coli. N-Linked glucose specific human sera were used for the analysis of the glycosylation process. We identified autotransporter adhesins as the preferred protein substrate of NGT in vivo, and in depth analysis of the modified sites in E. coli revealed a surprisingly relaxed peptide substrate specificity. Although NX(S/T) is the preferred acceptor sequon, we detected glycosylation of alternative sequons, including modification of glutamine and serine residues. We also demonstrate the use of NGT to glycosylate heterologous proteins. Therefore, our study could provide the basis for a novel route for the engineering of N-glycoproteins in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1574178082,"The haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor CD163 and proTNF-α are transmembrane macrophage proteins subjected to cleavage by the inflammation-responsive protease ADAM17. This leads to release of soluble CD163 (sCD163) and bioactive TNF-α. Sequence comparison of the juxtamembrane region identified similar palindromic sequences in human CD163 ((1044)Arg-Ser-Ser-Arg) and proTNF-α ((78)Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg). In proTNF-α the Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg sequence is situated next to the previously established ADAM17 cleavage site. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the sequences harbor essential information for efficient cleavage of the two proteins upon ADAM17 stimulation. This was further evidenced by analysis of mouse CD163 that, like CD163 in other non-primates, does not contain the palindromic CD163 sequence in the juxtamembrane region. Mouse CD163 resisted endotoxin- and phorbol ester-induced shedding, and ex vivo analysis of knock-in of the Arg-Ser-Ser-Arg sequence in mouse CD163 revealed a receptor shedding comparable with that of human CD163. In conclusion, we have identified an essential substrate motif for ADAM17-mediated CD163 and proTNF-α cleavage in macrophages. In addition, the present data indicate that CD163, by incorporation of this motif in late evolution, underwent a modification that allows for an instant down-regulation of surface CD163 expression and inhibition of hemoglobin uptake. This regulatory modality seems to have coincided with the evolution of an enhanced hemoglobin-protecting role of the haptoglobin-CD163 system in primates."
https://openalex.org/W2057187076,"The vacuolar (H(+))-ATPases (V-ATPases) are ATP-driven proton pumps composed of a peripheral V1 domain and a membrane-embedded V0 domain. Regulated assembly of V1 and V0 represents an important regulatory mechanism for controlling V-ATPase activity in vivo. Previous work has shown that V-ATPase assembly increases during maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells induced by activation of Toll-like receptors. This increased assembly is essential for antigen processing, which is dependent upon an acidic lysosomal pH. Cluster disruption of dendritic cells induces a semi-mature phenotype associated with immune tolerance. Thus, semi-mature dendritic cells are able to process and present self-peptides to suppress autoimmune responses. We have investigated V-ATPase assembly in bone marrow-derived, murine dendritic cells and observed an increase in assembly following cluster disruption. This increased assembly is not dependent upon new protein synthesis and is associated with an increase in concanamycin A-sensitive proton transport in FITC-loaded lysosomes. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with wortmannin or mTORC1 with rapamycin effectively inhibits the increased assembly observed upon cluster disruption. These results suggest that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR pathway is involved in controlling V-ATPase assembly during dendritic cell maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2024965970,"The Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains are crucial innate immune signaling modules. Microbial TIR domain-containing proteins inhibit Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling through molecular mimicry. The TIR domain-containing protein TcpB from Brucella inhibits TLR signaling through interaction with host adaptor proteins TIRAP/Mal and MyD88. To characterize the microbial mimicry of host proteins, we have determined the X-ray crystal structures of the TIR domains from the Brucella protein TcpB and the host adaptor protein TIRAP. We have further characterized homotypic interactions of TcpB using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and heterotypic TcpB and TIRAP interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and NF-κB reporter assays. The crystal structure of the TcpB TIR domain reveals the microtubule-binding site encompassing the BB loop as well as a symmetrical dimer mediated by the DD and EE loops. This dimerization interface is validated by peptide mapping through hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The human TIRAP TIR domain crystal structure reveals a unique N-terminal TIR domain fold containing a disulfide bond formed by Cys(89) and Cys(134). A comparison between the TcpB and TIRAP crystal structures reveals substantial conformational differences in the region that encompasses the BB loop. These findings underscore the similarities and differences in the molecular features found in the microbial and host TIR domains, which suggests mechanisms of bacterial mimicry of host signaling adaptor proteins, such as TIRAP."
https://openalex.org/W1982548286,"Separase, a protease encoded by the ESPL1 gene, cleaves the chromosomal cohesin during mitosis. Separase protein and transcripts are overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers. To investigate the physiological consequence of Separase overexpression in animals, we have generated a transgenic MMTV-Espl1 mouse model that overexpresses Separase protein in the mammary glands. MMTV-Espl1 mice in a C57BL/6 genetic background develop aggressive, highly aneuploid and estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ERα+) mammary adenocarcinomas with an 80% penetrance. The mammary tumors caused by overexpression of Separase, alone or combined with p53 heterozygosity, in mammary epithelium mimic several aspects of the most aggressive forms of human breast cancer, including high levels of genetic instability, cell cycle defects, poor differentiation, distant metastasis and metaplasia. Histopathologically, MMTV-Espl1 tumors are highly heterogeneous showing features of both luminal as well as basal subtypes of breast cancers, with aggressive disease phenotype. In addition to aneuploidy, Separase overexpression results in chromosomal instability (CIN) including premature chromatid separation (PCS), lagging chromosomes, anaphase bridges, micronuclei, centrosome amplification, multinucleated cells, gradual accumulation of DNA damage and progressive loss of tumor suppressors p53 and cadherin gene loci. These results suggest that Separase-overexpressing mammary cells are not only susceptible to chromosomal missegregation-induced aneuploidy but also other genetic instabilities including DNA damage and loss of key tumor suppressor gene loci, which in combination can initiate tumorigenesis and disease progression."

Full-length E6AP is a protein of 100 kDa; however, only the structure of the truncated E6AP Hect domain in association with its cognate UbcH7 ubiquitin carrier protein has been reported (49Huang L.

The Hect domain architecture displays an L-shape with distinct N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains connected by a flexible hinge region (49Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M.

The N-terminal subdomain can be further divided into large and small N-terminal subdomains also connected by flexible hinge segments (49Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M.

The active site Cys820 to which ubiquitin forms a thioester intermediate is contained in the C-terminal subdomain (49Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M.

The UbcH7 carrier protein binds to a pocket in the small N-terminal subdomain, but the geometry of the bound UbcH7∼ubiquitin thioester relative to Cys820 has been a challenge to understanding within the context of a coherent mechanism for Cys820∼ubiquitin thioester formation and subsequent polyubiquitin chain formation, discussed recently (51Ronchi V.P.

However, we have used kinetic analysis of 125I-polyubiquitin chain assembly to demonstrate for the first time the presence of two functionally distinct E2∼ubiquitin binding sites on the E6AP Hect domain, providing a mechanistically tractable resolution to the problem of active site thioester formation (51Ronchi V.P.

Other kinetic evidence indicates that the canonical UbcH7 binding site presented in the original crystal structure (49Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Structure of an E6AP-UbcH7 complex.

Klein J.M. Haas A.L. E6AP/UBE3A ubiquitin ligase harbors two E2∼ubiquitin binding sites.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10349-10360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), providing an entre into reconciling a potential mechanism for polyubiquitin chain assembly. In the present work, we use kinetic and biophysical methods to demonstrate for the first time that an E6AP oligomer is the catalytically competent form of the enzyme. Based on an earlier structure for E6AP initially discounted as an artifact of crystal packing forces (49Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Structure of an E6AP-UbcH7 complex. Insights into ubiquitination by the E2-E3 enzyme cascade.Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), we propose that the fully functional form of the oligomer is a trimer, computational analysis of which allowed us to identify conserved residues located at the subunit interfaces. Using rates of 125I-polyubiquitin chain assembly as a functional readout, we have identified a subset of residues essential for stabilizing the active trimer. Furthermore, a small molecule mimic of a key stabilizing interaction is sufficient to dissociate the trimer and abrogate E6AP-catalyzed chain assembly but not Cys820∼ubiquitin thioester formation. In contrast, E6 viral protein enhances E6AP activity by promoting oligomerization as a consequence of the ability of the former to dimerize through its N-terminal Zn2+ binding domain (51Ronchi V.P.

Remarkably, E6-induced oligomerization rescues synthetic and Angelman syndrome loss-of-function mutations contributing to subunit association and stabilization. The current results explain previously unresolved roles for a cohort of point mutations in the neurological pathology of Angelman syndrome, reveal new strategies for regulating E6AP function by modulating subunit assembly, and provide insights into the role of oligomerization in polyubiquitin chain formation by the Hect ligase superfamily.

https://openalex.org/W2030265039,"One of the mechanisms for establishment of infection employed by intra-macrophage pathogen-like Leishmania is inhibition of oxidative burst-mediated macrophage apoptosis to protect their niche for survival and replication. We tried to elucidate the underlying mechanism for this by using H2O2 for induction of apoptosis. Leishmania donovani-infected macrophages were much more resistant to H2O2-mediated apoptosis compared with control. Although infected cells were capable of comparable reactive oxygen species production, there was less activation of the downstream cascade consisting of caspase-3 and -7 and cleaved poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and 3 proteins and reactive oxygen species scavenging enzyme thioredoxin, known to be involved in stabilization of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, were found to be induced during infection. Induction of SOCS proteins may be mediated by Egr1, and silencing of Socs1 and -3 either alone or in combination resulted in reduced thioredoxin levels, enhanced activation of caspases, and increased apoptosis of infected macrophages. The induction of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, thioredoxin, SOCS, and Egr1 in L. donovani-infected macrophages was found to be unaffected by H2O2 treatment. SOCS knocked down cells also displayed decreased parasite survival thus marking reduction in disease progression. Taken together, these results suggest that L. donovani may exploit SOCS for subverting macrophage apoptotic machinery toward establishing its replicative niche inside the host.

https://openalex.org/W2075036501,"Transcript elongation by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) is thought to be regulated at pause sites by open versus closed positions of the RNAP clamp domain, pause-suppressing regulators like NusG and RfaH that stabilize the closed-clampRNAP conformation, and pause-enhancing regulators like NusA and exit channel nascent RNA structures that stabilize the open clamp RNAP conformation. However, the mutual effects of these protein and RNA regulators on RNAP conformation are incompletely understood. For example, it is unknown whether NusA directly interacts with exit channel duplexes and whether formation of exit channel duplexes and RfaH binding compete by favoring the open and closed RNAP conformations. We report new insights into these mechanisms using antisense oligonucleotide mimics of a pause RNA hairpin from the leader region of the his biosynthetic operon of enteric bacteria like Escherichia coli. By systematically varying the structure and length of the oligonucleotide mimic, we determined that full pause stabilization requires an RNA-RNA duplex of at least 8 bp or a DNA-RNA duplex of at least 11 bp; RNA-RNA duplexes were more effective than DNA-RNA. NusA stimulation of pausing was optimal with 10-bp RNA-RNA duplexes and was aided by single-stranded RNA upstream of the duplex but was significantly reduced with DNA-RNA duplexes. Our results favor direct NusA stabilization of exit channel duplexes, which consequently affect RNAP clamp conformation. Effects of RfaH, which suppresses oligo-stabilization of pausing, were competitive with antisense oligonucleotide concentration, suggesting that RfaH and exit channel duplexes compete via opposing effects on RNAP clamp conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2095370559,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 80% of all lung cancers. Although activating mutations in genes of the RAS-MAPK pathway occur in up to 30% of all NSCLC, the cooperating genetic lesions that are required for lung cancer initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Here we identify a role for the cell polarity regulator Scribble (Scrib) in NSCLC. A survey of genomic databases reveals deregulation of SCRIB in human lung cancer and we show that Scrib(+/-) mutant mice develop lung cancer by 540 days with a penetrance of 43%. To model NSCLC development in vivo, we used the extensively characterized LSL-KRas(G12D) murine model of NSCLC. We show that loss of Scrib and activated oncogenic KRas cooperate in vivo, resulting in more aggressive lung tumors, likely due to a synergistic elevation in RAS-MAPK signaling. Finally, we provide data consistent with immune infiltration having an important role in the acceleration of tumorigenesis in KRas(G12D) lung tumors following Scrib loss."

The structure of compound 3 can be segmented into a N-terminal anchor; an Ω-shaped loop; an intermediate segment; a tight glycine-loop; and a C-terminal α-helix that is anchored to K1 at its reactive center loop and two-stranded β-sheet. The contact surface has an overall hydrophobic character with some charged hot spots. In a model system, compound 3 blocked FXa inhibition by TFPI (EC50 = 11 nm) and inhibition of TF-FVIIa-catalyzed FX activation by TFPI (EC50 = 2 nm). The peptide prevented transition from the loose to the tight FXa-TFPI complex, but did not affect formation of the loose FXa-TFPI complex. The K1 domain of TFPI binds and inhibits FVIIa and the K2 domain similarly inhibits FXa. Because compound 3 binds to K1, our data show that K1 is not only important for FVIIa inhibition but also for FXa inhibition, i.e. for the transition of the loose to the tight FXa-TFPI complex. This mode of action translates into normalization of coagulation of hemophilia plasmas. Compound 3 thus bears potential to prevent bleeding in hemophilia patients. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor that inhibits activated factor X (FXa) via a slow-tight binding mechanism and tissue factor-activated FVII (TF-FVIIa) via formation of a quaternary FXa-TFPI-TF-FVIIa complex. Inhibition of TFPI enhances coagulation in hemophilia models. Using a library approach, we selected and subsequently optimized peptides that bind TFPI and block its anticoagulant activity.

https://openalex.org/W2080719619,"The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) serves as a docking factor for some adenovirus (AdV) types and group B coxsackieviruses. Its role in AdV internalization is unclear as studies suggest that its intracellular domain is dispensable for some AdV infection. We previously showed that in motor neurons, AdV induced CAR internalization and co-transport in axons, suggesting that CAR was linked to endocytic and long-range transport machineries. Here, we characterized the mechanisms of CAR endocytosis in neurons and neuronal cells. We found that CAR internalization was lipid microdomain-, actin-, and dynamin-dependent, and subsequently followed by CAR degradation in lysosomes. Moreover, ligands that disrupted the homodimeric CAR interactions in its D1 domains triggered an internalization cascade involving sequences in its intracellular tail."
https://openalex.org/W1998975327,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) interconverts between an inactive soluble and active membrane-bound form in response to changes in membrane lipid composition. Activation involves disruption of an inhibitory interaction between the αE helices at the base of the active site and an autoinhibitory (AI) segment in the regulatory M domain and membrane insertion of the M domain as an amphipathic helix. We show that in the CCT soluble form the AI segment functions to suppress kcat and elevate the Km for CTP. The crystal structure of a CCT dimer composed of the catalytic and AI segments reveals an AI-αE interaction as a cluster of four amphipathic helices (two αE and two AI helices) at the base of the active sites. This interaction corroborates mutagenesis implicating multiple hydrophobic residues within the AI segment that contribute to its silencing function. The AI-αE interaction directs the turn at the C-terminal end of the AI helix into backbone-to-backbone contact with a loop (L2) at the opening to the active site, which houses the key catalytic residue, lysine 122. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that lysine 122 side-chain orientations are constrained by contacts with the AI helix-turn, which could obstruct its engagement with substrates. This work deciphers how the CCT regulatory amphipathic helix functions as a silencing device."
https://openalex.org/W2029059762,"The cancer-associated, centrosomal adaptor protein TACC3 (transforming acidic coiled-coil 3) and its direct effector, the microtubule polymerase chTOG (colonic and hepatic tumor overexpressed gene), play a crucial function in centrosome-driven mitotic spindle assembly. It is unclear how TACC3 interacts with chTOG. Here, we show that the C-terminal TACC domain of TACC3 and a C-terminal fragment adjacent to the TOG domains of chTOG mediate the interaction between these two proteins. Interestingly, the TACC domain consists of two functionally distinct subdomains, CC1 (amino acids (aa) 414–530) and CC2 (aa 530–630). Whereas CC1 is responsible for the interaction with chTOG, CC2 performs an intradomain interaction with the central repeat region of TACC3, thereby masking the TACC domain before effector binding. Contrary to previous findings, our data clearly demonstrate that Aurora-A kinase does not regulate TACC3-chTOG complex formation, indicating that Aurora-A solely functions as a recruitment factor for the TACC3-chTOG complex to centrosomes and proximal mitotic spindles. We identified with CC1 and CC2, two functionally diverse modules within the TACC domain of TACC3 that modulate and mediate, respectively, TACC3 interaction with chTOG required for spindle assembly and microtubule dynamics during mitotic cell division.

In contrast, the functional role of the N-terminal part of TACC3 outside of the TACC domain is rather undefined besides being a substrate for Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation that is required for centrosomal and proximal spindle localization of TACC3 (28.Peset I. Vernos I. The TACC proteins. TACC-ling microtubule dynamics and centrosome function.Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). From the analysis of X. laevis TACC3, it has been proposed that the N-terminal part masks the TACC domain and thereby inhibits its function (58.Albee A.J. Tao W. Wiese C.

Cell. 2008; 19: 3347-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Aurora-A mediated phosphorylation of TACC3 was implicated to “unmask” and thereby expose the TACC domain to intermolecular interaction with XMAP215 (46.Peset I. Seiler J. Sardon T. Bejarano L.A. Rybina S. Vernos I. Function and regulation of Maskin, a TACC family protein, in microtubule growth during mitosis.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 59.Albee A.J. Wiese C. Xenopus TACC3/maskin is not required for microtubule stability but is required for anchoring microtubules at the centrosome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3347-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis/details of the masking/unmasking mechanism of the TACC domain and its interaction with the C terminus of XMAP215 remained enigmatic. Here, we subjected recombinant murine TACC3 and the C-terminal part of the murine XMAP215 homologue chTOG to a deletion and biochemical interaction analysis. We identify within the TACC domain two functionally distinct subdomains, CC1 (aa 414–530) and CC2 (aa 530–630), which are involved in interdomain and intradomain protein interaction, respectively. We demonstrate that TACC3 forms a stable intramolecular complex through the interaction of 7R with CC2 (TACC domain “masked”). Interestingly, the C terminus of chTOG (aa 1806–2032) right hand to the putative MT-interacting TOG6 domain (52.Hood F.E. Williams S.J. Burgess S.G. Richards M.W. Roth D. Straube A. Pfuhl M. Bayliss R. Royle S.J. Coordination of adjacent domains mediates TACC3-ch-TOG-clathrin assembly and mitotic spindle binding.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) binds selectively to the CC1 module and thereby disrupts the intramolecular CC2–7R complex, thereby giving rise to the effector-bound state of the TACC domain (TACC domain “unmasked”). Neither intradomain interaction of TACC3 nor its binding to chTOG was affected by Aurora-A kinase. Thus, consecutive intra- and intermolecular protein interactions direct and determine TACC3-chTOG protein complex formation before its Aurora-A-regulated centrosomal and proximal spindle recruitment required for MT growth and mitotic spindle assembly. Protein sequences of TACC family members were retrieved from the NCBI database and used for further analysis. For sequence alignment and evolutionary analysis of conserved domains, the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment algorithm was used (60.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. ClustalW. Improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55712) Google Scholar), and alignment was analyzed with JALVIEW. Further analysis of the coiled-coil boundary in the TACC domain of murine TACC3 was performed using the COILS server in 14, 21, and 28 residue scan mode (61.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences.Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Algorithms and tools from the EXPASY proteomic server were employed for sequence-based protein characterization. Coding sequences for murine TACC3 and its variants were amplified using sequence-specific primer and cloned into the pGEX-4T1-NTEV expression vector. The following constructs were created: full-length TACC3 (aa 1–630); TACC3-ΔN (Δ1–118); TACC3-ΔR (Δ141–308), lacking the serine-proline-glutamate-rich repeat region; TACC3-ΔNΔR (Δ1–118 and Δ141–308); 7R (aa 119–324) comprising the serine-proline-glutamate-rich repeat region; CC (TACC domain; aa 414–630); CC1 (aa 414–530); CC2 (aa 530–630) (62Thakur, H. C., (2012) Biochemical and biophysical characterization of the centrosomal protein TACC3.

Moreover, pGEX-4T1-NTEV-based expression constructs for C-terminal fragments of human chTOG were created: chTOG-Cterm (aa 1574–2032), chTOG-A (aa 1544–1805), and chTOG-B (aa 1806–2032). To generate TACC3 deletion mutants fused at the C terminus to GFP, the following constructs were cloned in a pEGFP-N1 (Clontech)-based vector: full-length TACC3; TACC-ΔCC1 and TACC-ΔCC2 lacking the CC1 or CC2 subdom"

As a result, the transgenic plants restored phytol-synthesizing activity. These results indicate that GGR is active as long as it is anchored to membranes, even in the absence of LIL3. Subsequently, we addressed the question why the LHC motif is conserved in the LIL3 sequences. We modified the transmembrane domain of LIL3, which contains the LHC motif, by substituting its conserved amino acids (Glu-171, Asn-174, and Asp-189) with alanine.

Our findings demonstrate that LPS induces Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) internalization in corneal epithelial cells and that blocking with anti-CD14 selectively inhibits TLR4 endocytosis, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and IRF3 phosphorylation, and production of CCL5/RANTES and IFN-β, but not IL-8.

We conclude that CD14 has a critical role in mediating TLR4 signaling through IRF3 in resident corneal epithelial cells and macrophages and thereby modulates TLR4 cell surface activation of the MyD88/NF-κB/AP-1 pathway and production of CXC chemokines and neutrophil infiltration to infected tissues.

CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein and therefore cannot directly induce cell signaling; however, CD14 and lipid A-binding protein are accessory molecules to the TLR4/MD-2 receptor, and CD14 binds LPS and transfers it to MD-2 to initiate TLR4 dimerization and signaling (4Kawai T.

Phosphoinositide-mediated adaptor recruitment controls Toll-like receptor signaling.Cell. 2006; 125: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and this selective activity on macrophages and dendritic cells was recently shown to be mediated by CD14 through a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and phospholipase Cγ-dependent pathway (7Zanoni I.

Although macrophages and dendritic cells have an important role in the host response to LPS and infection with Gram-negative bacteria, epithelial cells are generally the first cells that are exposed to LPS from the environment. Under homeostatic conditions, epithelial cells lining the gut, lungs, and ocular surface down-regulate LPS responsiveness; however, epithelial cells can respond directly to LPS following infectious and inflammatory conditions. We recently demonstrated that IFN-γ induces JAK2/STAT1 activation in corneal epithelial cells, which in turn leads to binding of STAT1 to GAS sites on the MD-2 promoter and induces transcription and cell surface localization of MD-2 and confers LPS responsiveness (9Roy S. Sun Y. Pearlman E.

We also showed that corneal epithelial cells utilize the TRIF pathway when activated by TLR3 (12Johnson A.C. Li X. Pearlman E. MyD88 functions as a negative regulator of TLR3/TRIF-induced corneal inflammation by inhibiting activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3988-3996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that CD14 is expressed on corneal epithelial cells and is required for TLR4 internalization. We also show that blockade of CD14 inhibits IRF3, but not NF-κB phosphorylation, and is dependent on Syk activation. Using a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal infection, we found significantly elevated neutrophil infiltration and corneal opacification in the absence of CD14, which we attribute to impaired TLR4 internalization and consequently increased CXC chemokine production in the infected corneas. CD14-mediated TLR4 internalization and activation of the TRIF/IRF3 pathway therefore have an important role in bacterial infections by modulating MyD88/NF-κB/AP-1-mediated production of CXC chemokines and neutrophil-mediated inflammation and resulting tissue damage. Keratinocyte serum-free medium, trypsin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and gentamycin were purchased from Invitrogen. The Ultrapure LPS was purchased from Invivogen. Anti-CD4 antibodies were from ELISA detection kits for IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL1, IL-1β, and IFN-β, and recombinant human IFN-γ was purchased from R&D Systems. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Blocking antibody to CD14 and all of the antibodies used for flow cytometry analysis were from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA). Piceatannol was purchased from Sigma. C57BL/6 and CD14−/− mice (4–6 weeks old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All animals were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions in microisolator cages. All protocols were approved by Case Western Reserve University IACUC. Mice were anesthetized, and corneal epithelium was abraded with three parallel 1-mm scratches using a 26-gauge needle and infected with 2.5 μl of PBS containing 1 × 105 colony-forming units (cfu) of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 as described (13Sun Y.

Mice were examined under a stereomicroscope for corneal opacification, ulceration, and perforation at 24 or 48 h after infection. Mice were euthanized, and corneal opacification (bright field) was visualized in the intact eye using MZFLIII microscope (Leica Microsystems) and Spot RT Slider KE camera (Diagnostics Instruments). All images were captured using SpotCam software (RT Slider KE). At 24 and 48 h after infection, mice were euthanized, and the whole eye was homogenized in 1 ml of PBS using the Mixer Mill MM300 (Retsch, Newtown, PA) at 33 Hz for 4 min. Serial log dilutions of the eye homogenate were plated onto brain heart infusion agar plates. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cfu were determined by direct counting. Eyes were enucleated and placed in 10% formalin/PBS, 5-mm corneal sections were prepared, and H&E staining was performed as described (13Sun Y. Karmakar M. Roy S. Ramadan R.T. Williams S.R. Howell S.

The slides were dipped in glacial acetic acid, stained with Shandon Bluing solution (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA), and counterstained with alcohol eosin Y solution (Thermo Shandon). Slides were then dehydrated and mounted under Permount medium (Vector Laboratories). The SV40-immortalized human corneal epithelial cell line 10.014 pRSV-T (HCEC) was obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained by culturing in keratinocyte serum-free medium with bovine pituitary extract and recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

Tissue procurement was approved by the Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH)/University Hospitals of Cleveland Institutional Review Board. Bulbar conjunctival tissue was removed, and cornea was excised and placed in sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mg/ml dispase and 5 mg/ml gentamycin for 4 h at 4 °C. The corneal epithelium was then collected by gentle scraping and incubation with 5 ml of 0.25% trypsin, 5 min at 37 °C. The epithelial cell suspension was transferred to DMEM containing 10% FCS to block further enzyme activity. Epithelial cells from each cornea were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in keratinocyte serum-free medium containing epithelial growth factor and bovine pituitary extract with antibiotics. After passage 1, antibiotics were omitted from the culture medium, and cells were harvested and transferred to a 50-cm2 flask. The medium was changed every 4 days, and cells from passages 2–5 were used for experiments when cells were 70% confluent (15Adhikary G. Sun Y. Pearlman E.

The pellet was resuspended in RBC lysis buffer for 3 min and recovered by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 10 min. Cells were incubated for 10 days in DMEM containing 5% FBS and 30% L929 medium during which they differentiated into macrophages (12Johnson A.C. Li X. Pearlman E.

Macrophages were then incubated with live or antibiotic-killed PAO1 at a 10:1 ratio of bacteria to macrophages and processed for Western blotting and ELISA. Infected and PBS-treated corneas were excised and homogenized in 150 μl of PBS using a Mixer Mill MM300 (Retsch). BMDMs were grown overnight and incubated with antibiotic-killed PAO1 for 4 h, and the supernatants were used directly. Human corneal cells were grown overnight in 12-well plates (4 × 105 cells/well), treated with LPS, and supernatants were collected. Cytokine were determined by sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems). Absorption was measured at 450 nm on a Versa Max microplate reader using SoftMaxPro software 5.2 (Molecular Devices). BMDM from C57BL/6 and CD14−/− mice were incubated with PAO1 at a 10:1 ratio of bacteria to macrophages for indicated times. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed using cold 1× lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). Total protein was quantified using standard BCA technique (Thermo Scientific), and 20 μg of protein was separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with p-IκBα, total IκBα, p-IRF3, total IRF3, p-ERK, total ERK, p-JNK, total JNK, p-p38, total p38, and, β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology). All of the primary antibodies were used in 1:1000 dilutions. Proteins were detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed with Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce). BMDMs were cultured as 5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates on sterile coverslips and incubated with P. aeruginosa at a 10:1 ratio of bacteria to epithelial cells for 60 min. Translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit was determined as described (13Sun Y. Karmakar M. Roy S. Ramadan R.T. Williams S.R. Howell S. Shive C.L. Han Y. Stopford C.M. Rietsch A. Pearlman E.

Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse p65 (1:100; eBioscience). p65 binding was detected using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes). Corneas dissected 24 and 48 h after infection were processed for flow cytometry as described (13Sun Y. Karmakar M. Roy S. Ramadan R.T. Williams S.R. Howell S. Shive C.L. Han Y. Stopford C.M.

Briefly, after digestion in collagenase, Fc receptors were blocked for 20 min followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-NIMP-R14 for 45 min to detect neutrophils. The cells were then washed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. For staining of epithelial cells, HCEC, HCET, and primary human corneal epithelial cells were incubated with anti-CD14 antibody for 2 h followed by incubation with LPS for the indicated time periods. The cells were then incubated with human IgG (20 μg/ml) for 15 min followed by incubation with anti-TLR4 (eBioscience) or isotype control antibody for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed using an Accuri c6 flow cytometry. Human corneal epithelial cells were incubated for 2 h with IFN-γ (250 ng/ml) and then stimulated for 1 h with LPS (1 μg/ml). For extracellular staining, cells were blocked for 1 h in 10% goat serum and incubated for 1 h with mouse TLR4 antibody (Abcam) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG for 40 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were counterstained with DAPI and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. For intracellular staining, cells were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization using 0.1% Triton X-100 and then stained as described above. Cells were examined using a Leica DM6000B inverted microscope. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test (Prism; GraphPad Software). p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Our previous studies showed that although TLR4 is constitutively expressed by corneal epithelial cells, LPS responsiveness is dependent on IFN-γ induction of MD-2 (9Roy S. Sun Y. Pearlman E. Interferon-γ-induced MD-2 protein expression and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) responsiveness in corneal epithelial cells is mediated by Janus tyrosine kinase-2 activation and direct binding of STAT1 protein to the MD-2 promoter.J.

Therefore, in the experiments described below, corneal epithelial cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence of recombinant IFN-γ. Fig. 1 shows TLR4 staining by confocal microscopy. Unstimulated HCET cells exhibit a cell surface TLR4 staining pattern consistent with the known presence of TLR4 on lipid rafts (17Motshwene P.G. Moncrieffe M.C. Grossmann J.G. Kao C. Ayaluru M. Sandercock A.M. Robinson C.V. Latz E. Gay N.J. An oligomeric signaling platform formed by the Toll-like receptor signal transducers MyD88 and IRAK-4.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25404-25411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In contrast, after a 1-h stimulation with LPS and IFN-γ, TLR4 staining is primarily intracellular. To determine whether LPS induces CD14 expression on corneal epithelial cells, HCEC and HCET cell lines were incubated with LPS, and CD14 expression was detected by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2A, CD14 is expressed on unstimulated HCEC and HCET cells and is not further elevated after stimulation with LPS, demonstrating that the CD14 is constitutively expressed on the cell surface of human corneal epithelial cells. As CD14 regulates TLR4 endocytosis in murine macrophages and dendritic cells (7Zanoni I. Ostuni R. Marek L.R. Barresi S. Barbalat R. Barton G.M. Granucci F. Kagan J.C. CD14 controls the LPS-induced endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4.Cell. 2011; 147: 868-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), we examined whether CD14 has a similar role in epithelial cells. HCEC, HCET, and primary human corneal epithelial cells were incubated with LPS in the presence or absence of anti-CD14 blocking antibody, and cell surface and intracellular TLR4 expression were examined by flow cytometry. Results are shown as representative profiles after 30 and 60 min of incubation with blocking CD14 Ab or isotype control (IgG), and the percentage reduction of surface TLR4 expression was compared with unstimulated (no LPS) cells. Fig. 2B shows decreased cell surface TLR4 after a 30- or 60-min incubation with LPS, whereas in the presence of blocking CD14 Ab, TLR4 cell surface expression was not reduced. Quantification of mean fluorescence intensity shows 50% of the initial cell surface expression after a 30-min LPS incubation and 25–35% expression after 60 min compared with 80–90% in the presence of blocking anti-CD14 (Fig. 2B). Conversely, flow cytometry showed increasing intracellular TLR4 following LPS stimulation (Fig. 2C), which is consistent with confocal images shown in Fig. 1. However, in the presence of anti-CD14, intracellular TLR4 was not increased. Taken together with Fig. 1, these findings demonstrate that in corneal epithelial cells, LPS induces relocalization of TLR4 from the cell surface to an intracellular location, which is mediated by CD14. In macrophages and dendritic cells, cell surface TLR4 signals through the MyD88 pathway and activates NF-κB, whereas endosomal TLR4 signals through TRIF to activate IRF3-dependent cytokines (8Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Phosphoinositide-mediated adaptor recruitment controls Toll-like receptor signaling.Cell. 2006; 125: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). As we showed that TRIF is active in corneal epithelial cells (12Johnson A.C. Li X. Pearlman E. MyD88 functions as a negative regulator of TLR3/TRIF-induced corneal inflammation by inhibiting activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3988-3996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we anticipated that LPS would selectively activate the TRIF pathway and that this would be inhibited by blocking CD14. HCEC and HCET cells were incubated with LPS and anti-CD14, and p-IRF3 and p-IκB were examined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, p-IRF3 increased after a 30- and 60-min incubation with LPS; however, phosphorylation was inhibited 60–70% in the presence of anti-CD14 as shown by densitometry. In contrast, p-IκB was not inhibited by anti-CD14 in HCEC cells and only partially in HCET cells (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these findings, production of CCL5/RANTES and IFN-β, which are activated by TRIF/IRF3 signaling (5Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity: update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6189) Google Scholar, 18Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B. Pitha P.M. Golenbock D.T. LPS-TLR4 signaling to IRF-3/7 and NF-κB involves the Toll adapters TRAM and TRIF.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), was lower in the presence of anti-CD14 in both cell lines and in primary corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 3C). IL-8 was also lower in anti-CD14-treated cells (Fig. 3C), which is consistent with TRIF activation of NF-κB (5Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity: update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6189) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that in addition to mediating TLR4 internalization, CD14 also regulates IRF3 signaling in human corneal epithelial cells. In macrophages, Syk activation by LPS is CD14-dependent, but TLR4-independent (7Zanoni I. Ostuni R. Marek L.R. Barresi S. Barbalat R. Barton G.M. Granucci F. Kagan J.C. CD14 controls the LPS-induced endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4.Cell. 2011; 147: 868-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To determine the role of Syk in LPS activation, HCEC and HCET were stimulated with LPS in the presence of both anti-CD14 and the Syk inhibitor piceatannol. As shown in Fig. 4A, p-Syk was detected in both cell lines after a 30- and 60-min incubation with LPS, and Syk phosphorylation was inhibited in the presence of anti-CD14. Consistent with this finding, LPS-induced CCL5 production was completely absent in the presence of piceatannol (Fig. 4B), whereas there was no difference in IL-8 production between LPS and LPS/piceatannol-treated HCEC and HCET cells. To examine whether p-Syk regulates LPS-induced TLR4 internalization, cells were incubated with LPS and piceatannol, and TLR4 cell surface expression was examined by flow cytometry. We found that in contrast to LPS stimulation alone where TLR4 cell surface expression decreased >50%, cell surface TLR4 remained unchanged over 60 min in LPS/piceatannol-treated cells (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that Syk phosphorylation mediates TLR4 internalization and selective activation of the TRIF pathway in human corneal epithelial cells. As CD14 regulates TLR4 signaling and cytokine production in vitro, we used gene knock-out mice to examine the role of CD14 in a murine model of P. aeruginosa corneal infection, which is dependent on TLR4 (13Sun Y.

Corneas of C57BL/6 and CD14−/− mice were abraded and infected topically with 1 × 105 virulent P. aeruginosa as described (13Sun Y. Karmakar M. Roy S. Ramadan R.T. Williams S.R. Howell S. Shive C.L.

Immunol. 2010; 185: 4272-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After 24 h, corneas were homogenized, and cytokines were measured by ELISA. Fig. 5A shows that as with corneal epithelial cells, CCL5/RANTES production was significantly lower in infected corneas from CD14−/− compared with C57BL/6 mice. Conversely, CD14−/− mice had significantly elevated IL-6, CXCL1, and CXCL2 compared with C57BL/6 mice. To determine the effect of CD14 deficiency on cellular infiltration, total cells in the cornea were quantified by flow cytometry using the Ly6G monoclonal Ab NIMPR-14 and the F4/80 macrophage Ab. As shown in Fig. 5B, there were significantly more neutrophils in the corneas of CD14−/− mice compared with C57BL/6 mice, whereas there was no significant difference in the number of macrophages. Consistent with the increased neutrophil numbers, total cfu in infected corneas of CD14−/− mice were significantly lower than C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 5D). Normal mammalian corneas are transparent, and although there are resident fibroblasts and macrophages, neutrophils migrate into the corneal stroma from peripheral l"
https://openalex.org/W2000591680,"Caspase-8 is now appreciated to govern both apoptosis following death receptor ligation and cell survival and growth via inhibition of the Ripoptosome. Cells must therefore carefully regulate the high level of caspase-8 activity during apoptosis versus the modest levels observed during cell growth. The caspase-8 paralogue c-FLIP is a good candidate for a molecular rheostat of caspase-8 activity. c-FLIP can inhibit death receptor-mediated apoptosis by competing with caspase-8 for recruitment to FADD. However, full-length c-FLIPL can also heterodimerize with caspase-8 independent of death receptor ligation and activate caspase-8 via an activation loop in the C terminus of c-FLIPL. This triggers cleavage of c-FLIPL at Asp-376 by caspase-8 to produce p43FLIP. The continued function of p43FLIP has, however, not been determined. We demonstrate that acute deletion of endogenous c-FLIP in murine effector T cells results in loss of caspase-8 activity and cell death. The lethality and caspase-8 activity can both be rescued by the transgenic expression of p43FLIP. Furthermore, p43FLIP associates with Raf1, TRAF2, and RIPK1, which augments ERK and NF-κB activation, IL-2 production, and T cell proliferation. Thus, not only is c-FLIP the initiator of caspase-8 activity during T cell activation, it is also an initial caspase-8 substrate, with cleaved p43FLIP serving to both stabilize caspase-8 activity and promote activation of pathways involved with T cell growth."

These double-membrane sinusoidal structures are formed by compressing the ER lumen to a constant width of 15 nm, and are highly enriched in the ATPase activator LULL1. Further, we define an important role for a highly conserved aromatic motif at the C terminus of Torsins.

https://openalex.org/W2038860020,"Multidrug resistance is a major barrier against successful chemotherapy, and this has been shown in vitro to be often caused by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. These transporters are frequently overexpressed in human cancers and confer an adverse prognosis in many common malignancies. The genetic factors, however, that initiate their expression in cancer are largely unknown. Here we report that the major multidrug transporter ABCG2 (BCRP/MXR) is directly and specifically activated by the transcription factor E2F1--a factor perturbed in the majority of human cancers. E2F1 regulates ABCG2 expression in multiple cell systems, and, importantly, we have identified a significant correlation between elevated E2F1 and ABCG2 expression in human lung cancers. We show that E2F1 causes chemotherapeutic drug efflux both in vitro and in vivo via ABCG2. Furthermore, the E2F1-ABCG2 axis suppresses chemotherapy-induced cell death that can be restored by the inhibition of ABCG2. These findings therefore identify a new axis in multidrug resistance and highlight a radical new function of E2F1 that is relevant to tumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2038740066,"Metastasis is responsible for more than 90% of the mortality observed among patients with breast cancer. Human phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (hPEBP4) is a novel member of the PEBP family and functions as an anti-apoptotic molecule. Here, we found that the metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells expressed much higher levels of hPEBP4 than the nonmetastatic MCF-7 breast cancer cells and that the expression levels of hPEBP4 were positively correlated with the metastasis of clinical breast cancer. The hPEBP4 overexpression in the MDA-MB-231 cells significantly promoted cell invasion in vitro and increased the development of lymph node metastasis in vivo. Conversely, the silencing of hPEBP4 suppressed the cell-invasive ability both in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation showed that hPEBP4 promoted the expression or activity of the metastasis-related proteinases MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) 2, MMP9 and MMP13. This hPEBP4-potentiated cell invasion and MMP expression is due to an increase in Akt activation. Knockdown of Akt restored hPEBP4-induced breast tumor metastasis in the hPEBP4-MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model. Moreover, we found that hPEBP4 functioned as a scaffolding molecule and enhanced the association of Akt with Src to promote Akt tyrosine phosphorylation, a prerequisite for the full activation of Akt, in a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding domain-dependent manner. Given the present information about human breast cancer, these functional data from cell culture and animal studies suggest that, in human breast cancer hPEBP4 is a novel and clinically relevant metastasis accelerator gene and may be a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for breast cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2066308932,"The aged liver is more sensitive to the drug treatments and has a high probability of developing liver disorders such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. Here we present mechanisms underlying age-associated severe liver injury and acceleration of liver proliferation after CCl4 treatments. We have examined liver response to CCl4 treatments using old WT mice and young C/EBPα-S193D knockin mice, which express an aged-like isoform of C/EBPα. Both animal models have altered chromatin structure as well as increased liver injury and proliferation after acute CCl4 treatments. We found that these age-related changes are associated with the repression of key regulators of liver biology: C/EBPα, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and telomere reverse transcriptase (TERT). In quiescent livers of old WT and young S193D mice, the inhibition of TERT is mediated by HDAC1-C/EBPα complexes. After CCl4 treatments, TERT, C/EBPα and FXR are repressed by different mechanisms. These mechanisms include the increase of a dominant negative isoform, C/EBPβ-LIP, and subsequent repression of C/EBPα, FXR, and TERT promoters. C/EBPβ-LIP also disrupts Rb-E2F1 complexes in C/EBPα-S193D mice after CCl4 treatments. To examine if these alterations are involved in drug-mediated liver diseases, we performed chronic treatments of mice with CCl4. We found that C/EBPα-S193D mice developed fibrosis much more rapidly than WT mice.

Treatment of aged patients involves the use of drugs including those utilized for chemotherapy. The liver is the main organ of this drug and toxicant metabolism, which makes it the primary target of chemically induced injury. As the result of this injury, the liver starts proliferating, a characteristic that contributes to development of several diseases including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC (1Fujii T.

Therefore, the S193D mice represent a powerful animal model for the investigations of the responses of livers of aged mice to drug treatments. Another member of C/EBP family, C/EBPβ, is similar to C/EBPα and is involved in the regulation of chromatin structure of hepatocytes through interactions with HDAC1 (16Wang G-L. Salisbury E. Shi X.

In this report, we show that an increase in repressive histone modifications in livers of old WT mice and in livers of young S193D mice changes the response of the liver to CCl4 injury. The main differences between young and old WT mice in the response to CCl4 are elevation of C/EBPβ-LIP in livers of old mice and subsequent repression of three key regulators of liver functions: TERT, C/EBPα, and FXR. These age-related alterations lead to an increase in liver injury and apoptosis and to an increase in liver proliferation after CCl4 treatments. We also found that chronic treatments with CCl4 cause a significantly higher level of fibrosis in S193D mice than in WT mice. This suggests that the molecular alterations observed in S193D mice may contribute to development of drug-mediated liver diseases in old patients. Antibodies to C/EBPα (14AA), C/EBPβ (C-19), cdc2 (L-19), PCNA (FL-261), FXR (H-130), Rb (IF8), E2F1, HP1α, CUGBP1, elF2α, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β (Tyr 216), CYP2E1, CYP2B1/2, and CYP3A were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to C/EBPβ (A16) and trimethylated histone H3K9 were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Monoclonal antibody against to β-actin was from Sigma-Aldrich. Telomerase activity was measured using quantitative telomerase detection kit (Allied Biotech, Vallejo, CA). Wild-type and S193D mice were maintained as previously described (22Wang G-L. Shi X. Haefliger S. Jin J. Major A. Iakova P. Finegold M. Timchenko N.A. Elimination of C/EBPα through the ubiquitin-proteasome system promotes the development of liver cancer in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 2549-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this report, we used young mice (2–3-month-old) and old mice (20–22-month-old) for all studies. For the simplicity of presentation, young mice are shown on figures as 2-month-old (2m) mice and old mice are shown as 22-month-old (22m). Young and old mice (males) were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of 10% CCl4 in olive oil (5.0 ml/kg) or vehicle control as the zero time point. Mice were treated for 4 weeks with 10% CCl4 in olive oil (5 ml/kg I.P; 3 times/week). BrdU was injected in mice 4 h before they were sacrificed. Liver damage and fibrosis were examined by staining with markers of fibrosis α-SMA and Sirius Red. All data in this report represent summaries of work with 5–6 mice of each age-group per each time point after CCl4 injections. Experiments with animals have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor College of Medicine (protocol AN-2503). Mice were anesthetized and rapidly exsanguinated through the caudal vana cava. Liver pieces were quickly removed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed routinely and embedded in paraffin wax for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. BrdU was injected intraperitoneally 2 h before mice were sacrifice, and BrdU staining was performed using BrdU uptake assay kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Hepatocyte apoptosis was detected by using In situ Cell Death Detection (TUNEL) kit from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). Sirius Red staining was performed using “Direct Red 80” (Sirius Red, Sigma-Aldrich) kit. α-SMA immunostaining was performed with “Actin, α-Smooth Muscle, Immunohistology kit” (Sigma). Serum ALT and AST were measured at Baylor College of Medicine Facilities. Nuclear extracts were isolated from liver tissues and used for the Western blotting and for Co-IP as described in our previous publication (21Orellana D. Liu X. Wang G-L. Jin J. Iakova P.

The Rneasy Plus minikit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) was applied to extract total RNA, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of PCR primers were as follows: mC/EBPα: 5′-ATGGAGTCGGCCGACTTCTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTCTCGTGCTCGCAGATGCC-3′ (reverse); mCUGBP1: 5′-TCTGGGAAAACCTGTGGATA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACAAAAAGCAGCTGGAAAT-3′(reverse); β-actin: 5′-TCTTGGGTATGGAATCCTGTGGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCT-3′ (reverse); primers for mFXR and mTERT were the same as in references (18Jin J.

Rb and CUGBP1 were immunoprecipitated from nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts correspondingly with monoclonal antibodies, and the presence of E2F1 and C/EBPβ in Rb IPs and eIF2α in CUGBP1 IPs was examined by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies to the mentioned proteins. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described in our previous articles, using the ChIP-IT Kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the chromatin solutions were prepared from liver tissues, and DNA was sheared by sonication. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ (C-19 and A16), HDAC1, acetylated histone H3K9, and trimetylated histone H3K9 were immunoprecipitated from the solutions. DNA was isolated and used for PCRs with primers covering the C/EBP binding sites within C/EBPα, FXR and mTERT promoters. The sequences of the primers for the mTERT are as follows: 5′-AGGCGGCAGACCTCCTATAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGAGAGGGGCTGCTGAATTT-3′ (reverse). PCR mixtures were amplified, and PCR products were separated by 8% PAGE. All values are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. Statistical significance was assumed when *, p < 0.05. Liver functions decline with age, leading to development of age-associated diseases (11Timchenko N.A. Monga S.P.

Metabol. 2009; 20: 171-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Previous studies with rats have shown that livers of old rats have an increased liver injury and accelerated liver proliferation after CCl4 treatments (2Murali B. Korrapati M.C. Warbritton A.

Since C/EBPα is a critical regulator of liver functions in old mice, we have generated C/EBPα-S193D mice, which express an aged-like isoform of C/EBPα. These mice have altered chromatin structure and developed several aged-like dysfunctions of the liver at young age (6Jin J. Iakova P. Wang G-L. Shi X. Haefliger S. Finegold M. Timchenko N.A.

Invest. 2010; 120: 2549-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined if young S193D mice and old WT mice have similar responses to CCl4 treatments. In a prior investigation of effects of CCl4 on young S193D mice and old WT mice, we examined chromatin structure and expression of histone H3 trimethylation at K9 as a marker for heterochromatin in our experimental mice. Western blotting showed that amounts of H3K9-trimethyl are dramatically increased in livers of both old WT and young S193D mice (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this increase, immunostaining showed that chromatin structure is changed in both old WT mice and in young S193D mice (Fig. 1A). Therefore, given similarities in the change of chromatin structure, we used the S193D mouse model and old WT mice for the elucidation of mechanisms of age-mediated increase of liver proliferation after CCl4 injections. Mice were treated with CCl4 and investigated by several approaches. H&E staining showed that livers of old WT and young S193D mice have more fatty degenerated hepatocytes around central veins starting from 6 h after CCl4 treatments (Fig. 1B). Levels of ALT and AST are also higher in serum of old WT and young S193D mice than those in young WT mice at 6 and 24 h after CCl4 injections (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these studies showed that livers of old WT and young S193D mice undergo much higher damage after CCl4 treatment than livers of young WT mice. One of the important responses to CCl4 is the activation of apoptosis to remove the damaged cells. Therefore, we compared the number of apoptotic cells in livers of old WT, young S193D and young WT mice using TUNEL staining. In all three animal groups, TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the area of centrilobular necrosis at 24 h after CCl4 injections. However, the number of apoptotic cells is much higher in young S193D and old WT mice than that in young WT mice at 24 h (Fig. 1D). In livers of young WT mice, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was increased at later time points. Taken together, this study demonstrated that livers of young S193D and old WT mice are more susceptible to CCl4-induced liver injury and that apoptosis is dramatically activated in these mice at 24 h after CCl4 injection. We next compared liver proliferation in young WT, old WT, and young S193D mice after CCl4 treatment. Since proliferative response to partial hepatectomy is reduced in old WT mice (11Timchenko N.A. Monga S.P. Molecular Pathology of the Liver Diseases. Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, New York2011: 279-290Google Scholar, 12Timchenko N.A. Aging and liver regeneration.Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 2009; 20: 171-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and because C/EBPα-S193D inhibits liver proliferation after partial hepatectomy (22Wang G-L. Shi X. Haefliger S. Jin J. Major A. Iakova P. Finegold M. Timchenko N.A. Elimination of C/EBPα through the ubiquitin-proteasome system promotes the development of liver cancer in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 2549-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we expected that both old WT mice and young S193D mice might have a reduced proliferation of hepatocytes after CCl4 treatment. However, BrdU uptake showed that the number of proliferating hepatocytes is higher in livers of young S193D and old WT mice compared with that in young WT mice (Fig. 2, A, B, G, H). To confirm this observation, we applied two additional approaches: examination of mitosis and examination of cell cycle proteins. The examination of mitotic figures revealed that the number of hepatocytes with mitotic figures is higher in livers of old WT mice than that in livers of young WT mice (Fig. 2C). We also found that the mitosis occurs early in S193D mice with a broad peak between 48 and 72 h, while mitosis takes place at 72 h in young WT mice (Fig. 2I). Examination of expression of cell cycle proteins, PCNA and cdc2, by Western blotting showed that these proteins are elevated in all three groups of mice; however, the degree of elevation (as a ratio to β-actin) is higher in livers of old WT mice (Fig. 2, D–F) and in livers of young S193D mice (Fig. 2, J–L). Thus, three independent approaches showed that liver proliferation is accelerated in old WT and in young S193D mice treated with CCl4 compared with proliferation of the liver in young WT mice. We further investigated several possibilities that could contribute to the molecular basis for the severe damage and for the increased liver proliferation in old WT and young S193D mice. First, we determined the expression of enzymes which convert CCl4 in the liver. We focused our studies on expression of cytochromes CYP2E1, CYP2B1/2, and CYP3A, which are major enzymes that contribute to execute the biotransformation of CCl4 (24Zangar R.C. Benson J.M. Burnett V.L. Springer D.L. Cytochrome P450 is the primary enzyme responsible for low-dose carbon tetrachloride metabolism in human liver microsomes.Chem. Biol.

Gonzalez F.J. Regulation of P450 genes by liver-enriched transcription factors and nuclear receptors.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 17: 223-234Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We did not observe significant differences for these proteins in the livers of WT and S193D mice (Fig. 3A) suggesting that S193D livers convert CCl4 as well as livers of young WT mice. Examination of the GSK3β pathway also showed no significant differences in the expression of total GSK3β in livers of young WT and S193D mice (Fig. 3A). We also examined expression of the active form, Tyr216-ph-GSK3β. These studies showed that the expression of Tyr216 ph-GSK3β is reduced at early time points in S193D mice, but it is slightly higher at later time points (Fig. 3A). Since these differences are minor, we think that it is unlikely that GSK3β is involved in acceleration of liver proliferation in S193D mice. Given our previous observations that both S193D-C/EBPα and ph-S193-C/EBPα inhibit liver proliferation (22Wang G-L. Shi X. Haefliger S. Jin J. Major A. Iakova P. Finegold M. Timchenko N.A.

We found that the levels of C/EBPα are reduced in all three groups; however, the reduction of C/EBPα in old WT and young S193D mice takes place early and to higher degree (Fig. 3, B–D). Previous reports have shown that farnesoid X receptor, FXR, is a critical regulator of liver biology and that the deletion of FXR affects liver repair after CCl4 treatment (27Meng Z. Wang Y. Wang L.

Although multiple gastric cancer genomes have been sequenced, the driving recurrent gene fusions have not been well characterized. Here, we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to identify novel gene fusions in 18 human gastric cancer cell lines and 18 pairs of primary human gastric cancer tissues and their adjacent normal tissues. Multiple samples revealed expression of PPP1R1B-STARD3 fusion transcript. The presence of PPP1R1B-STARD3 correlated with elevated levels of PPP1R1B mRNA. PPP1R1B-STARD3 fusion transcript was detected in 21.3% of primary human gastric cancers but not in adjacent matched normal gastric tissues. Based on reverse transcription PCR analysis of DNA, unlike other fusions described in gastric cancer, the PPP1R1B-STARD3 appears to be generated by RNA processing without chromosomal rearrangement. Overexpression of PPP1R1B-STARD3 in MKN-28 significantly increased cell proliferation and colony formation. This increased proliferation was mediated by activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling. Furthermore, expression of PPP1R1B-STARD3 fusion transcript enhanced the tumor growth of MKN-28 cells in athymic nude mice. These findings show that PPP1R1B-STARD3 fusion transcript has a key role in subsets of gastric cancers through the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2167918456,"Previous studies have demonstrated that cyclin D1, an upstream regulator of the Rb/E2F pathway, is an essential component of the ErbB2/Ras (but not the Wnt/Myc) oncogenic pathway in the mammary epithelium. However, the role of specific E2fs for ErbB2/Ras-mediated mammary tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here, we show that in the majority of mouse and human primary mammary carcinomas with ErbB2/HER2 overexpression, E2f3a is up-regulated, raising the possibility that E2F3a is a critical effector of the ErbB2 oncogenic signaling pathway in the mammary gland. We examined the consequence of ablating individual E2fs in mice on ErbB2-triggered mammary tumorigenesis in comparison to a comparable Myc-driven mammary tumor model. We found that loss of E2f1 or E2f3 led to a significant delay in tumor onset in both oncogenic models, whereas loss of E2f2 accelerated mammary tumorigenesis driven by Myc-overexpression. Furthermore, southern blot analysis of final tumors derived from conditionally deleted E2f3−/loxP mammary glands revealed that there is a selection against E2f3−/− cells from developing mammary carcinomas, and that such selection pressure is higher in the presence of ErbB2 activation than in the presence of Myc activation. Taken together, our data suggest oncogenic activities of E2F1 and E2F3 in ErbB2- or Myc-triggered mammary tumorigenesis, and a tumor suppressor role of E2F2 in Myc-mediated mammary tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1966158578,"Internalization of the Na+/K+-ATPase (the Na+ pump) has been studied in the human lung carcinoma cell line H1299 that expresses YFP-tagged α1 from its normal genomic localization. Both real-time imaging and surface biotinylation have demonstrated internalization of α1 induced by ≥100 nm ouabain which occurs in a time scale of hours. Unlike previous studies in other systems, the ouabain-induced internalization was insensitive to Src or PI3K inhibitors. Accumulation of α1 in the cells could be augmented by inhibition of lysosomal degradation but not by proteosomal inhibitors. In agreement, the internalized α1 could be colocalized with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 but not with Golgi or nuclear markers. In principle, internalization could be triggered by a conformational change of the ouabain-bound Na+/K+-ATPase molecule or more generally by the disruption of cation homeostasis (Na+, K+, Ca2+) due to the partial inhibition of active Na+ and K+ transport. Overexpression of ouabain-insensitive rat α1 failed to inhibit internalization of human α1 expressed in the same cells. In addition, incubating cells in a K+-free medium did not induce internalization of the pump or affect the response to ouabain. Thus, internalization is not the result of changes in the cellular cation balance but is likely to be triggered by a conformational change of the protein itself. In physiological conditions, internalization may serve to eliminate pumps that have been blocked by endogenous ouabain or other cardiac glycosides.

https://openalex.org/W2007668768,"The toxic subcellular accumulation of lipids predisposes several human metabolic syndromes, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of neurodegeneration. To identify pathways that prevent lipid-induced cell death, we performed a genome-wide fatty acid sensitivity screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified 167 yeast mutants as sensitive to 0.5 mm palmitoleate, 45% of which define pathways that were conserved in humans. 63 lesions also impacted the status of the lipid droplet; however, this was not correlated to the degree of fatty acid sensitivity. The most liposensitive yeast strain arose due to deletion of the ""ARE2 required for viability"" (ARV1) gene, encoding an evolutionarily conserved, potential lipid transporter that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Down-regulation of mammalian ARV1 in MIN6 pancreatic β-cells or HEK293 cells resulted in decreased neutral lipid synthesis, increased fatty acid sensitivity, and lipoapoptosis. Conversely, elevated expression of human ARV1 in HEK293 cells or mouse liver significantly increased triglyceride mass and lipid droplet number. The ARV1-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation was accompanied by up-regulation of DGAT1, a triglyceride synthesis gene, and the fatty acid transporter, CD36. Furthermore, ARV1 was identified as a transcriptional of the protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a key regulator of lipid homeostasis whose transcriptional targets include DGAT1 and CD36. These results implicate ARV1 as a protective factor in lipotoxic diseases due to modulation of fatty acid metabolism. In conclusion, a lipotoxicity-based genetic screen in a model microorganism has identified 75 human genes that may play key roles in neutral lipid metabolism and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2033884767,"Asparagine-linked glycosylation is a post-translational protein modification that is conserved in all domains of life. The initial transfer of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) onto acceptor asparagines is catalyzed by the integral membrane protein oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). The previously reported structure of a single-subunit OST enzyme, the Campylobacter lari protein PglB, revealed a partially disordered external loop (EL5), whose role in catalysis was unclear. We identified a new and functionally important sequence motif in EL5 containing a conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr293) whose aromatic side chain is essential for catalysis. A synthetic peptide containing the conserved motif can partially but specifically rescue in vitro activity of mutated PglB lacking Tyr293. Using site-directed disulfide cross-linking, we show that disengagement of the structurally ordered part of EL5 is an essential step of the glycosylation reaction, probably by allowing sequon binding or glyco-product release. Our findings define two distinct mechanistic roles of EL5 in OST-catalyzed glycosylation. These functions, exerted by the two halves of EL5, are independent, because the loop can be cleaved by specific proteolysis with only slight reduction in activity."
https://openalex.org/W2094745777,"The induction of the intrinsic antiviral defense in mammals relies on the accumulation of foreign genetic material. As such, complete engagement of this response is limited to replication-competent viruses. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are mediators of this defense with shared enhancer elements but display a spectrum of transcriptional potential. Here we describe a mechanism designed to enhance this response should a pathogen not be successfully inhibited. We find that activation of IRF7 results in the induction of MAP3K8 and restructuring of the antiviral transcriptome. MAP3K8 mediates the phosphorylation and repression of IRF3 homodimers to promote greater transcriptional activity through utilization of IRF3:IRF7 heterodimers. Among the genes influenced by the MAP3K8/IRF7 signaling axis are members of the SP100 gene family that serve as general transcriptional enhancers of the antiviral defense. We propose that this feed forward loop serves to reinforce the cellular response and is reserved for imminent threats to the host."
https://openalex.org/W2056258826,"Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF) is a cytokine endowed with multiple functions, depending on the cellular and environmental context. TNF receptor engagement induces the formation of a multimolecular complex including the TNFR-associated factor TRAF2, the receptor-interaction protein kinase RIP1 and the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis cIAP1, the latter being essential for NF-κB activation. Here, we show that cIAP1 also regulates TNF-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization through a cdc42-dependent, NF-κB-independent pathway. Deletion of cIAP1 prevents TNF-induced filopodia and cdc42 activation. The expression of cIAP1 or its E3-ubiquitin ligase-defective mutant restores the ability of cIAP1−/− MEFs to produce filopodia, whereas a cIAP1 mutant unable to bind TRAF2 does not. Accordingly, the silencing of TRAF2 inhibits TNF-mediated filopodia formation, whereas silencing of RIP1 does not. cIAP1 directly binds cdc42 and promotes its RhoGDIα-mediated stabilization. TNF decreases cIAP1-cdc42 interaction, suggesting that TNF-induced recruitment of cIAP1/TRAF2 to the receptor releases cdc42, which in turn triggers actin remodeling. cIAP1 also regulates cdc42 activation in response to EGF and HRas-V12 expression. A downregulation of cIAP1 altered the cell polarization, the cell adhesion to endothelial cells and cell intercalation, which are cdc42-dependent processes. Finally, we demonstrated that the deletion of cIAP1 regulated the HRas-V12-mediated transformation process, including anchorage-dependent cell growth, tumour growth in a xenograft model and the development of experimental metastasis in the lung."

Here, we find that the translocase requirements can be altered for PClep in a predictable manner by changing the polarity and charge of the peptide region that is translocated across the membrane. When the polarity of the translocated peptide region is lowered and the charged residues in this region are removed, translocation of this loop region occurs largely by a YidC- and Sec-independent mechanism. When the polarity is increased to that of the wild-type procoat protein, the YidC insertase is essential for translocation. Further increasing the polarity, by adding charged residues, switches the insertion pathway to a YidC/Sec mechanism. Conversely, we find that increasing the hydrophobicity of the transmembrane segments of PClep can decrease the translocase requirement for translocation of the peptide chain.

In Escherichia coli, two main translocases have been identified to date, and they are involved in inserting inner membrane proteins (1Kudva R. Denks K. Kuhn P. Vogt A. Müller M. Koch H.G.

The Sec translocase is the major translocase of E. coli and is responsible for inserting the majority of the inner membrane proteins as well as translocating exported proteins across the inner membrane into the periplasmic space. The second is the YidC membrane insertase, which plays a role in inner membrane protein insertion and assembly. The Sec translocase is a heterotrimeric protein composed of the SecYEG protein-conducting channel, the accessory SecDF-YajC trimeric complex, and the peripheral subunit SecA. SecA is mainly involved in the insertion of proteins with large periplasmic domains (4Andersson H. von Heijne G.

It is believed to insert ∼20–30 residues for every ATP hydrolysis cycle (7Economou A. Wickner W.

It is believed to function in concert with the Sec translocase to integrate proteins into the lipid bilayer and can also act, in certain cases, as a chaperone assisting membrane proteins to attain their correct membrane-embedded fold within the membrane (3Dalbey R.E. Wang P. Kuhn A. Assembly of bacterial inner membrane proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 161-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).

Because of this common feature, it has been suggested that YidC is only capable of acting as an insertase for proteins with small periplasmic domains, whereas larger periplasmic domains require the Sec pathway for translocation. Interestingly, several studies have shown that modification of the primary structure of different YidC-only substrates can alter their insertion pathway to a Sec-dependent mechanism. The first observation was that an extension of the periplasmic loop of the M13 procoat by 174 residues (from OmpA) 2The abbreviations used are:OmpAouter membrane protein APClepprocoat lepTMtransmembrane segmentPKproteinase K. switches the protein from a Sec-independent pathway to the Sec pathway (5Kuhn A.

In this study, we present the polarity/charge hypothesis, which proposes that the membrane transfer expense of the translocated region determines the translocase requirement. We show that the insertion mechanism of Procoat lep (PClep) can be altered in a predictable way by changing the charge and polarity of the peptide region that is translocated. Although translocation of a peptide of low polarity can occur in a YidC/Sec-independent manner, YidC is required for translocation when the periplasmic loop is made more polar. Further increases in the polarity, by the substitution of positively charged residues or inserting negatively charged residues in PClep, change the mechanism such that both the YidC and Sec translocases are needed. However, substitution of apolar amino acids, with charged residues in the transmembrane segment of PClep to decrease its hydrophobicity, can also increase the requirements for a translocase.

An equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) buffer (m/v) was then added to the sample and incubated on ice for another 1 h. The total protein was then spun down at 14,000 × g for 10 min and washed with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone. The protein pellet was then solubilized with Tris-SDS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2% (m/v) SDS). The samples were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to leader peptidase (Lep) to precipitate the PClep derivatives or with antiserum to OmpA for a control. For the SecA inhibition studies, the cells were pretreated with sodium azide (3 mm final concentration) for 5 min prior to labeling of the cells. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. All the positively and negatively charged mutants, neutral polar mutants, as well as the hydrophobic derivatives were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The M13 coat protein is synthesized as a precursor called procoat with a cleavable signal sequence and a mature region consisting of a 20-amino acid periplasmic loop and a transmembrane segment (Fig. 1). The signal sequence of procoat is proteolytically removed by signal peptidase 1 (SP1, also known as leader peptidase) to generate the mature coat protein after membrane insertion. In our study, we used PClep in which the cytoplasmic region is extended by 103 amino acids of the P2 domain of SP1 (30Kuhn A. Zhu H.Y. Dalbey R.E.

This extension makes the protein easier to detect by using an antibody. Wild-type PClep has a total of five charged amino acids in the periplasmic loop between the signal peptide and the membrane anchor. It contains four negatively charged and one positively charged residue, giving it a predicted net charge of −3 (Fig. 1). The YidC dependence of wild-type PClep was assayed using the YidC depletion strain, JS7131, which has yidC under the control of the araBAD promoter (11Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Möller I.

The role of the polar, carboxyl-terminal domain of Escherichia coli leader peptidase in its translocation across the plasma membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13844-13849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, JS7131 cells were converted to spheroplasts, by the addition of lysozyme and EDTA to allow the protease to have access to the inner membrane. A portion of the cells was treated with PK for 60 min to probe membrane insertion of PClep. When the 35S-labeled PClep was expressed under YidC expression conditions, it was processed to the mature form (Fig. 2B, 2nd lane). PK added to the spheroplasts cleaves the translocated periplasmic loop causing a further shift on the gel (Fig. 2B, 1st lane, labeled f; which denotes the fragment with an approximate molecular mass of 15.1 kDa). Under YidC depletion conditions, procoat accumulated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, lane 4) and was protected from PK cleavage (Fig. 2B, lane 3) (Fig. 2B, labeled p with a molecular mass of 19.46 kDa; corresponding to PClep). When YidC was present, PClep was inserted across the membrane where SP1 cleaved the signal peptide, giving rise to a lower molecular mass protein (Fig. 2B, labeled c; corresponding to coat lep with a molecular mass of 17.07 kDa). The Sec dependence of the wild-type PClep and respective mutants was studied in the SecE depletion strain, CM124. Cells bearing the respective mutants on a plasmid were back-diluted in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.4% glucose (SecE depletion conditions) or 0.4% glucose + 0.2% arabinose (SecE expression conditions) for 8–9 h. The cells were then transferred to fresh M9 medium and grown for 30 min before induction and 35S labeling of the protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Depletion of SecE had no effect on the membrane insertion of procoat because the mature Clep is detected under both SecE expression and depletion conditions (Fig. 2B, center panel). This mature Clep was efficiently digested by PK to give rise to the fragment (Fig. 2B, f) confirming that what we are seeing is indeed the transmembrane segment Clep. Outer membrane protein A was used as a control for efficient SecE depletion (Fig. 2F) because it requires the SecA/SecYEG to translocate across the inner membrane. Under SecE depletion conditions, OmpA accumulated as a cytoplasmic precursor, ProOmpA, as evidenced by the slower migration on the gel. Similarly, addition of sodium azide to the cells prior to pulse labeling causes an inhibition of the SecA ATPase activity (32Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Azide-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli alter the SecA protein, an azide-sensitive component of the protein export machinery.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Insertion of PClep into the membrane was unaffected by inhibition of SecA function. Once again, OmpA was used as a control to confirm efficient SecA inhibition (Fig. 2F). OmpA controls were carried out for every experiment performed in this study, but are just being shown once for representative purposes. To investigate if the charges in the loop of PClep play a role in determining the mechanism of membrane insertion, we studied a series of mutants with a progressively increasing number of positively charged residues at the +2, +4, and +5 positions (30Kuhn A. Zhu H.Y. Dalbey R.E. Efficient translocation of positively charged residues of M13 procoat protein across the membrane excludes electrophoresis as the primary force for membrane insertion.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2385-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the mutants are depicted in Fig. 2A. We first studied the ARGNN PClep mutant with an arginine at the +2 position, giving the periplasmic loop a net charge of +1. Fig. 2C shows that this procoat mutant is strictly dependent on YidC because membrane insertion of ARGNN PClep was completely blocked under YidC depletion conditions. Interestingly, this mutant now appears to be slightly SecE-dependent, as well as SecA-dependent for insertion. This is evident by the slight accumulation of precursor observed under SecE depletion conditions and SecA inhibition conditions. Fig. 2D shows that ANGRR PClep with 2 arginines at the +4 and +5 positions and a net charge of +2 in the loop is also completely YidC-dependent for membrane insertion (Fig. 2D). However, in this case, the extent of SecE and SecA dependence was stronger as compared with the ARGNN PClep mutant. A significant portion of the protein accumulated as a cytoplasmic precursor under SecE depletion/SecA inhibition conditions. Membrane insertion of ARGRR PClep, with 3 arginine residues at +2, +4, and +5 positions of PClep, became dramatically more SecE/SecA-dependent for membrane insertion as compared with the other positively charged mutants, but it remained YidC-dependent for insertion. Fig. 2E shows the majority of the protein accumulated in the cytoplasm under SecE depletion conditions and almost all of the protein accumulated when SecA was inhibited, showing that this protein was strongly dependent on the Sec translocase for insertion. Thus, it appears that there is a linear relationship between the number of positively charged residues in the loop of PClep and the extent of Sec dependence (see supplemental Table S1 for quantification of the membrane insertion efficiency under the various depletion conditions). To examine if the addition of a positively charged residue to the transmembrane segment of PClep and to the H-region of the signal peptide had a similar effect on Sec recruitment as the addition of a positive charge in the loop, we proceeded to substitute the methionine at the −5 position with an arginine in the signal sequence of PClep (see Fig. 3A for construct). This mutant, designated L-R PClep, remained YidC-dependent for insertion, as the precursor form was resistant to PK in the JS7131 strain (Fig. 3B). The positively charged residues in the signal peptide made the protein slightly dependent on the Sec translocase for insertion, as judged from the small accumulation of preprotein under SecE depletion conditions. Similarly, membrane insertion was affected when SecA was inhibited by the addition of sodium azide. Interestingly, substitution of a negatively charged residue (L-D PClep) in place of the positively charged residue also caused the protein to be slightly SecE/SecA-dependent for insertion, while remaining completely YidC-dependent (Fig. 3C). PClep with a positively charged residue substituted for the glycine at +23 in the transmembrane segment of PClep (TM-R PClep) strictly required YidC for membrane insertion, but both SecE as well as SecA made insertion more efficient (Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed with an aspartic acid (TM-D PClep) introduced at the same position (+23) within the TM segment (Fig. 3E). To study whether the addition of multiple charges had a cumulative effect on the Sec requirement of PClep, we incorporated arginine residues into both the signal sequence and the transmembrane segment of the protein (L/TM-R PClep). As seen in Fig. 3F, this protein showed a dramatic increase in the Sec dependence with more than half of the protein being accumulated in the cytoplasm under SecE depletion conditions or when SecA was inhibited. Substitution of aspartic acid residues at both positions in the protein (L/TM-D PClep) caused the protein to be SecA- and SecE-dependent for insertion, in addition to being completely YidC-dependent (Fig. 3G). Next, we examined whether the substitution of a neutral hydrophilic residue would have the same effect as a charged residue when added to the same positions as the charged residues in the signal peptide or TM sequence. The mutants L-Q, TM-Q, and L/TM-Q showed no Sec requirement, while remaining completely dependent on YidC for insertion (Fig. 3, H–J, respectively). Taken together, these studies show that Sec requirement was enhanced only when a charged residue was added and not with a neutral polar residue. Previously, we found that the Sec dependence of insertion was increased by adding two to three negatively charged residues to the wild-type PClep (8Chen M. Xie K. Yuan J. Yi L. Facey S.J. Pradel N.

https://openalex.org/W2080495917,"The DNA damage response (DDR) promotes genome integrity and serves as a cancer barrier in precancerous lesions but paradoxically may promote cancer survival. Genes that activate the DDR when dysregulated could function as useful biomarkers for outcome in cancer patients. Using a siRNA screen in human pancreatic cancer cells, we identified the CHD5 tumor suppressor as a gene, which, when silenced, activates the DDR. We evaluated the relationship of CHD5 expression with DDR activation in human pancreatic cancer cells and the association of CHD5 expression in 80 patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) by immunohistochemical analysis with clinical outcome. CHD5 depletion and low CHD5 expression in human pancreatic cancer cells lead to increased H2AX-Ser139 and CHK2-Thr68 phosphorylation and accumulation into nuclear foci. On Kaplan–Meier log-rank survival analysis, patients with low CHD5 expression had a median recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 5.3 vs 15.4 months for patients with high CHD5 expression (P=0.03). In 59 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, low CHD5 expression was associated with decreased RFS (4.5 vs 16.3 months; P=0.001) and overall survival (OS) (7.2 vs 21.6 months; P=0.003). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, low CHD5 expression remained associated with worse OS (HR: 3.187 (95% CI: 1.49–6.81); P=0.003) in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, low CHD5 expression activates the DDR and predicts for worse OS in patients with resected PAC receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings support a model in which dysregulated expression of tumor suppressor genes that induce DDR activation can be utilized as biomarkers for poor outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2092523224,"Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is an important component of the immune system and is produced by neutrophils to kill invading microorganisms. The transcription factor HypT is specifically activated by HOCl by methionine oxidation and protects Escherichia coli cells from the detrimental effects of HOCl. HypT forms dodecameric ring-like oligomers. Binding of HypT to DNA induces dissociation of the dodecamers into dimers and tetramers, thus forming the DNA-binding species. To dissect HypT dissociation, binding to DNA, and activation, we aimed to dissociate the dodecamers independently of DNA and to analyze HOCl-dependent activation in vitro. We found that HypT dodecamers dissociated into tetramers in the presence of l-arginine and NaCl, which was reversible upon dilution of the additive. Making use of the reversible dissociation, we generated mixed assemblies consisting of wild-type and mutant HypT subunits and determined that mutant subunits with reduced thermal stability were stabilized by wild-type HypT in the mixed assembly. HypT tetramers, as present at high NaCl concentrations, were stabilized against thermal unfolding and aggregation triggered by high HOCl concentrations. Importantly, in vitro activation by HOCl of HypT tetramers was completed within 1 min, whereas activation of dodecamers required 1 h for completion. Furthermore, activation of HypT tetramers required stoichiometric amounts of HOCl instead of an excess of HOCl, as observed for dodecamers. This supports the idea that small HypT oligomers are the activation-competent species, whereas the dodecamers are a storage form.

Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a strongly antimicrobial reactive oxygen species with high oxidizing potential.

Changes in the oligomeric state of proteins can also be enforced by using chemical additives that are known to alter the oligomerization and increase the stability and/or solubility of proteins such as urea, l-arginine, and salt (17Rudolph R. Lilie H. In vitro folding of inclusion body proteins.FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar).

In this study, we aimed to analyze the requirements for HypT activation by HOCl. Considering that the DNA-binding species, the in vivo HOCl-activated species, and the constitutively active HypT mutant are small oligomers (9Gebendorfer K.M. Drazic A. Le Y. Gundlach J.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 9493-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we wanted to dissociate HypT dodecamers into smaller oligomers prior to activation by HOCl. Although DNA causes dissociation of HypT into smaller oligomers, the presence of DNA complicates the study of HypT activation by HOCl because DNA reacts with HOCl. Therefore, we used additives known to destabilize oligomers as a tool to dissociate the HypT dodecamer (i.e. inactive HypT) into smaller oligomers independently of DNA. We show that l-arginine and NaCl caused reversible dissociation of HypT. Reassociation did not exclusively require identical HypT species but could also be achieved using different subunits, thus allowing for generation of mixed assemblies. l-Arginine and NaCl did not cause significant conformational changes but increased the thermal stability of HypT, and NaCl also increased the stability of HypT against HOCl-induced aggregation. NaCl-induced dissociation into small oligomers strongly accelerated HypT activation by HOCl. This supports the idea that the small oligomers (i.e. the previously identified DNA-binding species (9Gebendorfer K.M. Drazic A. Le Y. Gundlach J. Bepperling A. Kastenmüller A. Ganzinger K.A.

Values were corrected for buffer depending on salt and arginine concentrations. The oligomerization state was analyzed by the c(s) method provided with the SedFit software or dc/dt method analyzed with the dc/dt+ software. HypT (0.3–1.2 mg/ml) in storage buffer was incubated with various concentrations of l-arginine or dl-arginine (Sigma-Aldrich), NaCl, or urea (37 °C, 0.5 h). These additives have been described to alter the oligomerization state of certain proteins and increase the stability and/or solubility of proteins (17Rudolph R. Lilie H. In vitro folding of inclusion body proteins.FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Here, these additives were used to test whether HypT dodecamers can be forced to dissociate into smaller oligomers. A 2 m l-arginine or 0.7 m dl-arginine stock solution was prepared, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 using HCl. dl-Arginine was used for CD analysis and intrinsic fluorescence, whereas l-arginine was used for all other experiments. Reassociation after arginine or NaCl treatment was induced by diluting samples with gel filtration buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5) and 0.4 m NaCl) to obtain a final concentration of 0.05 m arginine or 0.4 m NaCl (37 °C, 1 h, final protein concentration of 0.03–0.1 mg/ml). HypT* (without a His tag), His-tagged HypT (HypT (9Gebendorfer K.M. Drazic A. Le Y. Gundlach J. Bepperling A. Kastenmüller A. Ganzinger K.A. Braun N. Franzmann T.M. Winter J.

HypT* was then mixed with one of the His-tagged species. Subsequently, additives were either diluted to a final concentration of 0.05 m, removed with a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare), and protein-eluted with gel filtration buffer or removed using a Centricon 10K tube and washed with gel filtration buffer. The same effects were observed for both procedures. The final protein concentration was 0.03–0.08 mg/ml. Samples were loaded onto a HisTrap column (1-ml column volume), His-tagged assemblies were eluted with 0.5 m imidazole, and buffer was exchanged to gel filtration buffer using a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare). Using this procedure, exclusively assemblies containing a His tag were purified. Samples in nonreducing sample buffer were separated on a neutral pH gradient SDS gel (Serva), fluorescence was analyzed using a Typhoon scanner (9Gebendorfer K.M. Drazic A. Le Y. Gundlach J. Bepperling A. Kastenmüller A. Ganzinger K.A. Braun N. Franzmann T.M. Winter J. Identification of hypochlorite-specific transcription factor from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 6892-6903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and gels were subsequently blotted onto PVDF membrane followed by decoration with His tag-specific antibodies. The thermal stability of mixed assembled HypT oligomers was followed by thermal stability assays using SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen) (31Ericsson U.B. Hallberg B.M. Detitta G.T. Dekker N. Nordlund P. Thermofluor-based stability of proteins.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 357: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). SYPRO Orange (2 μl; 1:100 dilution) was added to 18 μl of 1.5 μm HypT (in storage buffer), and fluorescence intensity was recorded from 25 to 80 °C in 55 cycles (heating rate of 1 °C/min). The intrinsic fluorescence intensity was analyzed using a HORIBA Yvon FluoroMax-4 fluorometer. HypT (1 μm) was analyzed in storage buffer (excitation at 295 nm, emission at 305–500 nm, 20 °C). Far-UV CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-715 spectrometer with 3–6 μm HypT in the absence or presence of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (1 mm, 1 h). CD spectra were recorded from 205 nm (NaCl) or 215 nm (dl-arginine) to 260 nm at 20 or 37 °C (20 nm/min), accumulating 16 spectra. To determine the thermal stability of proteins, samples were incubated from 20 to 80 °C (heating rate of 20 °C/h), and the CD signal was followed at 222 nm. Curves were fitted using a Boltzmann fit (y = A2 + (A1 − A2)/(1+e((x−x0)/dx))). Dodecameric HypT (0.4 m NaCl) and tetrameric HypT (1.5 m NaCl) were incubated with various concentrations of HOCl (HOCl:HypT molar ratio of 1:1 to 200:1, 37 °C, 1 h). Samples were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant and insoluble proteins were separated on a neutral pH gradient SDS gel, and Coomassie Blue-stained bands were quantified using the ImageJ software. Glutathionylated HypT (HypTGSSG) was used (10Drazic A. Miura H. Peschek J. Le Y. Bach N.C. Kriehuber T. Winter J. Methionine oxidation activates a transcription factor in response to oxidative stress.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 9493-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Dodecameric HypTGSSG (0.4 m NaCl) and tetrameric HypTGSSG (1.5 m NaCl) were incubated with various concentrations of HOCl (yielding defined HOCl:HypT molar ratios, 37 °C), and samples were removed at different time points. HOCl was quenched, and HypT was reduced by the addition of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (1 mm, 37 °C, 2 h). Fluorescence anisotropy with HypT variants (2 μm final concentration) and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled 158-bp metN DNA (10 nm final concentration) was performed exactly as described (9Gebendorfer K.M. Drazic A. Le Y. Gundlach J. Bepperling A. Kastenmüller A. Ganzinger K.A. Braun N. Franzmann T.M. Winter J. Identification of hypochlorite-specific transcription factor from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 6892-6903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HypT forms dodecameric ring-like structures that dissociate into dimers and tetramers upon incubation with DNA, thus forming the DNA-binding species (9Gebendorfer K.M. Drazic A. Le Y. Gundlach J. Bepperling A. Kastenmüller A. Ganzinger K.A. Braun N. Franzmann T.M. Winter J. Identification of hypochlorite-specific transcription factor from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 6892-6903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To dissect dissociation of dodecamers and binding to DNA, we aimed to dissociate HypT independently of DNA. We therefore incubated purified HypT with substances known to destabilize intermolecular interactions such as salt, urea, and l-arginine (23Srinivas V. Raman B. Rao K.S. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. Structural perturbation and enhancement of the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin by arginine hydrochloride.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and analyzed the oligomerization state by analytical ultracentrifugation. HypT sediments at 10–11 S under standard conditions (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 0.4 m NaCl (9Gebendorfer K.M. Drazic A. Le Y. Gundlach J. Bepperling A. Kastenmüller A. Ganzinger K.A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 6892-6903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). The addition of urea did not significantly alter the oligomeric state of HypT, and the protein remained a large oligomer sedimenting at 10–11 S in the presence of up to 1 m urea (Fig. 1A)."
https://openalex.org/W2002418081,"Dysregulation of the Hedgehog (Hh)-Gli signaling pathway is implicated in a variety of human cancers, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), medulloblastoma (MB) and embryonal rhabdhomyosarcoma (eRMS), three principle tumors associated with human Gorlin syndrome. However, the cells of origin of these tumors, including eRMS, remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore the cell populations that give rise to Hh-related tumors by specifically activating Smoothened (Smo) in both Hh-producing and -responsive cell lineages in postnatal mice. Interestingly, we find that unlike BCC and MB, eRMS originates from the stem/progenitor populations that do not normally receive active Hh signaling. Furthermore, we find that the myogenic lineage in postnatal mice is largely Hh quiescent and that Pax7-expressing muscle satellite cells are not able to give rise to eRMS upon Smo or Gli1/2 overactivation in vivo, suggesting that Hh-induced skeletal muscle eRMS arises from Hh/Gli quiescent non-myogenic cells. In addition, using the Gli1 null allele and a Gli3 repressor allele, we reveal a specific genetic requirement for Gli proteins in Hh-induced eRMS formation and provide molecular evidence for the involvement of Sox4/11 in eRMS cell survival and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2107590903,"The ionic pore of the P2X receptor passes through the central axis of six transmembrane (TM) helices, two from each of three subunits. Val(48) and Ile(328) are at the outer end of TM1 and TM2, respectively. Homology models of the open and closed states of P2X2 indicate that pore opening is associated with a large lateral displacement of Ile(328). In addition, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that lipids enter the interstices between the outer ends of the TM domains. The P2X2(I328C) receptor was activated by propyl-methanethiosulfonate (MTS) as effectively as by ATP, but cysteine substitutions elsewhere in TM2 had no such effect. Other lipophilic MTS compounds (methyl, ethyl, and tert-butylethyl) had a similar effect but not polar MTS. The properties of the conducting pathway opened by covalent attachment of propyl-MTS were the same as those opened by ATP, with respect to unitary conductance, rectification, and permeability of N-methyl-d-glucamine. The ATP-binding residue Lys(69) was not required for the action of propyl-MTS, although propyl-MTS did not open P2X2(K308A/I328C) receptors. The propyl-MTS did not open P2X2 receptors in which the Val(48) side chain was removed (P2X2(V48G/I328C)). The results suggest that an interaction between Val(48) and Ile(328) stabilizes the closed channel and that this is broken by covalent attachment of a larger lipophilic moiety at the I328C receptors. Lipid intercalation between the separating TM domains during channel opening would be facilitated in P2X2(I328C) receptors with attached propyl-MTS. The results are consistent with the channel opening mechanism proposed on the basis of closed and open crystal structures and permit the refinement of the position of the TMs within the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W2070085951,"Previous experiments have indicated that growth factor receptor-bound protein 14 (Grb14) may modulate rod photoreceptor cGMP-gated channels by decreasing channel affinity for cGMP; however, the function of Grb14 in rod physiology is not known. In this study, we examined the role of Grb14 by recording electrical responses from rods in which the gene for the Grb14 protein had been deleted. Suction-electrode recordings from single mouse rods showed that responses of dark-adapted Grb14(-/-) mice to brief flashes decayed more rapidly than strain-controlled wild type (WT) rods, with decreased values of both integration time and the exponential time course of decay (τREC). This result is consistent with an increase in channel affinity for cGMP produced by deletion of Grb14. However, Grb14(-/-) mouse rods also showed little change in dark current and a large and significant decrease in the limiting time constant τD, which are not consistent with an effect on channel affinity but seem rather to indicate modulation of the rate of inactivation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6). Grb14 has been reported to translocate from the inner to the outer segment in bright light, but we saw effects on response time course even in dark-adapted rods, although the effects were somewhat greater after rods had been adapted by exposure to bleaching illumination. Our results indicate that the mechanism of Grb14 action may be more complex than previously realized."
https://openalex.org/W1992135405,"The natural cytotoxicity receptors, comprised of three type I membrane proteins NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46, are a unique set of activating proteins expressed mainly on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. Among these, NKp30 is a major receptor targeting virus-infected cells, malignantly transformed cells, and immature dendritic cells. To date, only few cellular ligands of NKp30 have been discovered, and the molecular details of ligand recognition by NKp30 are poorly understood. Within the current study, we found that the ectodomain of NKp30 forms functional homo-oligomers that mediate high affinity binding to its corresponding cellular ligand B7-H6. Notably, this homo-oligomerization is strongly promoted by the stalk domain of NKp30. Based on these data, we suggest that homo-oligomerization of NKp30 in the plasma membrane of NK cells, which might be favored by IL-2-dependent up-regulation of NKp30 expression, provides a way to improve recognition and lysis of target cells by NK cells.
