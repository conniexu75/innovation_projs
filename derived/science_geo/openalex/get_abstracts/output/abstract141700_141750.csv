Inhibitors of the peptidyltransferase reaction (e.g.anisomycin) can trigger a ribotoxic stress response that activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, components of a signaling cascade that regulates cell survival in response to stress. We have found that selected trichothecenes strongly activate JNK/p38 kinases and induce rapid apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. Although the ability of individual trichothecenes to inhibit protein synthesis and activate JNK/p38 kinases are dissociable, both effects contribute to the induction of apoptosis. Among trichothecenes that strongly activate JNK/p38 kinases, induction of apoptosis increases linearly with inhibition of protein synthesis. Among trichothecenes that strongly inhibit protein synthesis, induction of apoptosis increases linearly with activation of JNK/p38 kinases. Trichothecenes that inhibit protein synthesis without activating JNK/p38 kinases inhibit the function (i.e. activation of JNK/p38 kinases and induction of apoptosis) of apoptotic trichothecenes and anisomycin. Harringtonine, a structurally unrelated protein synthesis inhibitor that competes with trichothecenes (and anisomycin) for ribosome binding, also inhibits the activation of JNK/p38 kinases and induction of apoptosis by trichothecenes and anisomycin. Taken together, these results implicate the peptidyltransferase site as a regulator of both JNK/p38 kinase activation and apoptosis.

Taken together, these results implicate the peptidyltransferase site as a regulator of both JNK/p38 kinase activation and apoptosis. The trichothecenes are a structurally related family of low molecular weight mycotoxins synthesized by various Fusariumspecies. The ability of trichothecenes to inhibit the growth of rapidly proliferating cells in vitro and to selectively target tissues with a high mitotic index (e.g. bone marrow, gastrointestinal epithelium) prompted the selection of a representative compound (i.e. diacetoxyscirpenol) for testing in phase I and phase II clinical trials in human cancers (1Bukowski R.

Anisomycin also induces rapid apoptosis in human lymphoid cells (18Polverino A. Patterson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7013-7021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (in marked contrast to the delayed apoptosis induced by many protein synthesis inhibitors that do not activate JNK and p38 MAP kinases,e.g. puromycin, emetine) (19Kochi S.

The role of JNK/p38 kinase activation in the induction of apoptosis is controversial. Although JNK activation is required for the induction of apoptosis in some experimental systems (21Xia Z.

It appears that the functional response to JNK activation can differ in different cell types exposed to different apoptotic stimuli. The precise relationship between anisomycin-induced translational arrest, JNK activation, and apoptosis is not known. Deacetylation of anisomycin markedly inhibits its ability to bind to ribosomes, arrest translation (29Crow T. Forrester J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4490-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Eskin A. Yeung S. Klass M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7637-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), activate JNK/p38 kinases, and induce apoptosis (see below), suggesting that the functional effects of anisomycin may be related to ribosome binding. The rich structural diversity of the trichothecenes has the potential to further dissect the relationship between these ribosome initiated functional responses. Individual trichothecenes differ significantly in their ability to induce translational arrest (see below). The structural features that determine these functional differences are centered around chemical sidegroups that modify the C7 and C8 positions of a pentane ring common to all trichothecenes (see Fig. 1 A and Table I). For example, diacetoxyscirpenol is a potent inhibitor of protein translation, whereas 3-acetyldiacetoxyscripentriol (produced by acetylation of the C6 position of the pentane ring) is not (Table I). Structural features that affect the ability of individual trichothecenes to interact with the ribosomal peptidyltransferase site are likely to determine the distinct functions of these compounds. As such, a structure:function analysis comparing the ability of individual trichothecenes to inhibit protein synthesis, activate JNK/p38 kinases and induce apoptosis might improve our understanding of how ribosome binding regulates these diverse functions. The results of this type of analysis suggest that cooperation between JNK/p38 kinase activation and translational arrest is important for the induction of rapid apoptosis by selected inhibitors of protein synthesis. Consequently, the relative ability of individual trichothecenes to trigger translational arrest and JNK/p38 kinase activation are likely to determine their efficacy as antineoplastic drugs. Importantly, the one trichothecene that has been tested for antineoplastic activity in clinical trials (1Bukowski R. Vaughn C. Bottomley R. Chen T. Cancer Treat.

Classification of natural or synthetic trichothecenes using the functional parameters defined in this study might facilitate selection of the most promising compounds for testing in clinical trials.Table IInhibition of protein synthesis by various trichothecenesTrichothecenesProtein SynthesisCaspase-3 ActivationJNK Activation% control-foldScirpentriol3.6 (0.3)16.614.4Diacetylverrucarol7.1 (1.5)9.313.9T-2 triol4.7 (0.4)12.411.9Nivalenol51.6 (5.8)6.911.9T-2 tetraol83.6 (9.8)1.79.0Acetyldiacetoxyscirpenol70.5 (1.8)1.54.3Diacetoxyscirpenol2.4 (0.2)9.43.4Acetyldeoxynivalenol2.2 (0.1)4.82.5HT-21.6 (0.2)8.22.4T-2 tetraoltetraacetate49.4 (2.9)1.81.3Iso-T-211.0 (2.6)1.71.3Acetyl T-22.1 (0.1)3.21.2T-2 toxin1.4 (0.2)4.21.2Verrucarin1.6 (0.2)3.91.2Control100 (7.5)1.01.0The level of protein synthesis after a 20 min treatment with individual trichothecenes (all at 10 μm) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mean ± S.D. is indicated in parentheses.

Trichothecenes and other protein synthesis and protease inhibitors were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Stock solutions for all compounds were prepared in Me2SO at 3.3 mm, except for emetine, which was dissolved in water at 10 mg/ml. The Jurkat human T-lymphoid cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 500 units/ml penicillin and 500 μg/ml streptomycin. For various treatments, cells were collected at 1.0–1.5 × 106/ml and resuspended at 1.0 × 107/ml in the fresh growth medium. Anisomycin (3.8 μm), trichothecenes (10 μm), or other protein synthesis inhibitors (or equivalent volumes of solvents for control samples) were added in a volume not exceeding 1% of the total culture volume and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. For treatments with two reagents, cells were incubated with the first reagent (or solvents for control samples) for 30 min at 37 °C before addition of the second reagent (or solvents for control samples) and continued culture at 37 °C for indicated periods of time. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80 °C until further analysis. After 3 h of treatment with various agents, 5 × 106 cells per treatment were lysed in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, incubated on ice for 10 min, vortexed for 5 s, and lysates were clarified for 5 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at the top speed. 0.45 ml of the supernatants were extracted once with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and aqueous phases were adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl and precipitated with equal volumes of isopropanol, followed by overnight incubation at −20 °C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation (10 min) at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at the top speed, pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, air dried and resuspended in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml RNase A. Following a 30 min incubation at 37 °C, 10 μl aliquots were separated on 1.2% agarose gels in TAE buffer as described (31Tian Q. Streuli M. Saito H. Schlossman S. Anderson P. Cell. 1991; 67: 629-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). DEVD-specific caspase activity was determined as described (32Nicholson D. Ali A. Thornberry N. Vaillancourt J.

DEVD-specific caspase activity was determined in triplicate by mixing 10 μl of supernatants (50 μg of protein) with 0.2 ml of reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.1), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with 2 μm DEVD-AMC) and incubating at 30 °C for 20 min. The DEVD-specific caspase activity was calculated by measuring fluorescence of released AMC using CytoFluor 4000 MultiWell Plate Reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. The cell lysates used for enzymatic assay of caspase-3 (see above) were also subjected to Western blotting analysis with caspase-3 (CPP32)-specific antibodies (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and with PARP-specific monoclonal antibodies C-2–10 as described (33Budihardjo I. Poirier G. Kaufmann S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 178: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). JNK kinase activity was assayed as described previously (34Shifrin V. Davis R. Neel B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2957-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with slight modifications.

After 20 min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 4× SDS loading buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and boiling for 5 min. One-third of each reaction was separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA), exposed to x-ray film and subsequently quantitated using a Bio-Rad model GS-525 PhosphorImager. Activation of kinase p38 was assayed as described previously (36Gabai V. Meriin A. Mosser D. Caron A. Rits S. Shifrin V. Sherman M. J. Biol.

Duplicate filters were probed with antibody 9212, recognizing both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of p38 to verify equal loading. Protein synthesis was assayed by measuring the incorporation of labeled amino acids into cellular proteins, essentially as described by Ausbel et al. (37Ausbel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) with the following modifications: Jurkat cells were grown and collected as described above, washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended at 2 × 106/ml in cysteine- and methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and treated in triplicate with protein synthesis inhibitors (or with corresponding solvents for control samples) for 20 min at 37 °C before the addition of 50 μCi/ml of35S-labeled methionine/cysteine mixture (NEN Life Science Products) and incubation for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (200 μl/106 cells; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 14 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1.7 mg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After a 10-min incubation on ice, cell lysates were vortexed for 10 s and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. 50 μl of the supernatants were mixed with 500 μl of 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of 500 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After 20 min on ice, precipitated proteins were collected by filtration through glass microfiber filters (GF/C, Whatman), washed with 10 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 5 ml of ethanol, and air dried. Incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into cellular proteins was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting in a Packard 1600 TR counter. We compared the relative ability of anisomycin (3.8 μm) and trichothecene mycotoxins (10 μm) to activate JNK (Fig.1 B) and p38 (Fig.1 C) MAP kinases in Jurkat T cells. Within each structural subfamily (i.e. derivatives of nivalenol, scirpenol and T-2 toxin, see Fig. 1 A), we identified trichothecenes that induce strong (e.g. nivalenol, scirpentriol, and T-2 triol), intermediate (e.g. acetyldeoxynivalenol, acetoxyscirpenol, and HT-2), or weak (e.g. verrucarin, T-2 toxin) activation of JNK/p38 kinases. The different activity of these compounds cannot be explained by differential cell permeability, as several trichothecenes (e.g. deoxynivalenol and 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol; T-2 triol and acetyl-T-2 toxin) that differ dramatically in their ability to activate JNK/p38 kinases (Fig. 1), are similarly potent inhibitors of protein synthesis (see Table I, and below). The strong correlation between the ability of individual trichothecenes to activate JNKs and p38 (compare Fig. 1,B and C), suggests that both of these MAP kinases are activated via the same mechanism, the ribotoxic stress response. Therefore, our data indicate that structural differences between individual trichothecenes can influence their ability to trigger the ribotoxic stress response. During our analysis of JNK activation by various trichothecenes, we noticed that many trichothecenes induce what appears to be a typical apoptotic cell death in Jurkat cells. The relative ability of individual trichothecenes to induce various manifestations of apoptosis was assessed by monitoring internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig.2 A), processing of pro-caspase-3 (Fig. 2 B), activation of DEVD-specific caspases (Fig. 2 C), and cleavage of one of the major caspase-3 substrates, PARP (Fig. 2 D). This analysis identified trichothecenes within each structural subfamily that are strong (e.g. deoxynivalenol, scirpentriol, and T-2 triol), intermediate (e.g. nivalenol, diacetoxyscirpentriol, HT-2), and weak (e.g. 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, varrucarin, T-2) inducers of apoptosis. Comparison of results presented in Figs. 1 and 2reveals that activation of JNK/p38 kinases is not sufficient for the induction of apoptosis (see also Table I). Thus trichothecenes that similarly activate JNK/p38 kinases (e.g. T-2 triol and T-2 tetraol, Fig. 1) can differ significantly in their ability to induce apoptosis as measured by caspase-3 activation (Fig. 2, B andC). Nevertheless, the most potent apoptotic trichothecenes strongly activate JNK/p38 kinases, suggesting that kinase activation might contribute to the efficient induction of rapid apoptosis. The sequential activation of stress-induced MAP kinases and caspases differs in different experimental systems (25Goillot E. Raingeaud J. Ranger A. Tepper R. Davis R. Harlow E. Sanchez I. Proc. Natl.

Because of the strong correlation between JNK activation and trichothecene-induced apoptosis (compare Figs. 1 and 2; summarized in Table I), we determined the temporal order of JNK and caspase-3 activation by several trichothecenes and anisomycin (Fig. 3). The kinetics of JNK activation by anisomycin and T-2 triol are similar, with each drug producing maximal activation within 15 min (Fig.3 A) followed by detectable caspase activation at 1–2 h (Fig. 3, B and C). This sequential order of JNK and caspase-3 activation is even better illustrated by T-2 tetraol, which has a slower rate of cellular uptake than T-2 toxin (10Middlebrook J. Leatherman D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3103-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Middlebrook J. Leatherman D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 250: 860-866PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore requires 2 h for maximal activation of JNK (Fig.3 A), and 3 h for detectable caspase activation (Fig.3 B). Therefore, in response to trichothecenes and anisomycin, JNK activation precedes caspase-3 activation, distinguishing this process from a similarly rapid Fas-induced apoptosis in which JNK/p38 kinases are activated after caspase-3 during the later stages of cell death (38Juo P.

A more direct test of a role for JNKs in the activation of caspases would be provided by the demonstration that dominant negative JNK inhibits trichothecene-induced caspase activation. Unfortunately, the low transfection efficiency of Jurkat cells prevented us from obtaining useful information from this experiment. Activation of JNK/p38 kinases can signal cell survival or induce cell death in different cell types under different conditions (42Anderson P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of protein synthesis can promote the induction of apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines that activate JNK/p38 kinases (e.g.Fas-ligand, tumor necrosis factor-α), suggesting that the survival pathway, but not the death pathway, requires new protein synthesis (43Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153 (and references therein): 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar,44Nagata S.

The possibility that differential inhibition of protein synthesis might determine the functional response to trichothecene-induced JNK/p38 kinase activation prompted us to compare the ability of individual trichothecenes to inhibit protein synthesis in Jurkat cells. Table I compares the ability of individual trichothecenes to inhibit protein synthesis, activate caspase-3, and activate JNK. Although there is no obvious correlation between any two trichothecene-induced effects (e.g. protein synthesis inhibition versus JNK activation; protein synthesis inhibition versus caspase activation; JNK activation versus caspase activation), the tendency for apoptotic trichothecenes to strongly inhibit protein synthesis and strongly activate JNKs (Table I) suggests that these two effects might cooperate in the induction of apoptosis. To test this possibility, we measured the dose-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis produced by trichothecenes that strongly activate JNK kinases (>9-fold activation; Table I) and derived IC50values for this functional response (Fig.4 A). We then compared the activation of caspase-3 at a trichothecene concentration (10 μm) at which each of these compounds maximally activate JNK1 (determined in dose-response experiments using the assay described in Fig. 1 B). Under these conditions, caspase activation is a linear function of IC50 (Fig. 4 B), suggesting th"

TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTβR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death.

While TNFR1, CD95/Fas/APO-1, DR3/TRAMP/APO-3, DR4/TRAIL-R1/APO-2, DR5/TRAIL-R2, and DR6 receptors contain a conserved intracellular motif of ∼80 amino acids called death domain, associated with the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways, other members, which contain a low sequence identity in the cytoplasmic domains, stimulate the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 (1Armitage R.

By searching an expressed sequence tag (EST) data base, a new member of the TNFR superfamily was identified, named TR6, and was characterized as a soluble cognate receptor for LIGHT and FasL/CD95L. LIGHT and FasL mediate the apoptosis, which is the most common physiological form of cell death and occurs during embryonic development, tissue remodeling, immune regulation, and tumor regression. LIGHT is highly induced in activated T lymphocytes and macrophages. LIGHT was characterized as a cellular ligand for HVEM/TR2 and LTβR (10Mauri D.N. Ebner R. Kochel K.D. Montgomery R.I. Cheung T.C.

It is also involved in the establishment of peripheral tolerance in the activation-induced cell death of lymphocytes. Moreover, expression of FasL in nonlymphoid and tumor cells contributes to the maintenance of immune privilege of tissues by preventing the infiltration of Fas-sensitive lymphocytes (16Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). FasL is also processed and shed from the surface of human cells (17Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.-L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tchopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that TR6 (DcR3), a new member of the TNFR superfamily, binds LIGHT and FasL. Therefore TR6 may act as an inhibitor in LIGHT-induced tumor cell death by blocking LIGHT interaction with its receptors. An EST cDNA data base, obtained from more than 600 different cDNA libraries, was screened for sequence homology with the cysteine-rich motif of the TNFR superfamily, using the blastn and tblastn algorithms. Three EST clones containing an identical open reading frame, the amino acid sequence of which showed significant homology to TNFR-II, were identified from cDNA libraries of human normal prostate and pancreas tumor. A full-length TR6 cDNA clone encoding an intact N-terminal signal peptide was obtained from a human normal prostate library. For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated using TriZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.) from various human cell lines before and after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin or lipopolysaccharide. RNA was converted to cDNA by reverse transcription and amplified for 35 cycles by PCR. Primers used for amplification of the TR6 fragment are according to the sequence of TR6. β-Actin was used as an internal control for RNA integrity. PCR products were run on 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV illumination. The recombinant TR6 protein was produced with hexahistidine at the C terminus. TR6-(His) encoding the entire TR6 protein was amplified by PCR. For correctly oriented cloning, a HindIII site on the 5′ end of the forward primer (5′-AGACCCAAGCTTCCTGCTCCAGCAAGGACCATG-3′) and aBamHI site on the 5′ end of the reverse primer (5′-AGACGGGATCCTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCACAGGGAGGAAGCGCTC-3′) were created. The amplified fragment was cut withHindIII/BamHI and cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCEP4 (Invitrogen). The TR6-(His)/pCEP4 plasmid was stably transfected into HEK 293 EBNA cells to generate recombinant TR6-(His). Serum-free culture media from cells transfected TR6-(His)/pCEP4 were passed through Ni-column (Novagen). The column eluents were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and TR6-(His) was detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-poly(His)6 antibody (Sigma). Production of HVEM/TR2-Fc, LTβR-Fc, and FLAG-tagged soluble LIGHT (sLIGHT) fusion proteins were previously described (14Zhai Y. Guo R. Hsu T.-L. Yu G.-L. Ni J. Kwon B.S. Jiang G.-W. Lu J. Tan J. Ugustus M. Carter K. Rojas L. Zhu F. Lincoln C. Endress G. Xing L. Wang S. Oh K.O. Gentz R. Ruben S. Lippman M.E. Hsieh S.-L. Yang D. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Fc fusion protein-containing supernatants were filtered and trapped onto protein G-Sepharose beads. FLAG-tagged sLIGHT proteins were purified with anti-FLAG mAb affinity column. TR6-(His) was incubated overnight with various FLAG-tagged ligands of the TNF superfamily and anti-FLAG agarose in binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% gelatin, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 4 °C and then precipitated. The bound proteins were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot with HRP-conjugated anti-poly(His)6 or anti-human IgG1antibodies. For cell-binding assays, HEK 293 EBNA cells were stably transfected using the calcium phosphate method with pCEP4/full sequence of LIGHT cDNA or pCEP4 vector alone. After selection with hygromycin B, cells were harvested with 1 mmEDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with TR6-(His), HVEM/TR2-Fc, or LTβR-Fc for 20 min on ice. For detecting Fc-fusion protein, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. To detect TR6 binding, cells were stained with anti-poly(His)6 and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG consecutively. The cells were analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Cytotoxicity assays using HT29 cells were carried out as described previously (13Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5000 HT29 cells were seeded in 96-well plates with 1% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and treated with sLIGHT (10 ng/ml) and 10 units/ml human recombinant interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (supplied from NIAID, NIH Repository). Serial dilutions of TR6-(His) were added in quadruplicate to microtiter wells. Cells treated with IFN-γ and sLIGHT were incubated with various amounts of TR6-(His) for 4 days before the addition of [3H]thymidine for the last 6 h of culture. Cells were harvested, and thymidine incorporation was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. TR6 was identified by searching an EST data base. Three clones containing an identical open reading frame were identified from cDNA libraries of human normal prostate and pancreas tumor. A full-length TR6 cDNA encoding an intact N-terminal signal peptide was obtained from a human normal prostate library. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids. To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of mature TR6, hexahistidine-tagged TR6 was expressed in the mammalian cell expression system, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by peptide sequencing. The N-terminal sequence of the processed mature TR6-(His) started from amino acid 30, indicating that the first 29 amino acids constituted the signal sequence (Fig.1 A). Therefore, the mature protein of TR6 was composed of 271 amino acids with no transmembrane region. There was one potential N-linked glycosylation site (Asn-173) in TR6. Like OPG (4Simmonet W.S.

Fig. 1 Bshows the potential cysteine-rich motif aligned among TNFR-I, TNFR-II, 4-1BB, TR2/HVEM, LTβR, TR1/OPG, and TR6. TR6 contained two perfect and two imperfect cysteine-rich motifs, and its amino acid sequence was remarkably similar to the TR1/OPG amino acid sequence. TR6 shares ∼30% sequence homology with OPG and TNFR-II. We analyzed expression of TR6 mRNA in human multiple tissue blots by Northern hybridization. Northern blot analyses indicated that TR6 mRNA was ∼1.3 kilobases in length and was expressed predominantly in lung tissue and the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW480 (data not shown). RT-PCR analyses were performed to determine the expression patterns of TR6 in various cell lines. TR6 transcript was detected weakly in most hematopoietic cell lines. The expression of TR6 was induced upon activation in Jurkat T leukemia cells. Interestingly, TR6 mRNA was constitutively expressed in endothelial cell line, HUVEC, at high level (Fig.2). To identify the ligand for TR6, several FLAG-tagged soluble proteins of TNF ligand family members were screened for binding to recombinant TR6-(His) protein by immunoprecipitation. TR6-(His) selectively bound LIGHT-FLAG and FasL-FLAG among FLAG-tagged soluble TNF ligand members tested (Fig.3). This result indicates that TR6 binds at least two ligands, LIGHT and FasL. LIGHT exhibits significant sequence homology with the C-terminal receptor-binding domain of FasL (31%), but sLIGHT is unable to bind to Fas (10Mauri D.N. Ebner R. Kochel K.D. Montgomery R.I.

LIGHT is expressed in activated T cells. LIGHT, in conjunction with serum starvation or addition of IFN-γ, inhibits the cell proliferation in tumor cells, MDA-MB-231 and HT29. To determine whether TR6 might act as an inhibitor to LIGHT interactions with HVEM/TR2 or LTβR, TR6-(His) was used as a competitive inhibitor in LIGHT-HVEM/TR2 interaction. When LIGHT was immunoprecipitated with HVEM/TR2-Fc in the presence of TR6-(His), HVEM/TR2-Fc binding to LIGHT was decreased competitively by TR6-(His), but TR6-(His) binding to LIGHT was not changed by HVEM/TR2-Fc (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, the binding of HVEM/TR2-Fc (6 nm) or LTβR (6 nm) was completely inhibited by 20 nm TR6-(His) protein in immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 3 C). These results support the notion that TR6 may act as a strong inhibitor of LIGHT function through HVEM/TR2 and LTβR. To determine whether TR6 binds to LIGHT expressed on the cell surface, we performed a binding assay using LIGHT-transfected HEK 293 EBNA cells by flow cytometry. LIGHT-transfected HEK 293 EBNA cells were stained significantly by TR6-(His) as well as by HVEM/TR2-Fc and LTβR-Fc. No binding was detected by HVEM/TR2-Fc or LTβR-Fc on pCEP4 vector-transfected HEK 293 EBNA cells. (Fig.4). Furthermore, control isotype did not bind to LIGHT-transfected HEK 293 EBNA cells, and none of the above fusion proteins bound to vector-transfected cells, confirming the specificity of these bindings. These bindings indicate that TR6 can bind to both soluble and membrane-bound forms of LIGHT. Browning et al. (13Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W.

Both HVEM/TR2 and LTβR are involved cooperatively in LIGHT-mediated killing of HT29 cells (14Zhai Y. Guo R. Hsu T.-L. Yu G.-L. Ni J. Kwon B.S. Jiang G.-W. Lu J. Tan J. Ugustus M. Carter K. Rojas L.

To determine whether binding of TR6 inhibits LIGHT-mediated cytotoxicity, HT29 cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml sLIGHT and IFN-γ (10 units/ml) in the presence of 200 ng/ml LTβR-Fc or TR6-(His). As shown in Fig.5 A, TR6-(His) blocked significantly the LIGHT-mediated cell killing. Cells were also incubated with sLIGHT and/or IFN-γ in the presence of varying concentrations of TR6-(His). TR6-(His) blocked sLIGHT-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, TR6 appears to act as a natural inhibitor of LIGHT-induced tumor cell killing. The data also suggest that TR6 contributes to immune evasion of tumors. LIGHT interaction with HVEM/TR2 and/or LTβR may trigger the distinct biological events, such as T cell proliferation, blocking of HVEM-dependent HSV1 infection, and anti-tumor activity (10Mauri D.N.

Indeed, while this paper was in preparation, another group reported an identical cDNA to TR6, which they called decoy receptor (DcR) 3 and showed that it bound to FasL and might contribute to immune evasion by certain tumor (18Pitti R.M. Marsters S.A. Lawrence D.A. Roy M. Kischkel F.C. Dowd P. Huang A. Donahue C.J. Sherwood S.W. Baldwin D.T. Godowski P.J. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Hillan K.J. Cohen R.L. Goddard A.D. Botstein D. Ashkenazi A. Nature. 1998; 396: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). TR6 may act as a decoy receptor and contribute to immune evasion both in slow and rapid tumor cell death, which is mediated by LIGHT or the FasL-mediated apoptosis pathway. TR6 may function as a cytokine to trigger membrane-bound FasL or LIGHT and transduce signals through FasL or LIGHT. Recently the Desbarats and Suzuki groups (19Desbarats J. Duke R.C. Newell M.K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Suzuki I. Fink P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) reported that FasL could itself transduce signals, leading to cell cycle arrest and cell death in CD4+ T cells but cell proliferation in CD8+ T cells. Therefore, TR6 may be involved in signaling through FasL and LIGHT. HUVEC cells constitutively expressed TR6 in RT-PCR analysis. LIGHT and FasL have been known to be expressed in activated T cells. Therefore it is speculated that TR6 and its ligands are important for interactions between activated T lymphocytes and endothelium. TR6 may be involved in activated T cell trafficking as well as endothelial cell survival. In this paper we have identified a novel soluble member of the TNFR superfamily, TR6, which is constitutively expressed in lung tissue, tumor cells, and in endothelial cells. We have also identified the ligands for TR6, LIGHT, and FasL, which are involved in the cell death pathway. TR6 bound specifically to LIGHT and FasL and inhibited their activities. Like DcR1, DcR2, and another soluble member of the TNFR superfamily, OPG, TR6 may act as an inhibitor of signaling through TNF family members, FasL and LIGHT. Hence, TR6 may have important roles in the inhibition of apoptosis and tumor modulation. Addendum-During the preparation of this manuscript, Pittiet al. (18Pitti R.M. Marsters S.A. Lawrence D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2043065121,"NADPH is known to be tightly bound to mammalian catalase and to offset the ability of the substrate of catalase (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to convert the enzyme to an inactive state (compound II). In the process, the bound NADPH becomes NADP<sup>+</sup> and is replaced by another molecule of NADPH. This protection is believed to occur through electron tunneling between NADPH on the surface of the catalase and the heme group within the enzyme. The present study provided additional support for the concept of an intermediate state of catalase, through which NADPH serves to prevent the formation (rather than increase the removal) of compound II. In contrast, the superoxide radical seemed to bypass the intermediate state since NADPH had very little ability to prevent the superoxide radical from converting catalase to compound II. Moreover, the rate of NADPH oxidation was several times the rate of compound II formation (in the absence of NADPH) under a variety of conditions. Very little NADPH oxidation occurred when NADPH was exposed to catalase, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or the superoxide radical separately. That the ratio exceeds 1 suggests that NADPH may protect catalase from oxidative damage through actions broader than merely preventing the formation of compound II."
https://openalex.org/W2150603117,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiate Ras-dependent activation of the Erk 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by stimulating recruitment of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors to the plasma membrane. Both integrin-based focal adhesion complexes and receptor tyrosine kinases have been proposed as scaffolds upon which the GPCR-induced Ras activation complex may assemble. Using specific inhibitors of focal adhesion complex assembly and receptor tyrosine kinase activation, we have determined the relative contribution of each to activation of the Erk 1/2 cascade following stimulation of endogenous GPCRs in three different cell types. The tetrapeptide RGDS, which inhibits integrin dimerization, and cytochalasin D, which depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton, disrupt the assembly of focal adhesions. In PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, both agents block lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)- and bradykinin-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that intact focal adhesion complexes are required for GPCR-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in these cells. In Rat 1 fibroblasts, Erk 1/2 activation via LPA and thrombin receptors is completely insensitive to both agents. Conversely, the epidermal growth factor receptor-specific tyrphostin AG1478 inhibits GPCR-mediated Erk 1/2 activation in Rat 1 cells but has no effect in PC12 cells. In HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells, LPA and thrombin receptor-mediated Erk 1/2 activation is partially sensitive to both the RGDS peptide and tyrphostin AG1478, suggesting that both focal adhesion and receptor tyrosine kinase scaffolds are employed in these cells. The dependence of GPCR-mediated Erk 1/2 activation on intact focal adhesions correlates with expression of the calcium-regulated focal adhesion kinase, Pyk2. In all three cell types, GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation is significantly inhibited by the Src kinase inhibitors, herbimycin A and 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo-d-3,4-pyrimidine (PP1), suggesting that Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases represent a point of convergence for signals originating from either scaffold.

These tyrosine phosphorylation events are sensitive to the inhibition of Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in many cell types (2Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J.

Although the requirement for tyrosine kinases in GPCR-mediated Erk 1/2 activation has been well documented, the proximal signaling events whereby these receptors initiate tyrosine phosphorylation remain poorly understood. Recent data have implicated FAK family kinases and RTKs, both of which regulate the activity of Src kinases, as proximal mediators of GPCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. FAKs are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that compose part of the focal adhesion complex. These complexes assemble on αβ integrin heterodimers following integrin engagement of extracellular matrix proteins. Following recruitment, FAKs autophosphorylate and provide docking sites for several signaling proteins, including c-Src and Grb2 (6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). In many cell types, stimulation of Gi- or Gq-coupled receptors causes FAK activation (7Hordijk P.L.

This activation is cell adhesion-dependent, because disruption of focal adhesions prevents the response (10Slack B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, stimulation of either LPA or bradykinin receptors activates the calcium-regulated FAK family kinase, Pyk2 (11Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar), and overexpression of Pyk2 mutants that are either catalytically inactive or unable to bind to c-Src prevents GPCR-induced Erk 1/2 activation (5Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 11Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). In other systems, however, GPCR-mediated Erk 1/2 activation is apparently dissociable from FAK phosphorylation (7Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Rozengurt E J. Biol.

Classical RTKs, such as the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF), are single transmembrane domain proteins that dimerize and transphosphorylate upon ligand binding. Tyrosine phosphorylation of RTKs promotes their association with SH2 or PTB domain-containing signaling proteins, which assemble on the receptor to form a Ras activation complex (12Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 615-661PubMed Google Scholar). “Transactivation” of RTKs following GPCR stimulation has been implicated in GCPR-mediated activation of Erk 1/2 (13Linseman D.A.

In Rat 1 fibroblasts and COS-7 cells, inhibition of EGF receptor function inhibits LPA-, endothelin-1-, and thrombin receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and Gab1 and activation of Erk 1/2 (3Daub H.

Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). In this model, the transactivated RTK forms the structural core of a GPCR-induced mitogenic signaling complex, as receptor phosphorylation creates docking sites for the components of the Ras activation complex. We compared the role of focal adhesions and EGF receptors in mediating Erk 1/2 activation via endogenously expressed LPA, thrombin, and bradykinin receptors in three different cell types: PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, Rat 1 fibroblasts, and HEK-293 embryonic kidney cells. Surprisingly, we found that the preferred scaffold was independent of the specific Gi/Gq-coupled GPCR being stimulated. Rather, the utilization of scaffolds varied between cell types, with PC-12 cells and Rat 1 fibroblasts apparently representing opposite ends of a continuum. In PC-12 cells GPCR-mediated Erk 1/2 activation was almost exclusively focal adhesion-dependent, whereas in Rat 1 fibroblasts it was almost exclusively RTK-dependent. In HEK-293 cells, both scaffolds contributed to the GPCR signal. Utilization of the focal adhesion scaffold correlated with signaling via pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins and with cellular expression of the calcium-regulated FAK family kinase, Pyk2. In each case, GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation was sensitive to Src kinase inhibitors, suggesting that a critical role of both scaffolds is to support the GPCR-induced activation of Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Cytochalasin D, EGF, herbimycin A, tyrphostin AG1478, and 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo-d-3,4-pyrimidine (PP1) were from Calbiochem. Bordetella pertussis toxin was from List Biologicals. LPA and bradykinin were from Sigma. The tetrapeptides H3N+-arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine-COO−(RGDS) and H3N+-arginine-glycine-glutamate-serine-COO−(RGES) and the thrombin agonist hexapeptide H3N+-serine-phenylalanine-leucine-leucine-arginine-asparagine-CONH2(SFLLRN) were synthesized at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute peptide facility (Duke University Medical Center). Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, Rat-1 fibroblasts, and HEK-293 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media withl-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °CC in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Rat-1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). HEK-293 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. For the determination of p125FAK and Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation, cells grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes were incubated in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin) for 24 h before assay. Agonist stimulation was performed at 37 °C in serum-free medium following preincubation with inhibitors, as described in the figure legends. After stimulation, monolayers were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.25% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm NaVO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μ/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and diluted to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Before immunoprecipitation, a 50-μl aliquot of the whole cell lysate was added to 2× Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and assay of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation (below). Immunoprecipitation of p125FAK was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-p125FAK IgG (clone 2A7, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) plus 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G plus/protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) with overnight agitation at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with ice-cold RIPA buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline, denatured in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Tyrosine phosphorylation or the presence of immunoprecipitated proteins was detected by protein immunoblotting. Phosphotyrosine was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20H (Transduction Laboratories). FAK was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-p125FAK IgG (Transduction Laboratories), and Pyk2 was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-Pyk2 IgG (Transduction Laboratories), each with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) as secondary antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins on nitrocellulose were visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified by scanning laser densitometry. For the determination of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation, 15 μg of clarified whole cell lysate protein/lane were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was detected by protein immunoblotting using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific MAP kinase IgG (New England Biolabs) with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as secondary antibody. Quantitation of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was performed after exposure of nitrocellulose membranes to Vistra ECF reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and scanning on a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). After quantitation of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped of immunoglobulin and reprobed using rabbit polyclonal anti-Erk2 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to confirm equal loading of Erk2 protein. To select endogenous GPCRs capable of activating the Erk 1/2 cascade in a variety of cell types, we assayed Erk 1/2 phosphorylation following stimulation of PC12, Rat 1, and HEK-293 cells with agonists for LPA, thrombin, or bradykinin receptors. Each of these receptors has been shown to mediate both pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive signals resulting from dual coupling to Gi/o-family and Gq/11-family heterotrimeric G proteins (16van Corven E.J. Groenick A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 17Vouret-Cravari V. van Obberghen-Schilling E.

Ther. 1992; 56: 131-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Erk 1/2 activation via endogenous EGF receptors was also determined as a control for cellular responsiveness and inhibitor specificity. Fig. 1 compares GPCR-induced Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in each of the three cell lines. In PC12 cells, both LPA- and bradykinin-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was pertussis toxin-insensitive (Fig. 1 A). In these cells, the thrombin agonist peptide, SFLLRN, provoked a less than 2-fold stimulation of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown). In contrast, LPA- and SFLLRN-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in Rat 1 fibroblasts was completely pertussis toxin-sensitive (Fig. 1 B). In HEK-293 cells, pertussis toxin only partially blocked the LPA and thrombin receptor responses (Fig. 1 C). Here, LPA-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was predominantly pertussis toxin-sensitive, whereas the response to SFLLRN was predominantly pertussis toxin-insensitive. This differential sensitivity to pertussis toxin indicates that dual Gi/Gq-coupled GPCRs activate the Erk 1/2 cascade via distinct G protein pools in different cell types. As expected, EGF-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was insensitive to pertussis toxin in all three cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2, the Src-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A (left panels) and PP1 (right panels) significantly inhibited LPA-, bradykinin- and SFLLRN-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in PC12, Rat 1, and HEK-293 cells. Although neither inhibitor affected EGF receptor autophosphorylation at the concentrations employed (data not shown), both herbimycin A and PP1 also impaired EGF-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. These data suggest that Src kinase activation contributes to both the GPCR- and RTK-mediated Erk 1/2 cascades. Because Src family kinases associate with both integrin-based focal adhesion complexes (19Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and receptor tyrosine kinases (12Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 615-661PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that signals originating from either locus would be sensitive to Src inhibitors. If Gi/Gq-coupled receptors in different cell types selectively employ focal adhesions or RTKs as signaling platforms, then the differential use of these scaffolds might account for some of the observed heterogeneity in GPCR-mediated Erk 1/2 activation. To test this hypothesis, we determined the relative dependence of GPCR signals on the presence of functional focal adhesions and receptor tyrosine kinases in PC12, Rat 1, and HEK-293 cells. Two FAK family kinases, p125FAK and Pyk2 (also known as CADTK, CAKβo, RAFTK, and FAK2) have been shown to autophosphorylate in response to GPCR stimulation (7Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J.

As shown in Fig. 3 A, PC12, HEK-293, and Rat 1 cells exhibit distinct patterns of p125FAK and Pyk2 expression as detected by protein immunoblotting. Although all three lines express abundant p125FAK, only the neuronal PC12 cells express abundant Pyk2. In contrast, HEK-293 cells contain little, and Rat 1 cells no, detectable Pyk2 immunoreactivity. In quiescent PC12 cells, LPA, bradykinin, and EGF stimulation increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both Pyk2 and p125FAK, indicating that both kinases, when present, are activated following GPCR stimulation (Fig. 3 B). Intact focal adhesions are required for the activation of FAK family kinases and formation of FAK·c-Src complexes (20Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 383: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Peptides containing the motif RGD, which mimic the integrin ligand found in extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, have been shown to block integrin heterodimerization (25Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 26Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thereby disrupt the formation of focal adhesions. Similar effects are produced by depolymerization of actin stress fibers following exposure to cytochalasin D. In HEK 293 cells, blocking integrin dimerization using the synthetic oligopeptide GRGDS inhibits m1 and m3 muscarinic receptor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin (10Slack B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine the extent to which intact focal adhesions might be required for GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation, we determined the effects of RGD peptides and cytochalasin D on Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in PC12, Rat 1, and HEK-293 cells. In each experiment, agonist-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was measured as a marker for the integrity of focal adhesion complexes. As shown in Fig. 4, stimulation of LPA, thrombin, bradykinin, or EGF receptors rapidly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK, indicating that each of these receptors promoted focal adhesion complex assembly. Preincubation of cells with the RGDS peptide, but not the control RGES peptide, inhibited agonist-stimulated p125FAK phosphorylation in each of the three cell lines (Fig. 4, A–C, left panels). In PC12 cells, LPA- and bradykinin-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation, like p125FAK phosphorylation, was markedly inhibited by the RGDS peptide (Fig. 4 A, right panel). In contrast, LPA and SFLLRN-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in Rat 1 fibroblasts was completely insensitive to the RGDS peptide despite the significant inhibition of agonist-induced p125FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B, right panel). In HEK-293 cells, LPA and SFLLRN-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was partially inhibited (Fig. 4 C,right panel). EGF receptor-mediated Erk 1/2 activation was insensitive to the RGDS peptide in all three cell lines, indicating that intact focal adhesions are not required for acute stimulation of Erk 1/2 by RTKs. Similar results were obtained using cytochalasin D to inhibit focal adhesion assembly. As shown in Fig. 5, cytochalasin D treatment markedly reduced GPCR- and EGF receptor-stimulated p125FAK phosphorylation in PC12, Rat-1, and HEK-293 cells (Fig. 5, A–C, left panels). As with the RGDS peptide, cytochalasin D completely blocked LPA- and SFLLRN-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in PC12 cells (Fig.5 A, right panel). In Rat 1 fibroblasts, LPA- and SFLLRN-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was cytochalasin D-insensitive (Fig. 5 B, right panel), whereas a partial inhibition of LPA- and SFLLRN-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation was observed in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 5 C,right panel). Like FAKs, RTKs including the EGF (3Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 15Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27871-27875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) receptors can be activated in response to GPCR stimulation. In Rat 1 and COS-7 cells, inhibition of EGF receptor transactivation blocks GPCR-mediated MAP kinase activation (3Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 15Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Because both activated RTKs and focal adhesions represent potential docking sites for proteins involved in the regulation of mitogenesis, either or both might function as a scaffold for GPCR-mediated activation of Erk 1/2. As shown in Fig. 6, the EGF receptor-specific tyrphostin AG1478 has markedly different effects on GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in PC12, Rat 1, and HEK-293 cells. As expected, exposure to tyrphostin AG1478 had no effect on LPA-, bradykinin- or SFLLRN-stimulated FAK phosphorylation in any of the three cell lines, whereas producing marked inhibition the EGF effect (Fig. 6, A–C, left panels). At concentrations sufficient to abolish EGF-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation, LPA- and bradykinin-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation in PC12 cells was insensitive to tyrphostin AG1478 (Fig. 6 A, right panel). In contrast, tyrphostin AG1478 inhibited both LPA- and SFLLRN-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation in Rat 1 fibroblasts (Fig.6 B, right panel). In HEK-293 cells, the tyrphostin also produced partial inhibition of LPA- and SFLLRN-stimulated Erk 1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 C,right panel). Because the sensitivity of GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation to tyrphostin AG1478 was opposite the effects of inhibitors of focal adhesion assembly, these results suggest that focal adhesions and RTKs can function independently as scaffolds for GPCR-mediated Erk 1/2 activation. Our data indicate that both focal adhesions and RTKs can function independently to support activation of the Erk 1/2 MAP kinase cascade following activation of endogenous Gi/Gq-coupled receptors. Fig.7 schematically depicts a model consistent with these data. In PC12 cells, Gi/Gq-coupled receptors such as those for LPA and bradykinin mediate Erk 1/2 activation predominantly via pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins and a focal adhesion-based scaffold. The lack of pertussis toxin sensitivity is consistent with the recent report that the Gi-coupled α2A adrenergic receptor does not mediate Erk 1/2 activation in stably transfected PC12 cells (28Williams N.G. Zhong H. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24624-24632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of functional receptors, EGF receptor transactivation does not contribute detectably to GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation in these cells. Rat 1 fibroblasts apparently represent the opposite end of a continuum. In these cells, LPA and thrombin receptors mediate Erk 1/2 activation largely via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and transactivation of the EGF receptor. Unlike PC12 cells, GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation in these cells is unaffected by the disruption of focal adhesion complexes. HEK-293 cells apparently employ both scaffolds, as these cells exhibit LPA- and thrombin-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation that is partially pertussis toxin-sensitive and partially sensitive to inhibitors of focal adhesion complex assembly and of EGF receptor transactivation. Signals arising from either scaffold apparently converge on Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, as Src inhibitors impair Erk 1/2 activation in each cell type. Gi/Gq-coupled receptors are known to activate the Erk pathway via both tyrosine kinase-dependent and -independent pathways (29Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that about a third of the Erk 1/2 phosphorylation mediated by LPA receptors in Rat 1 fibroblasts and by LPA and thrombin receptors in HEK-293 cells is insensitive to both Src- and EGF receptor-selective kinase inhibitors. This residual, tyrosine kinase-independent signal may reflect protein kinase C-mediated Erk 1/2 activation, which we have shown is Ras-independent and herbimycin A-insensitive in HEK-293 cells (29Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that GPCR-mediated Erk 1/2 activation arising from focal adhesion- and RTK-based scaffolds are dissociable, the factors that determine scaffold preference are poorly understood. Our data suggest that cell type-specific expression of calcium-regulated FAK kinases such as Pyk2 in neuronal (11Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar) or hematopoeitic cells (30Dikic I. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14301-14308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) may dictate whether GPCRs employ the focal adhesion complex as a signaling scaffold. Pyk2 and p125FAK share approximately 60% sequence identity within their catalytic domain and 40% within their N- and C-terminal domains (11Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar) but appear to differ significantly in their regulation by extracellular stimuli. Unlike p125FAK, activation of the Pyk2 homologue CADTK apparently occurs by a two-stage process dependent upon both cellular adhesion and a costimulatory calcium- or protein kinase C-dependent signal (11Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 22Li X. Hunter D. Morris J. Haskill J.S. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9361-9364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of both endogenous Pyk2 and p125FAK occurs following cell adhesion in rat aortic smooth muscle cells, but Pyk2 phosphorylation is further increased by costimulation with calcium ionophore or angiotensin II (31Zheng C. Xing Z. Bian Z.C. Guo C. Akbay A. Warner L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2384-2389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This differential regulation of Pyk2 and p125FAK activity suggests a basis for their distinct roles in the regulation of MAP kinase pathways. Consistent with this, GPCR-induced p125FAKphosphorylation is dissociated from Erk 1/2 activation in Rat 1 cells (8Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Rozengurt E J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Della Rocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which do not detectably express Pyk2. Conversely, overexpression of Pyk2 in 293T cells is sufficient to confer robust LPA-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation that is calcium- and Src kinase-dependent (5Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Several distinct RTKs, including those for platelet-derived growth factor, EGF, and insulin-like growth factor-1, can undergo transactivation (13Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 14Rao G.N. Delafontaine P. Runge M.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). In a given cell type, GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation may involve transactivation of multiple RTKs. For example, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which lack endogenous EGF receptors, LPA stimulation results in Erk 1/2 activation that is dependent upon transactivation of platelet-derived growth factor receptors. However, when EGF receptors are expressed in these cells, signaling proceeds in an EGF receptor-dependent manner (32Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although such data suggest that “generic” mechanisms for the pleiotropic transactivation of RTKs may exist, the molecular mechanisms behind RTK transactivation are poorly understood. In COS-7 cells, EGF receptor transactivation is pertussis toxin-sensitive and inhibited by sequestration of free G protein Gβγ subunits (27Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K.

Conversely, protein kinase C-dependent EGF receptor transactivation has been described in HEK-293 cells stably overexpressing m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (33Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence supports the role of Src family kinases in GPCR stimulation of Erk 1/2.

Recruitment of c-Src to Pyk2 is required for its action, because a point mutant of Pyk2 that cannot complex with c-Src behaves as a dominant negative inhibitor of GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation (5Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of Src kinase activity using either dominant inhibitory c-Src mutants (2Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) dramatically reduces LPA receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and Gab1 and Erk 1/2 activation in COS-7 cells. Although these data clearly support a role for Src kinases “downstream” of both FAK family kinases and transactivated RTKs, additional evidence suggests that Src kinase activity may also play an “upstream” role in GPCR-induced RTK transactivation. Overexpression of Src inhibitor kinase Csk impairs LPA and α2A adrenergic receptor-mediated EGF receptor phosphorylation in COS-7 cells (27Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In addition, angiotensin II stimulation has recently been shown to induce association of activated c-Src with the EGF receptor independent of EGF receptor catalytic activity, suggesting that c-Src activation may precede EGF receptor transactivation (36Eguchi S. Namaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsonomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Previous work has revealed significant heterogeneity in the mechanisms whereby GPCRs mediate activation of the Erk 1/2 MAP kinase pathway. In most systems studied, GPCR-stimulated Erk 1/2 activation involves the assembly of a Ras activation complex on the plasma membrane, which is dependent upon regulated tyrosine phosphorylation of adapter proteins such as Shc and Gab1 and recruitment of Grb2-mSos. Our data strongly suggest that both focal adhesions and RTKs can function as independently regulated scaffolds for the assembly of this complex and indicate that the preferred scaffold is determined primarily by the cellular context in which the receptor is expressed. Considerable care is therefore warranted in using ectopic expression systems to characterize the signal transduction pathways employed by GPCRs which exhibit tissue-specific expression in vivo. Further examination of the functional significance of these different scaffolds will ultimately enhance our understanding of the diversity of proliferative and differentiative signals originating from GPCRs.

https://openalex.org/W2089701610,"The intracellular level of p27 Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitory protein, is rapidly reduced at the G1/S transition phase when the cell cycle pause ceases. In this study, we demonstrated that two posttranslational mechanisms were involved in p27 Kip1 breakdown: degradation via the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway and proteolytic processing that rapidly eliminates the cyclin-binding domain. We confirmed that p27 Kip1 was ubiquitinated in vitroas well as in vivo. The p27 Kip1-ubiquitination activity was higher at the G1/S boundary than during the G0/G1 phase, and p27 Kip1 ubiquitination was reduced significantly when the lysine residues at positions 134, 153, and 165 were replaced by arginine, suggesting that these lysine residues are the targets for Ub conjugation. In parallel with its Ub-dependent degradation, p27 Kip1was processed rapidly at its N terminus, reducing its molecular mass from 27 to 22 kDa, by a ubiquitination-independent but adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent mechanism with higher activity during the S than the G0/G1 phase. This 22-kDa intermediate had no cyclin-binding domain at its N terminus and virtually no CDK2 kinase inhibitory activity. These results suggest that p27 Kip1 is eliminated by two independent mechanisms, ubiquitin-mediated degradation and ubiquitin-independent processing, during progression from the G1 to S phase."

Also, pol β-neutralizing antibody inhibits release of the dRP-oligo in wild-type cell extracts, and the addition of pol β after inhibition with antibody completely restores the excision reaction.

Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Also, pol β null cell extract does not repair a reduced abasic site in a linear DNA substrate that is repaired through long patch BER in pol β-containing wild-type cell extract (11Biade S. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 898-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Further, the absolute amount of long patch BER activity (substrate repaired per mg of extract protein) in the pol β null cell extract is less than that in the isogenic wild-type cell extract. 2S. H. Wilson, unpublished observation. 2S. H. Wilson, unpublished observation. Taken together, these results suggest that pol β, in addition to its role in single-nucleotide patch repair, could play an important but yet unknown role in long patch BER. In light of this background information, we directly addressed the role of pol β in the excision process of long patch BER performed by mammalian cell extracts. Normal human lymphoid cell line AG9387 was obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). Cells were grown in medium recommended by the supplier. The DNA pol β-knockout mouse fibroblasts and the isogenic wild type cell lines were grown as described (12Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from 3–5 g of cells by the method of Manley et al. (13Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) and dialyzed overnight against buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 17% glycerol, and 0.1 m KCl. Extracts were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Human DNA pol β was purified as described (14Kumar A. Widen S. Williams K. Kedar P. Karpel R. Wilson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against human pol β were raised in rabbit and were affinity-purified on a pol β-Sepharose column. Double-stranded closed circular DNA containing single uracil (U-DNA) was constructed as described (15Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) by priming single-stranded M13 DNA with the 5′-labeled oligonucleotide32pUCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATTGGGTACCG for internally labeled uracil-containing substrate and32pCCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATTGGGTACCG for the control DNA substrate. Standard 10-μl reactions contained 50–100 ng of internally labeled U-DNA, 45 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 70 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 3.4% glycerol, 50 μm each of dGTP, dATP, TTP, dCTP, 1 μg of 30-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide (as a carrier), and 20 μg of a cell extract protein. DNA repair synthesis reactions were carried out at 32 °C for the indicated times. After the reaction, excision products were stabilized by the addition of 0.5m NaBH4 to a final concentration of 0.1m and incubated for 30 s on ice. Then 12 μl of formamide-dye solution was added, and the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To assess the role of pol β in long patch BER of uracil-DNA (U-DNA), we analyzed BER excision products formed in cell extracts. A closed circular plasmid DNA substrate containing a 32P-labeled phosphate group immediately 5′ to a solitary uracil-guanine base pair (Fig. 1 a) was prepared. To release the labeled phosphate from the substrate, enzymes in a cell extract must first excise uracil and then incise the phosphodiester bond 5′ to the arising AP site. Next, the labeled phosphate is released either as the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate residue (dRP) or as dRP moiety attached to a short oligonucleotide produced after strand displacement and flap incision (dRP-oligo). Under our standard reaction conditions, >70% of the U-DNA substrate was consumed in 60 min (Fig. 1,a and b). In addition to release of a dRP, which migrated very quickly out of the gel, there was release of a predominant dRP-oligo product that almost co-migrated with a trinucleotide marker (Fig. 1 b). A control DNA substrate with a normal cytosine-guanine base pair at the same position as the uracil-guanine lesion was not degraded (Fig. 1 b, lane C). Because oligonucleotides containing 5′-dRP may migrate differently in polyacrylamide gels than the oligonucleotide markers used, we engineered a marker with the same nucleotide sequence as the expected excision product and with the dRP residue at the 5′-end. First, we constructed an oligonucleotide duplex with a uracil residue in one strand 4 bases upstream of the 3′-end and with a labeled phosphate group next to it on the 5′ side. This oligonucleotide duplex was then treated with bacterial uracil-DNA glycosylase and endonuclease IV. The combined action of these enzymes releases the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate-containing oligonucleotide pdRpCpGpG. This product was stabilized by reduction with NaBH4 and subjected to high resolution electrophoresis. The pdRpCpGpG molecule almost co-migrated with the 3-mer marker (Fig. 1 c). We conclude that during long patch BER of the U-DNA the dRP residue can be excised with at least three nucleotides located immediately 3′ to the damaged base. The use of pol β-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a homozygous deletion in the pol β gene allowed us to test directly whether pol β is involved in excision steps of long patch BER. We found that wild-type mouse cell extract released dRP-oligo as a major excision product in long patch BER. This product was strongly reduced in the pol β null cell extract, and the size distribution of excision products was different (Fig. 2). To confirm that the observed reduction in dRP-oligo release was due to the absence of pol β, the purified enzyme was added to cell extract prepared from pol β null cells (Fig. 3). As little as 2 ng of pol β could reconstitute dRP-oligo release to the level observed in wild-type cell extract (Fig. 3 , comparelanes 4 and 6). The addition of 4 ng of pol β further stimulated dRP-oligo excision (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6).Figure 3Reconstitution of dRP-oligo release in a pol β null cell extract with purified pol β. Cell extract (20 μg of protein) derived from pol β null cells was preincubated on ice for 20 min with the indicated amounts of pol β protein before the addition of U-DNA substrate. Reactions were further incubated for 20 min at 32 °C and processed as described above. The release of dRP-oligo by wild-type (pol β+) extract is shown in lane 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additional evidence for a role of pol β in excision was obtained by using antibody specific to pol β. The addition of antibody blocked the excision of dRP-oligo and resulted in an excision product pattern characteristic for the pol β null cell extract (Fig.4, lanes 2–4). This excision deficiency in the presence of antibody was then corrected by addition of pol β to the antibody-containing reaction (Fig. 4, lane 5), indicating that the effect of antibody was highly specific and limited to blockage of pol β function. This antibody to pol β is known to inhibit the enzyme's DNA polymerase activity (16Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Based on these experiments, we conclude that DNA repair synthesis performed by pol β is required for dRP-oligo excision in long patch BER. Previous studies had shown that pol β is the major DNA polymerase for the single-nucleotide BER pathway (12Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) whereas pol δ/ε are thought to be involved in PCNA-dependent long patch BER (4Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Recent findings, however, suggest that pol β and pol δ can substitute for each other in long patch BER reconstituted with purified proteins (7Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The substitution of different polymerases in BER was also confirmed by the competence of pol β null cell extracts in the in vitrorepair of both natural and reduced abasic sites in closed circular DNA (11Biade S. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 898-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, the biochemical proficiency of pol β and other polymerases in both subpathways for base excision repair has been documented. Yet, the question remained as to the DNA polymerase of choice for the long patch BER subpathway and its precise role(s) in the sequential mechanism. In this report we present data demonstrating that pol β is the major DNA polymerase involved in long patch BER in mammalian cells. Several experimental approaches used in this study support this conclusion. First, the excision step of long patch BER is dependent upon the pol β status of the cell extract: long patch excision is reduced in pol β-deficient cells but can be reconstituted by the addition of purified pol β. Second, pol β-neutralizing antibody inhibits long patch BER excision and especially release of the dRP-oligo product. These results were unexpected because pol β has not been proposed to participate in the long patch BER reaction. The striking homogeneity of the excision product size (i.e. the dRP-oligo) indicates that the proteins involved in excision may predetermine the length of the excised oligonucleotide, and pol β is a good candidate for this function. It was shown earlier that when a suitable substrate is provided, FEN1 is able to release the AP-site 5′-sugar phosphate as part of an oligonucleotide but does not favor any particular flap size (18DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M. Bambara R.A. Zingman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 47: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, as we have demonstrated here in the presence of pol β, the excision is almost strictly limited to release of the dRP-oligo, and in pol β-deficient cell extract this particular excision product was significantly reduced. It appears that different steps of the BER reaction are coordinated and directed by multiple interactions between the participating proteins (3Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). For example, after removal of the T base, from the G-T mismatch, G-T-DNA glycosylase remains bound to the AP site and must be displaced by AP endonuclease (19Waters T. Gallinari P. Jiricni J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Further, AP endonuclease was shown to interact with pol β, and this interaction stimulates the pol β lyase repair reaction (20Bennett R.A.O. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). After this step in the repair process pol β appears to play a central role in determining the subpathway: removal of 5′-sugar phosphate by pol β (21Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 22Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and interaction with DNA ligase I (23Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) results in single-nucleotide BER. Alternatively, as we demonstrate here, a pol β-dependent excision reaction may switch repair to the long patch BER subpathway. In conclusion, whereas multiple pathways function in BER, pol β-dependent DNA repair operates in mammalian cells for both single-nucleotide BER and long patch BER.

In this study, we purified the enzyme from the serum-free culture medium of a human sarcoma cell line.

The expression of a soluble recombinant form of the protein produced an active enzyme, which transferred α-GalNAc from UDP-[3H]GalNAc to various acceptor substrates including GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser.

They are implicated in the regulation and maintenance of cell proliferation, cytodifferentiation, and tissue morphogenesis, exhibiting their biological activities by interacting with various proteins through specific saccharide sequences. They are synthesized as proteoglycans, on specific Ser residues in the so-called GAG-protein linkage region, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, which is common to the GAGs (for reviews, see Refs. 1Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoprotein. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar and 2Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). The linkage region synthesis is initiated by the addition of Xyl to Ser followed by the addition of two Gal residues and is completed by the addition of GlcA, each reaction being catalyzed by a specific glycosyltransferase (1Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoprotein. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar, 2Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). The GAGs are built up on this linkage region by the alternating addition of N-acetylhexosamine and GlcA residues. Heparin/heparan sulfate is synthesized once GlcNAc is transferred to the common linkage region, whereas chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate is formed if GalNAc is first added. However, biosynthetic sorting mechanisms of different GAG chains remain enigmatic. Although at least eight different kinds of glycosyltransferase reactions are required to synthesize these GAGs, only the GlcA transferase that completes the tetrasaccharide linkage region and the heparan sulfate-polymerase that polymerizes GlcA and GlcNAc have been cloned (3Kitagawa H.

EXT is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cartilage-capped skeletal excrescences, which may lead to skeletal abnormalities and short stature (5Solomon L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1964; 16: 351-363PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exostoses represent osteochondromas that are benign bone tumors, malignant transformation into chondrosarcomas or osteosarcoma occurs in approximately 2% of EXT patients (5Solomon L. Am.

Sporadic and exostoses-derived chondrosarcomas are attributable to the loss of heterozygosity for the markers in EXT1 and EXT2loci (14Hecht J.T. Hogue D. Strong L.C. Hansen M.F. Blanton S.H.

While searching for the key enzyme involved in biosynthetic sorting of chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate from heparin/heparan sulfate, we found a novel α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (α-GalNAcT) in fetal bovine sera and in the mouse mastocytoma cells, which transferred an α-GalNAc residue to GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser derived from the GAG-protein linkage region (16Kitagawa H.

In this study, we purified the enzyme and demonstrated 100% peptide sequence identity to the protein encoded by the multiple exostoses-like gene EXTL2/EXTR2 (10Wuyts W. Van Hul W. Hendrickx J.

PCR reactions were carried out with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by 30 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 75 s. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGIR201protA (22Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the fusion of α-GalNAcT to the insulin signal sequence and the protein A sequence present in the vector. A NheI fragment containing the fusion protein was inserted into theXbaI site of the expression vector pSVL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan). The expression plasmid (6 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENETM 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with and then resuspended in the assay buffer and tested for α-GalNAcT and GlcNAc transferase-I (GlcNAcT-I) activities using the tetrasaccharide-serine (1 nmol) representing the GAG-protein linkage region, N-acetylchondrosine (5 nmol), and GlcAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol (250 nmol) as acceptor substrates as described (16Kitagawa H.

The isolation of the products from the α-GalNAcT reaction usingN-acetylchondrosine as an acceptor was carried out by gel filtration on a Superdex 30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.25 m NH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol. The radioactive peak containing the product was pooled and evaporated to dryness. The isolated product (about 10 pmol) was digested with 15 mIU of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase or 39 mIU of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, respectively, at 37 °C overnight. The enzyme digest was analyzed using the same Superdex 30 column as that noted above. The isolation of the products from the GlcNAcT-I reaction using GlcAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol was performed by HPLC on a Nova-Pak® C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm; Waters, Tokyo, Japan) in an LC-10AS system (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). The column was developed isocratically for 15 min with H2O at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature; thereafter, a linear gradient was applied to increase the methanol concentration from 0 to 100% over a 5-min period, and the column was then developed isocratically for 40 min with 100% methanol. The radioactive peak containing the product was pooled and evaporated to dryness. The isolated product (about 74 pmol) was incubated with 14 mIU of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, or with 3 mIU of heparitinase I for testing the digestability in a total volume of 30 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm Ca(OAc)2 at 37 °C overnight. The enzyme digest was analyzed using the same Nova-Pak® C18 column as that noted above. Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels (CLONTECH) were used for the analysis. The manufacturer normalizes each cDNA sample against six housekeeping genes. To verify this, we determined the levels of amplification of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, whose transcript is always present in the tissues at a constant level. The amplification reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl using the 5′ primer, 5′-ACCACTGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, and the 3′ primer, 5′-TCCACAACACGGTTGCTGTA-3′, by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. A 10-μl aliquot of the amplified products was visualized by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Using the normalized cDNA input, we then performed the amplification of a transcript, using a serial number of cycles (25-30-35) to find the conditions for a semiquantitative amplification. The best results were obtained by carrying out 30 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 75 s using the 5′ and 3′ primers described above, which were designed to span the two introns in the EXTL2 gene (10Wuyts W. Van Hul W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Van Agtmael T. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to discriminate a PCR product amplified from cDNA from, if any, one amplified from contaminating genomic DNA. PCR products were then visualized by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. To confirm that the amplified DNAs were derived from the EXTL2 mRNA, the amplified fragments were gel-purified, subcloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified DNAs were identical to that of the human EXTL2 cDNA (10Wuyts W. Van Hul W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Van Agtmael T. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (data not shown). α-GalNAcT was purified from the serum-free culture medium of a human sarcoma (malignant fibrous histiocytoma) cell line to near homogeneity mainly by affinity chromatographies on heparin-Sepharose and UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose. Upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, the purified α-GalNAcT preparation gave a major protein band of 38-kDa (data not shown), which was excised and subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The obtained sequence of thirty amino acid residues (Fig. 1) was 100% identical to that of residues 54–83 of the protein encoded by EXTL2/EXTR2 except for the unidentified amino acid corresponding to theN-glycosylation site (10Wuyts W. Van Hul W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Van Agtmael T. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Eur. J. Hum.

Commun. 1998; 243: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), as demonstrated by data base searches. The EXTL2/EXTR2 sequence indicated a single open reading frame of 990-base pair coding for a protein of 330 amino acids, including one potential N-glycosylation site (10Wuyts W. Van Hul W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Van Agtmael T. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Saito T. Seki N.

Commun. 1998; 243: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which has a type II transmembrane protein topology characteristic of many other glycosyltransferases cloned to date. Since the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified α-GalNAcT was found 54 amino acids away from the putative start site for translation of EXTL2/EXTR2, the purified α-GalNAcT seems to be a truncated form that has lost its transmembrane domain and subsequently been released from the enzyme-producing cell, as has been observed for several other glycosyltransferases (23Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A soluble form of the protein encoded by EXTL2/EXTR2 cDNA was generated by replacing the first 57 amino acids of EXTL2/EXTR2 with the cleavable insulin signal sequence and the IgG-binding domain of protein A as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When the expression plasmid containing the EXTL2/protein A fusion was expressed in COS-1 cells, an approximately 66-kDa protein was secreted (data not shown). The apparent molecular mass of the fused protein was reduced to 60-kDa after N-glycosidase treatment (data not shown), indicating that the one potential N-linked glycosylation site of EXTL2/EXTR2 is being utilized. The fused enzyme expressed in the medium was absorbed on IgG-Sepharose beads to eliminate endogenous glycosyltransferases and then the enzyme-bound beads were used as an enzyme source for further studies. The bound fusion protein was assayed for α-GalNAcT activity using a variety of acceptor substrates. As shown in Table I, marked glycosyltransferase activity was detected withN-acetylchondrosine (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc), GlcAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol, and the tetrasaccharide-serine representing the GAG-protein linkage region as the acceptor substrates. In addition, no detectable α-GalNAcT activity was recovered by the affinity purification from the control pSVL transfection sample. To identify the α-GalNAcT reaction products, N-acetylchondrosine was labeled by an enzyme reaction using UDP-[3H]GalNAc as a donor substrate and the enzyme-bound beads as an enzyme source. The labeled products were completely digested by α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, but not by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, quantitatively yielding a3H-labeled peak at the elution position of free [3H]GalNAc, as demonstrated by gel filtration (Fig.2 A). These results indicated that a GalNAc residue had been transferred toN-acetylchondrosine through an α-linkage and that the expressed protein was α1,4-GalNAc transferase.Table IAcceptor specificity of the α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase secreted into the culture medium by transfected COS-1 cellsAcceptorα-GalNAcT activityaThe values represent the averages of two independent experiments.GlcNAcT-I activityaThe values represent the averages of two independent experiments.pmol/ml medium/hGlcAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol10931GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser50NDbND, not detected (<0.1 pmol/ml medium/h).GlcAβ1–3GalNAc117—c—, not determined.a The values represent the averages of two independent experiments.b ND, not detected (<0.1 pmol/ml medium/h).c —, not determined. Open table in a new tab In view of the recent findings that EXT1 and EXT2, the carboxyl halves of both of which shared significant homology with EXTL2/EXTR2, were heparan sulfate-polymerases required for the heparan sulfate biosynthesis (4Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), it was of particular interest to investigate the involvement of EXTL2/EXTR2 in the heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Although our enzyme showed an α-GalNAcT activity toward the tetrasaccharide-serine derived from the common GAG-protein linkage region, the structure of the reaction product has not been found in naturally occurring GAG chains, which prompted us to hypothesize that the enzyme may have an α-GlcNAc tansferase activity toward the linkage region structure taking into account the tetrasaccharide structure of the acceptor substrate for the α-GalNAcT activity. Hence, the purified fusion protein was assayed for GlcNAc transferase activity using UDP-[3H]GlcNAc as a sugar donor and two oligosaccharide acceptor substrates whose structures represent the GAG-protein linkage region. As shown in Table I, a significant GlcNAc transferase activity was detected with GlcAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol as an acceptor, whereas no activity was detected using the linkage tetrasaccharide-serine. The observed substrate specificity was consistent with that reported for GlcNAcT-I (17Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. Lindahl U. Goto F. Ogawa T. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is involved in the heparan sulfate biosynthesis. No detectable GlcNAc transferase activity was recovered by affinity purification from a control pSVL transfection sample, excluding the possibility of an artifact or of an endogenous origin of the activity. To identify the GlcNAc transferase reaction products, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol was labeled with [3H]GlcNAc using the enzyme bound to beads. The labeled products were completely digested by heparitinase I that cleaves an α1,4-glucosaminide linkage in an eliminative fashion, quantitatively yielding a 3H-labeled peak at the position of free [3H]GlcNAc, as demonstrated by HPLC (Fig.2 B), whereas they were inert to the action of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. These results clearly indicated that a GlcNAc residue had been transferred exclusively to the nonreducing terminal GlcA of GlcAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol through an α1,4 linkage. Taken together, the present findings demonstrated that EXTL2/EXTR2 is an α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase that transfers GalNAc/GlcNAc to the artificial yet authentic oligosaccharide acceptor substrate for GlcNAcT-I (20Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of the tetrasaccharide-serine derived from the GAG-protein linkage region to serve as an acceptor (Table I) is discussed below. To screen tissue expression of the α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase, we used PCR-based methods with normalized cDNA pools. A single amplified DNA of the expected size (875 base pairs) was obtained from each cDNA preparation of the 18 adult and 8 fetal human tissues examined, although the amounts of the amplified cDNAs varied (Fig.3), indicating that the gene was ubiquitously expressed. In the present study, we demonstrated that EXTL2/EXTR2encoded enzyme with a dual catalytic activity of α-GalNAcT and GlcNAcT-I, i.e. an α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase that transferred GalNAc/GlcNAc to the core oligosaccharide representing the GAG-protein linkage region. Thus, the enzyme turned out to be identical to the previously described GlcNAcT-I that determines and initiates the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (20Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and most likely heparin as well. The gene, like other EXT gene family members, was found ubiquitously expressed in virtually every human tissue examined (Fig. 3), which is in accordance with the observations that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are distributed on the surfaces of most cells and the extracellular matrices in virtually every tissue. In view of the present findings of the involvement of EXTL2/EXTR2 in the heparan sulfate biosynthesis together with those of Lind et al. (4Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), who recently reported that EXT1 and EXT2 both encoded a heparan sulfate-polymerase required for the heparan sulfate biosynthesis, the expression of heparan sulfate seems to play an important role in the tumor suppressor function although the precise mechanism remains unclear. The initial characterization of crude GlcNAcT-I preparations showed that the enzyme exhibited strict specificity toward GlcAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol (20Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol, or GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-benzyl (24Fritz T.A. Agrawal P.K. Esko J.D. Krishna N.R. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Neither N-acetylheparosan (-4GlcAβ1–4GlcNAcα1-)n nor the tetrasaccharide-serine, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser derived from the linkage region, was utilized as an acceptor substrate (17Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. Lindahl U. Goto F. Ogawa T. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it was suggested that the transfer of the first GlcNAc residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide primer is mediated by GlcNAcT-I, distinct from the enzyme that has been termed heparan sulfate-polymerase involved in the formation of the repeating disaccharide units of heparan sulfate (20Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that GlcNAcT-I directly recognizes a specific sequence in the core protein or an aglycone structure attached to the linkage tetrasaccharide (24Fritz T.A. Agrawal P.K. Esko J.D. Krishna N.R. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These hypotheses have now been proven by the molecular identification and characterization of both enzymes in a recent study (4Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and in the present study. The molecular similarity of the two enzymes is consistent with the fact that both enzymes have α1,4-GlcNAc transferase activities and recognize the terminal β-GlcA moiety of their acceptor substrates. The enzyme protein of the α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase composed of 330 amino acids is about half the size of the other EXT family members that have 676∼919 amino acids. The variation in size is due to differences on the amino-terminal side of the protein. The protein shows significant homology with the carboxyl termini of the other members of the family. Based on the facts that both EXT1 and EXT2 encode a bifunctional heparan sulfate-polymerase catalyzing the GlcA and GlcNAc transferase reactions and that EXTL2/EXTR2 encodes GlcNAcT-I, it is reasonable to assume that the carboxyl-terminal side of EXT1 and EXT2 is the domain catalyzing the GlcNAc transferase reaction. A phylogenetic tree of the EXT gene family based on the conserved carboxyl-terminal amino acids shows a close relationship between EXT2 and EXTL3/EXTR1 and between EXT1 and EXTL1 (13Van Hul W. Wuyts W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Genomics. 1998; 47: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that the remaining two members, EXTL1 and EXTL3/EXTR1 might be heparan sulfate-polymerases. Notably, the EXTL2/EXTR2 gene is the most divergent, suggesting that this unique gene family member was the first to split from a common ancestor during evolution and evolved separately from the others (13Van Hul W. Wuyts W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Genomics. 1998; 47: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The possible role of the α-GalNAcT activity of the enzyme in the GAG biosynthesis remains unclear, since no α-GalNAc-capped structure has been reported in naturally occurring GAG chains. In our recent study, the α-GalNAc-capped pentasaccharide serine GalNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, a reaction product of the α-GalNAcT, was not utilized as an acceptor for the glucuronyltransferase involved in the chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis (25Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Tsutsumi K. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that the addition of an α-GalNAc residue may serve as a stop signal that precludes further chain elongation. The cDNA now provides an essential tool for investigating the biological functions of the α-GalNAcT reaction products, if any, in naturally occurring glycoconjugates as well as heparan sulfate with regard to the tumor suppressor activity. The EXTL2 has been assigned to chromosome 1p11-p12, and this region has been found to be involved in chromosomal rearrangements in a variety of tumors as described (10Wuyts W. Van Hul W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Van Agtmael T. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In view of the tumor suppressor capacity of the EXT genes, EXTL2 might also be a serious candidate gene involved in one of the tumors associated with this region. In this regard, many different types of tumors are associated with undersulfation and distinct changes in the sulfation pattern of the heparan sulfate structure (Ref. 26Jayson G.C. Lyon M. Paraskeva C. Turnbull J.E. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 51-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and the references therein), and recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for heparan sulfate in growth factor signaling mediated by Wingless proteins duringDrosophila development (27Binari R.C. Staveley B.E. Johnson W.A. Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. Manoukian A.S. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2623-2632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition,Drosophila homologues of EXT1 and heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase (encoded by ttv andpipe, respectively) were recently implicated in the Hedgehog diffusion and the formation of embryonic dorsal-ventral polarity, respectively (28Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 29Sen J. Goltz J.S. Stevens L. Stein D. Cell. 1998; 95: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, considering the probability that deletion of the gene would cause the complete elimination of heparan sulfate and heparin unless functional redundancy with other genes exists, it is likely that germ line mutations inactivating the enzymatic activity result in embryonic lethality and that somatic mutations cause much more serious defects than those caused by EXT1 andEXT2, leading to the progression of various tumors or to lethal disorders. In fact, congenital deficiency in heparan sulfate even only in enterocytes results in severe clinical problems and eventually death (30Murch S.H. Winyard P.J.D. Koletzko S. Wehner B. Cheema H.A.

The major glycosylated form of contulakin-G was found to incorporate the disaccharide β-d-Galp-(1→3)-α-d-GalpNAc-(1→) attached to Thr10.

In contrast, the glycosylated form of contulakin-G exhibited significantly weaker binding affinity for all of the receptors tested. However, both contulakin-G and nonglycosylated Thr10 contulakin-G were found to be potent agonists of rat neurotensin receptor type 1. Based on these results, we conclude that O-linked glycosylation appears to be a highly unusual strategy for increasing the efficacy of toxins directed against neurotransmitter receptors.

The 500 species of predatory cone snails have evolved extremely complex venoms. Each individual species typically has at least 100 different pharmacologically active components of varying molecular weights in its venom; most are small peptides (<30 amino acids) specifically targeted to receptors or ion channels. These small, biologically active peptides found in Conus venoms can be divided into two general classes, those with sequences that contain few or no cysteine residues and those that are cysteine-rich (conotoxins).

https://openalex.org/W2041831485,"Members of the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase family, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, stress-activated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38, are central elements that transduce the signal generated by growth factors, cytokines, and stressing agents. It is well known that the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which leads to cellular mitogenic response. On the other hand, the role of the other MAP kinases in mediating the cellular function of PDGF remains unclear. In the present study, we have investigated the functional role of the other MAP kinases in PDGF-mediated cellular responses. We show that ligand stimulation of PDGF receptors leads to the activation of p38 but not stress-activated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Experiments using a specific inhibitor of p38, SB203580, show that the activation of p38 is required for PDGF-induced cell motility responses such as cell migration and actin reorganization but not required for PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. Analyses of tyrosine residue-mutated PDGF receptors show that Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins including Src family kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the GTPase-activating protein of Ras, the Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase SHP-2, phospholipase C-γ, and Crk do not play a major role in mediating the PDGF-induced activation of p38. Finally, the expression of dominant-negative Ras but not dominant-negative Rac inhibited p38 activation by PDGF, suggesting that Ras is a potent mediator in the p38 activation pathway downstream of PDGF receptors. Taken together, our present study proposes the existence of a Ras-dependent pathway for the activation of p38, which is important for cell motility responses elicited by PDGF stimulation.

Westermark B. Nicola N. Guidebook to Cytokines and their Receptors. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 249-273Google Scholar for a review). PDGF has been shown to promote chemotaxis of fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and phagocytic cells (2Nister M. Hammacher A. Mellström K. Siegbahn A. Rönnstrand L. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The effect of PDGF is exerted by binding to two structurally similar protein-tyrosine kinase receptors denoted α- and β-receptors (see Ref. 5Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for a review). Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues. Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins bind in a specific manner to tyrosine-phosphorylated regions of PDGF receptors and mediate a number of PDGF-induced intracellular signaling events. There are nine autophosphorylation sites in the PDGF β-receptor, which bind to Src family kinases (Tyr-579 and Tyr-581), Grb2 (Tyr-716), the regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (Tyr-740 and Tyr-751), Nck (Tyr-751), the GTPase-activating protein of Ras (RasGAP) (Tyr-771), the SH2 domain-containing phosphatase SHP-2 (Tyr-1009), and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) (Tyr-1021) (5Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the PDGF α-receptor, tyrosine residues 754, 762, 768, 988, and 1018 have been identified as autophosphorylation sites (6Yokote K. Mori S. Siegbahn A. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H.

Members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), stress-activated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK1/JNK), and stress-activated protein kinase-2 (p38), are central elements that transduce the signal generated by growth factors, cytokines, and stressing agents (11Waskiewicz A.J.

It is well known that PDGF activates ERK in various types of cells expressing PDGF receptors, which leads to the mitogenic response of the cells. On the other hand, the role of the other MAP kinases in mediating the cellular function of PDGF remains unclear. In the present study, we have investigated the functional role of the other MAP kinases, SAPK1/JNK and p38, in PDGF-mediated cellular responses. We report that PDGF activates p38 but not SAPK1/JNK. Furthermore, we show experimental evidence suggesting that PDGF-induced activation of p38 is mediated through a Ras-dependent pathway and is required for PDGF-induced cell migration as well as actin reorganization. We conclude that p38 is an important mediator of the cell motility responses elicited by PDGF. Recombinant human PDGF-BB was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (14Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C.

[methyl-3H]Thymidine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).

The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 40 μg/ml gentamicin. Human skin fibroblasts TIG103 were obtained from the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin. Transient transfection of cultured cells with the expression vector pEFBOS-N17rac1 was performed using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cells were used for experiments 48 h after transfection. In vitro gene transfer of rasY57into cultured cells was carried out by incubation with AdexCAHRasY57 at 100 multiplicity of infection in F-12 medium for 2 h at 37 °C under gentle agitation. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were used for experiments 48 h after the transfer. The activity of ERK, SAPK1/JNK, and p38 was measured using a p44/42 MAP kinase assay kit, a SAPK1/JNK assay kit, and a p38 MAP kinase assay kit, respectively (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells in a 100-mm Petri dish were serum-starved for 20 h in F-12 medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Then the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PDGF-BB at 37 °C for 0–120 min or with 10 μg/ml anisomycin (Sigma) for 10 min, rinsed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed. For immunoprecipitations, 200 μl of the lysates were incubated with p38 MAP kinase antibody (1:50 dilution) or with phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose 6MB (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C. For precipitation of SAPK1/JNK, the lysates were incubated with a c-Jun fusion protein as a substrate linked to Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. For kinase assays, the beads were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 200 μm ATP in the presence of an ATF-2 fusion protein as a substrate for p38 or an Elk-1 fusion protein as a substrate for ERK. The reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For immunoblotting, the samples were electrically transferred from the acrylamide gel onto a nitrocellulose filter (Hybond-ECL, Amersham) followed by blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were incubated with phospho-ATF-2 antibody (1:1000 dilution), phospho-Elk1 antibody (1:1000 dilution), or phospho-c-Jun antibody (1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the sites of antibody binding were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham). A chemotactic response was assayed essentially as described (6Yokote K. Mori S. Siegbahn A. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5101-5111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using a 96-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg, MD). A polycarbonate membrane (polyvinylpyrrolidone-free, pore size, 8.0 μm) was coated with 100 μg/ml type I collagen (Vitrogen 100, Collagen Biomaterials, Palo Alto, CA) before use. Actin reorganization and membrane ruffling were analyzed essentially as described by Mellström et al. (20Mellström K. Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in triplicate and were repeated at least three times. The ability of PDGF-BB to stimulate DNA synthesis, measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid precipitable materials of cultured cells, was determined as described previously (21Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21158-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether PDGF-BB activates three members of the MAP kinase family, ERK, SAPK1/JNK, and p38 in PAE cells expressing the wild-type PDGF α- or β-receptors. The cells were serum-starved and stimulated with PDGF-BB. After stimulation, ERK and p38 were collected by immunoprecipitation, and SAPK1/JNK was collected by adsorption to the c-Jun fusion protein and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of the respective substrates, Elk-1 for ERK, ATF-2 for p38, and c-Jun for SAPK1/JNK. Phosphorylation of the substrates was detected by immunoblotting with the specific antibodies against the phosphorylated substrates. As shown in Fig.1, PDGF-BB stimulation increased phosphorylation of Elk-1 (upper panel) and ATF-2 (lower panel) in both the cells expressing the wild-type α- and β-receptors. PDGF-BB-induced activation of ERK, and p38 was clearly detected at 10 min after stimulation. ERK activity but not p38 activity still remained elevated 120 min after stimulation. In contrast, PDGF-BB stimulation failed to phosphorylate c-Jun (middle panel) in either the wild-type α- or β-receptor-expressing cells. These data clearly indicate that PDGF-BB stimulation of the PDGF α- as well as β-receptors leads to the activation of both ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways but not the SAPK1/JNK pathway. It was also found that SAPK1/JNK and p38 were strongly activated by treatment with anisomycin (Fig. 1,middle and lower panels), in agreement with previous reports (22Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 23Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Kardalinou E. Buckle R.S. Mahadevan L.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that anisomycin activates two MAP kinase subtypes associated with the stress response but not ERK. Fig.2 shows the time course of p38 activation by PDGF-BB in PAE cells expressing the wild-type PDGF α- or β-receptors. PDGF-BB-induced activation of p38 turned out to be transient; it was maximal at 10 min after stimulation and declined to basal level by 30 min in both the α- and β-receptor-expressing cells. The dose response of PDGF-BB-induced activation of p38 was shown in Fig. 3. The maximal activation of p38 was achieved at the concentrations around 20–50 ng/ml PDGF-BB in both the α- and β-receptor-expressing cells.Figure 2Time course of PDGF-BB-induced p38 activation in PAE cells expressing the wild-type PDGF α- or β-receptors. The cells expressing the wild-type α-receptor (WTα) or β-receptor (WTβ) were serum-starved for 20 h and treated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 0–120 min at 37 °C. After treatment, the cells were lysed, and p38 activity of the cell lysates was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

After treatment, p38 activity was measured and is expressed as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next asked whether PDGF-BB induces activation of p38 in other cell types. Human skin fibroblasts TIG103 were examined. As shown in Fig.4, PDGF-BB activated p38 in TIG103 fibroblasts from 5 to 15 min after stimulation. The data indicate that PDGF-BB-induced activation of p38 occurs not only in an artificial condition where human PDGF receptors are expressed in the transfected PAE cells but also in a natural condition where fibroblasts express endogeneous PDGF receptors. It is well established that PDGF modulates cell motility. To evaluate the role of p38 in PDGF-induced cell migration, we examined the effect of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, on PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis using a modified Boyden chamber method in PAE cells expressing the wild-type PDGF β-receptor. PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis reached the maximal level at 20 ng/ml, a 108-fold increase as compared with control (data not shown); therefore, the concentration of PDGF-BB was kept constant at 20 ng/ml throughout the assays. As shown in Fig.5 A, treatment of the cells with SB203580 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of chemotaxis of PDGF-BB-stimulated cells, with a 27.1% reduction at 1 μm SB203580 and a 69.5% reduction at 10 μm(IC50, 6.0 μm). On the other hand, PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, did not affect PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis at concentrations of up to 50 μm (Fig. 5 B). It was also found that SB202474, a negative control of SB203580, did not affect PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis at concentrations of up to 20 μm as expected (data not shown). The data suggest that activation of p38 but not ERK is required for PDGF-BB-induced cell migration. An essential feature of the chemotactic response in the cytoskeleton level is the actin reorganization, such as the formation of lamellipodia or membrane ruffling, extending forward the direction of movement (24Stoker M. Gherardi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PDGF stimulation of PAE cells expressing the wild-type PDGF β-receptor leads to an induction of membrane ruffling and a reduction of actin stress fibers (4Eriksson A. Siegbahn A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, next we examined whether SB203580 affects PDGF-BB-induced actin reorganization at the concentration that inhibits cell migration. The wild-type PDGF β-receptor-expressing cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB and fixed, and actin filaments were stained using tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin. As shown in Fig.6 B, PDGF-BB stimulation induced the appearance of membrane ruffling and the disappearance of actin stress fibers. In contrast, these phenomena were not observed when the cells were pretreated with 10 μm SB203580 (Fig.6 C). Quantitative analyses of the data are shown in Fig.7. The percentage of membrane ruffling-forming cells to total cells was significantly (p < 0.002) reduced, whereas the percentage of stress fiber-forming cells to total cells was significantly (p< 0.026) increased by treatment with SB203580. Both pretreatments with 10 μm SB202474 (Figs. 6 D and 7) and with 20 μm PD098059 (data not shown) did not affect PDGF-BB-induced actin reorganization as expected. These data suggest that activation of p38 is required for PDGF-BB-induced actin reorganization.Figure 7SB203580 inhibits PDGF-BB-induced membrane ruffling and rearrangement of actin stress fibers in PAE cells expressing the wild-type PDGF β-receptor.The cells were pretreated with SB203580 or SB202474 and stimulated with PDGF-BB as described in the legend to Fig. 6. Then the cells were fixed and actin filaments were stained using tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin. The cells were viewed by fluorescence microscopy, and 300 cells were counted in duplicate. The percentages of membrane ruffling-forming cells to total cells as well as that of stress fiber-forming cells to total cells were calculated. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.Bars represent mean ± S.D. *,p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate whether p38 is involved also in PDGF-induced mitogenesis, next we examined the effect of SB203580 on the PDGF-BB-stimulated increase in DNA synthesis in PAE cells expressing the wild-type PDGF β-receptor. DNA synthesis was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. As shown in Fig. 8, treatment of the cells with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB induced a 3.9-fold increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation as compared with the control. Simultaneous treatment of the cells with 20 μmSB203580, the concentration of which was shown to be enough to considerably inhibit PDGF-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 5 A), did not affect PDGF-BB-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation. Next we examined which SH2 domain-containing proteins mediate PDGF-induced p38 activation. PAE cells expressing the wild-type or various mutant PDGF β- or α-receptors, in which one or two tyrosine residues were replaced with phenylalanine residues, were analyzed for PDGF-BB-induced p38 activation. The cells expressing Y579F, Y740F/Y751F, Y771F, Y1009F, or Y1021F mutant β-receptors, which are unable to interact with Src family kinases, PI 3-kinase, RasGAP, SHP-2, or PLC-γ, respectively, and the cells expressing Y762F or Y1018F mutant α-receptors, which are unable to interact with Crk or PLC-γ, respectively, were used for the assay. As shown in Fig.9, all these mutant β- or α-receptors were found to mediate PDGF-BB-induced activation of p38 as efficiently as the wild-type β- or α-receptors, respectively. The data indicate that none of these SH2 proteins play a major role in transducing the signal leading to p38 activation by PDGF-BB. Among these SH2 proteins, PI 3-kinase and PLC-γ have been considered major role players in cell motility responses induced by the PDGF β-receptor (25Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.-K. Heldin C.-H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether specific inhibitors for PI 3-kinase and PLC-γ, wortmannin and U-73122, respectively, inhibit PDGF-BB-induced p38 activation. Neither wortmannin (1 μm) nor U-73122 (1–25 μm) affected the activation of p38 by PDGF-BB at the concentrations sufficient to inhibit enzymatic activation of these SH2 proteins (data not shown). The data confirm that PI 3-kinase and PLC-γ are not involved in PDGF-induced p38 activation. Members of the small GTP-binding proteins have a critical role in the activation of the MAP kinases. Among these proteins, Ras is well known to be activated upon ligand stimulation of the PDGF β-receptor. The activated Ras has been shown to activate three distinct MAP kinases, ERK, SAPK1/JNK, and p38 in different conditions (27Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 28Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). In addition, the small GTP-binding protein Rac1 has been reported to regulate PDGF-induced membrane ruffling (29Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar, 30Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Wennström S. Yokote K. Siegbahn A. Heldin C.-H. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and to play a role in mediating the p38 MAP kinase pathway in response to stimulation by interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor (31Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of these small GTP-binding proteins in PDGF-induced activation of p38, we examined the effect of overexpression of dominant-negative Rac1 (N17Rac1) or dominant-negative Ras (Ras57Y) on the PDGF-BB-induced activation of p38 in PAE cells expressing the wild-type PDGF β-receptor. The expression of N17Rac1 profoundly inhibited PDGF-BB-induced actin reorganization as expected (data not shown). On the other hand, as shown in Fig.10 A, the expression of N17Rac1 did not affect the PDGF-BB-induced activation of p38. In contrast, the expression of Ras57Y potently inhibited PDGF-BB-induced activation of p38 as well as ERK (Fig. 10 B). Ras57Y expression did not affect anisomycin-induced activation of p38 (Fig.10 B). These data suggest that Ras is a potent mediator of a p38 pathway downstream of the PDGF β-receptor. In the present study, we show that PDGF-BB stimulation of the PDGF α- as well as β-receptors leads to activation of both ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways but not the SAPK1/JNK pathway (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Experiments using the specific inhibitor of p38 show that activation of p38 is required for PDGF-BB-induced cell motility responses such as cell migration and actin reorganization but not required for PDGF-BB-stimulated DNA synthesis (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). Our present study also shows that SH2 domain-containing proteins including Src family kinases, PI 3-kinase, RasGAP, SHP-2, PLC-γ, and Crk do not play a major role in mediating PDGF-BB-induced activation of p38 (Fig. 9). Instead, Ras, but not Rac, seems to be a potent mediator in the p38 activation pathway downstream of the PDGF β-receptor (Fig. 10). Using fibroblast cell lines expressing a dominant-negative Ras mutant, Kundra et al. (32Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have shown that Ras inhibition suppresses migration toward PDGF-BB. The observation is consistent with our present findings, suggesting that Ras is involved upstream of the PDGF-induced activation pathway of p38 leading to cell migration. It was also reported using an inhibitor of MEK1, PD098059, that ERK activation was involved in PDGF-directed migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (33Graf K. Xi X.-P. Yang D. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 334-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we did not observe any inhibitory effect of the MEK1 inhibitor on PDGF-BB-mediated chemotaxis in our assay system (Fig. 5 B). Joneson et al. (34Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) have reported that membrane ruffling and ERK activation are mediated by distinct Ras effector pathways. Our data demonstrating that PDGF-induced cell motility response is mediated by p38 but not by ERK also suggest the existence of a Ras/p38 pathway independent of the classical Ras/ERK pathway. The MEKs for p38, MAP kinase kinase 3, and MAP kinase kinase 6, are relatively specific activators of p38 (35Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar), and it is conceivable that they are also involved in the activation process of p38 downstream of PDGF stimulation. Although there may be some cross-activation of p38 by SEK1/MAP kinase kinase 4 (36Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), which is one of the MEKs upstream of SAPK1/JNK, its involvement is unlikely because we did not observe SAPK1/JNK activation after PDGF-BB stimulation (Fig. 1). MEKKs in the p38 cascade have not been clearly identified, and the signaling link between Ras and MAP kinase kinase 3/6 remains to be determined. Based on a series of studies (37Huot J. Houle F. Marceau F. Landry J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 38Guay J. Lambert H. Gingras-Breton G. Lavoie J.N. Huot J. Landry J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is now clear that activation of the p38 cascade results in activation of MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2, which in turn phosphorylates the F-actin polymerization modulator heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Although the physiological significance of the phosphorylation is not fully understood and the function of HSP27 is not yet clear, it can regulate microfilament dynamics (39Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Huot J. Houle F. Spitz D.R. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar) and, thereby, is likely to play an important role in cell motility responses elicited by PDGF stimulation. It is well established that Rac regulates growth factor-induced membrane ruffling (29Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar, 41Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). In fact, Hooshmand-Rad et al.(30Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Wennström S. Yokote K. Siegbahn A. Heldin C.-H. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have recently confirmed the involvement of Rac in PDGF-induced actin reorganization and chemotaxis. Therefore, it was our surprise that the expression of the dominant-negative Rac1 mutant failed to inhibit PDGF-BB-induced activation of p38 (Fig. 10 A). The data suggest a possibility that the p38-mediated signaling pathway is independent of the Rac-mediated pathway and both pathways function synergistically in PDGF-induced cell motility responses. Alternatively, Ras-dependent activation of p38 may be a prerequisite for subsequent activation of Rac in the context of a PDGF-induced signaling pathway. Zhang et al. (31Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) have shown that the p21-activated kinase 1 and its upstream regulators, Rac and Cdc42, couple to and regulate the activity of p38 and are an integral part of the signaling pathway linking cell surface proinflammatory receptors to p38 activation. On the other hand, Tan et al. (42Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) have shown that fibroblast growth factor-induced activation of p38 is mediated through an intracellular signaling pathway that requires Ras. Our present study shows that PDGF-induced activation of p38 is also mediated by Ras but not by Rac, suggesting that the Ras-dependent pathway functions as an alternative mechanism for the growth factor-mediated signal leading to p38 activation. PI 3-kinase has been reported to be indispensable for PDGF-induced chemotaxis, which is mediated by the PDGF β-receptor (25Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.-K. Heldin C.-H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Replacement of two tyrosine residues within PI 3-kinase binding sites of the PDGF β-receptor causes a loss of chemotactic response to PDGF-BB in cells transfected with this mutant receptor. However, Higakiet al. (43Higaki M. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Shimokado K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29342-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that two different PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, did not inhibit PDGF-induced chemotaxis and, furthermore, Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing a dominant-negative p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase showed a chemotactic response comparable to that of parental cells while showing a remarkable decrease in PI 3-kinase activity. The underlying mechanism of the discrepant observations concerning the functional role of PI 3-kinase in PDGF-induced chemotaxis remains to be elucidated. Our present finding that the Y740F/Y751F mutant PDGF β-receptor, which lacks the PI3-kinase binding sites, activated p38 as efficiently as the wild-type β-receptor (Fig. 9) clearly rules out a possibility that PI 3-kinase is involved upstream of the p38-dependent signaling pathway for cell motility responses. In summary, we have demonstrated that the p38 pathway is involved in modulating the PDGF-induced cell motility responses and obtained evidence suggesting that the activation of p38 is mediated through Ras-dependent mechanism. The finding that p38 may regulate cell motility is consistent with the previous report suggesting that p38 activation by vascular endothelial growth factor mediates actin reorganization and cell migration in human endothelial cells (44Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The report, together with our present study, supports the notion that p38 is an important mediator of cell motility responses elicited by receptor tyrosine kinases.

Egr-1 activates the LHβ gene in vitro through synergy with steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), a protein required for gonadotrope function. To test if this synergy is essential for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation of LHβ, we examined the activity of the LHβ promoter in the gonadotrope cell line LβT2. GnRH markedly stimulated the LHβ promoter (15-fold). Mutation of either Egr-1 or SF-1 elements within the LHβ promoter attenuated this stimulation, whereas mutation of both promoter elements abrogated GnRH induction of the LHβ promoter. Furthermore, GnRH stimulated Egr-1 but not SF-1 expression in LβT2 cells. Importantly, overexpression of Egr-1 alone was sufficient to enhance LHβ expression. Although other Egr proteins are expressed in LβT2 cells and are capable of interacting with SF-1, GnRH stimulation of Egr-1 was the most robust. We also found that the nuclear receptor DAX-1, a repressor of SF-1 activity, reduced Egr-1–SF-1 synergy and diminished GnRH stimulation of the LHβ promoter. We conclude that the synergy between Egr-1 and SF-1 is essential for GnRH stimulation of the LHβ gene and plays a central role in the dynamic regulation of LHβ expression.

Endocrine signals within the female hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis regulate ovarian follicle development, ovulation, and steroidogenesis.

The LHβ promoter contains similar sites at positions −50 and −113.In addition to Egr-1 elements, the LHβ proximal promoter also contains evolution-conserved SF-1 responsive elements located at positions −127 and −59 (12Keri R.A.

Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

SF-1 regulates the expression of most steroidogenic enzymes in both female and male gonads and adrenal cortex as well as other proteins relevant to reproductive development and function (31Parker K.L.

Investig. 1998; 5: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Importantly, SF-1 is essential for reproductive development, because mice deficient in this transcription factor lack gonads and adrenal glands, which consequently leads to persistence of Mullerian structures even in male embryos as well as early neonatal death from adrenal insufficiency (17Luo X.

Interestingly, the transcriptional activity of SF-1 is repressed by DAX-1, an orphan nuclear receptor implicated in the pathogenesis of adrenal hypoplasia congenita and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (34Zanaria E.

Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Like SF-1, Egr-1 is also required for normal reproductive development and function, as Egr-1 −/−female mice exhibit arrested uterine development and infertility, reflecting a specific deficiency in LHβ expression in pituitary gonadotropes (16Lee S.L.

Pulsatile release of GnRH acting through GnRH receptors plays a central role in dynamic regulation of LHβ expression (1Belchetz P.E. Plant T.M. Nakai Y. Keogh E.J. Knobil E.

Dalkin A.C. Ortolano G.A. Marshall J.C. Shupnik M.A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Therefore we hypothesized that GnRH activation of the LHβ gene requires the synergistic interaction of Egr-1 and SF-1. We tested our hypothesis utilizing the gonadotrope cell line LβT2, which expresses Egr-1 and SF-1 and responds to GnRH administration with LHβ production (40Alarid E.T. Windle J.J. Whyte D.B. Mellon P.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3319-3329PubMed Google Scholar, 41Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONEgr-1 is essential for LHβ production in vivo, as Egr-1 −/− mice exhibit LHβ deficiency, resulting in abnormal sexual development and infertility (16Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J. Science. 1996; 273: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 24Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Trembleau A. Gourdji D. Driancourt M.A. Rao C.V. Charnay P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 12: 107-122Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Similarly, SF-1 −/− mice are deficient in LHβ production (33Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), which can be restored with GnRH administration (33Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GnRH is the most important physiologic regulator of LH production and stimulates LHβ production and secretion in vitro (41Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas it is known that the synergy between Egr-1 and SF-1 is required for basal expression of LHβ in vitro (16Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J. Science. 1996; 273: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar,29Halvorson L.M. Ito M. Jameson J.L. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14712-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), our results provide the first link between the GnRH-dependent stimulation of LHβ and the synergistic interaction of Egr-1 and SF-1. Maximal diminution of the LHβ promoter activity is observed only when both Egr-1 and SF-1 elements are mutated, providing further support to the role of Egr-1–SF-1 synergy in directing LHβ production. It is also evident that mutations in the Egr-1 binding elements within the LHβ promoter have a more profound effect on GnRH-stimulated activity of the LHβ promoter when compared with analogous mutations in the SF-1 elements, suggesting that Egr-1 plays a more important role in the dynamic regulation of the LHβ gene by GnRH. This conclusion is supported by the finding that GnRH regulates the expression of Egr-1 and not SF-1. In addition, we confirmed that overexpression of Egr-1 alone was sufficient to activate expression of endogenous LHβ in LβT2 cells even in the absence of GnRH stimulation. Nevertheless, it is likely that endogenous SF-1 in LβT2 cells supports the ability of Egr-1 to activate the LHβ gene.Our results are consistent with the finding that changes in the transcription rate of LHβ in vivo are not associated with a concomitant change in SF-1 expression in sheep pituitary (52Brown P. McNeilly A.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although a weak induction (<1.65-fold) of SF-1 expression by pulsed GnRH treatment of GnRH-deficient female rats has been reported (53Haisenleder D.J. Yasin M. Dalkin A.C. Gilrain J. Marshall J.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5719-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although Keri and Nilson (12Keri R.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10782-10785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) suggested that SF-1 sites are required for GnRH stimulation of the bovine LHβ promoter in transgenic mice, Ikeda et al. (33Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that SF-1 is not obligatory for GnRH effect, because GnRH can at least partially restore LHβ expression even in SF-1-deficient mice. These inconsistencies may be partly explained by a different promoter or cellular contexts or by compensation by other nuclear proteins for the absence of functional SF-1 in the knock-out mouse model. Interestingly, a cooperative interaction has also been demonstrated between the pituitary transcription factors Ptx1 and Pit1 in stimulation of theprl gene (54Szeto D.P. Ryan A.K. O'Connell S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7706-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 55Lanctot C. Lamelot B. Drouin J. Development. 1997; 124: 2807-2817PubMed Google Scholar) as well as between Ptx1 and SF-1 in regulation of LHβ (56Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike Egr-1, the action of Ptx1 is not specific to LHβ, as Ptx1 is also required for expression of the gonadotropin α-subunit (56Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism of synergy between Egr-1 and SF-1 is currently unknown. Our results, as well as the results of others (29Halvorson L.M. Ito M. Jameson J.L. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14712-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), indicate that both proteins must be DNA-bound to synergistically activate LHβ gene expression. It is possible that in addition to enhancement of Egr-1 expression, GnRH-dependent signals modulate the functional interaction between Egr-1 and SF-1. Previous studies utilizing a protein-protein interaction assay in vitro (29Halvorson L.M. Ito M. Jameson J.L. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14712-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) suggest that Egr-1 and SF-1 physically interact with each other, and this interaction requires the zinc finger domain of Egr-1. Current studies are underway to test for the presence and significance of this interaction in LβT2 cells.In addition to Egr-1 and SF-1, other DNA binding elements within the LHβ gene may modulate GnRH stimulation of LHβ expression. Using the rat somatolactotropic cell line GH3, Kaiser et al. (14Kaiser U.B. Sabbagh E. Chen M.T. Chin W.W. Saunders B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12943-12951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that another zinc finger protein, Sp1, binds to the rat LHβ promoter at 2 sites located between −451 and −386 and may play a role in GnRH-stimulated expression of the LHβ gene. Although the Sp1-dependent GnRH effect was markedly weaker (2–3-fold) when compared with the Egr-1-SF-1-dependent effect in our experiments, these results suggest that GnRH stimulation of the LHβ promoter involves an integrated response of multiple transcription factors binding to discrete promoter elements. Indeed estradiol, acting via estrogen receptors, modulates LHβ expression (8Shupnik M.A. Rosenzweig B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17084-17091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and estrogen receptors were shown to interact with SF-1 in regulation of the salmon gonadotropin IIβ subunit (57LeDrean Y. Liu D. Wong A.O.L. Xiong F. Hew C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 217-229PubMed Google Scholar). Other sex hormones also alter LHβ expression (9Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I.

Shupnik M.A. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is likely that signaling by these promoter-bound transcription factors is modulated by diverse signal transduction pathways that participate in the transmission of GnRH stimuli from its surface receptors to the LHβ gene (2Saade G. London D.R. Clayton R.N. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1744-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocr.

Endocrinol. 1991; 80: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Whereas potential cross-talk between these second messenger pathways and Egr-1–SF-1 synergy remains to be established, such coordinated interaction is likely to contribute to the fine tuned LHβ response to GnRH pulses under diverse physiological conditions.Unlike Egr-1, little is known at the present time about the role of other Egr proteins in reproductive physiology or pathophysiology. Mice homozygous for mutant Egr-2 exhibit abnormal hindbrain development and die within 2 weeks after birth (59Schneider-Maunoury S. Topilko P. Seitanidou T. Levi G. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Pournin S. Babinet C. Charnay P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1199-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 60Swiatek P.J. Gridley T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2071-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Egr-3-deficient mice have muscle spindle agenesis, which results in sensory ataxia, and are not known to have gonadotropin deficiency (61Tourtellotte W.G. Milbrandt J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We used JEG3 cells to assess cooperativity between Egr proteins and SF-1 in activation of the LHβ promoter, because these cells do not express an appreciable level of either Egr proteins or SF-1, although they are all expressed in LβT2 cells. All four Egr proteins synergistically interact with SF-1 in transcriptional activation of the LHβ promoter. Interestingly, whereas GnRH stimulates the expression of all Egr proteins to some extent, Egr-1 exhibits the largest and most prolonged response to GnRH stimulation. This selective effect of GnRH may provide at least a partial explanation for the fact that the profound phenotype of Egr-1-deficient mice was not compensated by any of the other proteins from the Egr family. Studies that focus on the expression of Egr proteins in wild type and Egr-1-deficient mice are required to further elucidate these findings.DAX-1 is a potent repressor of SF-1 activity (36Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 37Crawford P.A. Dorn C. Sadovsky Y. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2949-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and this repression is achieved, at least in part, through recruitment of the co-repressor N-CoR to DNA-bound SF-1. DAX-1 is expressed in the anterior pituitary and in αT3 cells, a gonadotrope cell line similar to LβT2 (62Ikeda Y. Swain A. Weber T.J. Hentges K.E. Zanaria E. Lalli E. Tamai K.T. Sassone-Corsi P. Lovell-Badge R. Camerino G. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It is also expressed in LH-expressing human pituitary adenomas (63Ikuyama S. Yi-Ming M. Ohe K. Nakagaki H. Fukushima T. Takayanagi R. Nawata H. Clin. Endocrinol. 1998; 48: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas DAX-1 has only a marginal effect on SF-1-mediated activation of the LHβ promoter in the absence of Egr proteins, it markedly represses the synergistic activation of LHβ by Egr-1 and SF-1. These data provide more insight into the range of the repressive function of DAX-1 and suggest that the ability of DAX-1 to repress SF-1-mediated regulation of LHβ expression depends on the interaction with the synergistic factor Egr-1. A similar effect was recently observed by Nachtigal et al. (64Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) who found that WT1, an Egr-1-related zinc finger protein, synergistically interacts with SF-1 to promote Mullerian inhibitory substance expression. DAX-1 antagonizes this synergy, but only when both WT1 and SF-1 are co-expressed (64Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Whereas our results demonstrate an analogous repressive effect of DAX-1 on SF-1 and Egr-1 in the context of the LHβ promoter, versions of the promoter harboring mutations to the SF-1 and/or Egr-1 binding sites remain partially repressible by DAX-1 (data not shown). SF-1-independent repression by DAX-1 also occurs on the human steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) promoter via direct DNA binding by DAX-1 to hairpin structures (65Zazopoulos E. Lalli E. Stocco D.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1997; 390: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Comparison of the rat LHβ promoter to the"
https://openalex.org/W2084948634,"DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is a heterodimeric protein composed of 45-kDa (DFF45) and 40-kDa (DFF40) subunits, a protein that mediates regulated DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation in response to apoptotic signals. DFF45 is a specific molecular chaperone and an inhibitor for the nuclease activity of DFF40. Previous studies have shown that upon cleavage of DFF45 by caspase-3, the nuclease activity of DFF40 is relieved of inhibition. Here we further investigate the mechanism of DFF40 activation. We demonstrate that DFF45 can also be cleaved and inactivated by caspase-7 but not by caspase-6 and caspase-8. The cleaved DFF45 fragments dissociate from DFF40, allowing DFF40 to oligomerize to form a large functional complex that cleaves DNA by introducing double strand breaks. Histone H1 directly interacts with DFF, confers DNA binding ability to DFF, and stimulates the nuclease activity of DFF40 by increasing its K cat and decreasing itsK m.

Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The cleavage of DFF45 by caspase-3, which liberates the nuclease activity of DFF40, supports this suggestion. In addition to caspase-3, DFF can also be activated by caspase-7 and weakly activated by caspase-8 but not by caspase-6 (Fig.1 B). This is consistent with previous studies on the substrate preferences of caspases, with caspase-3 and caspase-7 preferring the DXXD motif that fits the caspase cleavage sites DETD and DAVD on DFF45. On the other hand, caspase-6, -8, and -9 prefer the (L/V)EXD motif that is absent in DFF45 (18Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W.

This large DFF40 oligomer is by itself an active DNase and is responsive to histone H1 stimulation. The formation of this large DFF40 oligomer probably requires the chaperoning function of DFF45 because the expression of DFF40 alone cannot generate functional DNase both in cultured cells and in DFF45 knock out mice (4Enari M.

Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we have identified additional protein factors, such as histone H1 and HMG-1/-2, that enhance the nuclease activity of DFF (7Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.

Histone H1 and HMG proteins are “architectural” proteins that are located in the internucleosomal linker regions of chromatin (11Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

The association of DFF with these chromatin-associated proteins therefore targets DFF to the linker regions. Moreover, the direct interaction of DFF with histone H1 also confers the DNA binding ability to DFF (Fig.3 B).Previously, we have shown that histone H1 stimulates the nuclease activity of DFF more than 10-fold (7Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis indicates that histone H1 enhances the nuclease activity of DFF by increasingK cat and decreasing K m (Fig.3 C). We postulate that HMG proteins may have a role similar to histone H1. Of the HMG proteins tested, HMG-1, HMG-2, and HMG-14 but not HMGI/Y stimulated the nuclease activity of DFF (data not shown). One possibility is that HMGI/Y does not interact directly with DFF although histone H1 and HMG-1, -2, and -14 do. Therefore histone H1 and HMG proteins not only recruit DFF to the internucleosomal linker regions of chromatin but also stimulate the nuclease activity of DFF40 oligomer. Recently, Halenbeck et al. (6Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Contoy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) stated that carrier proteins such as BSA also enhance the endonuclease activity of DFF40/CPAN in the presence of higher concentrations of Mg2+. However, our results indicate that low concentrations of BSA have no effect on DFF40 nuclease activity (7Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), and only when high concentrations of BSA (1 mg/ml) were included in the reaction buffer did the BSA effect become obvious (data not shown). The stimulatory effect of histone H1 on DFF40 nuclease is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that of BSA (data not shown). Furthermore, histone H1 and HMG-1/-2 still stimulated the nuclease activity of DFF40 when we used the same assay conditions as described by Halenbeck et al. (6Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A.

Therefore the stimulatory effect of chromatin-associated proteins on DFF is different from that of BSA.Unlike DNase I, DFF40 did not generate single strand nicks when cleaving double-stranded DNA (Fig. 4), indicating that DFF40 cleaves DNA by introducing double strand breaks. The break points are either blunt ends or one-base 5′-overhangs with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl groups (data not shown). Such a property eliminates the possibility for single strand repair enzymes to relegate the broken points. In addition, because double-stranded DNA breaks are themselves apoptotic signals, the cleavage of genomic DNA by DFF40 may trigger an amplification cycle that marks an irreversible step for apoptosis. Chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation into nucleosomal fragments are the best recognized biochemical events of apoptosis (1Wyllie A.H.

The cleavage of DFF45 by caspases, interestingly, does not just dissociate the fragments of DFF45 from DFF40 to release its inhibition; in addition, liberated DFF40 oligomerizes to form a large protein complex that elutes at the exclusion volume of a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Fig. 2). This large DFF40 oligomer is by itself an active DNase and is responsive to histone H1 stimulation. The formation of this large DFF40 oligomer probably requires the chaperoning function of DFF45 because the expression of DFF40 alone cannot generate functional DNase both in cultured cells and in DFF45 knock out mice (4Enari M.

Purified DFF exhibits relatively weak nuclease activity in the presence of caspase-3, whereas the same amount of protein can actively induce DNA fragmentation in nuclei (3Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we have identified additional protein factors, such as histone H1 and HMG-1/-2, that enhance the nuclease activity of DFF (7Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 10Toh S.Y. Wang X. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 598-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Histone H1 and HMG proteins are “architectural” proteins that are located in the internucleosomal linker regions of chromatin (11Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989: 198-288Google Scholar). The association of DFF with these chromatin-associated proteins therefore targets DFF to the linker regions. Moreover, the direct interaction of DFF with histone H1 also confers the DNA binding ability to DFF (Fig.3 B). Previously, we have shown that histone H1 stimulates the nuclease activity of DFF more than 10-fold (7Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis indicates that histone H1 enhances the nuclease activity of DFF by increasingK cat and decreasing K m (Fig.3 C). We postulate that HMG proteins may have a role similar to histone H1. Of the HMG proteins tested, HMG-1, HMG-2, and HMG-14 but not HMGI/Y stimulated the nuclease activity of DFF (data not shown). One possibility is that HMGI/Y does not interact directly with DFF although histone H1 and HMG-1, -2, and -14 do. Therefore histone H1 and HMG proteins not only recruit DFF to the internucleosomal linker regions of chromatin but also stimulate the nuclease activity of DFF40 oligomer. Recently, Halenbeck et al. (6Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Contoy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) stated that carrier proteins such as BSA also enhance the endonuclease activity of DFF40/CPAN in the presence of higher concentrations of Mg2+. However, our results indicate that low concentrations of BSA have no effect on DFF40 nuclease activity (7Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), and only when high concentrations of BSA (1 mg/ml) were included in the reaction buffer did the BSA effect become obvious (data not shown). The stimulatory effect of histone H1 on DFF40 nuclease is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that of BSA (data not shown). Furthermore, histone H1 and HMG-1/-2 still stimulated the nuclease activity of DFF40 when we used the same assay conditions as described by Halenbeck et al. (6Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Contoy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore the stimulatory effect of chromatin-associated proteins on DFF is different from that of BSA. Unlike DNase I, DFF40 did not generate single strand nicks when cleaving double-stranded DNA (Fig. 4), indicating that DFF40 cleaves DNA by introducing double strand breaks. The break points are either blunt ends or one-base 5′-overhangs with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl groups (data not shown). Such a property eliminates the possibility for single strand repair enzymes to relegate the broken points. In addition, because double-stranded DNA breaks are themselves apoptotic signals, the cleavage of genomic DNA by DFF40 may trigger an amplification cycle that marks an irreversible step for apoptosis.

The ultimate targets of these signal transduction cascades are transcription factors required for cellular proliferation. Understanding how constitutive activation of Ras contributes to tumorigenesis requires an understanding of both the signaling pathways that Ras activates and how these pathways in turn regulate gene expression. Gene expression from κB sites is enhanced in cells transformed with activated Ras and NF-κB activity is required for oncogenic Ras to transform NIH-3T3 and Rat-1 fibroblasts. Both dominant negative and constitutively active components of signaling pathways have been tested for their ability to regulate NF-κB. These experiments show that Ras utilizes Raf-dependent and Raf-independent pathways to activate NF-κB transcriptional activity, both of which require the stress-activated kinase p38 or a related kinase. In the case of Raf, activation of NF-κB by an autocrine factor stimulates κB-dependent transcriptional activity.

Three MAP kinases have been identified, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPKs), and the p38 kinases. The MAP kinases are activated in response to a wide variety of stimuli including growth factors, cytokines, and cellular stress. The ERKs are primarily responsible for responding to cellular proliferation signals, while JNKs and p38 respond to cellular stress signals (11Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Wildmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Each MAP kinase is regulated by different upstream signaling pathways that consist of similar elements. ERK is activated by a MAP kinase kinase, MEK, which is activated by a MAP kinase kinase kinase, Raf. JNK and p38 are activated by the MAP kinase kinase MKK4/SEK1, which is activated by the MAP kinase kinase kinase MEKK. Once activated, the MAP kinases translocate to the nucleus, where they activate transcription factors (4Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ras regulates cell growth through activation of transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation.The mammalian transcription factor NF-κB is involved in regulating the expression of genes required for inflammatory responses, for suppression of apoptosis, and for controlling cell growth (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a member of the Rel family of transcription factors, which consists of five members, c-Rel, p50 (NF-κB1), p65 (RELA), p52 (NF-κB2), and RELB. The different family members can form homodimers or heterodimers, and different subunit combinations have different functions in regulating transcription (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). The classic NF-κB activator of transcription is a heterodimer composed of a p50 and p65 subunit. This heterodimer is a potent activator of gene expression from κB sites due to the presence of at least two transactivation domains in the C-terminal region of p65 (16Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 17Ruben S.M. Narayanan R. Klement J.F. Chen C.-H. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 444-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids comprise a transactivation domain (TA1) that belongs to the class of acidic activators and can activate transcription from GAL4 binding sites when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain.NF-κB activity is regulated, at least in part, by its subcellular localization. NF-κB is held in the cytoplasm, where it is inactive, through an interaction of the p65 or c-Rel subunits with the inhibitor protein, IκB (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). A variety of extracellular stimuli activate signal transduction pathways that target the NF-κB·IκB complex for disruption (15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). These pathways target IκB for degradation by the proteasome by leading to the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IκB (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB results in the disruption of the NF-κB·IκB complex, allowing NF-κB to be transported into the nucleus, where it can activate gene expression (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). Serine residues 32 and 36 are required for the inducible phosphorylation of IκB through the recently identified IκB kinases (18Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest that NF-κB plays an important role in cellular transformation. NF-κB is activated by a variety of cellular oncogenes including Her2/Neu (23Galang C. Garcia-Ramirez J. Solski P. Westwick J. Der C.J. Neznanov N. Oshima R. Hauser C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and two members of the NF-κB family, v-rel and p52/lyt-10, and the IκB family member Bcl-3 are potentially oncogenic (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments have shown that oncogenic forms of H-Ras and Raf-1 can activate a reporter driven by NF-κB binding sites (24Finco T. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17676-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Importantly, expression of a modified, superrepressor form of IκBα blocked the ability of oncogenic Ras alleles to induce focus formation in 3T3 cells (26Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The requirement of NF-κB for Ras transformation is based partly on the ability of NF-κB to suppress transformation-associated apoptosis (27Mayo M.W. Wang C.-Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was observed that oncogenic Ras activates NF-κB through the ability to stimulate transcriptional function dependent on the transactivation domains of the p65/RelA subunit (26Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We show here that oncogenic Ras activates NF-κB transcriptional activity largely through a Raf-independent mechanism that utilizes a SEK- and p38-dependent pathway. The ability of Raf-1 to activate NF-κB is MEK/ERK-dependent but appears to require an autocrine pathway that ultimately utilizes the same SEK/p38-dependent mechanisms as oncogenic Ras.DISCUSSIONWe have presented evidence, summarized in Fig.7, that oncogenic Ras enhances NF-κB transcriptional activity through a signaling pathway that utilizes the p38 MAP kinase. Ras activates a MAP kinase signaling cascade that most likely includes the small GTP-binding protein Rac and the MEKK, PAK, and MKK4/SEK1 kinases. MKK4/SEK1 can activate both the JNK kinases and p38. However, none of the dominant negative JNK constructs we tested blocked Ras activation of NF-κB, while compounds that blocked p38 blocked Ras activation of NF-κB. Therefore, we conclude that p38 or a closely related kinase and/or the downstream kinases it activates are responsible for oncogenic Ras activation of NF-κB.We have also shown that oncogenic Raf enhances NF-κB transcriptional activity apparently through the same pathway as Ras although by a different initiating mechanism. Raf activation of NF-κB most likely occurs through an autocrine feedback loop, since conditioned medium from Raf-transformed cells activated NF-κB transcriptional activity when added to parental cells. Raf has been shown to induce the expression of hb epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-α, and Raf's ability to activate the SAPKs, to which JNK and p38 belong, is assumed to require the production of these or related factors (31McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We do not know the identity of the autocrine factor that Raf utilizes to activate NF-κB in our system, but it is possible that it is hb epidermal growth factor or transforming growth factor-α. Recent work has shown that oncogenic Raf activates NF-κB in HEK 293 cells through an autocrine loop that activates the SAPKs (39Troppmair J. Hartkamp J. Rapp U. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In that study, blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor, which binds both hb epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-α, inhibited the ability of Raf to activate NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Future studies will address the identity of this factor in our system.The p38 family of MAP kinases consists of four members, p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ (e.g. see Ref. 40Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3663-3671Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These kinases are activated both by stress-inducing signals including osmotic shock and by UV irradiation and inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (11Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Wildmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 13Karin M. Annu. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by many of same stimuli that activate p38, and recent evidence indicates that p38 plays a role in the ability of certain stimuli to activate NF-κB transcriptional activity (e.g. see Ref. 41Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism that p38 uses to activate NF-κB is not understood. For example, we do not know if p38 phosphorylates NF-κB itself or if one of the p38-regulated kinases can phosphorylate NF-κB. Phosphorylation of the p65 NF-κB subunit has been shown to stimulate NF-κB transcriptional function (42Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 43Wang D. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that NF-κB is not the direct target of one of these kinases but that p38 targets a transcriptional coactivator such as CBP to stimulate transcriptional function. Additional studies will be required to determine if p38 acts directly on NF-κB or if it targets other components of the transcription machinery.Ras utilizes multiple signaling components to transform cells. These include Raf, Pak, Rac, and PI3-K (1Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 2Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J.

Based on our data with oncogenic Ras and Raf, the p38 stress-activated kinase pathway appears to control this response. Since NF-κB has been found to be required for the ability of Ras to transform cells (26Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol.

Three MAP kinases have been identified, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPKs), and the p38 kinases. The MAP kinases are activated in response to a wide variety of stimuli including growth factors, cytokines, and cellular stress. The ERKs are primarily responsible for responding to cellular proliferation signals, while JNKs and p38 respond to cellular stress signals (11Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Wildmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Each MAP kinase is regulated by different upstream signaling pathways that consist of similar elements. ERK is activated by a MAP kinase kinase, MEK, which is activated by a MAP kinase kinase kinase, Raf. JNK and p38 are activated by the MAP kinase kinase MKK4/SEK1, which is activated by the MAP kinase kinase kinase MEKK. Once activated, the MAP kinases translocate to the nucleus, where they activate transcription factors (4Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ras regulates cell growth through activation of transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation. The mammalian transcription factor NF-κB is involved in regulating the expression of genes required for inflammatory responses, for suppression of apoptosis, and for controlling cell growth (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a member of the Rel family of transcription factors, which consists of five members, c-Rel, p50 (NF-κB1), p65 (RELA), p52 (NF-κB2), and RELB. The different family members can form homodimers or heterodimers, and different subunit combinations have different functions in regulating transcription (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). The classic NF-κB activator of transcription is a heterodimer composed of a p50 and p65 subunit. This heterodimer is a potent activator of gene expression from κB sites due to the presence of at least two transactivation domains in the C-terminal region of p65 (16Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 17Ruben S.M. Narayanan R. Klement J.F. Chen C.-H. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 444-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids comprise a transactivation domain (TA1) that belongs to the class of acidic activators and can activate transcription from GAL4 binding sites when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. NF-κB activity is regulated, at least in part, by its subcellular localization. NF-κB is held in the cytoplasm, where it is inactive, through an interaction of the p65 or c-Rel subunits with the inhibitor protein, IκB (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). A variety of extracellular stimuli activate signal transduction pathways that target the NF-κB·IκB complex for disruption (15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). These pathways target IκB for degradation by the proteasome by leading to the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IκB (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB results in the disruption of the NF-κB·IκB complex, allowing NF-κB to be transported into the nucleus, where it can activate gene expression (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). Serine residues 32 and 36 are required for the inducible phosphorylation of IκB through the recently identified IκB kinases (18Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that NF-κB plays an important role in cellular transformation. NF-κB is activated by a variety of cellular oncogenes including Her2/Neu (23Galang C. Garcia-Ramirez J. Solski P. Westwick J. Der C.J. Neznanov N. Oshima R. Hauser C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and two members of the NF-κB family, v-rel and p52/lyt-10, and the IκB family member Bcl-3 are potentially oncogenic (14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments have shown that oncogenic forms of H-Ras and Raf-1 can activate a reporter driven by NF-κB binding sites (24Finco T. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17676-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Importantly, expression of a modified, superrepressor form of IκBα blocked the ability of oncogenic Ras alleles to induce focus formation in 3T3 cells (26Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The requirement of NF-κB for Ras transformation is based partly on the ability of NF-κB to suppress transformation-associated apoptosis (27Mayo M.W. Wang C.-Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was observed that oncogenic Ras activates NF-κB through the ability to stimulate transcriptional function dependent on the transactivation domains of the p65/RelA subunit (26Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We show here that oncogenic Ras activates NF-κB transcriptional activity largely through a Raf-independent mechanism that utilizes a SEK- and p38-dependent pathway. The ability of Raf-1 to activate NF-κB is MEK/ERK-dependent but appears to require an autocrine pathway that ultimately utilizes the same SEK/p38-dependent mechanisms as oncogenic Ras. DISCUSSIONWe have presented evidence, summarized in Fig.7, that oncogenic Ras enhances NF-κB transcriptional activity through a signaling pathway that utilizes the p38 MAP kinase. Ras activates a MAP kinase signaling cascade that most likely includes the small GTP-binding protein Rac and the MEKK, PAK, and MKK4/SEK1 kinases. MKK4/SEK1 can activate both the JNK kinases and p38. However, none of the dominant negative JNK constructs we tested blocked Ras activation of NF-κB, while compounds that blocked p38 blocked Ras activation of NF-κB. Therefore, we conclude that p38 or a closely related kinase and/or the downstream kinases it activates are responsible for oncogenic Ras activation of NF-κB.We have also shown that oncogenic Raf enhances NF-κB transcriptional activity apparently through the same pathway as Ras although by a different initiating mechanism. Raf activation of NF-κB most likely occurs through an autocrine feedback loop, since conditioned medium from Raf-transformed cells activated NF-κB transcriptional activity when added to parental cells. Raf has been shown to induce the expression of hb epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-α, and Raf's ability to activate the SAPKs, to which JNK and p38 belong, is assumed to require the production of these or related factors (31McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We do not know the identity of the autocrine factor that Raf utilizes to activate NF-κB in our system, but it is possible that it is hb epidermal growth factor or transforming growth factor-α. Recent work has shown that oncogenic Raf activates NF-κB in HEK 293 cells through an autocrine loop that activates the SAPKs (39Troppmair J. Hartkamp J. Rapp U. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In that study, blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor, which binds both hb epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-α, inhibited the ability of Raf to activate NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Future studies will address the identity of this factor in our system.The p38 family of MAP kinases consists of four members, p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ (e.g. see Ref. 40Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3663-3671Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These kinases are activated both by stress-inducing signals including osmotic shock and by UV irradiation and inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (11Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Wildmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

NF-κB is activated by many of same stimuli that activate p38, and recent evidence indicates that p38 plays a role in the ability of certain stimuli to activate NF-κB transcriptional activity (e.g. see Ref. 41Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism that p38 uses to activate NF-κB is not understood. For example, we do not know if p38 phosphorylates NF-κB itself or if one of the p38-regulated kinases can phosphorylate NF-κB. Phosphorylation of the p65 NF-κB subunit has been shown to stimulate NF-κB transcriptional function (42Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 43Wang D. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that NF-κB is not the direct target of one of these kinases but that p38 targets a transcriptional coactivator such as CBP to stimulate transcriptional function. Additional studies will be required to determine if p38 acts directly on NF-κB or if it targets other components of the transcription machinery.Ras utilizes multiple signaling components to transform cells.

A housekeeping role for iPLA2 in generating lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) acceptors for arachidonic acid incorporation into phosphatidylcholine (PC) has been proposed because iPLA2 inhibition reduces LPC levels and suppresses arachidonate incorporation and phospholipid remodeling in P388D1 cells. Because islet β-cell phospholipids are enriched in arachidonate, we have examined the role of iPLA2 in arachidonate incorporation into islets and INS-1 insulinoma cells. Inhibition of iPLA2 with a bromoenol lactone (BEL) suicide substrate did not suppress and generally enhanced [3H]arachidonate incorporation into these cells in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium at varied time points and BEL concentrations. Arachidonate incorporation into islet phospholipids involved deacylation-reacylation and not de novo synthesis, as indicated by experiments with varied extracellular glucose concentrations and by examining [14C]glucose incorporation into phospholipids. BEL also inhibited islet cytosolic phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAPH), but the PAPH inhibitor propranolol did not affect arachidonate incorporation into islet or INS-1 cell phospholipids. Inhibition of islet iPLA2 did not alter the phospholipid head-group classes into which [3H]arachidonate was initially incorporated or its subsequent transfer from PC to other lipids. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric measurements indicated that inhibition of INS-1 cell iPLA2 accelerated arachidonate incorporation into PC and that inhibition of islet iPLA2 reduced LPC levels by 25%, suggesting that LPC mass does not limit arachidonate incorporation into islet PC. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry measurements indicated that BEL but not propranolol suppressed insulin secretagogue-induced hydrolysis of arachidonate from islet phospholipids. In islets and INS-1 cells, iPLA2 is thus not required for arachidonate incorporation or phospholipid remodeling and may play other roles in these cells.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric measurements indicated that inhibition of INS-1 cell iPLA2 accelerated arachidonate incorporation into PC and that inhibition of islet iPLA2 reduced LPC levels by 25%, suggesting that LPC mass does not limit arachidonate incorporation into islet PC. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry measurements indicated that BEL but not propranolol suppressed insulin secretagogue-induced hydrolysis of arachidonate from islet phospholipids. In islets and INS-1 cells, iPLA2 is thus not required for arachidonate incorporation or phospholipid remodeling and may play other roles in these cells.

In many cells, nonesterified arachidonate imported from the extracellular space or released intracellularly by PLA2enzymes is quickly converted to arachidonoyl-CoA in an ATP-dependent step and then rapidly incorporated into phospholipids by acyltransferases (35Hill E.E.

Arachidonate represents 30–36% of the total esterified fatty acyl mass in phospholipids of normal rat and human islets and isolated beta cells (37Ramanadham S. Bohrer A. Mueller M. Jett P. Gross R.

Fusion of secretory granule and plasma membranes is the final event in insulin exocytosis, and the high content of certain arachidonate-containing phospholipids in those membranes may facilitate their fusion (39Ramanadham S.

To examine the generality of these phenomena, we performed similar experiments with islets. Control islets exhibited PLA2activity in the absence of Ca2+ that was stimulated by ATP, and activity was 98% inhibited in 25 μm BEL-treated islets (Fig. 1, left panel), consistent with properties of recombinant iPLA2 expressed from cDNA cloned from an islet library (10Ma Z.

Despite effective iPLA2 inhibition, no suppression of [3H]arachidonic acid incorporation into phospholipids was observed in BEL-treated islets during 10-min incubations in Ca2+-replete medium, in Ca2+-free EGTA-containing medium, or in islets that had been loaded with the intracellular Ca2+-chelator BAPTA-AM and incubated in Ca2+-free EGTA-containing medium (Fig. 1, center panel).

This indicates that [3H]arachidonic acid incorporation into islet phospholipids is not completely Ca2+-independent. Incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into islet phospholipids (Fig. 1, right panel) exhibited features similar to those for [3H]arachidonic acid, and incorporation of both fatty acids was generally higher in BEL-treated than control islets. This effect was observed at all incubation times between 10 and 60 min (Fig. 2), and no suppression of [3H]arachidonic acid incorporation into islet phospholipids was observed at any BEL concentration that reduced islet iPLA2 activity (Fig.3). Incorporation of both fatty acids into human islet phospholipids was affected by BEL and by manipulating Ca2+ in ways similar to those with rat islets (not shown).Figure 2Time course of incorporation of [3]arachidonic acid or [3]palmitic acid into islet phospholipids.

https://openalex.org/W2050666671,"Macrophage-mediated oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is considered to be of major importance in early atherogenesis; therefore, intervention means to inhibit this process are being extensively studied. In the present study, we questioned the ability of the isoflavan glabridin (from licorice) to accumulate in macrophages and to affect cell-mediated oxidation of LDL. We first performed in vitro studies, using mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) and the J-774 A.1 macrophage-like cell line. Both cells accumulated up to 1.5 μg of glabridin/mg of cell protein after 2 h of incubation, and this process was time- and glabridin dose-dependent. In parallel, in glabridin-enriched cells, macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL was inhibited by up to 80% in comparison with control cells. Glabridin inhibited superoxide release from MPMs in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or to LDL when added together with copper ions, by up to 60%. Translocation of P-47, a cytosolic component of NADPH oxidase to the plasma membrane was substantially inhibited. In glabridin-enriched macrophages, protein kinase C activity reduced by ∼70%. All of the above effects of glabridin required the presence of the two hydroxyl groups on the flavonoid's B phenol ring. In order to assess the physiological significance of these results, we next performed in vivostudies, using the atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-deficient (E0) mice. MPMs harvested from glabridin-treated E0 mice (20 μg/mouse/day for a period of 6 weeks) demonstrated reduced capability to oxidize LDL by 80% in comparison with placebo-treated mice. This latter phenomenon was associated with a reduction in the lesion oxysterols and a 50% reduction in the aortic lesion size.We thus conclude that glabridin accumulation in macrophages is associated with reduced cell-mediated oxidation of LDL and decreased activation of the NADPH oxidase system. These phenomena could be responsible for the attenuation of atherosclerosis in E0mice, induced by glabridin.

Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds naturally present in fruits and vegetables and are an integral part of the human diet (5Pierpoint W.F. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1986; 213: 125-140PubMed Google Scholar). Consumption of flavonoids in the diet was shown to be inversely associated with morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease (6Hertog M.G.L.

We have recently shown that dietary supplementation of healthy human volunteers with flavonoid-rich nutrients such as olive oil, red wine, or licorice root, resulted in a reduction in LDL oxidizability (10Aviram M.

Furthermore, consumption of red wine or its flavonol quercetin or of licorice extract by atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-deficient (E0) mice resulted in a significant reduction in the development of atherosclerotic lesions, along with a reduction in their LDL oxidation (12Fuhrman B.

We have also demonstrated that the isoflavan glabridin binds to the LDL particle and substantially inhibits its oxidation (12Fuhrman B. Buch S. Vaya J. Belinky P.A. Coleman R. Hayek T. Aviram M. Am.

Aviram M. Mahmood S. Vaya J. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vivo, antioxidants can bind to, and accumulate in, cells, including arterial wall macrophages. Macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL is considered to be of major importance during early atherogenesis, and the formation of oxidized LDL can then induce cellular cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation (17Berliner J.A.

Macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL is affected by the balance between cellular oxygenases (18Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1992; 3: 313-317Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Aviram M. Rosenblat M. Etzioni A. Levy R.

We have shown activation of the macrophage NADPH oxidase following binding of LDL to its receptor under oxidative stress (21Aviram M. Rosenblat M. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 385-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to LDL oxidation. Recently, this enzyme was shown to be also present in the arterial wall adventitia (22Pagano P.J.

Several studies have shown that flavonoids attenuate cell-mediated oxidation of LDL when added to the extracellular medium (23Nardini M. D'Aquino M. Tomassi G. Gentili U. Di Felice M. Scaccini C.

Under these conditions, it is not clear whether the antioxidants exert their effect within the lipoprotein particle, in the medium, or at the cellular level. Only few studies examined the capability of macrophages enriched with vitamin E to oxidize LDL (27Suzukawa M. Abbey M. Clifton P. Nestel P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 110: 77-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Baoutina A. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid. Res. 1998; 39: 114-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one study, it has been reported that loading J-774 A.1 macrophages with high concentrations of vitamin E can protect LDL against macrophage-mediated oxidation (27Suzukawa M. Abbey M. Clifton P. Nestel P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 110: 77-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In another study, when MPMs or human monocytes were incubated with vitamin E at a more physiological concentration, no effect on cell-mediated oxidation of LDL was obtained (28Baoutina A. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid. Res. 1998; 39: 114-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Since some of these enzymes are involved in macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL, the present study analyzed the effect (and mechanisms) of macrophage enrichment with the isoflavan glabridin on the capability of these cells to oxidize LDL. EGTA, ATP, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, cytochromec from horse heart, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), FAD, β-NADPH, superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes, SDS, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), calphostin C, staurosporine, andN-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride were all purchased from Sigma. The J-774 A.1 murine macrophage-like cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The macrophages were plated at 1 × 106 cells/35-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The cells were fed every 3 days (36Aviram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 218-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) were harvested from the peritoneal fluid 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 3 ml of thioglycolate in saline (24 g/mouse) (37Aviram M. Williams K.J. McIntosh R.A. Carpentier Y.A. Tall A.R. Deckelbaum R.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 67-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells (10–20 × 106/mouse) were washed and centrifuged three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 1000 × g for 10 min. Then the cells were resuspended to 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum (heat-inactivated at 56 °C of 30 min), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmof glutamine. The cell suspension was dispensed into 35-mm plastic Petri dishes and incubated in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) for 2 h. The dishes were washed once with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove nonadherent cells, and the monolayer was further incubated under similar conditions for 18 h prior to the beginning of the experiment. In some experiments, lactic dehydrogenase release to the incubation medium was measured in order to determine cell viability. Lactic dehydrogenase release into the medium was quantitated over time by spectrophotometric measurement of the consumption of NADH, using a commercially available kit (Merck LDH, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Membrane and cytosol fractions were prepared as described previously (38Nunoi H. Rotrosen D. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Science. 1988; 242: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended at 108 cells/ml in relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 100 μmleupeptin at 4 °C, following sonication for 3 × 10 s, resulting in about 95% of cell breakage. Nuclei, granules, and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (2 min, 15,600 ×g), and the postnuclear supernatant was made in 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4and 5 mm NaF. The supernatant was centrifuged in a Beckman Airfuge (30 min, 134,000 × g) to obtain a cell membrane pellet and a cytosolic supernatant. Membranes were suspended at 109 cell equivalents/ml in 0.34 msucrose/half-strength relaxation buffer containing 1 mmdithiothreitol. Solubilized membrane and cytosolic fractions were stored at −70 °C. Plasma LDL was derived from fasted normolipidemic volunteers. LDL was prepared by discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (39Aviram M. Biochem. Med. 1983; 30: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The lipoprotein was washed atd = 1.063 g/ml and dialyzed against 150 mmNaCI, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. LDL was then sterilized by filtration (0.45 μm), kept at 3–6 mg of protein/ml under nitrogen in the dark at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks. Prior to the oxidation studies, LDL was dialyzed against PBS, EDTA-free solution, pH 7.4, under nitrogen at 4 °C. The lipoprotein was found to be free of lipopolysaccaride contamination as analyzed by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (Associated of Cape Cod Inc., Woods Hole, MA). The LDL used for all experiments was from different batches. The variation in LDL oxidizability among batches did not exceeded 10%. Cells (1 × 106/35-mm dish) were incubated with LDL (100 μg of protein/ml) in Ham's F-10 medium in the presence of 2 μm CuSO4. LDL was also incubated under similar conditions in the absence of cells. The extent of LDL oxidation was measured directly in the medium (after centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min), by the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assay, using malondialdehyde for the standard curve preparation (40Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10519) Google Scholar). Macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL was calculated by subtraction of the oxidation rate in the absence of cells from that obtained in the presence of macrophages. Glabridin was isolated from the acetone extract of the roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra (the licorice plant) and purified on silica gel column chromatography (14Vaya J. Belinky P.A. Aviram M. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Glabridin (100 mg, 0.31 mmol) was dissolved in acetone (4 ml) in a round bottom flask, and methyl iodide (240 μl, 2.64 mmol) and K2CO3(384 mg, 2.76 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was heated to 50 °C with stirring and, after 8 h, was filtered, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column, using CH2Cl2/hexane (4:1, v/v) and then CH2Cl2 alone as eluents, to afford 2′,4′-O-dimethylglabridin (70.6 mg, 65% yield), which was identified as described before (16Belinky P.A. Aviram M. Mahmood S. Vaya J. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). No attempt was made to optimize the yield. The purity of the isolated and synthesized compounds used in this study was above 98%, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using RP-18 column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; 25-cm length, 0.4-cm diameter, 5-μm particle size). The analysis was performed by detecting the absorbance of the compounds at 230 nm, using acetonitrile/water as eluents (16Belinky P.A. Aviram M. Mahmood S. Vaya J. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Glabridin and 2′,4′-O-dimethylglabridin were dissolved in 100% ethanol to stock solutions of 10 mm. Glabridin and 2′,4′-O-dimethylglabridin were incubated with the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. The ethanol concentration added to the cells did not exceed 0.2%. At the end of the incubation period, all preparation steps were performed at 4 °C. The macrophages were washed three times with PBS, and then the cells were scraped from the dish into 1 ml of PBS, followed by sonication twice for 20 s each time at 80 watts. Cellular protein content was determined using the method of Lowry et al.(41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glabridin and 2′,4′-O-dimethylglabridin were extracted from the sonicat with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v). The upper hexane phase from triplicate samples was collected and dried under nitrogen. The amounts of glabridin and 2′,4′-O-dimethylglabridin in the dried samples were analyzed by HPLC using the appropriate standards (16Belinky P.A. Aviram M. Mahmood S. Vaya J. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The production of the superoxide anion (O⨪2) by mouse peritoneal macrophages was measured as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of acetyl ferricytochrome C by the microtiter plate technique as described previously (42Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto L.T. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 105/well) were suspended in 100 μl of Hanks' balanced salts solution containing acetyl ferricytochrome c (150 μm). Superoxide production by the cells was stimulated by the addition of PMA (50 ng/ml) or LDL (100 μg of protein/ml) in the presence of 2 μm CuSO4. The reduction of acetyl ferricytochrome c was followed by the change in absorbance at 550 nm between 2- and 5-min intervals on a Thermomax Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The maximal rates of superoxide generation were determined and expressed as nmol of superoxides/106 cells/10 min using the extinction coefficient of E 550 = 21 mmol/liter−1 cm−1. Superoxide generation was measured as described previously (43Levy R. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3066-3071PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes and cytosol were prepared from control MPM or from MPM that were incubated for 2 h with 20 μm of glabridin. Membranes were solubilized in a buffer containing sodium deoxycholate (1.16%), glycerol (50%), NaN3 (1 mm), CaCl2 (1.2 mm), and sodium glycine (20 mm), pH 7.0. The final concentration of solubilized membranes was adjusted to 4 × 108 cell equivalents/ml. 0.5 μl of the membrane solution (2 × 105 cell equivalents) and 10 μl of cytosol (2 × 105 cell equivalents), at a final volume of 100 μl of reaction mixture, were added to wells of a chilled microtiter plate. The reaction solution contained the following: acetyl ferricytochrome c (150 μm), MgCl2(4 mm), FAD (10 μm), EGTA (1 mm), NADPH (200 μm), and SDS (100 μm) in 75 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Control wells also contained superoxide dismutase (2.5 mg). The reaction was monitored at 22 °C. Light absorbance at 550 nm was determined at 2-min intervals. Immunoblot detection of cytosolic NADPH oxidase components was performed as described (42Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto L.T. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were solubilized in 2× sample buffer (12% SDS, 8 m urea, 250 mm Tris base, 8 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.9). The amount of protein in each sample was quantified by the Pierce BCA protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cytosols or membranes were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, which was stained with Fast Green to detect protein banding, and then blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline, 0.01% gelatin containing goat antiserum to P-47 diluted 1:200 (a generous gift of Dr. Leto, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Immunoblots were incubated with 1 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat serum (Sigma) and developed by the ECL method. The activities of protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A were measured in the cytosolic or membrane fractions obtained from control and from glabridin-enriched macrophages using the MESACUP protein kinase assay kit, (PanVera Corp.). Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were generously provided to us by Dr. Jan Breslow (Rockefeller University, New York). Gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells was used to create these mice that lack apolipoprotein E (44Plump A.S. Smith J. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). The mice (15 mice in each group) were fed with glabridin or 2′,4′-O-dimethylglabridin in their drinking water (20 μg/day/mouse). At the end of glabridin feeding, MPM were harvested from the peritoneal fluid (after thioglycolate injection) for analyses of cellular glabridin content and MPM-mediated oxidation of LDL. Then the mice were sacrificed, and their hearts and entire aortas were dissected and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 msodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.01% calcium chloride. Following overnight fixation, the aortic arch was dissected free from the surrounding fatty tissue under a binocular stereomicroscope, and the first 4 mm of the ascending aorta (beginning with the aortic valves) was removed and cut transversely with razor blades into four blocks of approximately 1 mm each. The samples were then rinsed and stored in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer containing 7.5% (w/v) sucrose prior to treatment with an unbuffered 1% aqueous solution of osmium tetroxide for 2 h. This was followed by a cacodylate rinse and dehydration in ascending ethanols, prior to propylene oxide and embedding in epoxy resin (Eponate 12; Pelco International, Redding, CA). The blocks were orientated so that transverse sections of the aorta could be cut. After heat polymerization (18 h) at 60 °C, the blocks were trimmed, and 1-μm transverse sections cut with glass or diamond knives on an LKB Nova ultramicrotome (LKB, Bromma, Sweden). The sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1% borax (sodium tetraborate). In these toluidine blue-stained sections, the lipid deposits appear a green color and are easily visualized in the sections. When sufficient semithin sections were sampled from all of the blocks, the remainder of the blocks were then cut into much thicker sections (150–200 μm) for more macroscopic observation. The lipid content of the lesions of these thicker sections was stained in intense black from the prolonged osmium treatment and permitted lesion areas to be easily determined histomorphometrically. Only the area of the aortic arch was examined as previous and on-going studies by us and other groups have shown that this area is especially prone to atherosclerosis in the ApoE gene knockout mice, and the area is well defined with a clear starting point (aortic valves). Histomorphometric determinations of lesion size were performed using an Olympus Cue-2 image analysis system with appropriate morphometry software (Olympus Corp., Lake Success, NY). The system consists of a Zeiss Universal R photomicroscope (× 10 objective) fitted with a Panasonic WV-CD50 camera with the video image seen on a Sony 14-inch color monitor and an IBM-compatible PC. Measurements were made in standardized “windows” (fields) with an area of 176,758 μm2. Oxysterols were extracted from the aortas derived from the mice after their homogenization, by diethyl ether (3:1, v/v). The amount of total oxysterols (esterified and unesterified) was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, using the appropriate standards (15Belinky P.A. Aviram M. Fuhrman B. Rosenblat M. Vaya J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137: 49-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Student's t test was used to analyze the significance of the results in all comparisons of treatedversus untreated cells. Results are given as means ± S.D. We have recently shown that the licorice-derived isoflavan glabridin binds to LDL and substantially inhibits the oxidation of the lipoprotein, secondary to its ability to scavenge free radicals (12Fuhrman B.

Consumption of flavonoids can affect LDL oxidation not only by a direct interaction of the flavonoids with the lipoprotein, but also secondary to their accumulation in cells such as arterial wall macrophages. In the present study, we analyzed the macrophage capability to take up glabridin and studied the mechanisms by which cellular accumulation of glabridin can affect macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL. Upon incubation of macrophages (J-774 A.1 cell line or MPMs) with glabridin (20 μm) for 20 h at 37 °C, cellular glabridin content increased from 0 to 1.8 ± 0.2 μg of glabridin/mg of cell protein (n = 3). Incubation of MPMs or J-774 A.1 macrophages with LDL in the presence of 2 μm CuSO4 for 5 h at 37 °C resulted in a 90% or 82% inhibition of LDL oxidation, respectively, by the glabridin-enriched macrophages in comparison with the control cells (Table I). Extension of the oxidation period up to 20 h resulted in only 65% and 48% inhibition of LDL oxidation by glabridin-enriched MPMs and J-774 A.1 cells, respectively, in comparison with the control cells (Table I).Table IThe effect of macrophage enrichment with glabridin on cell-mediated oxidation of LDL: time study of LDL incubation with macrophagesCell-mediated oxidation of LDLJ-774A.1MPM5 h20 h5"
https://openalex.org/W2003355291,"The ability of the p53 tumor suppressor to induce cell cycle arrest and cell death is closely regulated under normal conditions. The transcriptional activity of p53 is negatively controlled by murine double minute (MDM2). p53 requires the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), or its structural homolog, p300, to stimulate transcription of responsive genes. Here we find that the transactivation domain of p53 selectively interacts with the N- and C-terminal regions of CBP/p300. A mutant CBP lacking the N terminus failed to stimulate p53-dependent transactivation. In both p53 null Saos2 cells, and in UV-irradiated MCF7 cells, we observed that MDM2 associates with the N-terminal region of CBP/p300. Because p53 interacts with both MDM2 and CBP/p300 through its trans-activation domain, we examined the role of MDM2 in p53-coactivator interactions. MDM2 blocked CBP/p300 recruitment in vitro and inhibited the interaction of the transactivating region of p53 with both the N- or C-terminal regions of CBP/p300 in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. These observations suggest that MDM2 may be inhibiting p53 trans-activation by shielding its activation domain from the coactivators, a new mechanism for the inhibition of p53-dependent gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1994561051,"It has previously been established that sequences at the C termini of polypeptide substrates are critical for efficient hydrolysis by the ClpP/ClpX ATP-dependent protease. We report for the bacteriophage λ O replication protein, however, that N-terminal sequences play the most critical role in facilitating proteolysis by ClpP/ClpX. The N-terminal portion of λ O is degraded at a rate comparable with that of wild type O protein, whereas the C-terminal domain of O is hydrolyzed at least 10-fold more slowly. Consistent with these results, deletion of the first 18 amino acids of λ O blocks degradation of the N-terminal domain, whereas proteolysis of the O C-terminal domain is only slightly diminished as a result of deletion of the C-terminal 15 amino acids. We demonstrate that ClpX retains its capacity to bind to the N-terminal domain following removal of the first 18 amino acids of O. However, ClpX cannot efficiently promote the ATP-dependent binding of this truncated O polypeptide to ClpP, the catalytic subunit of the ClpP/ClpX protease. Based on our results with λ O protein, we suggest that two distinct structural elements may be required in substrate polypeptides to enable efficient hydrolysis by the ClpP/ClpX protease: (i) a ClpX-binding site, which may be located remotely from substrate termini, and (ii) a proper N- or C-terminal sequence, whose exposure on the substrate surface may be induced by the binding of ClpX.

The Hsp100 family of protein ATPases was originally identified inEscherichia coli through the roles of individual ATPases as regulatory components of certain ATP-dependent serine proteases, such as ClpP (for reviews see Refs. 1Gottesman S.

For example, the ClpA and ClpX family members were isolated as factors that enabled the ClpP catalytic component to hydrolyze certain polypeptide substrates in an ATP-dependent manner (4Hwang B.J.

This suggests that interactions between ClpA and ClpP, promoted by nucleotide binding to ClpA, bring about an activation of proteolysis by ClpP. Nevertheless, for both the ClpP/ClpA (9Thompson M.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proteases, ATP hydrolysis per se is required to achieve processive degradation of larger polypeptides.Hsp104, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of E. coli ClpB, has been shown to be essential for cellular thermotolerance (10Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of the molecular chaperone Hsp70 largely reverses the temperature sensitivity exhibited by the hsp104 mutant (11Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzel J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These and other findings support the idea that members of the Clp family of ATPases can perform certain chaperone functions in the absence of their partner protease subunit (12Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been confirmed by recent experimental findings, namely: (i) that Hsp104 participates in the disaggregation of partially damaged or aggregated protein structures (13Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 14Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), (ii) that bacterial ClpA protein substitutes in vitro for the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone machine in activation of the phage P1 RepA replication protein for binding to its recognition sites in the P1 replication origin (16Wickner S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and promotes the binding of the RK2 plasmid-encoded TrfA protein to theoriRK2 sequence (19Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Yet perhaps the most convincing evidence for the notion that Clp ATPases have intrinsic chaperone activity comes from investigations of the bacteriophage Mu DNA replication system. Initially it was discovered that deletion of theE. coli clpX gene (but not the clpP gene) resulted in a total inactivation of Mu DNA replication in vivo (20Mhammedi-Alaoui A. Pato M. Gama M.-J. Toussaint A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Later, studies of the mechanism of Mu DNA replication in a reconstituted multiprotein system showed that ClpX acts at a step prior to initiation of DNA replication to promote the disassembly of an extremely stable MuA transposase nucleoprotein complex (21Levchenko I. Luo L. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 22Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 459-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is suggested that ClpX-mediated release of MuA transposase from a transposition intermediate triggers initiation of Mu DNA replication by providing access of host replication proteins to Mu DNA ends (24Nakai H. Kruklitis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19591-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Both the protease and chaperone activities of the Clp ATPases depend on ATP hydrolysis. In the presence of ATP, the ClpA or Hsp104 proteins individually oligomerize to give rise to a hexameric, ring-like structure (25Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29537-29545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Seol J.H. Woo K.M. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies have shown that ClpA or ClpX rings bind to the 7-fold symmetric ClpP component, which itself is arranged in a barrel-like double-ring structure. These interactions produce an overall structure that highly resembles the eukaryotic 26 S proteosome (28Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol.

For example, ClpX is known to recognize the λ O (6Wojtkowiak D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gottesman S.

A. 1996; 93: 10291-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) proteins, each of which seemingly exists in a native, properly folded state. These findings support the hypothesis that the Clp ATPases are specificity factors that are capable of recruiting different protein substrates and, subsequently, transferring them to the ClpP subunit for proteolysis (6Wojtkowiak D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is still not certain which sequences or protein structures in substrate proteins are recognized by the Clp/Hsp100 family (2Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Zylicz M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). For several protein substrates,e.g. MuA transposase (36Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), mutants of bacteriophage Mu repressor (32Laachouch J.E. Desmet L. Geuskens V. Grimaud R. Toussaint A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), or SsrA-tagged polypeptides (37Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), it has been shown that C-terminal sequences are primarily responsible for their targeting to the ClpP/ClpX protease. Recently, the presence of PDZ-like domains has been detected in ClpX and other Clp/Hsp100 family members. These structural motifs have been suggested to mediate the binding specificity of these proteins to different protein substrates (36Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was postulated that the initiating event during substrate selection by ClpX is the formation of a complex between ClpX and exposed C-terminal residues of a substrate protein (36Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).We decided to test the universality of this proposed mechanism using wild type and deletion mutant forms of the λ O replication initiator protein. Wild type O protein, a highly effective substrate of the ClpP/ClpX protease, is composed of N- and C-terminal structural domains, which are connected by a relatively unstructured linker region (38Um S.-J. Characterization of the Interaction of the Bacteriophage λ O Initiator Protein with the Viral Replication Origin.Ph.D. Dissertation. Johns Hopkins University, 1993Google Scholar). Contrary to published results with MuA transposase, mutants of Mu repressor, and SsrA-tagged polypeptide substrates, which demonstrated the importance of C-terminal sequences for hydrolysis by the ClpP/ClpX protease, we provide evidence that it is the N-terminal portion of the λ O replication protein that is primarily required for its efficient hydrolysis by this ATP-dependent protease. In addition, we also demonstrate that stable binding of substrate polypeptides to ClpX is not sufficient to ensure proteolysis by ClpP/ClpX. We suggest that in addition to a ClpX-binding site, special N-terminal or C-terminal sequences must be present in the ClpP/ClpX substrate polypeptide.DISCUSSIONIn a recent publication, Levchenko et al. (36Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggested that the ClpX protein recognizes specific sequences located at or near the C terminus of its substrate proteins. Their results indicated that such sequences may be displayed in a relatively disordered conformation. Experiments performed on MuA transposase, selected mutants of Mu repressor, and SsrA-tagged protein have implicated C-terminal residues of the substrate, mainly nonpolar amino acids, as being absolutely essential for ClpX recognition. As pointed out by Levchenko et al. (36Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a second group of ClpX substrates is composed of proteins that contain predominantly polar amino acids near the C terminus, with arginine at the terminal position. In this respect, the λ O replication protein, whose 10 C-terminal residues (residues 290–299) are -NTDWIYGVDL, apparently does not fit neatly into either of the known categories of ClpX substrates.In this report, we present evidence that certain of the predictions for the first class of ClpX substrates) made by Levchenko et al.(36Levchenko I.

Specifically, we showed that the N-terminal portion of λ O is more efficiently hydrolyzed by the ClpP/ClpX protease than is the O C-terminal region. The following experimental results support this conclusion: (i) the wild type λ O protein, O(1–299), is a much better substrate for ClpP/ClpX than either the O(19–299) or O(150–299) deletion mutant proteins, even though all three polypeptides share the same C-terminal sequence; (ii) three O deletion mutant proteins, O(1–162), O(1–139), and O(1–110), that each harbor a seemingly folded N-terminal domain, are rapidly hydrolyzed by ClpP/ClpX with kinetics similar to those for wild type λ O protein; (iii) the further removal of the first N-terminal 18 amino acids from λ O(1–110) or λ O(1–139) converts each to a form that is largely resistant to ClpP/ClpX-mediated proteolysis; (iv) the deletion of the first 18 amino acids at the N terminus of wild type λ O(1–299) results in a partial stabilization of this protein against hydrolysis by the ClpP/ClpX protease; and (v) deletion of the 15 C-terminal residues of O(150–299) causes only a slight reduction in the rate of proteolysis by ClpP/ClpX.This study also revealed that for most O deletion mutant proteins there is a close correlation between their relative affinity for ClpX and their rate of hydrolysis by the ClpP/ClpX protease. However, neither O(19–139) nor O(19–110) obeys this correlation. Both bind ClpX with moderate affinity, yet are nearly completely resistant to ClpP/ClpX-mediated proteolysis. We infer, therefore, that binding of ClpX to a potential substrate polypeptide is not sufficient to ensure hydrolysis of the polypeptide by the ATP-dependent ClpP/ClpX protease.Although the N-terminal region of λ O plays the primary role in substrate recognition by ClpX, our investigations indicate that the C-terminal domain of O retains some sensitivity to the ClpP/ClpX protease. This finding suggests that a weaker ClpX recognition site(s) is located within the C-terminal region of the λ O polypeptide. Interestingly, O(19–299) and O(150–299), which possess different N-terminal sequences but identical C-terminal portions, are hydrolyzed by ClpP/ClpX protease with similar kinetics. This may imply, when the 18 amino acids at the N terminus are absent, that the C-terminal domain of λ O determines the rate of ClpP/ClpX-dependent proteolysis.It is likely that relatively weak ClpX-binding sites are exposed on the surface of certain protein substrates of the ClpP/ClpX protease. In this regard, it is important to stress that such ClpX substrates as MuA transposase and Phd are hydrolyzed by the ClpP/ClpX protease much less efficiently than λ O. 2H. Nakai, personal communication, 3M. Yarmolinsky, personal communication.These ClpX substrates are hydrolyzed at rates roughly comparable with or even lower than that of the λ O(150–299). Thus, it is certainly possible that some proteins recognized by ClpX may possess multiple sequences or structural elements with varying degrees of affinity for ClpX.Our results show that it is possible to identify proteins that bind to ClpX but are not hydrolyzed by the ClpP/ClpX protease. This implies that certain protein substrates that are hydrolyzed by the ClpP/ClpX protease, such as λ O, possess at least two structural elements that define its vulnerability to the protease. One element is presumably a ClpX recognition motif, whereas the other element apparently is composed, at least in part, of a specific sequence at the N terminus or C terminus of the polypeptide. The latter sequence may play a role in efficient delivery of a ClpX-bound polypeptide to the active site of the ClpP protease, perhaps by enabling efficient unfolding of the substrate. As shown in this paper, one of the ClpX recognition sites in λ O is located internally, somewhere within the 19–110-amino acid fragment of O. The demonstration that ClpX recognition sites are not necessarily located at polypeptide termini agrees with a previous genetic analysis of the stationary phase sigma factor (ςs), a study concluding that ClpX recognizes an internal amino acid sequence in this substrate protein (33Schweder T. Lee K.H. Lomovskaya O. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Regardless of which portion of a protein is primarily recognized by ClpX, it is likely that the final outcome, in term of proteolysis, will depend not only on the presence of an intrinsic high affinity ClpX recognition sequence but also on the availability of a special C- or N-terminal sequence to make contact with ClpX and/or ClpP during delivery of the substrate polypeptide to the ClpP catalytic subunit. This precise situation was encountered previously by Laachouch et al. (32Laachouch J.E. Desmet L. Geuskens V. Grimaud R. Toussaint A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They fused the C-terminal 7 amino acids of the ClpX-sensitive Mu repressor vir3061 protein to the C termini of CcdA and CcdB proteins encoded by plasmid F. Fusion of this sequence to CcdB did not endow a sensitivity to ClpP/ClpX, whereas fusion of the same sequence to CcdA did engender a partial sensitivity to this ATP-dependent protease.It was proposed previously that ClpX could participate in regulatory mechanisms that “decide” whether a particular protein substrate is either repaired or destroyed (1Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 465-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 2Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Zylicz M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This decision could be based on the affinity of ClpX for the various sites present on a given protein substrate as well as on the accessibility of appropriate C- or N-terminal amino acid sequences. The results presented here suggest at least three possible outcomes for proteins that have ClpX recognition sites. First, it is possible to find polypeptides (such as O(19–139)) that bind to ClpX but are resistant to hydrolysis by the ClpP/ClpX protease. In such cases, ClpX is restricted to act only as a molecular chaperone. Second, if the protein instead also contains an exposed C- or N-terminal sequence that aids ClpX binding and/or function (such as λ O and O(1–139)), then such polypeptides may be immediately targeted to ClpP and hydrolyzed. Third, a native protein could contain both a ClpX-binding site(s), located distantly from polypeptide termini, as well as a “proper” C- or N-terminal sequence for ClpX that is not exposed on the surface of the protein. In this situation, ClpX action would be restricted to binding, but such binding events may in turn result in partial unfolding of the substrate protein. In the event that the special C- or N-terminal sequence of the substrate polypeptide is still not accessible once all ClpX-induced structural rearrangements have been completed, the substrate could dissociate from ClpX and have an opportunity to refold. Repeated cycles of ClpX binding, followed by substrate unfolding, dissociation, and refolding could result in the repair of a partially denatured protein substrate. Thus, ClpX would act as a molecular chaperone in this instance. On the other hand, if the initial binding of ClpX and unfolding of the substrate results in the formation of a stable complex between ClpX and the special sequence at the N or C terminus, then the refolding reaction may be largely precluded. In this case, ClpX would rapidly act to “deliver” the partially unfolded protein substrate to the ClpP protease for degradation.The extreme lability of the O protein in vivo was first reported 25 years ago (47Wyatt W.W. Inokuchi H. Virology. 1974; 58: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Later reports demonstrated that the O protein has a chemical half-life of just 1.5 min in λ-infected cells (48Lipinska B. Podhajska A. Taylor K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1998; 95: 15259-15263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), stabilized against proteolytic attack, it is likely that the studies reported here will provide useful insights into the O turnover process in vivo. For example, the rapid degradation of free intracellular O protein suggests that the various ClpX recognition motifs in O identified in the present study are freely accessible to ClpX in vivo. In contrast, the resistance of O protein assembled atoriλ (the O-some) to ClpX/ClpP attack makes it likely that one or more of the ClpX recognition motifs in the O-some nucleoprotein structure are inaccessible to ClpX. It is also conceivable that protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions within the O-some stabilize O protein against a critical ClpX-mediated unfolding step that is required for initiation of proteolysis. The Hsp100 family of protein ATPases was originally identified inEscherichia coli through the roles of individual ATPases as regulatory components of certain ATP-dependent serine proteases, such as ClpP (for reviews see Refs. 1Gottesman S.

Kanda K. Kakiuchi R. Sobue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), binds to the modulatory region of the IP3R in a Ca2+-dependent way (7Maeda N.

The findings that calmodulin inhibited IP3-induced Ca2+ release in a medium containing 0.2 μm free Ca2+ and in addition inhibited [3H]IP3 binding both in the absence and presence of cytosolic Ca2+ led to the proposal that the Ca2+-independent binding of calmodulin was responsible for the regulation of the IP3R (9Patel S.

Although the free cytosolic [Ca2+] is a very important regulator of the IP3R (2Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 3Finch E.A. Turner T.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18776-18782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there are no functional data showing how calmodulin modulates the Ca2+ release induced by IP3 at various Ca2+ concentrations. We have therefore studied how Ca2+ interferes with the effects of calmodulin on the IP3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized A7r5 cells. All experiments were performed in the absence of Mg-ATP to avoid activation of the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CaMKII that was reported to stimulate the IP3R (12Zhang B.X. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10997-11001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that calmodulin inhibited the IP3-induced Ca2+release if the free cytosolic [Ca2+] was 0.3 μm or higher. This inhibition occurred with an IC50 of 4.6 μm and was particularly pronounced at low IP3 concentrations. Calmodulin did not affect the IP3-induced Ca2+ release at lower Ca2+ concentrations. The effects of Ca2+ could be mimicked by Sr2+. We conclude that cytosolic Ca2+ or Sr2+ are absolutely required for the calmodulin-induced inhibition of the IP3-induced Ca2+ release. As a consequence, the bell-shaped Ca2+ activation curve of the IP3R becomes narrower in the presence of calmodulin. 45Ca2+ fluxes were performed on saponin-permeabilized A7r5 cells from embryonic rat aorta (13Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Nature. 1992; 357: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The nonmitochondrial Ca2+ stores were loaded for 50 min in 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.44 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaN3, and 150 nm free Ca2+ (23 μCi ml−1) and then washed once in 1 ml of efflux medium containing 120 mmKCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 4 μmthapsigargin, and, unless otherwise indicated, 1 mm BAPTA. The efflux medium was replaced every 2 min for 20 min. The additions of IP3, Ca2+, Sr2+, and calmodulin are indicated in the figures. The free [Ca2+] was calculated with the CaBuf computer program using the following decimal logarithms of the association constants for ATP: H-ATP, 6.49; H-HATP, 4.11; Ca-ATP, 3.78; Ca-HATP, 1.98; Mg-ATP, 4.00; and Mg-HATP, 2.06 (14Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York1989Google Scholar). The association constants for BAPTA were: H-BAPTA, 6.36; H-HBAPTA, 5.47; Ca-BAPTA, 6.97; and Sr-BAPTA, 5.13 (15Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment the 45Ca2+ remaining in the stores was released by incubation with 1 ml of a 2% SDS solution for 30 min. Calmodulin from bovine brain (purity >99%) was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and dissolved as a 1 mm stock in 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8). Control samples were treated with the same buffer. Permeabilized A7r5 cells loaded to equilibrium with 45Ca2+ slowly lost their accumulated45Ca2+ during incubation in efflux medium containing 1 mm BAPTA and no added Ca2+. Thapsigargin (4 μm) was added to block the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps during the additions of Ca2+. A short exposure to 1 μmIP3 and 0.3 μm free Ca2+accelerated the rate of Ca2+ loss (Fig.1 a, closed circles). The release was less pronounced if 10 μmcalmodulin was added together with the IP3 and Ca2+ (Fig. 1 a, open circles). Addition of 0.3 μm free Ca2+ in the absence of IP3 by itself induced a small Ca2+ release (Fig. 1 b), due to the exchange of labeled Ca2+for unlabeled Ca2+ (3Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 16Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22961-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This release was identical in the presence (Fig. 1 b, open circles) or absence (Fig. 1 b, closed circles) of 10 μmcalmodulin. Ca2+ release was always measured in the absence of Mg-ATP. Moreover, because there were six wash steps between the loading of the stores in the presence of Mg-ATP and the challenge with IP3, all residual Mg-ATP should have been effectively removed. The involvement of the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CaMKII in the observed inhibition by calmodulin seems therefore unlikely. In addition, we have also tested the effect of the CaMKII inhibitor KN62. Calmodulin (10 μm) inhibited the Ca2+ release induced by 1 μm IP3 and 0.3 μm free Ca2+ by 54 ± 3% in the absence of KN62 and by 51 ± 4% (n = 3) in the presence of 10 μm KN62. These findings exclude the involvement of CaMKII in the inhibition of the IP3R by calmodulin. Similar experiments to those illustrated in Fig. 1 were performed at several free Ca2+ concentrations (Fig.2 a). Calmodulin (10 μm) did not inhibit the IP3R in the absence of added Ca2+ or in the presence of low free Ca2+ concentrations (0.03 or 0.1 μm). The same concentration of calmodulin, however, strongly inhibited the IP3R at higher free Ca2+ concentrations (0.3 and 1 μm). Because the calmodulin used was lyophilized from a dialysis buffer containing 30 μm Ca2+, four Ca2+ions were bound to each molecule of calmodulin. We calculated that the addition of 10 μm calmodulin and its contaminating 40 μm Ca2+ to the efflux medium containing 1 mm BAPTA and 650 μm total Ca2+could therefore have slightly increased the free [Ca2+] from 0.30 to 0.36 μm. Although unlikely, we wanted to exclude that the inhibitory effect of calmodulin could be caused by this small change in free [Ca2+]. Addition of 40 μm Ca2+ in the absence of calmodulin inhibited the Ca2+ release induced by 1 μmIP3 and 0.3 μm free Ca2+ by only 4.3 ± 2.2% (n = 3). We have also tested the effect of calmodulin in an efflux medium containing 6 mmBAPTA instead of 1 mm BAPTA. The addition of 10 μm calmodulin to efflux medium containing 6 mm BAPTA and 3.897 mm total Ca2+increased the calculated free [Ca2+] from 0.30 to only 0.31 μm. Fig. 2 b shows that under these conditions of strong Ca2+ buffering, 10 μmcalmodulin still inhibited the IP3R in the presence of 0.3 and 0.6 μm free Ca2+. The same concentration of calmodulin had again no effect on the IP3-induced Ca2+ release at lower free Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 2 also illustrates that cytosolic Ca2+ exerted its biphasic effect on the IP3R both in the presence and in the absence of calmodulin. In the presence of calmodulin, the inhibition occurred at lower Ca2+ concentrations. As a consequence, the bell-shaped Ca2+ activation curve of the IP3R became narrower in the presence of calmodulin. The [Ca2+]-dependence of the IP3-induced Ca2+ release was markedly different when Ca2+was buffered with 1 mm (Fig. 2 a) or 6 mm BAPTA (Fig. 2 b). Both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of Ca2+ were more pronounced at the higher concentration of BAPTA. It is possible that this difference is caused by the postulated local [Ca2+] rise in the vicinity of the IP3Rs as a result of the passive Ca2+ leak from the stores (17Iino M. Endo M.

This [Ca2+] rise will be less pronounced in the presence of 6 mm BAPTA, thereby reducing the IP3-induced Ca2+ release at the lowest Ca2+ concentration from 46.9 ± 2.1 to 30.3 ± 2.3%/2 min (n = 5). As a consequence the stimulatory effect of elevating the [Ca2+] was more pronounced in the presence of 6 mm BAPTA. An alternative possibility could be that the IP3R at low free Ca2+ concentrations is inhibited by the Ca2+-free form of BAPTA, which is the predominant form of the chelator under these conditions (19Richardson A. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11528-11533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Combettes L. Hannaert-Merah Z. Coquil J.-F. Rousseau C. Claret M. Swillens S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17561-17571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such inhibition would be more pronounced at 6 mm BAPTA, which could again explain why the release in the absence of Ca2+was reduced at the higher concentration of BAPTA. However, we have previously shown that this inhibitory effect was relatively small in A7r5 cells (21Bootman M.D. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fig.3 a illustrates the Ca2+ release induced by 1 μm IP3and 0.3 μm free Ca2+ in the presence of various concentrations of calmodulin. Calmodulin inhibited the IP3R with an IC50 of 4.6 μm and a Hill-coefficient of 1.0, which is consistent with a single interaction with no evidence for cooperativity between the subunits of the IP3R tetramer. Fig.3 b shows the Ca2+ release as a function of the [IP3] in the absence (closed circles) and presence (open circles) of 10 μm calmodulin in a medium containing 0.3 μm free Ca2+. IP3 stimulated the IP3R with an EC50 of 0.25 μm IP3 in the absence of calmodulin and with an EC50 of 2.9 μm IP3 in the presence of calmodulin. Calmodulin not only increased the EC50 for IP3-induced Ca2+ release but also decreased the maximal Ca2+ release induced by high IP3concentrations. Interestingly, the inhibition was relatively more pronounced at lower IP3 concentrations, e.g. 10 μm calmodulin caused an 82% inhibition of the Ca2+ release induced by 0.3 μmIP3, whereas that in the presence of 300 μmIP3 was only inhibited by 20%. The inhibitory effects of calmodulin were clearly dependent on the presence of Ca2+. To discriminate whether calmodulin acted by potentiating the inhibitory effects of Ca2+ or whether the requirement for Ca2+ to see the inhibition by calmodulin reflected the formation of Ca2+/calmodulin, we have studied the effect of calmodulin in the presence of various Sr2+concentrations. Sr2+ is only 3-fold less potent than Ca2+ in activating the liver IP3R but is 600-fold less potent in inhibiting it (22Marshall I.C.B. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A similar effect was observed in A7r5 cells, where Sr2+ up to 100 μm induced a concentration-dependent decrease in the EC50 for IP3-induced Ca2+release, whereas Ca2+ induced a biphasic effect with low Ca2+ concentrations decreasing the EC50 and higher Ca2+ concentrations increasing it (23Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows the Ca2+ release induced by 1 μm IP3 in the presence of increasing Sr2+ concentrations. The closed barsconfirm that Sr2+ activated the IP3R and that no significant inhibition was observed at 30 μmSr2+. The hatched bars show the effect of 10 μm calmodulin. Calmodulin did not inhibit the IP3R in the absence of added Sr2+ or in the presence of low free Sr2+ concentrations (1 or 3 μm). The same concentration of calmodulin, however, strongly inhibited the IP3R at higher free Sr2+concentrations (10 and 30 μm), which by themselves were not inhibitory. Because Sr2+ binds to calmodulin (24Cox J.A. Malnoë A. Stein E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3218-3222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but does not inhibit the IP3R in the absence of calmodulin, we conclude that the dependence of the calmodulin inhibition on the presence of Sr2+ or Ca2+ represents the formation of Sr2+/calmodulin or Ca2+/calmodulin. The inhibition occurred at higher Sr2+ concentrations than Ca2+ concentrations, probably because Sr2+ was 30 times less effective than Ca2+ in binding to the high affinity Ca2+-binding sites of calmodulin (24Cox J.A. Malnoë A. Stein E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3218-3222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that calmodulin inhibited the IP3-induced Ca2+ release if the free cytosolic [Ca2+] was 0.3 μm or higher, whereas there was no effect at lower free Ca2+ concentrations. Calmodulin therefore shifted the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the IP3R toward lower free Ca2+concentrations without affecting the Ca2+-dependent activation. This results in a narrower bell-shaped dependence of the IP3R on Ca2+, which may be important for inducing the termination of intracellular Ca2+ spikes. Because all experiments were done in the absence of Mg-ATP and because the inhibition was not affected by 10 μm KN62, the involvement of a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase can be excluded. The IP3R interacts with calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent (7Maeda N. Kawasaki T. Nakade S. Yokota N. Taguchi T. Kasai M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; (in press): 274Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the Ca2+-independent interaction was responsible for the inhibition of the release (9Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.E. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), because calmodulin inhibited IP3-induced Ca2+ release in the presence of 0.2 μm free Ca2+ and inhibited [3H]IP3 binding at all free Ca2+concentrations tested. Our data on the effects of calmodulin on the Ca2+ release induced by IP3 and a broad range of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations now indicate that the inhibition of the IP3-induced Ca2+ release is strictly dependent on the formation of a Ca2+/calmodulin or a Sr2+/calmodulin complex."
https://openalex.org/W2092431485,"A cDNA encoding a new cysteine proteinase belonging to the papain family and called cathepsin F has been cloned from a human prostate cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 484 amino acids, with the same domain organization as other cysteine proteinases, including a hydrophobic signal sequence, a prodomain, and a catalytic region. However, this propeptide domain is unusually long and distinguishes cathepsin F from other proteinases of the papain family. Cathepsin F also shows all structural motifs characteristic of these proteinases, including the essential cysteine residue of the active site. Consistent with these structural features, cathepsin F produced in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase degrades the synthetic peptide benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, a substrate commonly used for functional characterization of cysteine proteinases. Furthermore, this proteolytic activity is blocked bytrans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases. The gene encoding cathepsin F maps to chromosome 11q13, close to that encoding cathepsin W. Cathepsin F is widely expressed in human tissues, suggesting a role in normal protein catabolism. Northern blot analysis also revealed a significant level of expression in some cancer cell lines opening the possibility that this enzyme could be involved in degradative processes occurring during tumor progression.

Northern blot analysis also revealed a significant level of expression in some cancer cell lines opening the possibility that this enzyme could be involved in degradative processes occurring during tumor progression. The cysteine proteinases are a widespread group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of many different proteins and play a major role in intracellular protein degradation and turnover (1Bond J.S. Butler P.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 2Chapman H.A. Riese R.J. Shi G.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). These proteolytic enzymes can be subdivided into more than 20 different families, including the papain family, calpains, streptopains, clostripains, viral cysteine proteinases, and caspases, the largest one being that of papain (3Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In fact, the papain family of cysteine proteinases comprises a large number of enzymes from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with representative members expressed in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, plants, and humans (3Rawlings N.D.

In recent years, the number of human cysteine proteinases belonging to the papain family has considerably increased, and a total of 10 different family members has been characterized at the amino acid sequence level. These human cysteine proteinases include cathepsin B (5Chan S.J. San Segundo B. McCormick M.B. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Structural analysis of these enzymes has revealed that all of them contain a series of conserved features including an essential cysteine residue in their active site. In addition, it is well established that all these cysteine proteinases are synthesized as preproenzymes, which are processed to the corresponding proenzymes and targeted to the lysosomes by the mannose 6-phosphate signal attached to them. However, these enzymes differ in tissue distribution and in some enzymatic properties, including substrate specificities and pH stability. Functional analysis of these proteinases has shown that in addition to their intracellular role in protein recycling, they are involved in other normal processes such as antigen presentation (19Riese R.J.

In addition, it has been suggested that cysteine proteinases are involved in a variety of disease processes such as pulmonary emphysema (22Mason R.W. Johnson D.A. Barrett A.J. Chapman H.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 925-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), osteoporosis (23Delaisse J.M. Pascale L. Vaes G. Biochem.

Therefore, these enzymes represent primary targets for the development of inhibitors that could block its uncontrolled activity in these pathological conditions. As part of our work directed to look for proteolytic enzymes that could be of importance in tumor progression, we have recently identified different cysteine proteinases of the papain family overexpressed in human carcinomas from diverse sources. These proteases include cathepsin O, originally cloned from a breast carcinoma (13Velasco G. Ferrando A.A. Puente X.S. Sánchez L.M. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27136-27142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cathepsin L2, overexpressed in breast and colon carcinomas (17Santamarı́a I. Velasco G. Cazorla M. Fueyo A. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1624-1630PubMed Google Scholar), and cathepsin Z, ubiquitously distributed in cancer cell lines and primary tumors and characterized by containing an unusual short propeptide in its amino acid sequence (18Santamarı́a I.

We have also identified human bleomycin hydrolase, a cytosolic cysteine proteinase distantly related to other members of the papain family and involved in chemotherapy resistance (27Ferrando A.A. Velasco G. Campo E. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1746-1750PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ferrando A.A. Pendás A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. Lidereau R. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol.

In this work, we describe the molecular cloning and complete nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding a new member of the papain family of cysteine proteinases, which has been called cathepsin F, and that is mainly characterized by possessing a unique long propeptide domain in its amino acid sequence. We also report the expression of the gene inEscherichia coli and the functional characterization of the recombinant enzyme. Finally, we determine the chromosomal location of the cathepsin F gene and analyze its expression in human tissues and cancer cell lines. A human prostate cDNA library, constructed in λgt11, and different Northern blots containing poly(A)RNAs prepared from diverse human tissues and cancer cell lines were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A high density gridded human P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) 1The abbreviations used are: PAC, P1 artificial chromosome; bp, base pair(s); E-64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane; EST, expressed sequence tag; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, benzyloxycarbonyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization+ genomic library and a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing a single human chromosome in a rodent background were supplied by the Human Genome Mapping Resource Center (Cambridgeshire, UK). Restriction endonucleases and other reagents used for molecular cloning were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Synthetic peptides Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, Z-Arg-Arg-AMC, and Z-Arg-AMC were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), and proteinase inhibitor E-64 was from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method in an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer (model 392A) and used directly after synthesis. Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK) using a commercial random-priming kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). After searching the GenBankTM data base of human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for sequences with homology to members of the papain family of cysteine proteinases, we identified a sequence derived from an ovarian tumor cDNA clone 2GenBankTM accession number H39591, deposited by Hillier, L., Clark, N., Dubuque, T., Elliston, K., Hawkins, M., Holman, M., Hultman, M., Kucaba, T., Le, M., Lennon, G., Marra, M., Parsons, J., Rifkin, L., Rohlfing, T., Soares, M., Tan, F., Trevaskis, E., Waterston, R., Williamson, A., Wohldmann, P., and Wilson, R., Washington University-Merck EST project. that could be a good candidate to encode a new family member. Further searching of the EST data base for sequences similar to H39591 led us to identify 6 overlapping ESTs, spanning around 680 bp, and useful to prepare a probe for trying to clone a cDNA encoding this putative novel human cysteine proteinase. To obtain this probe, we performed a PCR amplification of DNA prepared from a prostate cDNA library using two specific primers 5′-GGACTGTGGACAAGATGGAC and 5′-AGCTGTTCTTGATGGCCCA, whose sequence was derived from the overlapping ESTs. The PCR reaction was carried out in a GeneAmp 2400 PCR system from Perkin-Elmer for 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (56 °C, 15 s), and extension (72 °C, 15 s). The PCR-amplified product was cloned and, after confirming its identity by nucleotide sequence analysis, was used to screen a human prostate cDNA library, according to standard procedures (29Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 12.30-12.31Google Scholar). Hybridization to the radiolabeled probe was carried out for 18 h in 6× SSC (1× = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's (1× = 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll), 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA at 65 °C. The membranes were washed twice for 1 h at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to autoradiography. After plaque purification, cloned inserts were excised by EcoRI digestion and the resulting fragments subcloned into the EcoRI site of pUC18. The isolated prostate cDNA encoding a novel human cysteine proteinase was also used as a probe to screen a mouse brain cDNA library following the same procedure described above. Positive clones were isolated and characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis. DNA fragments selected for nucleotide sequencing were inserted in the polylinker region of phage vector M13mp19 and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using either M13 universal primer or cDNA specific primers and the Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All nucleotides were identified in both strands. Sequence ambiguities were solved by substituting dITP for dGTP in the sequencing reactions. Computer analysis of DNA and protein sequences were performed with the software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (30Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree directed to examine the evolutionary relationships between human cysteine proteinases was constructed using the NEIGHBOR program, included in the PHYLIP software package (31Kuhner M.K. Felsenstein J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 459-468PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of the tree was done by the unweighed pair group method using arithmetic averages. The phylogenic distances were obtained according to the method described by Kimura (32Kimura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). To prepare an expression vector suitable for production of recombinant cathepsin F in E. coli, we first generated a 647-bp DNA fragment containing the coding sequence for the mature human cathepsin F by PCR amplification of the isolated full-length cDNA with primers 5′-ATGGCCCCACCTGAATGGGACT and 5′-TCAGTCCACCACCGCCGAG. The PCR reaction was carried out for 20 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (68 °C, 1 min) using the ExpandTM Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to try to reduce error frequency. The PCR product was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, repaired with Klenow fragment, and ligated to the expression vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously treated with SmaI and alkaline phosphatase. The resulting plasmid, called pGEX-3X CTSF, was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). and the transformed cells were grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 16 h, diluted 1/100 with the same medium, and grown to an A 600 of 1.0. Then, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the incubation was continued for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 0.05 volumes of PBS, lysed by using a French press and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The soluble extract was treated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B and eluted with glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) following the manufacturer's instructions. The enzymatic activity of purified cathepsin F produced in E. coli was measured using 20 μm Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, Z-Arg-Arg-AMC, or Z-Arg-AMC as substrates and following the procedure described by Barrett and Kirschke (33Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Assays were performed at 30 °C, in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 8 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Brij 35. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored in a Cytofluor 2350 fluorometer (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. For inhibition assays, the reaction mixture was preincubated with 20 μm E-64 at 30 °C for 15 min, and the remaining activity was determined using the fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC as above. Total DNA from a panel of 24 monochromosomal somatic cell hybrids containing a single human chromosome in a mouse or hamster cell line background was PCR-screened for the presence of the genomic sequence flanked by the cathepsin F specific primers 5′-GTGCTGATCAGAAGTGCTGCTGC and 5′-AGTTTCCTGGACATGGATAGGGAC. Amplification conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (68 °C, 15 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). To more precisely determine the physical location of the cathepsin F gene within the human genome, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of genomic DNA clones for cathepsin F was performed as described previously (34Pendás A.M. Matilla A. Urı́a J.A. Freije J.P. Fueyo A. Estivill X. López-Otı́n C. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic clones were isolated from a human P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) genomic library screened by filter hybridization with the full-length cathepsin F cDNA as probe. Two independent clones were identified enclosing the cathepsin F gene as demonstrated by PCR and Southern blot analysis. DNA from one of these PAC clones (called 123H18) was obtained with the standard alkaline lysis method and then used for FISH mapping. To do that, 2 μg of the PAC DNA was nick-translated with biotin-16-dUTP and hybridized to normal male metaphase chromosomes obtained from phytohemaglutinin-stimulated cultured lymphocytes. Biotinylated probe was detected using two avidin-fluorescein layers. Chromosomes were diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride-banded, and images were captured in a Zeiss axiophot fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Photometrics). Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of different human tissue specimens and cancer cell lines were prehybridized at 42 °C for 3 h in 50% formamide, 5× SSPE (1× = 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 10× Denhardt's, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. After prehybridization, filters were hybridized with a full-length cDNA for cathepsin F. After hybridization, filters were washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 h at 50 °C and exposed to autoradiography. RNA integrity and equal loading was assessed by hybridization with an actin probe. As a previous step to identify and characterize new human cysteine proteinases belonging to the papain family, we performed an analysis of the human EST data bases, searching for expressed sequences with significant similarity to those previously determined for human cathepsins. This computer search allowed us to identify several overlapping ESTs that, after translation, generated an open reading frame with a significant degree of similarity to papain-like cysteine proteinases. A cDNA containing part of these overlapping ESTs was PCR-amplified from DNA of a human prostate cDNA library and used as a probe to hybridize this library. After screening of approximately 1 × 106 plaque-forming units, DNA was isolated from 10 independent clones selected according to their positive hybridization with the probe, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Computer analysis of the obtained sequences confirmed that all of them derived from the same gene, potentially encoding a new member of the papain family of cysteine proteinases. Further analysis of the nucleotide sequence derived from the isolated clone containing the largest insert revealed the presence of an open reading frame coding for a protein of 484 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of 53,365 (Fig. 1). To provide additional evidence that the isolated prostate cDNA encoded a putative cysteine proteinase, we performed a detailed amino acid sequence comparison between the identified sequence and those present in the data bases. This analysis revealed that the highest degree of identity was found with a cysteine proteinase fromSchistosoma mansoni (48%). Significant similarities were also found with the different human cysteine proteinases of the papain family, with the percentage of identities ranging from 37% with cathepsin L2 to 26% with cathepsin B. Furthermore, the identified amino sequence exhibits the domain organization and structural motifs characteristic of the papain-like cysteine proteinases (Fig.2). Thus, it contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids close to the initial methionine which likely corresponds to the signal peptide found in all other family members. In addition, the multiple amino acid sequence alignment between all human cysteine proteinases of the papain family characterized to date (Fig.2) also allows the identification of a proregion and a mature proteinase domain in the identified protein sequence, as well as to define the putative cleavage site between both domains. Thus, the active processed form of the putative novel cysteine proteinase would start at the alanine residue located at position 271, since it immediately precedes the absolutely conserved proline residue located at the +2 position in all family members. The amino acid sequence alignment shown in Fig. 2 also allows the identification of the putative active site Cys residue (at position 295) of the deduced amino acid sequence as well as other residues proposed to be important for the catalytic properties of cysteine proteinases, including the His-431 and Asn-451 residues (35Kamphuis I.G. Drenth J. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 36Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the amino acid sequences surrounding these three residues are also well conserved. Thus, the N-terminal region contains the glutamine residue (at position 289) of the oxyanion hole present in the structure of these enzymes as well as the conserved tryptophan residue and hydrophobic segment immediately adjacent to the active site cysteine residue (35Kamphuis I.G. Drenth J. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 36Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal region contains a series of conserved aromatic and glycine residues located around the histidine and asparagine residues of the active site. Finally, the deduced amino acid sequence also contains five potential sites of N-glycosylation (Asn-Glu-Thr at position 160, Asn-Arg-Thr at 195, Asn-Phe-Ser at 367, Asn-Asp-Ser at 378, and Asn-Arg-Ser at 440), it is very likely that at least one of them is effectively glycosylated and has attached the mannose 6-phosphate marker required for lysosomal targeting of these enzymes. On the basis of all these structural characteristics, we can conclude that the isolated human prostate cDNA codes for a novel member of the papain family of cysteine proteinases, which we propose to call cathepsin F. A phylogenetic tree constructed to evaluate the evolutionary relationships of human cathepsin F to other human cysteine proteinases revealed that this novel protein is only distantly related to other family members, the more closely related member is cathepsin W (Fig. 3).Figure 3Schematic illustration of evolutionary relationships between human cysteine proteinases. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the NEIGHBOR program of the PHYLIP software package (31Kuhner M.K. Felsenstein J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 459-468PubMed Google Scholar). The phylogenic distances were obtained according to the method described by Kimura (32Kimura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After first submission of the present work, a paper describing a sequence closely related to that described herein has been reported (37Wang B.

According to these authors, cathepsin F should be much smaller than the protein identified in this work (302 versus 484 amino acid residues), and contrary to all known members of this protease family, it would lack a hydrophobic signal sequence. Consequently, they propose that cathepsin F would be targeted to the lysosomal compartment via an N-terminal signal peptide-independent lysosomal targeting pathway. However, an alternative explanation would be that Wang et al. (37Wang B. Shi G.P. Yao P.M. Li Z. Chapman H.A. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32000-32008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have isolated a partial cDNA clone for this novel cysteine proteinase. In fact, a detailed comparison of both sequences shows that they are identical in the 3′-region, but the open reading frame identified in this work extends more than 180 amino acids upstream from the methionine residue considered by Wang et al. (37Wang B. Shi G.P. Yao P.M. Li Z. Chapman H.A. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32000-32008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) as the first residue in cathepsin F. In addition, and as can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2, the sequence reported herein contains a hydrophobic signal sequence like all the remaining cathepsins. This 19-residue leader peptide ends in a sequence Ala-Val-Ala, which matches perfectly the Ala-X-Ala motif found at the processing site of eukaryotic preproteins (38von Hejne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). Computer analysis using the algorithm developed by Nielsen et al. (39Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) confirmed that this site presented the highest probability to be the processing peptide bond of the cathepsin F leader sequence. Taken together, these data indicate that human cathepsin F contains a bona fide signal sequence; and consequently, its domain organization is identical to that previously described for all known members of the papain family of cysteine proteinases. Nevertheless, the amino acid sequence reported in this work for cathepsin F exhibits a very long propeptide (251 residues) which distinguishes this enzyme from all other family members, whose equivalent domains range from 206 to 41 residues in length (cathepsin C and cathepsin Z, respectively) (Fig. 2). To provide additional information on the structural organization of cathepsin F, studies were undertaken to identify and clone the murine homolog of this cysteine proteinase. To this purpose, the cDNA encoding human cathepsin F was used as a probe to screen a mouse brain cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis from clones selected after positive hybridization to the radiolabeled probe revealed the presence of an open reading frame coding for a protein showing 72% of identities with human cathepsin F (Fig. 2; accession number AJ131851). This murine protein also contains a hydrophobic signal sequence as well as a long propeptide domain, thus providing further evidence that these structural features are not exclusive of the sequence reported herein for human cathepsin F. Finally, it is remarkable that according to preliminary studies, 3I. Santam"

PS1 and PS2 are polytopic membrane proteins that undergo endoproteolytic cleavage to generate stable NH2- and COOH-terminal derivatives (NTF and CTF, respectively). Several lines of evidence suggest that the endoproteolytic derivatives are likely the functional units of PSin vivo. In the present report, we examine the disposition of PS NTF and CTF assemblies in stable mouse N2a neuroblastoma cell lines expressing human PS polypeptides. We show that exogenous expression of PS1 NTFs neither assemble with endogenous CTF nor exhibit dominant negative inhibitory effects on the endogenous PS1 cleavage and the accumulation of derivatives. In cells co-expressing PS1 and PS2, PS1- and PS2-derived fragments do not form mixed assemblies. In contrast, cells expressing a chimeric PS1/PS2 polypeptide form stable PS1 NTF-PS2 CTF assemblies. Moreover, expression of chimeric PS1/PS2 polypeptides harboring a familial early onset AD-linked mutation (M146L) elevates the production of Aβ42 peptides.

More recently, using in situ chemical cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we demonstrated that the NTF and CTF of either PS1 or PS2 can be coisolated (26Thinakaran G. Regard J.B.

Dis. 1998; 5: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) reported that expression of a truncated PS1 species corresponding to the human PS1 NTF with a FAD mutation failed to increase Aβ42 production; the authors suggested that the pathogenic effect of mutant PS is elicited by the full-length molecule and not the endoproteolytic derivatives. In this report, we examine the assembly of PS1 and PS2 derivatives in stable mouse N2a neuroblastoma cell lines expressing full-length PS, recombinant PS1 NTF, or chimeric PS1/PS2 polypeptides. We demonstrate that transgene-derived COOH-terminally truncated human PS polypeptides that correspond to PS1 NTF (residues 1–298) fail to co-assemble with endogenous PS1 CTF and are rapidly degraded. In cells co-expressing PS1 and PS2, processed fragments derived from full-length PS polypeptides form assemblies consisting entirely of either PS1 NTF·CTF or PS2 NTF·CTF. Based on these results, we conclude that the association of NH2 and COOH domains of the precursor PS polypeptide precedes endoproteolytic cleavage and that PS1 and PS2 do not form heteromultimeric assemblies. Interestingly, fragments derived from proteolytic processing of a chimeric PS1/PS2 precursor polypeptide are capable of forming stable heteromeric PS1 NTF·PS2 CTF assemblies. Furthermore, expression of a FAD-linked M146L mutant PS1/PS2 chimera elevated the production of Aβ42 peptides, indicating that the gain of function properties associated with the FAD-linked mutation is preserved in a PS1/PS2 chimera. Our results are consistent with a model where stabilization of intramolecular interaction(s) between domains within the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of PS1 is a prerequisite for endoproteolytic processing. Expression plasmids encoding human PS1 (pCB6PS1), PS2 (pCB6PS2), FAD-linked PS variants, and PS2 CTF have been described (10Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G. Eckman C.B. Lee M.K. Davenport F. Ratovitsky T.

A 235-base pair DNA fragment, which encodes PS1 amino acids 214–269, was generated using primers 195S (see above) and 5′-GGCAACCAGCATTCGAAGTGGACCTTTCGG and subsequent digestion with PflMI and BsmI.

To generate antibodies against the PS2 NH2-terminal region, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing residues 1–75 of human PS2. The specificity of the resultant antiserum, termed PS2NT, for PS2 was established by Western blot analysis of lysates prepared from stable N2a cell lines expressing PS1 or PS2 (data not shown).

To explore the role of protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation in β-subunit function, we examined the effect of PKA stimulation on Kv1.5 current following coexpression with either Kvβ1.2 or Kvβ1.3, both of which coassemble with Kv1.5 and induce fast inactivation. In Xenopus oocytes expressing Kv1.5 and Kvβ1.3, activation of PKA reduced macroscopic inactivation with an increase in K+ current. Similar results were obtained using HEK 293 cells which lack endogenous K+ channel subunits. These effects did not occur when Kv1.5 was coexpressed with either Kvβ1.2 or Kvβ1.3 lacking the amino terminus, suggesting involvement of this region of Kvβ1.3. Removal of a consensus PKA phosphorylation site on the Kvβ1.3 NH2terminus (serine 24), but not alternative sites in either Kvβ1.3 or Kv1.5, resulted in loss of the functional effects of kinase activation. The effects of phosphorylation appeared to be electrostatic, as replacement of serine 24 with a negatively charged amino acid reduced β-mediated inactivation, while substitution with a positively charged residue enhanced it. These results indicate that Kvβ1.3-induced inactivation is reduced by PKA activation, and that phosphorylation of serine 24 in the subunit NH2 terminus is responsible.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether this α-β interaction is modulated by PKA stimulation. We found that coexpression of Kvβ1.3, but not Kvβ1.2, enabled a response to kinase activation, with marked slowing of fast inactivation and an increase in K+ current. These effects can be attributed to phosphorylation of a specific consensus site by PKA in the NH2 terminus of the Kvβ1.3 subunit. Reagent grade chemicals, as well as 8-chlorophenylthio cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and forskolin were obtained from Sigma, while 8-bromo-cAMP was purchased from Calbiochem. Tissue culture media and reagents, including LipofectAMINE, were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Enzymes and buffers were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN), Promega (Madison, WI), and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The source of other materials is specified below. DNA constructs of Kv1.5, Kvβ1.2, and Kvβ1.3 (each in a modified pSP64T vector (13England S.K. Uebele V.N. Shear H. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Defolliculated Xenopus oocytes were prepared as described previously and injected with approximately 40 nl of RNA (20Murray K.T. Fahrig S.A. Deal K.K. Po S.S. Hu N.N. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M.

This was combined with an excess of undiluted RNA in ratios which achieved maximal effect as assessed by K+ current characteristics during electrophysiological recordings (13England S.K. Uebele V.N.

For coexpression of Kv1.5 and Kvβ1.3 in HEK 293 cells, human Kv1.5 (−22–1894 nucleotides) and human Kvβ1.3 (−53–1500 nucleotides) were inserted in tandem into a modified pBKCMV (m-pBK) vector that had the β-galacosidase ATG at position 151 removed to increase expression efficiency. The Kv1.5 subunit was placed 3′ to Kvβ1.3 and behind an internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES), thus generating a dual cistronic mRNA. A 590-base pair IRES was subcloned into EcoRI/EcoRV prepared pBSKS+. The above mentioned subunit fragments were blunted and subcloned into blunted XbaI and ClaI sites of the pBS polylinker that flanked the subcloned IRES. This construct was then digested withSalI, blunted, and then digested with NotI to release the Kvβ1.3/IRES/Kv1.5 sequence. This fragment was then inserted into NotI/SmaI digested m-pBK. This construct consistently generated currents showing complete Kvβ1.3 effects. Kvβ1.3 mutants were also expressed using this m-pBK IRES construct. Recently thawed HEK 293 cells (ATCC number 1573-CRL) were maintained in culture and transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE as described previously (22Uebele V.N. England S.K. Chaudhary A. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2406-2412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), with coexpression of green fluorescent protein to identify cells for voltage clamp analysis. For transfections, 2.5 μg of hKv1.5-pBK, 4 μg of Kvβ1.3/IRES/hKv1.5-pBK, and 0.5 μg of GFP-pCICMV were mixed with 25 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent and applied overnight, after which the standard culture medium was restored. Cells were removed from the dish using brief trypsinization, washed twice with maintenance medium, and stored at room temperature for recording within the next 12 h. Oocyte recordings were performed using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (20Murray K.T. Fahrig S.A. Deal K.K. Po S.S. Hu N.N. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M.

Membrane potentials were controlled by a high-compliance voltage-clamp amplifier (Clampator, Dagan Instruments, Minneapolis, MN) with voltage command potentials generated by a 12-bit digital-to-analog converter controlled by customized by pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Pipettes were filled with 3 m KCl, and a standard extracellular bath solution was utilized (in mm: NaCl 96, KCl 2, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5, pH 7.5). Oocytes that demonstrated endogenous currents greater than 1% of expressed currents were not utilized. Data were sampled at 10–20 kHz and filtered at 2–5 kHz. The holding potential was −80 mV and the cycle time for all pulse protocols was 10 s or slower to allow full recovery from inactivation between pulses unless otherwise specified. To calculate cell membrane electrical capacitance, the capacitive transient was recorded during a small voltage step (−80 to −70 mV) during which K+ currents were not activated. Integration of the leak-corrected transient yielded the charge (Q) transferred during the voltage step of V from which capacitance (C) was calculated: C =Q/V. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). K+ current recordings in HEK 293 cells were obtained with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (22Uebele V.N. England S.K. Chaudhary A. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2406-2412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The intracellular pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl 110, HEPES 10, K4BAPTA 5, K2ATP 5, and MgCl2 1 (pH 7.2); the extracellular bath solution contained (in mm): NaCl 130, KCl 4, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, glucose 10 (pH 7.35). Currents were sampled at 1–10 kHz and filtered at 0.5–5 kHz. Data acquisition and command potentials were controlled by pClamp software. Analysis of data was performed using either custom programs that were designed to read and analyze pClamp data files or Clampfit 6.04. Activation curves were constructed from deactivating tail currents and were fitted with a Boltzmann equation. The time course of macroscopic K+ current inactivation was fitted with an exponential function using a nonlinear least squares algorithm. Comparison of the voltage-dependent and kinetic properties of K+currents after PKA stimulation to control values was performed using a paired t test. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. For some experiments, Kv1.5 was coexpressed with an NH2-terminal deletion mutant of Kvβ1.3 (ΔN50Kvβ1.3). This mutant was constructed as described previously (21Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1485-C1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by changing the serine at position 50 to a methionine. A COOH-terminal deletion mutant of Kv1.5 (ΔC57Kv1.5) (23Uebele V.N. Yeola S.W. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was generated by transfer from pGEM into wild-type pBK using EcoRI and HindIII, followed by transfer into the IRES construct using StuI. Point mutations were constructed in the Kvβ1.3 sequence in which serines were converted to alanines at position 24 (S24A), 39 (S39A), or 164 (S164A) using either overlap extension polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) or the Quick-Change Site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Multiple independent recombinant clones were analyzed by restriction digestion to verify correct assembly and to screen for the presence of the mutation (creation of a new restriction site). Mutant inserts were fully sequenced and clones lacking polymerase errors were chosen for electrophysiologic studies. In Xenopus oocytes, coexpression of Kvβ1.3 with Kv1.5 produced K+ currents that displayed partial inactivation and slowed deactivation as previously reported (16England S.K. Uebele V.N. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28531-28534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1485-C1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). With sustained depolarization to +50 mV, peak K+ current declined by 44 ± 2% over a 50-ms period, with a rapid time course (τ = 4.2 ± 0.1 ms; n = 17). The voltage dependence of channel activation was shifted to hyperpolarized potentials (midpoint or V 12 = −22.0 ± 1.3 mV) compared with Kv1.5 alone (V 12 = −5.2 ± 1.0 mV;n = 19). In order to stimulate PKA, cells were perfused with a combination of kinase activators (8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP, 200 μm;3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mm; and forskolin, 10 μm) which activates the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator in a rapid, potent manner (25Drumm M.L. Wilkinson D.J. Smit L.S. Worrell R.T. Strong T.V. Frizzell R.A. Dawson D.C. Collins F.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1797-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1 A, activation of PKA caused marked slowing of macroscopic inactivation for K+ current derived from Kv1.5 + Kvβ1.3 (τ = 4.2 ± 0.1 ms before and 6.2 ± 0.3 ms after PKA activation; p < 0.01), with a reduction in the overall extent of K+ current inactivation induced by the β subunit (21 ± 2% at +50 mV, compared with 44 ± 2% before kinase activation). In addition, K+ current deactivation became more rapid, consistent with reduced β-mediated effects (deactivation τ at −40 mV was 63 ± 6 ms before and 47 ± 4 ms after PKA). The loss of K+ current inactivation was associated with a significant, sustained increase in current amplitude (+40 ± 3% at +50 mV in 15 min; n = 17). The time course of these effects was rapid, as shown by normalized K+ current values during an individual experiment in Fig.1 C. To further investigate the mechanisms of these effects by PKA, activation curves were constructed from deactivating tail currents. Stimulation of PKA did not change the midpoint of this curve (V 12 = −22.0 ± 1.3 mV before and −22.8 ± 1.1 mV after PKA), indicating that the voltage dependence of channel opening was not affected. In addition, there was no associated change in cell membrane electrical capacitance with kinase activation (+1 ± 2% at 15 min), suggesting that significant changes in cell surface area were not involved in the effect observed. K+ currents derived from coexpression of Kvβ1.3 with Kv1.5 demonstrate not only development of fast voltage-dependent inactivation, but also enhancement of the slow or C-type inactivation that is present with Kv1.5 alone (21Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1485-C1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of slow inactivation was studied with a twin pulse protocol during which the duration of the first pulse (+70 mV) was progressively lengthened, followed by a 50 ms hyperpolarizing step to −80 mV prior to the second pulse (+70 mV) in order to permit full recovery of fast inactivation while minimizing recovery of slow inactivated channels (21Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1485-C1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction of slow inactivation was calculated as 1 − (P2/P1), where P2 is the peak current of the second pulse and P1 is the peak current of the first pulse. With a prepulse of 2 s, this value was 0.32 ± 0.2 under control conditions, and 0.30 ± 0.02 after PKA stimulation (data not shown). These data indicate that despite the effect of PKA to reduce fast inactivation, the extent of slow inactivation was not altered. Because Kvβ1.2 can also coassemble with Kv1.5, we investigated whether coexpression of this subunit led to a similar effect with PKA activation. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 B, K+ currents following coinjection of Kvβ1.2 with Kv1.5 inXenopus oocytes demonstrated partial inactivation (50 ± 2% at +50 mV; n = 11), slowed deactivation, and an altered voltage dependence of channel opening (V 12= −20.4 ± 2.0 mV) compared with Kv1.5 alone. With stimulation of PKA, there was no effect on either K+ current amplitude (+3 ± 2% at +50 mV in 15 min; n = 11), kinetics of inactivation (τ = 4.0 ± 0.1 ms before and 4.0 ± 0.1 ms after PKA at +50 mV), or extent of inactivation (50 ± 3% after PKA). A comparison of the typical response to kinase activation when Kv1.5 was coexpressed with the two different β subunits is demonstrated in Fig. 1 C. In order to confirm the relevance of our findings for K+ channel regulation in mammalian cells, we also examined the effects of PKA activation in HEK 293 cells. Similar results were obtained when the K+channel subunits under study were expressed in this mammalian cell line. Following exposure to the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP, there was marked slowing in the time course of macroscopic fast inactivation for cells coexpressing Kv1.5 and Kvβ1.3 (τ = 3.7 ± 0.2 ms before and 5.9 ± 0.3 ms after PKA stimulation; n = 7), so that current at the end of a 250-ms voltage step was increased by 39 ± 8% (Fig. 2 A). Analogous to results in oocytes, there was no significant effect on slow inactivation (τslow = 402 ± 100 ms before and 468 ± 78 ms after PKA). On the other hand, there was greater variability in the effect of PKA to increase K+ current amplitude in HEK 293 cells than was seen in oocytes. Peak K+ current increased in most but not all cells (+29 ± 4% in 5 of 7 cells) expressing Kv1.5 + Kvβ1.3 (Fig. 2 A), with no significant change for the group as a whole (+1 ± 4%). As in oocytes, there was no change in the voltage dependence of channel opening as assessed by deactivating tail currents (Fig. 2 B;V 12 = −22 ± 1 mV before and −23 ± 1 mV after kinase stimulation). Kvβ1.2 and Kvβ1.3 share a common consensus PKA phosphorylation site in the conserved COOH-terminal region of the proteins (serine 164 in Kvβ1.3). However, two additional sites are present in the unique NH2 terminus of Kvβ1.3 (serine 24 and serine 39) which are not present in Kvβ1.2. Additional experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that one of these potential sites in the variable NH2 terminus of the protein was responsible for the effects of PKA activation which occurred with Kvβ1.3 but not Kvβ1.2. The NH2-terminal 50 amino acids of Kvβ1.3 were removed and the mutant construct (ΔN50Kvβ1.3) was coexpressed with Kv1.5 inXenopus oocytes. Deletion of this portion of the Kvβ1.3 NH2 terminus eliminated β-mediated inactivation as described previously (21Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1485-C1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the PKA response seen with wild-type Kvβ1.3 was abolished, with no effect on K+current amplitude (−4 ± 2% at +50 mV in 15 min;n = 6) or voltage dependence of channel opening (V 12 = −18 ± 2 mV before and −19 ± 2 mV after PKA) following stimulation of PKA (data not shown). These results implicated the Kvβ1.3 NH2 terminus in the effects of kinase activation and suggested that the observed increase in peak current with PKA activation was probably due to decreased inactivation. To determine if one or both unique NH2-terminal consensus PKA sites in Kvβ1.3 were responsible for the effects of PKA, each site was removed individually by changing serine to an alanine (Kvβ1.3S24A and Kvβ1.3S39A). K+ currents following coexpression of Kvβ1.3S24A with Kv1.5 in oocytes resembled wild-type currents, except that both the time course and extent of fast inactivation were enhanced (Fig.3 A). At +50 mV, inactivation τ was 3.4 ± 0.2 ms (versus 4.2 ± 0.1 ms for wild-type) with a fall in peak K+ current of 58 ± 2% over 50 ms (versus 44 ± 2% for wild-type;n = 7). In addition, activation of PKA had no effect on the extent of inactivation (54 ± 2% after PKA), the speed of macroscopic current decay (τ = 3.5 ± 0.1 ms after PKA), or K+ current amplitude (+0 ± 1% at +50 mV in 15 min) in the presence of this mutation (Fig. 3, A andB). K+ currents generated by the Kvβ1.3S39A mutation demonstrated current characteristics and response to PKA stimulation (Fig. 3 B) which was similar to that seen with wild-type Kvβ1.3. Upon exposure to PKA activators, K+currents demonstrated slowing of fast inactivation (τ = 4.5 ± 0.2 ms before and 5.9 ± 0.3 ms after PKA) and a reduction in the extent of this process (41 ± 2% before and 23 ± 3% after PKA), associated with a rapid increase in peak K+ current amplitude (+36 ± 3% at +50 mV in 15 min; n = 8). Taken together, these data indicate that coexpression of Kvβ1.3 modulates the response of Kv1.5 to PKA activation by phosphorylation at a specific site, serine 24, on the NH2 terminus of the β subunit protein. Because inactivation is enhanced with the Kvβ1.3S24A mutant, it is likely that wild-type Kvβ1.3 is phosphorylated to some extent under basal or unstimulated conditions. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, data obtained in HEK 293 cells further confirmed the mutagenesis experiments conducted in Xenopus oocytes. There was no effect of PKA activation on K+ currents derived from Kv1.5 + Kvβ1.3S24A (Fig. 4 A) with respect to fast inactivation (τfast = 4.8 ± 0.3 ms before and 5.1 ± 0.3 ms after PKA; n = 7). On the other hand, stimulation of PKA caused substantial relief of inactivation when Kv1.5 was coexpressed with the Kvβ1.3S39A mutant (Fig. 4 B; τfast = 4.7 ± 0.2 ms before and 7.6 ± 0.4 ms after PKA; n = 6). A similar effect was observed with a mutation which removed the conserved COOH-terminal Kvβ1.3 PKA consensus site, serine 164, as shown in Fig. 4 C(inactivation τfast = 5.9 ± 0.4 ms before and 7.3 ± 0.4 ms after PKA; n = 6). Finally, because previous reports showed that phosphorylation of sites in the COOH terminus of the Kv1.1 α subunit modulate Kvβ1.1-mediated inactivation (26Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Jing J. Peretz T. Singer-Lahat D. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14021-14024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a Kv1.5 mutant lacking the COOH-terminal 57 amino acids and the two PKA consensus sites (serine 555 and serine 578) in the channel was studied. When this mutant was coexpressed with Kvβ1.3, a wild-type response to PKA activation was observed (Fig.4 D; inactivation τfast = 5.0 ± 0.3 ms before and 10.0 ± 0.4 ms after PKA; n = 5). These results further substantiate the data in oocytes which implicate phosphorylation of serine 24 in Kvβ1.3 as the sole molecular mechanism responsible for the PKA reduction in fast inactivation. To determine whether the effects of PKA resulted directly from the negative charge imparted by phosphorylation, the serine at position 24 in Kvβ1.3 was mutated to the negatively charged amino acid aspartate (Kvβ1.3524D). Co-expression of Kv1.5 with Kvβ1.3S24D in Xenopus oocytes produced K+currents in which inactivation was substantially reduced (19 ± 3%; n = 5) compared with wild-type Kvβ1.3 as shown in Fig. 3 C (left panel). Nonetheless, the β-mediated hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation was largely preserved (V 12 = −15 ± 1 mV), indicating that the loss of inactivation associated with this mutation was not due to loss of β subunit expression. To further assess the role of charge at this location, serine 24 was then mutated to the positively charged residue lysine (Kvβ1.3S24K). This mutation had the opposite effect of Kvβ1.3524D, with enhancement of the extent (65 ± 1%; n = 5) and time course (τ = 2.6 ± 0.1 ms) of inactivation with respect to wild-type Kvβ1.3 (Fig. 3 C, right panel). These data indicate that the mechanism whereby phosphorylation relieves β-mediated inactivation is electrostatic in nature, and that the local charge at this position in Kvβ1.3 is critical to the α-β interaction which confers inactivation to Kv1.5 current. Our findings demonstrate that activation of PKA modulates K+ current derived from coexpression of Kv1.5 and Kvβ1.3, with relief of inactivation that is associated with an increase in current size. A reduction in fast inactivation would be predicted to cause some increase in K+ current amplitude. While PKA activation always enhanced K+ current in Xenopusoocytes, this response was somewhat more variable in HEK 293 cells, with an increase in current in most (5 of 7) but not all cells. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the fact that voltage clamp of the K+ currents under study is faster in HEK cells than in oocytes. Activation is rapid for Kv1.5 currents and in the presence of β subunit coexpression, the inactivation which is induced is also fast. If initial clamp of activating currents is slower in oocytes, there could be more overlap in time between the processes of activation and inactivation. Under these conditions, any change in the degree of inactivation is more likely to alter current amplitude because of concomitant activation. This discrepancy was the only experimental difference between results in the two expression systems, with other findings in oocytes essentially duplicated in HEK 293 cells. Removal of the PKA phosphorylation site at serine 24 in the Kvβ1.3 subunit abolished the PKA modification of fast inactivation. Moreover, this effect was mimicked by substitution of an acidic amino acid which caused reduced inactivation, while mutation to a basic amino acid enhanced it. Thus, we conclude that the molecular basis of the PKA effect is direct phosphorylation of the Kvβ1.3 subunit NH2 terminus at this position. The location of the phosphorylation site responsible for the PKA effect is not surprising, since our previous work has shown that it is the NH2terminus of Kvβ1.3 which confers inactivation upon Kv1.5 current through a possible open channel blocking mechanism (21Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1485-C1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the first 10 amino acids of Kvβ1.3 abolishes fast inactivation, while attaching the first 87 amino acids of Kvβ1.3 to the NH2terminus of Kv1.5 restores it (21Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1485-C1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that when the NH2 terminus of Kvβ1.3 assumes a three-dimensional structure, serine 24 must be positioned in a region critical for β-mediated inactivation, given the effect of charge mutations at this location. It is possible that serine 24 is positioned close to one or more basic residues which are important for the pore blocking effect of the NH2 terminus, and that phosphorylation or negative charge can shield these positively charged residues. This mechanism has been demonstrated previously for kinase modulation of Kv3.4, which encodes a rapidly inactivating or A-type channel (28Covarrubias M. Wei A. Salkoff L. Vyas T.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Beck E.J. Sorensen R.G. Slater S.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen.

Nature. 1997; 385: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Stimulation of protein kinase C removes fast inactivation by phosphorylation of NH2-terminal residues which are in close proximity to a group of basic amino acids in the inactivation particle. Our results here indicate that despite the effect of PKA to reduce Kvβ1.3 fast inactivation, the extent of slow inactivation was not altered. We have previously proposed that the enhanced slow inactivation observed with Kvβ1.3 was directly linked to the β-induced fast inactivation, since NH2-terminal deletions in Kvβ1.3 that removed fast inactivation also removed the enhanced slow inactivation (21Uebele V.N. England S.K. Gallagher D.J. Snyders D.J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1485-C1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the data presented here suggest the effect of Kvβ1.3 to promote slow inactivation is more complex and not solely coupled to β-induced fast inactivation. If it was, one would predict that PKA relaxation of fast inactivation would also reduce slow inactivation. As noted above, prior studies have shown that the inactivation conferred onto Kv1.1 by Kvβ1.1 is modulated by α subunit phosphorylation (26Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T.

Based upon our data, it is now apparent that phosphorylation of the β subunit itself also regulates β-mediated effects. The functional response of different K+ channel subunits to activation of protein kinases represents not only a means to modulate subunit interactions, but also another mechanism for K+ current diversity in vivo. Modulation of α-β function by kinase systems also further complicates the correlation of native currents with those obtained from cloned proteins in heterologous systems."
https://openalex.org/W2004294575,"Cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes have a demonstrated role in G1 phase, regulating the function of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb). Previously, we have shown that following treatment with low doses of UV radiation, cell lines that express wild-type p16 and Cdk4 responded with a G2 phase cell cycle delay. The UV-responsive lines contained elevated levels of p16 post-treatment, and the accumulation of p16 correlated with the G2 delay. Here we report that in UV-irradiated HeLa and A2058 cells, p16 bound Cdk4 and Cdk6 complexes with increased avidity and inhibited a cyclin D3-Cdk4 complex normally activated in late S/early G2 phase. Activation of this complex was correlated with the caffeine-induced release from the UV-induced G2 delay and a decrease in the level of p16 bound to Cdk4. Finally, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Cdk4 blocked cells in G2 phase. These data indicate that the cyclin D3-Cdk4 activity is necessary for cell cycle progression through G2 phase into mitosis and that the increased binding of p16 blocks this activity and G2 phase progression after UV exposure. Cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes have a demonstrated role in G1 phase, regulating the function of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb).

Loss of normal cell cycle control mechanisms is a common theme in the development of most cancers, in particular the loss of mechanisms involved in sensing and repairing DNA damage. An increasing number of tumor suppressor genes have been found to be intimately involved in DNA damage responses, including cell cycle responses. The best documented of these are the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and Rb. TP53 is mutated in a high proportion of tumors, and its gene product (p53) is involved in cell cycle responses following DNA damage (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). p53 knockout mice develop relatively normally, but are prone to a range of tumors (2Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4009) Google Scholar). Rb was identified as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, and its gene product (Rb) has a pivotal role in the late G1 phase restriction point (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). Knockout of one allele of Rb in mice produced animals predisposed to pituitary tumors, but they did not develop retinoblastoma, and the homozygous knockout was embryonically lethal (4Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). These tumor suppressors exert their cell cycle effects by ultimately modulating the levels and activities of the regulatory elements underlying cell cycle progression, the cyclin-dependent kinases.The cyclin-dependent kinases are regulated in a complex manner, through cyclin subunit association; a series of tightly regulated phosphorylations and dephosphorylations (5Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar); and the binding of inhibitory protein subunits, CKI proteins (Cdkinhibitors) (6Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). p53 can directly regulate the expression of one of these CKI proteins, p21 (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar); and in response to DNA damage, p53-induced p21 expression is responsible for a G1 phase delay (7Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tlsty T.D. Lees E. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from p21 knockout mice fail to delay in G1 in response to similar damage (8Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Rb exerts its cell cycle inhibitory effects is somewhat complex, although this is largely via its ability to bind and inhibit the activity of a group of transcription factors (E2F) that are essential for progression into S phase and the expression of a number of positive and negative regulators of cell cycle progression (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). Thus, loss of Rb function would be predicted to result in a deregulation of entry into S phase. One of the cell cycle regulators whose expression is controlled by Rb function is itself a tumor suppressor, p16 CDKN2A. p16 is another CKI that acts specifically to inhibit cyclin D-Cdk4 and Cdk6, the cyclin-dependent kinases responsible for phosphorylating Rb during G1 (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 6Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). CDKN2A itself is mutated, deleted, or hypermethylated in a high proportion of human tumors (9Foulkes W.D. Flanders T.Y. Pollock P.M. Hayward N.K. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 5-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).CDKN2A has also been identified as a melanoma susceptibility gene (10Castellano M. Pollock P.M. Walters M.K. Sparrow L.E. Down L.M. Gabrielli B.G. Parsons P.G. Hayward N.K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4868-4875PubMed Google Scholar) and is deleted, mutated, or hypermethylated in a high proportion of melanoma cell lines (10Castellano M. Pollock P.M. Walters M.K. Sparrow L.E. Down L.M. Gabrielli B.G. Parsons P.G. Hayward N.K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4868-4875PubMed Google Scholar).Cell cycle responses to DNA damage induced by suberythemal doses of UV radiation include both G1 and G2 phase delays. G1 delays appear to be through a p53-dependent mechanism, with increased expression of p21 resulting in inhibition of G1 cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases (11Poon R.Y.C. Jiang W. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13283-13291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Petrocelli T. Poon R. Drucker D.J. Slingerland J.M. Rosen C.F.

The G2 delay is p53-independent and is via a block in the Cdc25-dependent activation of cyclin A-Cdk and cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes (14Herzinger T. Funk J.O. Hillmer K. Eick D. Wolf D.A. Kind P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2151-2156PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M. McCormack A.K. Ellem K.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells undergoing the UV-induced G2 delay appear to be identical to normal early G2 phase cells, and in many respects, the delay appears to be a prolongation of that cell cycle state (15Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M. McCormack A.K. Ellem K.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cells recover from the UV-induced block after a delay of 24 h and recommence normal proliferation (16Milligan A. Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. Mutat. Res. 1998; 422: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A major difference that has been noted between the UV-induced G2-delayed cells and normally cycling cells at the equivalent cell cycle stage was a large increase in the level of p16 protein (17Wang X.-Q. Gabrielli B.G. Milligan A. Dickinson J.L. Antalis T.M. Ellem K.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2510-2514PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of a number of mainly melanoma cell lines either deleted for CDKN2A or that expressed either mutant p16 or Cdk4 showed that only cells lines that expressed both wild-type p16 and Cdk4 displayed a UV-induced G2 delay (16Milligan A. Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. Mutat. Res. 1998; 422: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Of the melanoma cell lines that had lost their UV-induced G2 delay response, two expressed p16 with mutations that abolished Cdk4 (but not Cdk6) binding, and one line expressed the Cdk4 R24C mutation, which abrogated p16 binding (10Castellano M. Pollock P.M. Walters M.K. Sparrow L.E. Down L.M. Gabrielli B.G. Parsons P.G. Hayward N.K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4868-4875PubMed Google Scholar, 16Milligan A. Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. Mutat. Res. 1998; 422: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Wang X.-Q. Gabrielli B.G. Milligan A. Dickinson J.L. Antalis T.M. Ellem K.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2510-2514PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that the effects of p16 on the G2 delay were being mediated through Cdk4, the most likely mechanism being p16 binding and inhibition of a cyclin D-Cdk4 activity. Here we show the existence of a cyclin D3-Cdk4 activity in late S/G2 phase cells that is inhibited in response to UV radiation through the increased association of p16 and provide evidence that this Cdk4 activity is necessary for normal G2 phase cell cycle progression.DISCUSSIONCyclin D-Cdk4 complexes have been reported to exist throughout the cell cycle in many cell types (26Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2261-2268PubMed Google Scholar, 27Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), although the function of these complexes through the cell cycle, apart from regulating the Rb-dependent G1 checkpoint, is unknown. Here we have demonstrated that cyclin D3-Cdk4 complexes are present throughout the cell cycle and that this complex is activated in late S/early G2 phase in both HeLa and A2058 cells. The presence of a Cdk4 activity in G2 phase was first indicated by Matsushimeet al. (27Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), who showed, in mouse fibroblasts overexpressing Cdk4 and cyclin D, peaks of Cdk4 activity both in G1 and G2 cell-enriched fractions. In the cell lines tested here, little G1 phase Cdk4 activity was detected (the low level of Cdk4 activity immunoprecipitated from lysate of asynchronous cultures represents Cdk4 activity from >60% G1 phase cells). The absence of G1 phase Cdk4 activity in Rb-defective cell lines, a consequence of human pappilloma virus-E7 expression in HeLa cells and loss of Rb expression in A2058 cells,2 has been reported by others (28Bates S. Parry D. Bonetta L. Vousden K. Dickson C. Peters G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1633-1640PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lukas J. Parry D. Aagaard L. Mann D.J. Bartkova J. Strauss M. Peters G. Bartek J. Nature. 1995; 375: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar).The high levels of heterodimeric p16-Cdk4 and p16-Cdk6 complexes and monomeric p16 detected in HeLa and A2058 cells are also a common feature of Rb-defective cell lines (30Parry D. Bates S. Mann D.J. Peters G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 31Ragione F.D. Russo G.L. Oliva A. Mercurio C. Mastropietro S. Della Pietra V. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15942-15949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In both HeLa and A2058 cells, only a small proportion of Cdk4 associated with cyclin D3, in agreement with other studies that showed that high levels of p16 expression reduce cyclin D binding to Cdk4 (30Parry D. Bates S. Mann D.J. Peters G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 31Ragione F.D. Russo G.L. Oliva A. Mercurio C. Mastropietro S. Della Pietra V. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15942-15949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).In response to UV exposure, p16 association with Cdk4 is elevated, presumably a result of both increased p16 levels and the increased stability of p16-Cdk4 and p16-Cdk6 complexes. A clear consequence of the increased association of p16 with Cdk4 complexes is the inhibition of cyclin D3-Cdk4 activity. This was correlated with decreased phosphorylation of Cdk4 compared with either normal early G2 phase cells or cells released from the UV-induced block with caffeine. The phosphorylation detected is likely to be at the activating Thr-172 on Cdk4 catalyzed by CAK (32Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Strom D.K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), which has been demonstrated to be blocked by p16 in vitro (33Aprelikova O. Xiong Y. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18195-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The absence of phosphorylated Cdk4 in p16 immunoprecipitates fits well with the proposal that the increased p16 association is inhibiting Thr-172 phosphorylation of Cdk4 and thereby blocking its activation.The observed UV-induced increase in the stability of the p16-Cdk4 and p16-Cdk6 complexes is unexpected. A recent mutational analysis of Cdk4 examining residues involved in p16 binding may provide a mechanism by which this increased complex stability is acquired. This study demonstrated that mutation of Thr-172 to the nonphosphorylatable Ala residue increased p16 binding >2-fold (34Coleman K.G. Wautlet B.S. Morrissey D. Mulheron J. Sedman S.A. Brinkley P. Price S. Webster K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18869-18874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the p16-Cdk6 complex revealed the T-loop containing Thr-172 to lie close to the first ankyrin repeat of p16 (35Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J.O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and the presence of a highly charged phosphoryl group at Thr-172 is likely to alter the binding avidity of p16. Our findings that increased p16 binding correlated with decreased Cdk4 phosphorylation in UV-irradiated cells and that decreased p16 binding following caffeine-induced release from the G2 block correlated with increased Cdk4 phosphorylation support a mechanism where a decrease in Cdk4 Thr-172 phosphorylation may increase p16 binding, which in turn will block the rephosphorylation of Thr-172 by CAK. It is not clear how caffeine changes the balance of phosphorylation and p16 binding so rapidly, and this whole mechanism will require further study.The decreased phosphorylation of Cdk4 during the G2 delay following UV exposure, in particular the absence of any phosphorylation of p16-bound Cdk4, differentiates this Cdk4-dependent cell cycle block from a Cdk4-dependent G1 phase block also initiated by low dose UV radiation (36Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Jinno S. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 376: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that Cdk4 was phosphorylated at Tyr-17 in response to UV radiation of cells in early G1 phase and that this blocked G1 phase progression (36Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Jinno S. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 376: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism appeared to be specific for the G1 block, and cells expressing wild-type Cdk4 or a nonphosphorylatable Cdk4 Y17F mutant were equally susceptible to DNA damage and displayed similar survival when irradiated as they entered S phase, suggesting that later cell cycle checkpoints did not utilize this mechanism.A lot of attention has been given to the role of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes in regulating the G1 phase Rb function, and there is currently little evidence of a role for these complexes later in the cell cycle. Much of the work on cyclin D has focused on cyclin D1, and although there is some degree of functional redundancy between the D-type cyclins, it becoming evident that all D-type cyclins are not equivalent. For example, overexpression of cyclin D1 (but not cyclin D3) accelerated G1 progression in fibroblasts (27Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), and overexpression of cyclins D2 and D3 (but not cyclin D1) inhibited granulocyte differentiation (37Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). In estrogen-stimulated MCF-7 breast cancer cells, cyclin D1 transcript and protein levels correlated with G1 phase progression, whereas expression of cyclin D3 message and protein was delayed, with cyclin D3 protein reaching maximal levels as cells progressed into G2 phase (19Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity differences have also been found between the cyclin D1-Cdk4 and D3-Cdk4 complexes in vivo and in vitro (38Sarcevic B. Lilischkis R. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33327-33337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that different cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes may have distinct functions, dependent on the cell type in which they are expressed and the timing of their expression and activation during the cell cycle.The existence of a G2 phase cyclin D-Cdk4 activity would also imply a regulatory mechanism to control this activity. The constitutive presence of the cyclin D3-Cdk4 complex throughout the cell cycle precludes cyclin-Cdk complex formation; thus, activity must be regulated at the level of phosphorylation and/or CKI interaction, which may act in concert to ensure very tight regulation. Agents or conditions that increase CKI levels at a particular point in the cell cycle presumably utilize these inhibitors to block cell cycle progression beyond that point until this inhibition is relieved. There are many reports demonstrating that overexpression of p16 inhibits cyclin D-Cdk4-dependent phosphorylation of Rb and G1 phase progression (29Lukas J. Parry D. Aagaard L. Mann D.J. Bartkova J.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2939-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Small increases in endogenously expressed p16 protein were found as serum-stimulated cells entered S phase (43Tam S.W. Shay J.W. Pagano M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5816-5820PubMed Google Scholar) and at the S/G2 transition in synchronized HeLa cells (17Wang X.-Q. Gabrielli B.G. Milligan A. Dickinson J.L. Antalis T.M. Ellem K.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2510-2514PubMed Google Scholar), although these were not correlated with discernible cell cycle delays. Much larger increases in p16 levels have been found in senescing cells, correlating with inhibition of the G1 and S phase cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases (44Alcorta D.A. Xiong Y. Phelps D. Hannon G. Beach D. Barrett J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13742-13747Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), and as a delayed response to low doses of UV radiation, correlating with a G2 delay (16Milligan A. Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2510-2514PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibition of cyclin D3-Cdk4 (this report). The UV-induced elevated p16 levels appear to be a specific response to UV-induced damage, as other genotoxic agents that produce a G2 delay in HeLa and A2058 cells,e.g. cisplatin and ionizing radiation, do not affect p16 protein levels. 3S. Goldstone, J. Sinnamon, S. Pavey, and B. G. Gabrielli, manuscript in preparation. Interestingly, a recent report has provided evidence for a p16-dependent checkpoint in G1 in response to a wide variety of DNA-damaging agents in p53-deficient cell lines (45Shapiro G.I. Edwards C.D. Ewen M.E. Rollins B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This checkpoint is dependent on Rb and Cdk4, although the levels of p16 appeared unchanged in this response, differentiating it from the UV response investigated here, which appears to be independent of Rb function.The data reported here provide evidence for a cyclin D-Cdk4 activity in late S/G2 phase that appears to be required for normal cell cycle progression through G2 phase into mitosis. This Cdk4 activity is inhibited in response to UV radiation, and inhibition of this activity appears to be involved in the G2 phase delay observed. It will be of interest to see whether this role for p16 in a G2 checkpoint is UV-specific or a more general cell cycle checkpoint control. It may also provide a mechanistic basis for the strong genetic and epidemiological evidence linking UV radiation, p16 CDKN2A function and melanoma. Loss of normal cell cycle control mechanisms is a common theme in the development of most cancers, in particular the loss of mechanisms involved in sensing and repairing DNA damage. An increasing number of tumor suppressor genes have been found to be intimately involved in DNA damage responses, including cell cycle responses.

Rb was identified as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, and its gene product (Rb) has a pivotal role in the late G1 phase restriction point (3Weinberg R.A.

CDKN2A itself is mutated, deleted, or hypermethylated in a high proportion of human tumors (9Foulkes W.D. Flanders T.Y. Pollock P.M. Hayward N.K. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 5-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).CDKN2A has also been identified as a melanoma susceptibility gene (10Castellano M. Pollock P.M. Walters M.K. Sparrow L.E. Down L.M. Gabrielli B.G.

Cell cycle responses to DNA damage induced by suberythemal doses of UV radiation include both G1 and G2 phase delays. G1 delays appear to be through a p53-dependent mechanism, with increased expression of p21 resulting in inhibition of G1 cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases (11Poon R.Y.C. Jiang W. Toyoshima H. Hunter T.

The G2 delay is p53-independent and is via a block in the Cdc25-dependent activation of cyclin A-Cdk and cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes (14Herzinger T. Funk J.O. Hillmer K. Eick D. Wolf D.A. Kind P.

Cells undergoing the UV-induced G2 delay appear to be identical to normal early G2 phase cells, and in many respects, the delay appears to be a prolongation of that cell cycle state (15Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M. McCormack A.K. Ellem K.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cells recover from the UV-induced block after a delay of 24 h and recommence normal proliferation (16Milligan A. Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. Mutat. Res. 1998; 422: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A major difference that has been noted between the UV-induced G2-delayed cells and normally cycling cells at the equivalent cell cycle stage was a large increase in the level of p16 protein (17Wang X.-Q. Gabrielli B.G. Milligan A. Dickinson J.L. Antalis T.M. Ellem K.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2510-2514PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of a number of mainly melanoma cell lines either deleted for CDKN2A or that expressed either mutant p16 or Cdk4 showed that only cells lines that expressed both wild-type p16 and Cdk4 displayed a UV-induced G2 delay (16Milligan A. Gabrielli B.G. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. Mutat. Res. 1998; 422: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Of the melanoma cell lines that had lost their UV-induced G2 delay response, two expressed p16 with mutations that abolished Cdk4 (but not Cdk6) binding, and one line expressed the Cdk4 R24C mutation, which abrogated p16 binding (10Castellano M.

To begin to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of cytokine genes, we wanted to determine which transcription factors are activated by PGN in mouse RAW264.7 and human THP-1 macrophage cells. Our results demonstrated that: (i) PGN induced phosphorylation of the transcription factors ATF-1 and CREB; (ii) ATF-1 and CREB bound DNA as a dimer and induced transcriptional activation of a CRE reporter plasmid, which was inhibited by dominant negative CREB and ATF-1; (iii) PGN induced phosphorylation of c-Jun, protein synthesis of JunB and c-Fos, and transcriptional activation of the AP-1 reporter plasmid, which was inhibited by dominant negative c-Fos; and (iv) PGN-induced activation of CREB/ATF and AP-1 was mediated through CD14. This is the first study to demonstrate activation of CREB/ATF and AP-1 transcription factors by PGN or by any other component of Gram-positive bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2060719924,"We have recently shown that phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) is activated by tau, a neuronal cell-specific microtubule-associated protein, in the presence of arachidonic acid. We now report that non-neuronal tissues also contain a protein that can activate PLC-γ in the presence of arachidonic acid. Purification of this activator from bovine lung cytosol yielded several proteins with apparent molecular sizes of 70–130 kDa. They were identified as fragments derived from an unusually large protein (∼700 kDa) named AHNAK, which comprises about 30 repeated motifs each 128 amino acids in length. Two AHNAK fragments containing one and four of the repeated motifs, respectively, were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins. Both recombinant proteins activated PLC-γ1 at nanomolar concentrations in the presence of arachidonic acid, suggesting that an intact AHNAK molecule contains multiple sites for PLC-γ activation. The role of arachidonic acid was to promote a physical interaction between AHNAK and PLC-γ1, and the activation by AHNAK and arachidonic acid was mainly attributable to reduction in the enzyme's apparent K m toward the substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), generating two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol. To date, a total of 10 different isozymes of PLC have been identified in mammalian cells, which can be classified into three major subfamilies, β (β1 to β4), γ (γ1 and γ2), and δ (δ1 to δ4) isozymes, based on their primary structures (1Rhee S.G Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Their structural differences correlate with varying mechanisms for their activation. Stimulation of β-isozymes by many agonists occurs through receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins and is mediated by the α-subunits of the Gq subfamily members and by βγ-subunits. In contrast, the γ-isozymes are activated when phosphorylated by various receptor-coupled protein-tyrosine kinases (1Rhee S.G Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggested alternative mechanisms for PLC-γ activation in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. Jones and Carpenter (2Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20845-20850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that phosphatidic acid could activate both tyrosine-phosphorylated and -unphosphorylated forms of PLC-γ to a similar extent. Since phosphatidic acid is the immediate product of phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by phospholipase D, activation of phospholipase D in cells may lead to subsequent activation of PLC-γ. We (3Bae Y.S.

A considerable portion (30–50%) of IP3 generated in response to platelet-derived growth factor was not a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ but rather a secondary event following PIP3generation by platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (3Bae Y.S.

We have also shown that variously spliced forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (6Hwang S.C. Jhon D.Y. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18342-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) stimulate PLC-γ activity independently of tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (AA). Although the concentration of AA in resting cells is quite low, a large quantity of AA can be liberated from phosphatidylcholine by the action of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) upon cell activation (7Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that certain stimuli that elicit cPLA2 activation may indirectly cause the activation of PLC-γ if the tau proteins are present. Tau proteins are exclusively expressed in neuronal cells (8Lee G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here, we report that non-neuronal cells also contain a protein that can activate PLC-γ in concert with AA, and we identify it as AHNAK. Our finding further bolsters the thesis that indirect activation of PLC-γ can occur in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. AA and cholesterol were purchased from Calbiochem. PIP2 was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [inositol-2-3H]PIP2and [2-3H]myo-inositol were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. PLC isozymes (PLC-β1, -γ1, -γ2, and -δ1) were purified from HeLa cells that had been transfected with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the entire coding sequence of the respective enzyme as described (9Park D. Jhon D.Y. Kriz R. Knopf J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16048-16055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All manipulations were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. During purification, PLC-γ1-activating activity was measured at 30 °C for 10 min in 100 μl of a reaction mixture containing 36,000 cpm of [3H]PIP2, 30 μm PIP2, 120 μm PE, 30 μm PS, 30 μm cholesterol, 30 μm arachidonic acid, PLC-γ1 (10 ng), 3 mmCaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.033% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), and a source of activator. To maintain the stimulated activity in the linear range of the assay, we adjusted the amount of PLC to obtain an unstimulated, basal activity in the range of a 500–1200 cpm of [3H]IP3 generated. The purification procedure consisted of the following steps. Fresh bovine lungs (3.0 kg) were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and homogenized in 10 liters of a solution containing 20 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and aprotinin (1 μg/ml) with a Waring blender. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged further at 13,000 × g for 1 h. Collected supernatant was heated at 80 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper to eliminate lipids. The heat-treated supernatant (5 g of protein) was applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-4B column (5 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. After washing with the equilibration buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 2 liters of a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in the buffer at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Fractions (20 ml) were collected and assayed for PLC-γ1-activating activity (see Fig. 1 A). Peak fractions (fractions 59–61) were pooled and dialyzed against equilibration buffer. The dialyzed protein (12 mg) from the previous step was applied to a TSKgel DEAE-5PW HPLC column (21.5 × 150 mm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with equilibration buffer for 5 min followed by a linear gradient of 0–1.0m NaCl in equilibration buffer over 40 min (see Fig.1 B). Fractions (5 ml) were collected and assayed for PLC-γ1-activating activity. Peak fractions (numbers 15–18) were pooled and dialyzed against equilibration buffer. Purified proteins (∼700 μg) from the DEAE-5PW column were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE on 8% gel (3-mm thickness, single-well comb). The gel was stained lightly with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and visualized protein bands were excised from the gel with a razor blade. The proteins were then eluted with an Electro-Eluter (C.B.S. Scientific, Del Mar, CA). Coomassie Brilliant Blue and SDS were extracted with isobutyl alcohol, and proteins were precipitated by cold acetone. Electroeluted proteins (10 μg each) from three different bands (bands 1–3 in Fig. 1 C) were digested with trypsin for 24 h and subjected to HPLC analysis on a Vydac C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by a linear acetonitrile gradient of 0–70% (v/v) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 70 min. The peptides isolated were subjected to amino acid sequencing analysis. The mixed micellar substrate was prepared as follows. Chloroform solutions of lipids (PIP2, PS, cholesterol, and PE in a molar ratio of 1:1:1:1:4 plus [3H]PIP2 as the tracer, together with various amounts of fatty acids where stated) were mixed and dried under N2 stream. Dried lipids were dispersed by sonication in a buffer composed of 50 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.067% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. The assay was started by mixing 50 μl of the micellar substrate with 50 μl of a solution containing PLC and the samples to be tested. The final assay mixture (100 μl) typically contained 10–20 ng of PLC-γ1; a 30 μmconcentration each of [3H]PIP2 (8–10 × 103 cpm), PS, and cholesterol; 120 μm PE in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0); 120 mm KCl; 10 mm NaCl; 0.033% deoxycholate; 1 mmMgCl2; 2 mm EGTA; and 1 μm free Ca2+ ions, unless otherwise stated. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), followed by centrifugation. The amount of radioactivity in the resulting supernatant, corresponding to liberated [3H]IP3, was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. In the case of the kinetic analysis, the micellar substrate was prepared with [3H]PIP2 without other lipids in a buffer containing 10 mm octyl glucoside instead of sodium deoxycholate. Wells of microtiter plates (Immuno Plate MaxiSorp, Nunc) were coated with AHNAK by incubating with 100 μl of a 10 μg/ml protein solution in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0) at 4 °C overnight. After further incubation with 300 μl of 1% BSA for 1 h, wells were washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20. Incubation with PLC-γ1 was carried out in a total volume of 100 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 μm free Ca2+ ions, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 100 μmarachidonic acid plus various amounts of PLC-γ1 and proteins to be tested at ambient temperature for 1 h. Wells were then washed twice with 200 μl of the same buffer containing 0.02% Tween 20. Bound materials were eluted by incubating with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 30 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. PLC-γ1 on the membrane was detected by using a specific monoclonal antibody (F-7–2) (10Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Choi W.C. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG goat antibody. We previously noticed that the addition of crude cytosol of bovine brain or HeLa cells to purified PLC-γ markedly enhanced PIP2-hydrolyzing activity measured in the presence of AA. We then identified the bovine brain activator as tau (6Hwang S.C. Jhon D.Y. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18342-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Since tau is exclusively expressed in neuronal cells, we presumed that the stimulating activity seen in HeLa cell extract was due to a protein with functional similarity to tau and initiated the isolation of this presumed non-neuronal PLC-γ activator. We screened various tissues and selected bovine lung cytosol for large scale purification of the PLC-γ activator. The increase in PLC-γ activity toward a mixed micellar substrate containing PIP2and AA was monitored throughout the purification. Treatment of bovine lung cytosol at 80 °C for 10 min resulted in a great enrichment of PLC-γ activator (data not shown). The heat-treated cytosol fraction was subjected to sequential chromatographies on heparin-Sepharose CL-4B and DEAE-5PW columns to yield a sharp activity peak that coincided with a discrete protein peak (Fig. 1,A and B). SDS-PAGE of the peak fraction showed closely spaced protein bands with apparent molecular masses ranging from 70 to 130 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane T). Further attempts at purification including gel filtration on TSKgel G3000-SW or ion exchange chromatography on Mono Q failed to separate these proteins. Thus, proteins were fractionated on a preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and four major protein bands between 70 and 130 kDa were excised and electroeluted (Fig. 1 C). After the removal of SDS, each eluted protein was tested for PLC-γ-activating activity. All of the eluted proteins activated PLC-γ1 (Fig.1 D). Three of the electroeluted proteins (bands 1–3 in Fig. 1 C) were individually digested with trypsin and analyzed on a reverse phase HPLC column. The peptide maps for bands 1, 2, and 3 were very similar (data not shown), suggesting that these three proteins were related. Seven peptides including two that were common to all three electroeluted proteins were sequenced to yield 1) LKGPK, 2) VDIDVPDVDVQGPDWHL, 3) FSMPGFK, 4) VPDVNIEGPDAK, 5) VKGDVDVSLPK, 6) ADIEISGPK, and 7) GDVDVSLPK. A search of data bases revealed that the sequence of an unusually large protein named AHNAK (meaning “giant” in Hebrew; Ref. 11Shtivelman E. Cohen F.E. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5472-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) carries exact coding sequences for all seven tryptic peptides; the sequences of peptides 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 were found 29, 17, 9, 10, and 9 times, respectively, in the different regions of AHNAK, whereas the sequence of peptide 2 was found to match AHNAK residues 3923–3939 and 4387–4403, and peptide 6 corresponded only to AHNAK residues 4096–4104. AHNAK is a 5643-membered protein composed of highly conserved repeated motifs (see below). Thus, the purified activator proteins are probably fragments derived from AHNAK protein. The ability of the purified AHNAK fragments to activate PLC-γ, measured with a mixed micellar substrate containing PIP2 plus PE, PS, cholesterol, and sodium deoxycholate, was dependent on unsaturated fatty acids. As shown in Fig.2 A, various unsaturated fatty acids were all somewhat effective in stimulating PLC-γ in the presence of AHNAK when tested at a concentration of 30 μm, whereas these lipids alone had no effect. However, corresponding saturated fatty acids were ineffective even at higher concentrations (up to 100 μm). Among those tested, AA was the most potent stimulant of PLC-γ activity in the presence of the activator, and half-maximal stimulation was observed at 25 μm (Fig. 2 B). AA was equally effective when added to preformed micelles as when incorporated into the substrate micelles (data not shown). The combined effects of the purified lung AHNAK and AA on PIP2 hydrolysis by PLC-β1, -γ1, -γ2, and -δ1 were compared in the presence of an excess amount of AHNAK (Fig.3). Activation by AHNAK and AA were apparent with both PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 (7–9-fold). Stimulation of the activity of PLC-δ1 was less apparent, and PLC-β1 activity was not affected at all. AHNAK contains approximately 30 repeats of a highly conserved motif, most of which are 128 amino acids in length (see Fig. 13). We investigated if one or several units of this repeated motif are capable of stimulating PLC-γ1. We prepared two GST-AHNAK fusion proteins (Fig. 4 A), one containing only one repeat (GST-AHNAK-R1) corresponding to AHNAK residues 3470–3882 and the other containing three full repeats and two split one-half repeats (GST-AHNAK-R4) corresponding to residues 3817–4412 (see Fig. 13 B). The two GST-AHNAK fusion proteins from E. coli could stimulate the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of PLC-γ1 in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of AA, whereas GST alone in concentrations up to 100 nm had little effect on the activity (Fig. 4 B). GST-AHNAK-R1 was somewhat less potent than the longer form, but both stimulated apparent PLC-γ1 activity more than 10-fold at concentrations as low as 10 nm. Half-maximal stimulation by the longer form was observed at 1.5 nm in the presence of 100 μmAA. In the absence of AA, both forms were ineffective in stimulating PLC-γ1, consistent with the behavior of the AHNAK fragments purified from bovine lung. We also reevaluated the sensitivity of PLC-β1, -γ1, and -δ1 isozymes using the GST-AHNAK fusion protein (Fig.5). Activation of PLC-γ1 was again most efficient. PLC-δ1 was also activated by the combination of AA and GST-AHNAK-R4 but to a lesser extent compared with PLC-γ1, and the activity of PLC-β1 was not affected at all, thus confirming the result with AHNAK fragments purified from bovine lung (Fig. 3).Figure 4Activation of PLC-γ1 by GST-AHNAK fusion proteins.

At a free Ca2+concentration of 10−6m, the stimulation was maximum at an Mg2+ concentration of 1 mm, which is close to physiological concentrations, and declined at higher concentrations (Fig. 6 A). The mechanism by which Mg2+ ions potentiated AHNAK-stimulated activity was not clear, but the basal activity of PLC-γ1 in the absence of AHNAK and AA was not significantly affected by the addition of Mg2+ ions. Stimulation of PLC-γ1 activity by GST-AHNAK-R4 plus AA was also investigated at different concentrations of free Ca2+ ions (Fig. 6 B). Activities of all PLC isozymes are dependent on Ca2+ ions (12Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), and the activity of PLC-γ1 increases rapidly from 10−8m of Ca2+ to reach a plateau at 10−6m of Ca2+ (13Wahl M.I. Jones G.A. Nishibe S. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10447-10456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PLC-γ1 activity stimulated by GST-AHNAK-R4 plus AA showed a similar Ca2+ dependence. AA alone had some stimulative action at 10−4m of Ca2+ (Fig.6 B). Because the tau protein also stimulates PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 rather specifically among various PLC isozymes in the presence of AA (6Hwang S.C. Jhon D.Y. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18342-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we asked whether tau and AHNAK share a common activation mechanism. As shown in Fig. 7, AHNAK was no longer effective at enhancing the PLC-γ1 activity in the presence of a saturating concentration of tau. This result indicates that the tau interaction site on PLC-γ overlaps with that of AHNAK. The effect of AHNAK and AA on PLC-γ activity at various concentrations of PIP2 was evaluated using a micellar substrate system composed of PIP2 and octyl glucoside. In the presence of 2–20 mm octyl glucoside, the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of PLC-γ was comparable with that measured with the mixed micellar substrate containing PIP2 plus PE, PS, cholesterol, and sodium deoxycholate (data not shown). With this simplified substrate system, AHNAK and AA activated PLC-γ activity only 3-fold, which compares with the 7–9-fold activation observed in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 with the substrate consisting of PIP2, PE, PS, cholesterol, and sodium deoxycholate. However, the effective concentrations of AHNAK and AA were unchanged. The initial rate of PIP2 hydrolysis was measured with varying concentration of PIP2 in the presence and absence of GST-AHNAK-R4 and AA. A plot of these data according to the Eaddie-Hofstee equation gave fairly straight lines (Fig.8). It appeared that the apparentV max was not affected by the presence of saturating concentrations of GST-AHNAK-R4 and AA, whereas the apparent K m for PIP2 was considerably reduced from 24 ± 4 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 4) to 8 ± 1 μm(n = 4). Because AHNAK could activate PLC-γ1 efficiently even at concentrations as low as 1 nm (Fig. 4 B), we presumed that AHNAK might form a tight complex with PLC-γ1. To prove this, GST-AHNAK-R4 was immobilized onto the wells of microtiter plates, and PLC-γ1 was incubated in the coated wells containing AA. Bound PLC-γ1 was eluted from the wells with a SDS-containing buffer and detected by immunoblot analysis. Binding of PLC-γ1 to immobilized AHNAK was clearly detected, while no binding was seen with a control well that had been coated with BSA (Fig.9 A). The binding to GST-AHNAK-R4 was completely abolished by the addition of GST-AHNAK-R4, but not by the addition of GST, to the well containing PLC-γ (Fig. 9 A). Moreover, we found that the binding was dependent on AA. As is shown in Fig. 9 B, in the presence of AA the binding was detectable at PLC-γ1 concentrations as low as 1 μg/ml and increased in a PLC-γ1 concentration-dependent manner. However, in the absence of AA, the binding was hardly seen even at 30 μg/ml PLC-γ1. These results indicate that PLC-γ1 directly interacts with AHNAK, and the role of AA is to potentiate the interaction. We could also precipitate the complex of GST-AHNAK-R4 and PLC-γ1 in the presence of AA using glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (data not shown). However, this experiment suffered from high background, probably due to nonspecific binding of PLC-γ1 to the beads. Increasing amounts of cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells, which are rich in AHNAK and PLC-γ1, were incubated with a mixed micellar substrate containing [3H]PIP2 and octyl glucoside. Hydrolysis of [3H]PIP2 was stimulated by the addition of AA, but a saturated fatty acid (stearic acid) was ineffective (Fig.10). The addition of recombinant AHNAK to the reaction mixture did not further the effect of AA. Thus, it appeared that these cells contained a saturating amount of AA-dependent activator for PLC and also that no other components in the soluble fraction of HeLa cells significantly inhibited this activation process. Background activity in the absence of AA was probably due to PLC-γ1 as well as other PLC isozymes like PLC-β1, PLC-β3, and PLC-δ1 that are known to exist in HeLa cells (HeLa cells do not contain PLC-γ2 isozyme). 2S. B. Lee and S. G. Rhee, unpublished observation. Since AHNAK and AA stimulated PLC-δ1 isozyme to a smaller but significant extent (Figs. 3 and 5), we evaluated the contribution of PLC-γ1 to the AHNAK/AA-stimulated activity by employing TV-1 embryonic fibroblasts derived from the PLC-γ1 null mouse (14Ji Q.S.

The TV-1 cells expressed no detectable amount of PLC-γ1 and very low levels of PLC-γ2 (14Ji Q.S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell. 1998; 9: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PLC-γ1-expressing cells were obtained by infecting TV-1 cells with vaccinia virus harboring the PLC-γ1 gene. Expression of PLC-γ1 by the viral vector was detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 11, inset). Cytosolic fractions were obtained from either control TV-1 cells infected with empty virus or the PLC-γ1-expressing TV-1 cells, and the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of the cytosolic fractions was measured in the presence and absence of AA (Fig. 11). The PLC activity in the control cells was low and not affected by the addition of AA. In contrast, the PLC activity in the cytosol from PLC-γ1-expressing cells was higher than that from control cells and substantially enhanced by the addition of AA. These results indicate that the γ-isozyme is the main target of AA stimulation. Membranes were isolated from HeLa cells that had been metabolically labeled with [3H]myo-inositol for 24 h, washed, and used as substrate for exogenously added PLC-γ1. AA again augmented the release of inositol phosphates by PLC-γ1, but the addition of recombinant AHNAK did not cause further augmentation (Fig.12 A). In a separate experiment, the labeled membranes were extracted with organic solvents to remove proteins and then used as the substrate. This time, AA alone did not cause much stimulation of PLC-γ activity, whereas the addition of AHNAK rendered AA capable of stimulating PLC-γ activity. (Fig. 12 B). These results suggest that the buffer-washed membrane preparation contained enough AHNAK to activate PLC-γ1 in the presence of AA and that AHNAK and AA were capable of stimulating the activity of PLC-γ1 toward cell membrane phosphoinositides. In the present study, we find that, like tau, AHNAK activates PLC-γ in the presence of AA. AHNAK was initially isolated as a 680-kDa protein uniquely localized to the desmosomes of bovine muzzle epidermal cells and termed desmoyokin (16Hieda Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 1"

Using amino- and carboxyl-terminal tagged G6PT, we demonstrate that proteolytic digestion of intact microsomes resulted in the cleavage of both tags, indicating that both termini of G6PT face the cytoplasm. This is consistent with ten and twelve transmembrane domain models for G6PT predicted by hydropathy analyses. A region of G6PT corresponding to amino acid residues 50–71, which constitute a transmembrane segment in the twelve-domain model, are situated in a 51-residue luminal loop in the ten-domain model. To determine which of these two models is correct, we generated two G6PT mutants, T53N and S55N, that created a potential Asn-linked glycosylation site at residues 53–55 (N53SS) or 55–57 (N55QS), respectively. N53SS or N55QS would be glycosylated only if it is situated in a luminal loop larger than 33 residues as predicted by the ten-domain model. Whereas wild-type G6PT is not a glycoprotein, both T53N and S55N mutants are glycosylated, strongly supporting the ten-helical model for G6PT.

The disease presents with both clinical and biochemical heterogeneity consistent with the existence of two major subgroups, GSD-1a and GSD-1b. GSD-1a, the most prevalent form of GSD-1 (1Chen Y.-T. Burchell A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 935-965Google Scholar), is caused by mutations in the G6Pase gene that abolish or greatly reduce G6Pase activity (2Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The active site of G6Pase is situated inside the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (3Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J.

Therefore, the glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) substrate, which is present in the cytoplasm, must be translocated across the ER membrane to be converted to glucose and phosphate by G6Pase, a key enzyme in glucose homeostasis (4Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). This led Arion et al. (5Arion W.J. Ballas L.M. Lange A.J.

Based on this concept, Narisawa et al. (7Narisawa K. Igarashi Y. Otomo H. Tada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 1360-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and Langeet al.

Both GSD-1a and GSD-1b are characterized by hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, kidney enlargement, growth retardation, lactic acidemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia, consequences of a functional G6Pase deficiency (1Chen Y.-T.

Additionally, GSD-1b patients also manifest infectious complications because of a heritable neutropenia and functional deficiencies of neutrophils and monocytes (9Beaudet A.L. Anderson D.C.

Mammalian G6PTs are membrane-associated proteins of 429 amino acids, each of which contains an ER transmembrane protein retention signal at its carboxyl (COOH) terminus (11Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M.

More recently, we have developed a functional assay for the recombinant G6PT protein and shown that mutations uncovered in the G6PT gene of GSD-1b patients abolish G6P transport activity (14Hiraiwa H.

Hydropathy profile analysis of the G6PT amino acid sequence predicts that this transporter is anchored in the ER membrane by either ten (18Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar) or twelve (11Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E.

The major difference between the two G6PT models is that amino acid residues 50–71, which constitute the transmembrane segment-2 in the twelve-domain model (11Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), are part of a 51-residue loop in the ten-domain model. A survey of mammalian multi-span membrane proteins has revealed that for a potential Asn-linked glycosylation site to be used, it must be situated inside the ER lumen, and the size of the hydrophilic loop must be at least 33-amino acids in length (20Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein glycosylation can provide useful topological information for membrane proteins. In this report, we have analyzed the orientation of human G6PT in the ER membrane. We used the 8 amino acid FLAG marker peptide to tag the amino (NH2) or COOH termini of G6PT and inserted two factor Xa protease cleavage sites (22Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) between G6PT and its terminal tag, which allows the in situ removal of the tag without affecting the G6PT protein. Our results show that human G6PT contains an even number of transmembrane helices with both NH2 and COOH termini facing the cytoplasm. To distinguish between the ten- and twelve-domain models of G6PT, we constructed two G6PT mutants, T53N and S55N, which create potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites at residues 53–55 and 55–57, respectively, and examined G6PT synthesis by transient expression and in vitro translation studies. Our data show that although the wild-type (WT) G6PT protein is nonglycosylated, the newly introduced glycosylation sites at either residues 53–55 (NSS) or 55–57 (NQS) are used, confirming the ten transmembrane helical model of G6PT. In vitrotranscription-translation of G6PT cDNA constructs, in a pGEM-7Zf(+) vector, was performed using the transcription and translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system obtained from Promega Biotech (Madison, WI).l-[35S]methionine was used as the labeled precursor. The in vitro synthesized proteins were analyzed by 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis and fluoro-autoradiography. Nucleotides 166–1486 of the human G6PT cDNA (11Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which contains the entire coding region (nucleotides 170–1459), were used as a template for mutant construction by polymerase chain reaction. The 8-amino acid FLAG marker peptide, DYKDDDDK (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak, CT) was used to tag the NH2 and COOH termini of G6PT. The 5′-primer for the NH2-terminal FLAG G6PT (G6PT-5′FLAG) contained an ATG initiation codon followed by the 24-bp FLAG coding sequence (5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG-3′) and nucleotides 170–190 of human G6PT; the 3′-primer contained nucleotides 1439–1459 of human G6PT. The 5′-primer for COOH-terminal FLAG G6PT (G6PT-3′FLAG) contained nucleotides 166–187 of human G6PT; the 3′-primer contained the last coding nucleotides (1439–1459) of human G6PT, followed by the 24-bp FLAG coding sequence and a termination codon. The amplified fragments were ligated into the pSVL vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The G6PT-fXaFLAG plasmids with two factor Xa tetrapeptide recognition motifs (IEGR) (22Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol.

The 5′-primer for the NH2-terminal FLAG-fXa-G6PT (G6PT-5′fXaFLAG) contained an ATG initiation codon followed by the 24-bp FLAG coding sequence, two fXa recognition sequence (ATCGAGGGTAGAATCGAGGGTAGA), and nucleotides 170–190 of human G6PT; the 3′-primer contained nucleotides 1439–1459 of human G6PT. The 5′-primer for the COOH-terminal fXa-FLAG G6PT (G6PT-3′fXaFLAG) contained nucleotides 166–187 of human G6PT; the 3′-primer contained the last coding nucleotides (1439–1459) of human G6PT, followed by the 24-bp fXa recognition sequence, the 24-bp FLAG coding sequence, and a termination codon. The amplified fragments were ligated into the pSVL vector. The two outside polymerase chain reaction primers for codon 53 (nucleotides 326–328) and codon 55 (nucleotides 332–334) mutants are nucleotides 164–187 (sense) and nucleotides 851–878 (antisense) of human G6PT. The antisense primer contains a BstEII site, located at nucleotides 863–869 in human G6PT (11Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Codon 53 (ACC, Thr) mutant primers (nucleotides 317–337) are (AAC, Asn) and codon 55 (AGC, Ser) mutant primers (nucleotides 323–343) are (AAC, Asn) or (CGC, Arg); mutant bases are denoted in boldface letters. The amplified fragments were ligated into the pGEM7ZhG6PT-BstEII-3′ or pSVLhG6PT-3′FLAG-BstEII-3′ fragment. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with streptomycin, penicillin, and 4% fetal bovine serum. The G6PT construct in a pSVL vector was transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Each construct was present at 30 μg and the pSVL vector DNA was included in each transfection to a final concentration of 60 μg plasmid DNA per 150-cm2 flask. Mock transfections of COS-1 cultures with the pSVL vector (60 μg) alone were used as controls. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 days, the transfected cultures were harvested for microsomal G6P uptake and Western blot analyses. For Western blot analysis of tagged G6PT, microsomal proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). The filters were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Scientific Imaging Systems). The immunocomplex was then incubated with a second antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and visualized by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium substrate (Kirkegarrd & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). G6P uptake measurements were performed essentially as described previously (14Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes (40 μg) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 250 mmsucrose, and 0.2 mm [U-14C]G6P (50 μCi/μmol). The reaction was stopped at the appropriate time by filtering immediately through a nitrocellulose filter (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) and washed with an ice-cold solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose. Microsomes permeabilized with 0.2% deoxycholate, which abolished G6P uptake, were used as negative controls. Two to three independent experiments were conducted, and at least two G6P uptake studies were performed for each microsomal preparation. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. G6PT-5′fXaFLAG-, G6PT-3′fXaFLAG-, G6PT-5′FLAG-, or G6PT-3′FLAG-transfected COS-1 cultures were used for protease protection assays. Cell homogenates (100 μg of protein) were treated with 7.5 μg of factor Xa protease (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 2 h at room temperature in a reaction mixture (75 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Then, dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone (Calbiochem) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm to inactivate factor Xa. The reaction mixture was then diluted 100-fold to 7.5 ml with cold buffer A (0.25 m sucrose and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in buffer A and used for Western blot analysis. Sequence analysis predicts the presence of a potential Asn-linked glycosylation site at amino acids 354–356, conserved among human, mouse, and rat G6PT proteins (11Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M.

This site is predicted to be located in a 17-amino acid loop in the ten-domain model (Fig.1) or in helix 10 in the twelve-domain model, thus would not satisfy the criteria as an acceptor for oligosaccharides in either model. In vitro translation assays showed that human, mouse, or rat G6PT cDNA supported the synthesis of a 37-kDa polypeptide both in the absence or presence of canine microsomal membranes (Fig. 2), confirming that this glycosylation site is not normally used.Figure 2Analysis of G6PT synthesis by in vitro transcription-translation of human, mouse, or rat G6PT cDNA in the absence or presence of canine microsomal membranes. l-[35S]methionine was used as the labeled precursor, and after electrophoresis, the proteins were visualized by fluoro-autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequence analysis predicts that G6PT is anchored in the ER membrane by ten (18Hoffman K.

Because microsomes are closed vesicles with a defined cytoplasmic-side out orientation (24Wessels H.P. Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), protease protection assays using NH2- and COOH-terminal tagged G6PT constructs should allow us to assess the location of its NH2 and COOH termini with respect to the ER lumen. To tag G6PT, we used the 8-amino acid FLAG marker peptide, DYKDDDDK, which has been successfully used to tag human G6Pase (3Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the FLAG-tagged G6PT proteins are targeted to the ER membrane and retain G6P transport activity, we examined microsomal G6P uptake in COS-1 cells transfected with the WT or a FLAG-tagged G6PT construct. In earlier studies, we have demonstrated that G6Pase greatly facilitates G6P transport into the ER lumen by the G6PT protein (14Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the presence of a co-transfected G6Pase cDNA, G6P was efficiently taken up by intact microsomes isolated from COS-1 cells transfected with the G6PT-WT cDNA (Fig.3 A). Microsomal G6P uptake activity in G6PT-5′FLAG/G6Pase-transfected cells (Fig. 3 B) was indistinguishable from that of G6PT-WT-transfected cells (Fig.3 A), suggesting that a small 5′FLAG tag did not interfere with G6P transport function of the G6PT protein. Significant levels of microsomal G6P uptake activity (approximately 71% of G6PT-WT activity) was also observed in COS-1 cells transfected with G6PT-3′FLAG/G6Pase cDNAs (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that G6PT is less tolerant of a small COOH-terminal tag. Both the ten and the twelve transmembrane helical models predict that NH2 and COOH termini of G6PT are situated at the same side of the ER membrane. The presence of an ER transmembrane retention signal at the COOH termini of mammalian G6PT proteins suggests that COOH terminus of G6PT faces the cytoplasm (25Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Thus, in intact microsomes, both NH2- and COOH-terminal FLAG tags in G6PT should be sensitive to proteolytic digestion. However, unlike G6Pase, which is resistant to limited proteolytic digestion (3Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the G6PT protein is sensitive to proteolysis as trypsin at 10 μg/mg microsomal protein rapidly abolishes G6P transport activity of the G6PT protein both in the absence or presence of G6Pase. 2C.-J. Pan, B. Lin, J. Y. Chou, unpublished results. To accurately determine the topology of G6PT, we inserted two factor Xa protease recognition motifs (22Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) between the G6PT coding region and the FLAG tag to yield G6PT-5′fXaFLAG and G6PT-3′fXaFLAG constructs, and examined G6P transport by transient expression assays. Significant G6P uptake activities were observed in microsomes from either G6PT-5′fXaFLAG/G6Pase or G6PT-3′fXaFLAG/G6Pase-transfected cells (Fig.3 C), albeit at reduced efficiencies. Our data suggest that both G6PT-5′fXaFLAG and G6PT-3′fXaFLAG constructs were anchored in the ER membrane and functioned as a G6P transporter. Intact microsomes, isolated from G6PT-5′fXaFLAG or G6PT-3′fXaFLAG transfected COS-1 cells, were then subjected to digestion by factor Xa and the presence of the FLAG epitope was visualized by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). Microsomes isolated from G6PT-5′FLAG or G6PT-3′FLAG-transfected cells were used as controls. The FLAG tag in microsomes of G6PT-5′fXaFLAG or G6PT-3′fXaFLAG-transfected cells was cleaved by factor Xa protease (Fig. 4), indicating that both NH2 and COOH termini of human G6PT face the cytoplasm and that human G6PT possesses an even number of transmembrane helices. Amino acid sequence analysis of G6PT predicts that the native protein contains no factor Xa recognition motifs. The FLAG tag in microsomes of either G6PT-5′FLAG or G6PT-3′FLAG transfected cells was resistant to factor Xa digestion (Fig. 4), as expected. The major difference between the two topological models of G6PT is that residues 50–71, which constitutes helix 2 in the twelve-domain model (11Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), are situated in a 51-residue luminal loop 1 in the ten-domain model (Fig.1). Whereas a potential Asn-linked glycosylation site within a transmembrane helix would not be used as an acceptor for oligosaccharides, such a site in a luminal loop larger than 33 residues would be used (20Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two models, we constructed two mutants, G6PT-T53N and G6PT-S55N, that created a potential glycosylation site at residue 53–55 (N53SS) or residues 55–57 (N55QS), respectively. Synthesis and processing of WT or mutant G6PT were examined in transfected COS-1 cells and by in vitro translation assays. Biosynthesis of G6PT in COS-1 cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged G6PT-WT, G6PT-T53N, or G6PT-S55N construct, in the absence or presence of a protein glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin (26Struck D.K. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1007-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was analyzed by Western blot assays. Both G6PT-WT5′FLAG and G6PT-WT3′FLAG constructs supported the synthesis of a 37-kDa polypeptide in the absence or presence of tunicamycin (Fig.5 A), confirming that G6PT is not a glycoprotein. In contrast, G6PT-T53N3′FLAG as well as G6PT-S55N3′FLAG constructs supported the synthesis of polypeptides of 41- and 37-kDa in the absence or presence of tunicamycin, respectively (Fig. 5 A). Our data show that the introduced glycosylation sites, N53SS and N55QS, were used as acceptors for oligosaccharides. In vitro translation assays showed that G6PT-T53N and G6PT-S55N mutant mRNAs directed the synthesis of a polypeptide of 37 kDa, which was processed to a glycopolypeptide of 41 kDa in the presence of canine microsomal membranes (Fig. 5 B). This is in contrast to the G6PT-WT mRNA which directed the synthesis of a 37-kDa protein both in the absence of presence of canine microsomal membranes (Fig. 5 B). Our data support the ten transmembrane helical model for G6PT. A number of missense mutations identified in the G6PT gene of GSD-1b patients are located in the 51 amino acid luminal loop (14Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

Using transient expression studies, we have previously shown that G6PT harboring one of these mutations, R28H, was unable to transport G6P into the microsomes (14Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined microsomal G6P transport activity of another naturally occurring luminal loop mutant, G6PT-S55R (17Veiga-da-Cunha M. Gerin I. Chen Y.-T. de Barsy T. de Lonlay P. Dionisi-Vici C. Fenske C.D. Lee P.J. Leonard J.V. Maire I. McConkie-Rosell A. Schweitzer S. Vikkula M. Van Schaftingen E. Am. J. Hum.

Our results showed that G6P uptake activity in intact microsomes isolated from COS-1 cells transfected with the G6PT-S55R, G6PT-T53N, or G6PT-S55N cDNA, in the presence of a co-transfected G6Pase cDNA, was nondetectable (data not shown). It has been proposed that hydrolysis of G6P requires the participation of at least two ER-associated membrane proteins, a G6P transporter, G6PT, that translocates G6P from the cytoplasm to the ER lumen, and a catalytic unit, G6Pase, that hydrolyzes G6P to glucose and phosphate (5Arion W.J. Ballas L.M. Lange A.J. Wallin B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4891-4897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier studies (3Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21658-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we have defined the transmembrane topology of G6Pase and shown that the active site of this enzyme faces the ER lumen. In this study, we characterized the orientation of the G6PT protein in the ER and showed that both the NH2 and COOH termini of G6PT reside in the cytoplasm, indicating that G6PT contains an even number of transmembrane helices. We further show that mammalian G6PTs are nonglycoproteins and a conserved Asn-linked glycosylation site at residues 354–356 (11Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Lin B. Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31656-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) is not used as an acceptor for oligosaccharides. Hydropathy profile analysis of bacterial transporters/receptors predicts that the sugar-phosphate transporter, uhpT, the G6P receptor, uhpC, and the glycerol-3-P transporter, GlpT, contain twelve transmembrane segments (28Gott P. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Lloyd A.D. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of G6PT with uhpT, uhpC, and GlpT suggests that human G6PT may also contain twelve transmembrane helices (11Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.-F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The topology of uhpT has been examined using fusion proteins containing uhpT and a topological reporter, alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) (29Lloyd A.D. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was assumed that fusion of PhoA to a periplasm-facing segment of a membrane protein would allow export of the PhoA moiety, resulting in high phosphatase activity. On the other hand, fusion of PhoA to a cytoplasm-facing segment or to a transmembrane domain of a membrane protein would exhibit lower phosphatase activity. A total of fifteen uhpT-PhoA fusion proteins were analyzed and the results, in general, supported the proposed twelve helical model for uhpT (29Lloyd A.D. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, fusion of PhoA to residue 79 in uhpT yielded a fusion protein exhibiting 100% of phosphatase activity (29Lloyd A.D. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the twelve-domain model of uhpT, residue 79 is situated within helix 2, and thus should exhibit low phosphatase activity. This raised the possibility that amino acid 79 in uhpT actually faces the periplasm. The hydropathy profiles analyzed by newly developed algorithms (the TMpred program and Ref. 18Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar) predict that uhpT, uhpC, and G6PT contains nine, ten, and ten transmembrane helices, respectively. To distinguish between the ten versus twelve transmembrane helical models of G6PT, we employed glycosylation scanning assays. Protein glycosylation provides a useful topological marker for membrane proteins. We created a potential Asn-linked glycosylation site in the region spanning amino acid residues 50–71 in G6PT, which would be in either helix 2 (twelve-helical model) or a 51-residue luminal loop 1 (ten-helical model). We showed that the newly introduced glycosylation sites, N53SS and N55QS, were used as acceptors for oligosaccharides. Our data support the ten transmembrane helical model for the G6PT protein (Fig. 1). To date, twelve missense mutations, G20D, R28C, R28H, S55R, G68R, G88D, W118R, G149E, G150R, C183R, R300H, and G339C, have been uncovered in the G6PT gene of GSD-1b patients (11Gerin I.

Genet. 1998; 63: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that four of these mutations, R28C, R28H, S55R, and G68R, are in the 51-residue luminal loop 1 in G6PT (Fig. 1). In an earlier study (14Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we showed that G6P uptake by the G6PT protein is greatly enhanced by G6Pase, and that G6PT harboring a R28H mutation (G6PT-R28H) was unable to transport G6P both in the absence or presence of G6Pase. In this study, we show that the G6PT-T53N and G6PT-S55N mutants as well as a naturally occurring G6PT-S55R mutant, each of which altered an amino acid within luminal loop 1, also lost their ability to transport G6P. Because this loop is located inside the ER lumen, it is tempting to speculate that luminal loop 1 in G6PT plays an important role in facilitating hydrolysis of G6P by G6Pase and is not involved in recruiting or binding of G6P in the cytoplasm. In summary, our data strongly support the ten transmembrane helical model of human G6PT. We have previously shown that G6Pase is anchored in the ER membrane by nine transmembrane helices (3Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Understanding of the orientations of both proteins in the ER should facilitate studies of the interrelationship between G6PT and G6Pase, two major players of the G6Pase system. We thank Drs. A.

Stimulation of heterologously expressed M2 receptors, but not other Gi/Go-associated receptors (M4 or α2c), activates a calcium- and voltage-independent chloride current in Xenopus oocytes. We show that the stimulatory pathway linking M2 receptors to these chloride channels consists of Gβγ stimulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI-3Kγ), formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), and activation of atypical protein kinase C (PKC). The chloride current is activated in the absence of M2 receptor stimulation by the injection of PIP3, and PIP3 current activation is blocked by a pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide of atypical PKC but not other PKCs. Moreover, the current is activated by injection of recombinant PKCζ at concentrations as low as 1 nm. M2 receptor-current coupling was disrupted by inhibiton of PI-3K and by injection of βγ binding peptides, but it was not affected by expression of dominant negative p85 cRNA. We also show that this pathway mediates M2 receptor coupling to metabotropic nonselective cation channels in mammalian smooth muscle cells, thus demonstrating the broad relevance of this signaling cascade in neurotransmitter signaling.

Here we show that stimulation of heterologously expressed M2receptors, but not other Gi/Go-linked receptors, opens endogenous metabotropic chloride channels inXenopus oocytes by activation of PI-3Kγ, generation of PIP3, and stimulation of aPKC. We also show that this signaling pathway mediates physiological coupling between M2 receptors and nonselective cation channels in mammalian smooth muscle cells. Surgical removal of oocytes was performed in the laboratory of Dr. Peter Drain in accordance with a protocol approved by the University of Pennsylvania Animal Care and Use Committee. Oocyte defolliculation, injection, and dual-electrode voltage clamp were as described previously (15Nara M. Dhulipala P.D. Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14920-14924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Currents were amplified (OC-725C, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), filtered at 200 Hz (−3 dB; 8-pole Bessel filter, model 902, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), digitized at 1 kHz (TL125, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and monitored and simultaneously stored on disk (Axotape, Axon Instruments). All currents shown were leak-subtracted using identical voltage paradigms before exposure to mACH. Pipettes with resistances between 0.5 and 1 megaohm were filled with 3 m KCl. Extracellular bath solution was (concentrations in mm): 115 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes. Intracellular injection of all substances consisted of 50-nanoliter volumes, and the indicated concentrations assume a 20-fold dilution in the oocyte cytosol (1 μl volume). Injections were made 10 min before oocyte stimulation. Antibodies directed against specific Gα subunits were injected at the obtained concentration (1:20 final titer). Solution changes were made by washing the bath with at least 25× bath volume (1 ml). cRNA was prepared using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). Plasmid DNAs were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes, and cRNAs were synthesized using the appropriate RNA polymerase. The integrity of the cRNAs was tested on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, and concentrations were estimated by spectrophotometry. The ΔP85 construct (16Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A.

Kasuga and subcloned in pBlueScript KS+ (Stratagene). M2, M3, and M4 clones were kindly provided by Dr. E. Peralta and Dr. T. Morelli. Equine trachealis tissue was obtained in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Pennsylvania Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell isolation, whole cell recording, and agonist application were as described previously (17Wang Y.-X. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14918-14923Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Seals were formed with 3–5-megaohm pipettes, and cells were dialyzed with the following (concentrations in mm): 130 CsCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1 MgATP, 0.1 EGTA, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.3. The bath solution was (concentrations in mm): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. Cells were allowed to adhere to a glass coverslip, and recordings in relaxed cells were made at room temperature. Following break-in, cells were dialyzed for 5 min before activation of currents by application of the muscarinic agonist using a puffer pipette. Chelerythrine, GF109203X, Gö 6976, and cPKC pseudosubstrate peptide were obtained from Calbiochem and PIP3 and PKCζ from Biomol. aPKC and QEHA peptides were custom synthesized. Bovine transducin α was kindly provided by Dr. H. E. Hamm. Heterologous expression of M2 receptors inXenopus oocytes indicated that receptor stimulation activates a novel metabotropic chloride current. The muscarinic agonist methacholine (mACH) activated only a sustained inward current in oocytes injected with M2 receptor cRNA and recorded in calcium-free conditions, whereas a transient inward current was observed in oocytes expressing Gq/11-coupled M3receptors (Fig. 1 A). The transient current was shown to be the ubiquitous endogenous calcium-activated chloride current, as it was blocked by chelating intracellular calcium or by inhibiting calcium release with heparin, whereas activation of the M2 current could be obtained repeatedly in calcium-free solutions and was not affected by intracellular calcium chelation or by blockade of calcium release. These currents were identified in early original experiments characterizing muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes inXenopus oocytes (18Fukuda K. Kubo T. Akiba I. Maeda A. Mishina M. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 327: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), although the sustained current was not isolated and was reported to be cation selective. Ion substitution experiments clearly identified the M2 current as anion selective, with a selectivity sequence of I− > Cl− > isethionate, whereas substitution of more than 90% of the sodium for Tris had no effect on current reversal potential (Fig. 1, B and C). The chloride current activated following M2 receptor binding was voltage-independent, and no measurable current was available in the absence of M2stimulation (no shift in background current observed with anion substitution), indicating that receptor binding is required for channel opening. To examine the linkage between M2 receptors and the novel chloride current, we used antibodies, specific peptides, dominant negative constructs, and enzyme inhibitors to disrupt receptor-effector coupling. M2 receptor-chloride current coupling was blocked by preinjection of antibodies directed against Gαi or Gαo, but not Gαq, proteins (Fig.2, A and B). Anti-Gαi1/Gαi2 and anti-Gαi3/Gαo antibodies blocked 83 ± 3% (n = 6) and 52 ± 4% (n = 6) of the current, respectively. Whereas M2 signaling was clearly coupled by Gi/Go proteins, the M2 current was not activated by heterologously expressed adrenergic α2C receptors or muscarinic M4receptors, which coupled weakly to intracellular calcium release and the associated calcium-activated chloride current (Fig. 2 C). These receptors also preferentially associate with Gi/Go proteins (19Coupry I. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9852-9857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Felder C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), indicating that the signaling pathway leading to activation of the M2 chloride current discriminates between receptors signaling through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Moreover, whereas both M2 and M4 receptors are capable of activating inward rectifying K+ channels through βγ proteins (21Gadbut A.P. Riccardi D. Wu L. Hebert S.C. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6398-6402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the stimulatory pathway linking M2 receptors and chloride channels effectively distinguishes between these closely related receptors. Protein kinase C (PKC) molecules that are activated by diacylglycerol and calcium following stimulation of phospholipase C by G protein-coupled receptors have been implicated in M2receptor-ion channel coupling (22Mochida S. Kobayashi H. Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 86: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Bernheim L. Beech D.J. Hille B.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 1019-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). M2 coupling to the novel chloride current was disrupted by exposure of oocytes to the nonselective protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine. However, GF109203X and Gö 6976 (not shown), more selective inhibitors of several conventional and novel PKC isoforms, had no effect on current activation (Fig. 3, A andB). None of the protein kinase C inhibitors affected M3 coupling to phospholipase C, and conversely, M2 receptor coupling was not affected by phospholipase C inhibition (Fig. 3 A). aPKCs that are activated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, PIP3, andcis-fatty acids have been implicated as effectors in mitogen, apoptotic, and contractile signaling (11Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 12Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

(London). 1997; 500: 95-109Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), although involvement of aPKCs in ion channel signaling has not been reported. We examined the role of protein kinase C subtypes in M2 receptor coupling using peptides that selectively bind and inhibit conventional PKCs or aPKCs. Preinjection of aPKC pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptides (28Dominguez I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Berra E. Garcia de Herreros A. Cornet M.E. Sanz L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3776-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but not cPKC inhibitory peptides (29House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), inhibited the M2 chloride current coupling, suggesting that aPKC activation is necessary for M2-chloride channel coupling. We confirmed the role of aPKC in receptor-effector coupling by direct injection of aPKC into the cytosol (Fig.4). Injection of recombinant PKCζ activated the chloride current in a concentration dependent fashion, with currents observed at final concentrations of PKCζ as low as 1 nm. Moreover, injection of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which stimulates PKCζin vitro (12Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), activated the current. Current activation was specific to PIP3 injection. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, linolenic acid, phosphatidylserine, and arachidonic acid failed to induce any current (data not shown). PIP3 and PKCζ currents were indistinguishable from that observed following M2 receptor stimulation in several respects. First, PIP3 and PKCζ activated an anion selective current with a permeability sequence of I− > Cl− > isethionate and a current-voltage relationship identical to the M2 current. Second, the current was sustained in the absence of extracellular calcium following activation by either agent and was insensitive to calcium chelation. Third, currents activated by M2 receptor stimulation and by PIP3 or PKCζ injection were not additive. Following activation of the current by 50 μmmACH, little or no further current was elicited by the injection of PIP3 or PKCζ (n = 6), and PIP3 or PKCζ, current activation abrogated subsequent mACH current (n = 5) (Fig. 4 A). Finally, the aPKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor blocked both the M2 and PIP3-induced chloride currents (Fig. 4, A andB). PIP3 has been shown to stimulate novel PKC-ε and PKC-η (30Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as atypical PKCζ activity, and the block of PIP3 currents by the aPKC pseudosubstrate peptide indicates the specific nature of PKCs mediating current activation. Moreover, neither diacylglycerol analogues nor phorbol esters activated the current (although 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol weakly activated the calcium-activated chloride current), and M2receptor-chloride current coupling was not affected by prior exposure to these agents (Fig. 4 A). Thus pharmacologic and peptide inhibitors that are selective for aPKCs blocked activation of the M2 chloride current, and lipid activators of aPKCs (but not known activators of conventional and novel PKCs) and PKCζ evoked the current in the absence of M2 receptor stimulation, indicating that stimulation of aPKC is both necessary and sufficient to open M2-coupled chloride channels. Hormone-stimulated PI-3K activity results in the formation of PIP3, which has been implicated as a second messenger in a wide variety of cellular processes such as glucose transport, actin rearrangement, chemotaxis, and apoptosis (see Ref. 7Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Activation of chloride channels by PIP3 suggested the involvement of PI-3K in the stimulatory pathway linking M2 receptor stimulation to chloride channel opening. Consistent with such a signaling cascade, the covalent PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked the M2-stimulated current (Fig.5), with no effect on M3coupling (not shown). Two groups of hormone-stimulated (class I) PI-3Ks have been identified based on activation by tyrosine kinase or by G protein-coupled signaling pathways. The former kinases are heterodimers composed of a catalytic p110 subunit that is stimulated following interaction with a p85 or p55 regulatory subunit containing SH2 and SH3 domains, whereas G protein-stimulated PI-3 kinase activity occurs through the direct activation of p110γ by the binding of Gβγ subunits (9Thomason P.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine the identity of the PI-3K involved in M2 coupling to aPKC, we used a peptide fragment of adenylyl cyclase 2 (QEHA peptide) containing a putative Gβγ binding motif, which blocks Gβγ signaling to several protein targets (34Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and has been shown to inhibit βγ stimulation of PI-3Kγ in vitro (33Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The QEHA peptide inhibited coupling between M2 receptors and chloride channels by as much as 80%. Concentration-dependent inhibition of M2receptor-effector coupling by the peptide was quite similar to that observed for PI-3Kγ (33Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, A and B). The peptide had no effect on PIP3 activation of the current, indicating that the block is upstream of PIP3 formation (data not shown). Similarly, purified bovine transducin α proteins, which bind free Gβγ subunits with high affinity, strongly inhibited M2-chloride channel coupling (Fig. 5 C). Injection of proteins to a final concentration of approximately 5 μm inhibited the current by 77.5 ± 5.3% (n = 12), whereas injection of boiled transducin α proteins was without effect. We also expressed a dominant negative p85 cRNA (Δp85), which has been shown to prevent the activation of p85-regulated PI-3K (16Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Expression of Δp85 or wild-type p85 had no effect on M2 signaling when cRNAs were injected at concentrations up to 4-fold higher than M2 receptor cRNA. Finally, we sought to determine whether the PI-3K·aPKC coupling pathway was involved in physiological M2 neurotransmission. Release of acetylcholine from vagal nerves stimulates M3and M2 receptors on smooth muscle cells at neuromuscular junctions in the lung, bladder, viscera, and some vessels. Stimulation of M2 receptors on isolated myocytes activates a sustained cation current (I cat) that mediates slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (35Benham C.D. Bolton T.B. Lang R.J. Nature. 1985; 316: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 36Byrne N.G. Large W.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 37Wang Y.X.

Physiol. 1996; 271: C435-C454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the coupling process is poorly understood. In voltage-clamped single tracheal smooth muscle cells, dialysis of the aPKC pseudosubstrate peptide selectively abolished I cat without affecting the large calcium-activated chloride current (I Cl(Ca)) that is associated with M3-mediated calcium release (see Ref. 37Wang Y.X. Fleischmann B.K. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C500-C508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6), indicating that aPKC activation is necessary for M2 coupling toI cat in smooth muscle. As shown, dialysis of the cPKC peptide had no effect on coupling. M2 coupling toI cat, but not M3 coupling toI Cl(Ca), was also disrupted by dialysis of the QEHA peptide and by the PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin, indicating that key elements of the signaling pathway linking M2receptors to chloride channels in Xenopus oocytes are required for coupling of these receptors in mammalian cells. It should be noted, however, that coupling of muscarinic receptors to nonselective cation is an example of signaling convergence in which discrete signals generated by the simultaneous stimulation of the M2 and M3 receptors are required for current activation (37Wang Y.X. Fleischmann B.K. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C500-C508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Inoue R. Isenberg G. J. Physiol. (London). 1990; 424: 73-92Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 40Pacaud P. Bolton T.B. J. Physiol. (London). 1991; 441: 477-499Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). That is, current activation requires the release of intracellular Ca2+, although such release is not itself sufficient for channel opening without simultaneous M2 receptor engagement (37Wang Y.X. Fleischmann B.K. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C500-C508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, dialysis of tracheal myocytes with PIP3 did not result in the activation of I cat (data not shown). Taken together, however, these data indicate that the M2·PI-3Kγ·aPKC coupling pathway likely underlies physiological postsynaptic muscarinic signaling in smooth muscle. In summary, we demonstrate a novel signaling pathway linking M2 receptors to metabotropic ion channels. Receptor binding results in the stimulation of the Gβγ-regulated PI-3Kγ, formation of PIP3, and activation of aPKC. This signaling pathway leads to the opening of a novel, second messenger-activated chloride current in Xenopus oocytes and mediates activation of nonselective cation channels in smooth muscle cells. These findings define a novel signaling cascade linking G protein-coupled receptors to membrane ion channels and provide further insight into the intricate role of lipid second messengers in receptor signaling.

GM1, asialo-GM1, and GD1b were representative gangliosides expressed on T cells of the wild type mice and completely deleted on those of the mutant mice. The sizes and cell numbers of the mutant mice spleen and thymus were significantly reduced. Spleen cells from the mutant mice showed clearly reduced proliferation compared with the wild type when stimulated by interleukin 2 (IL-2) but not when treated with concanavalin A or anti-CD3 cross-linking. Expression levels of IL-2 receptor α, β, and γ were almost equivalent, and up-regulation of α chain after T cell activation was also similar between the mutant and wild type mice. Activation of JAK1, JAK3, and SAT5 after IL-2 treatment was reduced, and c-fos expression was delayed and reduced in the mutant spleen cells, suggesting that the IL-2 signal was attenuated in the mutant mice probably due to the modulation of IL-2 receptors by the lack of complex gangliosides.

Gangliosides are enriched in nervous systems of vertebrates, suggesting their importance in the neuronal functions (1Ledeen R.W. Wu G. Lu Z.H. Kozireski-Chuback D. Fang Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

They are also present in cells of the immune system and have been thought to contribute in cell to cell recognition or cellular signal modulation (2Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Med. 1976; 143: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results indicate that gangliosides play important roles in the immune system. However, many of these studies were done by the addition of exogenous gangliosides (9Offner H. Thieme T. Vandenbark A.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3295-3305PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-ganglioside antibody to cultured cells (10Ting C.C. Bluestone J.A. Hargrove M.E. Loh N.N. J.

These studies do not address the functions of endogenously generated gangliosides. We have established mutant mouse lines that completely lacked GM2/GD2 synthase activity and expression of all complex gangliosides including those of asialo-series (12Takamiya K. Yamamoto A.

Most significantly, it was found that mature T cells from the mutant mice respond very weakly to interleukin 2 (IL-2). We elucidated here that the signaling pathway for IL-2/IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) was largely disrupted by the altered ganglioside arrangement on cell surface. This is the first report to study glycolipid functions by the genetic modification of their carbohydrate structures and showed critical roles for endogenous glycolipids in the transduction of proliferation signals introduced by lymphokines. For the analysis of IL-2 receptors and gangliosides, spleen cells and thymocytes from 6–8-week-old mice were used. Spleen cells resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline/0.5 mm EDTA/5% fetal calf serum were panned, and then unbound cells were collected and served to flow cytometry. Antibodies used were as follows: PC61 (IL-2Rα, 1 μl of ascites), TUm122 (IL-2R β, 1 μl of ascites), TUGm2 (IL-2Rγ, 1 μl of ascites) (these three antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. T. Takeshita at Tohoku University), R24 (anti-GD3 provided by Dr. L. J. Old, 0.5 μl of ascites), 220 (anti-GD2, supernatant), 2D4 (anti-GA2 obtained from ATCC, supernatant), 229–6-22 (anti-GA1, supernatant), M2590 (anti-GM3 purchased from Nihon Biotest Research Institute, 5 μg/ml), 370 (anti-GD1b, 0.5 μl of ascites), 549 (anti-GT1b, 0.5 μl of ascites), and 9–22 (anti-GD1a, 0.5 μl of ascites). Additional antibodies used were FITC anti-rat IgG for PC61, TUm122 and TUGm2, FITC anti-mouse IgG for R24 and 220, and FITC anti-mouse IgM for other mouse IgM mAbs. Samples without mAbs were used as negative controls. CD3 expression was analyzed by anti-CD3 mAb145–2C11 and FITC anti-hamster IgG with nonpanned spleen cells. To detect GM1, biotin-labeled choleratoxin B subunit (List Biological Laboratory, Campbell, CA) was used followed by avidin-FITC (EY Laboratories). Spleen cells from mice (6–8 weeks old) were dispersed and washed twice in plain RPMI 1640 medium at 4 °C. They were adjusted at 3.75 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and plated into 96-well plates at 100 μl/well. 100 μl of IL-2 was added to make final concentration of 1 unit/ml and cultured. At days 2, 3, 4, and 5 of culture, cells were harvested after incorporation of [3H]thymidine for 18 h (1 μCi/well) by being trapped with a glass filter, and then the filter was counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo). To analyze the response to concanavalin A (ConA) stimulation, ConA was added to the spleen cells prepared as described above at 1∼5 μg/ml, and proliferation was examined as performed in IL-2 treatment. Proliferation by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody was also examined by cultivating spleen cells in 96-well plates coated by mAb145–2C11 at 10 μg/ml, otherwise as done in IL-2 stimulation. Anti-mouse IgG (H and L) (Cappel) was coated in 6-cm bacteriological plates (Falcon) at 20 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) for 3 h at room temperature. After washing in saline, the plates were blocked by 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then stocked in a freezer. Spleen cells from mice of 6–8 weeks old were cultured in 24-well plates at the density of 1 × 107/ml/well in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. The cells were cultured for 0, 5, 10, and 30 min after addition of IL-2 (1 unit/ml, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.) (1 Takeda unit = 383 Japan reference unit). The cells were collected at each time point, and then the pellets were lyzed by adding 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm ρ-amidinophenyl-methanesulfonyl-fluoride hydrochloride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), 1% (v/v) Brij96). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, the supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated with 10 μl of antibodies (anti-JAK1 (Q-19), anti-JAK3 (C-21), or anti-STAT5b (C-17)) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and then with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer three times, the immunoprecipitates were applied to 7.5% gel of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrically blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblot was performed by PY-20 (ICN Biomedical Inc.) at 1:2000, anti-JAK1 at 1:4000, anti-JAK3 at 1:4000, and anti-STAT5b at 1:4000 dilution. Second antibodies used were biotinylated anti-mouse IgG for anti-JAK1 and anti-JAK3 and biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG for anti-STAT5b. Signals of antibody binding were detected by ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Spleen cells from mice (6–8 weeks old) were adjusted at 1 × 107/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and plated in 24-well plates at 2 × 107/well/2 ml. They were cultured for 0, 10, 30, and 60 min in the presence of IL-2 (1 unit/ml). At each time point, cells were collected, and then total RNA was extracted by Trizol® (Life Technologies, Inc.). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (15 μg/lane) was separated in 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, NEN Life Science Products). Prehybridization and hybridization was performed with32P-radiolabeled cDNA probes synthesized from c-fos or c-myc containing plasmids as described previously (3Yamashiro S. Okada M. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Then the membrane was washed and analyzed by a BioImaging Analyzer BAS-2000 (Fuji, Tokyo). GM1, asialo-GM1, and GD1b gangliosides detected in the wild type spleen T cells were completely absent in the mutant spleen cells, as expected from the proposed ganglioside synthetic pathway (Fig.1, A and B). Instead, GD3 expression was slightly increased in the knock-out mice, probably as a result of precursor accumulation. Spleens and thymuses from the mutant mice were smaller than the wild type organs (Fig. 1 C). Total cell numbers in the spleens or thymuses of the knock-out mice were significantly reduced as shown in Fig. 1 C. The ratios of CD3 positive T cells in the whole spleen cells were almost equivalent between the two groups,i.e. 31.8 ± 1.1% and 31.2 ± 1.6% for the wild type and the mutant mice, respectively. To compare their proliferation, spleen cells were stimulated with ConA, anti-CD3 antibody, or IL-2. Those from the mutant mice showed clearly decreased incorporation of [3H]thymidine compared with the wild type when stimulated by IL-2 (Fig. 2) but not when treated with ConA or anti-CD3 cross-linking. Because T cell population in the mutant spleen was equivalent to that of the wild type, the results described above indicate that T lymphocytes in the mutant have defects in IL-2/IL-2R-mediated signaling. Expression levels of IL-2 receptors were analyzed by flow cytometry. All three components of IL-2 receptor, α, β, and γ, were equally detected by specific monoclonal antibodies between the wild type and the mutant mice (Fig.3). After culture with IL-2, their expression patterns were also similar. When they were cultured in the presence of ConA, marked up-regulation of IL-2R α chain was observed in both groups (Fig. 3). Thus, there are no marked differences in the expression levels of IL-2 receptors and in the up-regulation of α chain. To analyze the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, the phosphorylation patterns of JAK1, JAK3, and STAT5 proteins that are the representative signal molecules responsible for transmission of the IL-2 signal were examined. JAK1 and JAK3 were phosphorylated at 5 min after IL-2 treatment in the wild type mouse T cells, and the activation level was sustained for 10 and 30 min for JAK1 and JAK3, respectively (Fig.4). On the other hand, JAK1 was scarcely phospholylated, and JAK3 phosphorylation detected at 5 min quickly returned to the basal line in the mutant mice. STAT5 was also phosphorylated at 5 min after IL-2 stimulation and kept the activated form even after 30 min in the wild type. In contrast, the mutant spleen cells showed delayed response and already declined at 30 min after IL-2 treatment (Fig. 4 C). c-fos/c-jun, c-myc, or bcl2has been reported to be involved in the cell proliferation by IL-2 (14Miyazaki T. Liu Z.-J. Kawahara A. Minami Y. Yamada K. Tsujimoto Y. Barsoumian E.L. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1995; 81: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We analyzed the regulation of c-fos and c-myc gene transcription when stimulated with IL-2. mRNA of c-fos in the wild type mice was readily detected by Northern blotting 10 min after IL-2 stimulation and then gradually decreased. In the mutant mouse, c-fos mRNA levels reached the plateau at 30 min and soon fell (Fig.5 A). On the other hand, c-myc mRNA levels exhibited very similar patterns in the mutant and wild type mice. Ganglioside GM2/GD2 synthase gene knock-out mice showed defects in ganglioside expression on T cells in accord with the proposed pathway of ganglioside synthesis (15Pohlentz G. Klein D. Schwarzmann G. Schmitz D. Sandhoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The comparative study of the immune system using these mutant mice, as well as the wild type mice, is expected to unambiguously elucidate the actual roles of gangliosidesin vivo. In fact, results obtained here clearly showed important roles of gangliosides in the regulation of IL-2/IL-2R-mediated signals in a straightforward manner. In many studies, the roles of glycolipids in the immune system have been analyzed by observing the effects of exogenous gangliosides, and they exhibited suppressive effects on T cell functions such as CD4 internalization (9Offner H. Thieme T. Vandenbark A.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3295-3305PubMed Google Scholar) and reduced response to mitogens or allogeneic antigens (16Whisler R.L. Yates A.J. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2106-2111PubMed Google Scholar). Actually, gangliosides were reported to bind to IL-2 (17Parker J. Caldini G. Krishnamurti C. Ahrens P.B. Ankel H. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and thereby inhibit T cell proliferation (18Robb R.J. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 971-976PubMed Google Scholar). These immunosuppressive effects of gangliosides have been considered to explain immunosuppression in cancer patients (19Floutsis G. Ulsh L. Ladisch S. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, results obtained in these experiments do not seem likely to reflect the real effects of endogenously generated gangliosides. Compartmentalization through protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions has now been recognized as a fundamental mechanism for efficient and organized cell signaling (20Liu P. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Some membrane components are apparently organized into glycolipid-enriched membrane domains or detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched domains (22Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) known as rafts. These rafts are enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-anchored proteins (23Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar), and a variety of signaling molecules. Recently, dynamic T cell receptor recruitment to such a microdomain upon T cell activation has been reported in a T cell line (24Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 25Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and in thymocytes (26Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.-M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.-A. Chauvin J.-P. Pierres M. He H.-T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). These data suggest that gangliosides expressed on T cells associate with receptors and signaling molecules to transduce the IL-2 signals at such a microdomain, although it is yet unclear that IL-2 receptors are enriched in glycolipid-enriched membrane domains. Defects in the IL-2 signal transduction found in the mutant mice T cells should take place due to lack of GM1/GD1b/GA1 and may be due to serious structural defects of IL-2 receptors. In particular, the configuration of β and γ chains may be affected because it has been reported that JAK1 and JAK3 are differentially associated with IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, respectively (27Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y. Liu Z.J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Among many signaling molecules, JAK3 is reported to mainly act in cell proliferation and to activate STAT5 (28Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Schindler U. Kawahara A. Mori H. Goulleux F. Groner B. Ihle N.J. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and induce c-fos expression (29Kawahara A. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Ihle N.J. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8724-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Reduced activation of JAK3 and JAK1 followed by reduced activation of STAT5 and reduced c-fos induction upon IL-2 stimulation may explain the suppressed proliferation of the mutant T cells. The fact that all mutant mice deficient for IL-2/IL-2Rs, except for those deficient in IL-2Rγ, show deregulated T cell activation and autoimmune diseases (30Theze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 481-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) suggests that the defects in the immune system of our mutant mice might come mainly from attenuation in the γ chain-mediated signal. Results presented in this report demonstrate a possibility that cell surface gangliosides regulate the proliferation signals by modulating the growth factor receptors. These findings will provide insights into the roles of gangliosides in the proliferation of activated T lymphocytes (3Yamashiro S. Okada M. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and T cell leukemia cells (31Furukawa K. Akagi T. Nagata Y. Yamada Y. Shimotohno K. Cheung N.-K.V. Shiku H. Furukawa K.

To identify the molecular motif in the Kir2.3 channel protein that is responsible for this process, experiments were performed using wild-type and mutated Kir2.3 and Kir2.1. CO2 and low pHi strongly inhibited wild-type Kir2.3 but not Kir2.1 in whole cell voltage clamp and excised inside-out patches. This CO2/pH sensitivity was completely eliminated in a mutant Kir2.3 in which the N terminus was substituted with that in Kir2.1, whereas a similar replacement of its C terminus had no effect. Site-specific mutations of all titratable residues in the N terminus, however, did not change the CO2/pH sensitivity. Using several chimeras generated systematically in the N terminus, a 10-residue motif near the M1 region was identified in which only three amino acids are different between Kir2.3 and Kir2.1. Mutations of these residues, especially Thr53, dramatically reduced the pH sensitivity of Kir2.3. Introducing these residues or even a single threonine to the corresponding positions of Kir2.1 made the mutant channel pH-sensitive. Thus, a critical motif responsible for gating Kir2.3 by protons was identified in the N terminus, which contained about 10 residues centered by Thr53. Protons are involved in gating Kir2.3.

The modulation of membrane excitability is a significant cellular property, which not only provides cells with an important strategy for responding to their external stimuli but also enables them to monitor their internal environment and intermediary metabolism (1Jiang C. Haddad G.G. Lister G. Tissue Oxygen Deprivation: Developmental Molecular and Integrated Function. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 595-616Google Scholar). Inward rectifier K+ channels play a part in this process in which several intracellular molecules such as nucleotides and protons are involved (2Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. J. Physiol. (London). 1997; 505: 267-282Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Whereas the concentration of protons is normally controlled by several buffering and feedback-controlling systems, pH can fall beyond its normal levels under certain pathophysiological conditions. For instance, CO2 retention, or hypercapnia, can cause a reduction in intra- and extracellular pH leading to respiratory acidosis (4Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). It is known that CO2 sensing, which plays an important role in the feedback regulation of CO2 and pH homeostasis in mammalian systems, is carried out by chemoreceptors, especially the central chemoreceptors (5Mitchell R.A. Berger R.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1975; 111: 206-224PubMed Google Scholar, 6Loeschcke H.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 332: 1-24Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 7Schlaefke M.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 90: 171-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fitzgerrald R.S. Lahiri S. Fishman A.P. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Baltimore1986: 313-362Google Scholar). Through these chemoreceptors, a high PCO2 level stimulates respiratory neuronal networks in the brain stem and enhances respiratory motor output. During this process, the information of PCO2 levels received by these chemoreceptor cells may first be conveyed to the change in their membrane excitability and then passed to the respiratory neuronal networks through chemical or electrical synaptic transmissions (9Euler C.Von. Fishman A.P. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Baltimore1986: 1-67Google Scholar, 10Feldman J.L. Bloom F.E. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Baltimore1986: 463-524Google Scholar). Hence, the change in membrane excitability constitutes an important step in the CO2 sensing. The alteration in membrane excitability with hypercapnia is known to be mediated by specific ion channels. CO2 has been shown to enhance the firing activity of locus ceruleus neurons by suppressing a proton- and polyamine-sensitive inward rectifying K+current (11Pineda J. Aghajanian G.K. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 723-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that CO2induces a depolarization in Lymnaea snail neurons by inhibiting a K+ channel with modest inward rectification (12Jiang C. Zhu G.Y. Hayashi F. Haddad G.G. Abstr. Soc. Neurosci. 1997; 23: 171.5Google Scholar). Recently, we have further demonstrated that CO2inhibits specific inward rectifier K+ channels including Kir2.3 (13Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.R. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because the Kir2.3 is expressed in the central nervous system and contributes to the maintenance of membrane excitability (14Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), detailed studies of the modulation of Kir2.3 during hypercapnia may bring about an understanding of the molecular mechanisms for CO2 sensing. Hypercapnia can modulate channel activity directly by acting on channel protein and indirectly by recruiting second messengers and other intermediate molecules. Our previous studies showed that the Kir2.3 inhibition during hypercapnia is largely mediated by decreases in the intra- and extracellular pH (pHi and pHo) and demonstrated that this channel has two pH sensors on either side of the plasma membranes (13Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.R. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whereas the pHo sensor has been well studied (15Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the pHi sensor, which contributes to more than 80% of channel inhibition, works at near physiological pH levels, and seemingly plays a more important role during hypercapnia, is still not understood. Therefore, we designed these experiments using a molecular genetic approach combined with patch clamp experiments to have an intervention of the structural-functional relationship of the Kir2.3 in CO2/pHi sensing. Frogs (Xenopus laevis) were anesthetized by bathing in 0.3% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. A few lobes of the ovaries were removed after a small abdominal incision (∼5 mm).Xenopus oocytes were treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Type I, Sigma) in OR2 solution (82 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES) for 90 min at room temperature. After washing, the oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C in ND-96 solution containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, and 2.5 sodium pyruvate with 100 mg/liter Geneticin added. A vector for eukaryotic expression (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to express Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels. Chimerical constructs between Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 were prepared by an overlap extension at the junction of the interested domains using polymerase chain reaction (Pfu or Taq DNA polymerases, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1. Site-specific mutations were made using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Quickchange, Stratagene). Correct mutations in both the overlapping polymerase chain reaction and site-directed mutagenesis were confirmed with DNA sequencing. Whole cell currents were studied on the oocytes 2–5 days after injection. Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using an amplifier (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) at room temperature (22–24 °C). The extracellular solution contained 90 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were impaled using electrodes filled with 3 mKCl. The current electrodes had a resistance of 0.3–0.6 megaohms. Current records were low-pass filtered (Bessel, 4-pole filter, 3 dB at 5 kHz), digitized at 5 kHz (12-bit resolution), and acquired using pClamp 6.0.3 (Axon Instruments) (16Jiang C. Sigworth F.J. Haddad G.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5590-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhu G. Zhang Y. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Oocytes were accepted for further experiments only if they expressed large inward rectifying currents (>3 μA), and their leak currents measured as the difference before and after a leak subtraction were less than 10% of the peak currents. Xenopus oocytes were placed in a semi-closed recording chamber (BSC-HT, Medical System, Greenvale, NY) in which oocytes were placed on a supporting nylon mesh, so that the perfusion solution bathed both the top and bottom surface of the oocytes. CO2(15% balanced with air) exposures were the same as described previously (13Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.R. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A high concentration of KHCO3 was used for intracellular acidification (18Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P.

In these experiments, bicarbonate at concentrations of 20, 50, and 90 mm was applied to the bath solutions without changing the K+ concentration. Intracellular pH levels were measured when these perfusates were administrated to oocytes. Patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (about 25 °C) as described previously (16Jiang C. Sigworth F.J. Haddad G.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5590-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhu G. Zhang Y. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In brief, fire-polished patch pipettes (0.5–2 megaohms) were made from 1.2-mm borosilicate capillary glass (Sutter P-94/PC puller). Macroscopic currents were recorded from Giant inside-out patches. Current records were low-pass filtered (2,000 Hz, Bessel, 4-pole filter, −3 dB), digitized (10 kHz, 12-bit resolution), and stored on computer disk for later analysis (pClamp 6, Axon Instruments). Junction potentials between the bath and pipette solutions were appropriately nulled before seal formation. For macroscopic current recordings, the oocyte vitelline membranes were mechanically removed after exposing hypertonic solution (400 mosmol) for 15 min. The stripped oocytes were placed in a Petri dish containing regular bath solution (see below). Recordings were performed using solutions containing equal concentrations of K+ applied to the bath and recording pipettes. The bath and recording pipette solution contained (in mm): 40 KCl, 75 potassium gluconate, 5 potassium fluoride, 0.1 sodium vanadate, 10 potassium pyrophosphate, 1 EGTA, 0.2 ADP, 10 PIPES, 1The abbreviations used are: PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis-(2-ethanesulfonic acid); H7, 1-[5-isoquinolinesulfonyl]-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride 10 glucose, and 0.1 spermine (FVPP solution, pH 7.4). This bath solution was chosen after several others had been tested regarding channel run-down in excised patches. In a control experiment, we found that macroscopic currents recorded from giant inside-out patches were very well maintained, showing less than 10% reduction over a 20-min period of recordings made in such a bath solution. A parallel perfusion system was used to administer agents to patches or cells at a rate of ∼1 ml/min with no dead space (16Jiang C. Sigworth F.J. Haddad G.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5590-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhu G. Zhang Y. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Low pH exposures were carried out using the same bath solutions that had been titrated to various pH levels as required by experimental protocols. PIPES buffer was used because of its buffering range from pH 5.8 to 7.4. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (n ≥ 4). Differences in means were tested with the Student's t test and were accepted as significant if p ≤ 0.05. Kir2.3 currents were studied by expressing these K+ channels in Xenopus oocytes. In the voltage clamp mode, whole cell Kir2.3 currents showed a strong inward rectification and were highly sensitive to extracellular Ba2+ (IC50 = 11 ± 2 μm,n = 4). Exposure of the oocytes to 15% CO2produced a marked inhibition of the whole cell Kir2.3 currents by 80 ± 2% (n = 7) (Fig.1 A). This effect was reversible and dependent on concentrations of CO2 (5, 10, and 15%, data not shown). Selective intracellular acidification without changing the extracellular pH also inhibited Kir2.3 to an extent comparable with that of CO2 when changes in pH levels were considered. The measured intracellular pH level during 15% CO2 exposure was 6.58 ± 0.13 (n = 6) using ion-selective microelectrodes (20Jiang C. Agulian S. Haddad G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 697-708Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Selective intracellular acidification to this pH level inhibited Kir2.3 by 74 ± 4% (n = 5). The inhibition of Kir2.3 by CO2 or intracellular acidification can be a direct effect of protons on the channel protein or an indirect effect through changes in concentrations of intracellular second messengers, protein kinases, phosphatases, and other cytosol-soluble factors. To delineate the mechanisms underlying the channel modulation, we performed experiments using cell-free excised patches. In the inside-out patch configuration, Kir2.3 currents were strongly inhibited when the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane was exposed to low pH solutions. This inhibition was fast, reversible, and concentration-dependent (Fig.2). Another member of the Kir2 family, Kir2.1, however did not respond to either high CO2 (Fig.1 B) or pHi 6.6 (Fig.3), suggesting that this effect was rather specific. Because cytosol-soluble factors were vastly diluted or washed out under our experimental condition, the inhibition of Kir2.3 channels is unlikely to be mediated by second messengers and other cytosol-soluble factors. Moreover, because our intracellular solutions contained chemicals that were unfavorable to protein dephosphorylation (see “Materials and Methods”), the modulation of Kir2.3 channel activity by pH levels may not be related to the fast turn-over of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.Figure 3The crucial role of the N-terminal region in pH sensing. A, because Kir2.3 (HIR) responds to CO2 and low pHi but Kir2.1 (IRK) does not, chimeras were constructed between these two channels to identify the intracellular pH-sensing domain. In IN-HIR, the Kir2.3 N-terminal region (from the N terminus to the beginning of M1) was substituted with the counterpart of Kir2.1. This IN-HIR recombinant lost its sensitivity to intracellular acidification. When the Kir2.1 N-terminal domain was replaced with the corresponding sequence in Kir2.3, the mutant channel became pHi-sensitive. Note that pHi sensitivity of these chimeras was studied by two-electrode clamp experiments in different oocytes. B, concentration-dependent inhibition of K+currents in inside-out patches. Whereas Kir2.3 currents showed strong pHi sensitivity with pK 6.77, Kir2.1 and IN-HIR had almost no response to a pHi change from 7.4 to 5.8. Although its pHi sensitivity decreased (pK6.45), HN-IRK responded to pHi changes in a manner more like Kir2.3 than Kir2.1. Data are presented as means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our results in excised patches support an idea that the proton-sensitive mechanism for channel gating is located on the Kir2.3 channel protein. To further test this idea, we chose to use molecular genetic approaches to determine the molecular basis of Kir2.3 channel modulation by intracellular protons. According to the generally accepted membrane-spanning topology of inward rectifier K+ channels, the Kir2.3 channel should have its N and C termini in the cytosol. In addition, part of the pore (P or H5) sequence should be accessible from the intracellular side. Based on these characteristics of Kir channels, we constructed chimeras in which each of these three sequences was replaced by its counterpart in Kir2.1. CO2 and pH sensitivities of these recombinant HIR-IRK channels were then studied in whole cell voltage clamp and excised patches. Substitution of the N terminus in Kir2.3 with that in Kir2.1 (IN-HIR) completely eliminated the channel response to low pHi (Figs. 3 A and 5). A chimerical Kir2.1 channel carrying an N-terminal sequence of Kir2.3 (HN-IRK) became pH-sensitive, although the degree of the pH sensitivity was smaller than that of wild-type Kir2.3 (Figs. 3 A and 5). Switches of the C terminus (IRK-HC, Fig. 5) or the H5 region from Kir2.3 to Kir2.1 (IN-HIR, Figs. 3 A and 5), however, failed to produce any CO2/pH sensitivity in these mutant channels. Thus, these results indicate that the CO2/pHi-sensitive mechanism is located on the N terminus rather than the H5 and C terminus of Kir2.3. It is known that a large number of protein molecules can be modulated by pH levels. Binding of protons to certain titratable amino acids can cause changes in the electrical charges of these residues and thus alter the protein conformation and channel activity. If this is the case in Kir2.3, there should be amino acid residues on the channel protein acting as receptive sites for protons. To test this hypothesis, we examined titratable amino acids in the N terminus of Kir2.3, especially histidines in which the side chain has a pK value of 6.04. Using site-directed mutagenesis, these histidines were changed to aspartates in which positive charges at these positions were converted to negative charges during hypercapnia. A simultaneous replacement of all three histidines (H2D, H4D, H11D) had no effect on channel expression and sensitivity to CO2 and pHi (Fig. 4, A andB). Neither did replacements of individual ones, suggesting that these histidines do not constitute the pH sensor in Kir2.3. To further strengthen this idea, we deleted all of these histidines plus the other nine residues at the beginning of the N terminus and found that the CO2/pHi sensitivity was unaffected (see below). In addition to these histidines, several residues that exist only in Kir2.3 and are potentially titratable at nonphysiological (extremely high or low) pH levels were studied. After these residues were switched to those in Kir2.1, including R6G, R14T, K16Q, and R17Q, we found that the same pH sensitivity was retained in all of these mutant Kir2.3 channels. Thus, none of these residues appears to be the reception or initiation site for proton sensing. To understand the pH-dependent mechanisms for Kir2.3 gating, we divided the N-terminal region into three segments and reconstructed several N-terminal chimeras using Kir2.3 and Kir2.1 sequences. Most of these chimeras were expressed in oocytes as functional channels, although the current amplitude in some of them was reduced. To eliminate the extracellular pH sensor, the sequence from M1 through M2 in Kir2.3 was replaced with a corresponding one in Kir2.1. This mutant channel carrying N and C termini from Kir2.3 (HIH) showed CO2 and pHi sensitivities almost identical to the wild-type Kir2.3 (Fig. 6 B). Thus, several chimeras were constructed based on the HIH. The first 12 amino acids at the N terminus of Kir2.3 (N1–12IH) were not involved in the CO2 sensitivity. A truncation of these residues did not have any significant effect on the channel expression, base-line currents, and sensitivity to CO2 (70 ± 3%,n = 4, p > 0.05) (Fig.5). Although a deletion of the next 12 residues did not produce functional channels, chimera with the first 19 amino acids replaced by those in Kir2.1 (N1–19IH) showed a CO2 sensitivity very close to that of the wild-type Kir2.3 (61 ± 4%, n = 6). The middle part of the N-terminal region includes 20 residues with 9 of them different between Kir2.3 and Kir2.1. Substitution of this sequence in Kir2.3 (N25–44IH) moderately reduced the level of CO2 sensitivity (54 ± 6%, n = 4). Unlike the two N-terminal regions mentioned above, an amino acid sequence near the M1 membrane-spanning domain containing about 10 residues was critical for CO2sensitivity. Replacement of this short sequence alone (N51–60IH) was sufficient to eliminate 80% of the CO2 sensitivity of the mutant Kir2.3 (13 ± 2%, n = 4). When this short sequence was constructed to Kir2.1 (N77–86IRK), we found that the mutant channel gained a substantial sensitivity to CO2(18 ± 5%, n = 4) and pHi (Figs. 5and 7). Extension of this sequence to 41 residues prior to the M1 domain of Kir2.3 (N46–86IRK) gave the mutant Kir2.1 a CO2sensitivity (36 ± 3%, n = 4) nearly the same as the HN-IRK (40 ± 4%, n = 6, p > 0.05) (Fig. 5). Therefore, this 10-residue motif is critical for the sensing of CO2/pH in Kir2.3, although another 30 amino acids (total 41 residues) around this motif are also needed to achieve the full effect of the entire N terminus. There is a high sequence homology in these 10 residues between Kir2.3 and Kir2.1, in which Kir2.3 differs from Kir2.1 in only three residues (Thr53, Tyr57, and Met60). Mutation of all of them into residues in Kir2.1 (T53I, Y57W, and M60V) greatly reduced the pH sensitivity by 0.6 pH units and generally disabled this mutant channel in terms of CO2 sensing (Fig. 6). Replacements of two of these residues (T53I, Y57W) had the same effect (Fig. 6 B). Even with a single mutation (T53I), the CO2 and pH sensitivities were severely diminished. Mutation of either tyrosine or methionine alone (Y57W or M60V) also caused a reduction in the CO2 and pH sensitivities, though their effects were much less than that of the T53I mutation. When these three residues were constructed to Kir2.1 (N77–86IRK), the effect was dramatic. The mutant Kir2.1 started to be inhibited at pHi6.6 with a pK value of 6.0 and h (Hill coefficient) of 2.3 (n = 5). Its pH sensitivity became more like that of HN-IRK, a chimera carrying the full N terminus from Kir2.3, than of the wild-type Kir2.1 (Fig.7). Mutation of isoleucine 79 alone (I79T-IRK) had an effect on converting the pH sensitivity of the Kir2.1 as effectively as the N77–86IRK mutation (pK 5.93,h 2.3, n = 5) (Fig. 7), demonstrating the critical role of the threonine 53 of Kir2.3 in CO2 and pHi sensing. Because threonine 53 in Kir2.3 is a protein kinase C phosphorylation site (21Zhu G. Qu Z. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11643-11646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), channel sensitivity to CO2 was studied in the presence of high concentration H7 (1-[5-isoquinolinesulfonyl]-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride, a blocker of protein kinases C and A; Sigma). After bathing the oocytes with 30 μm H7 for 20 min, exposure of the oocytes to 15% CO2 produced the same degree of inhibition of Kir2.3 currents (74 ± 3% control versus 72 ± 1% with H7, p > 0.05, paired Student's t test,n = 4), a result consistent with our studies of wild-type Kir2.3 using excised patches (see above). In our current studies, we have demonstrated that a molecular motif that is located on the N terminus consisting of about 10 amino acids is responsible for gating the Kir2.3 channel by high CO2 and low intracellular pH. Like Ca2+, nucleotides, and other second messengers, proton is an important regulator of cellular functions. A number of ion channels have been known to be modulated by protons; these include large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels, hcurrents, gap junctions, and γ-aminobutyric acid andN-monomethyl arginine receptor channels (22Traynelis S.F. Cull-Candy S.G. Nature. 1990; 345: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 23Krishek B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. J. Physiol.

Changes in the activity of these ion channels can take place under several physiological and pathophysiological conditions when intra- and extracellular pH levels are low. One of these conditions is high CO2 or hypercapnia. CO2 sensing by the central chemoreceptors is critical in feedback mechanisms controlling CO2 levels in mammals (5Mitchell R.A. Berger R.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1975; 111: 206-224PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schlaefke M.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 90: 171-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fitzgerrald R.S. Lahiri S. Fishman A.P.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 288Google Scholar), which may involve the modulation of K+ channel activity. Inhibition of inward rectifier K+ channels can produce depolarization and an increase in membrane excitability (2Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. J. Physiol. (London). 1997; 505: 267-282Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Although there are a number of ways to inhibit these K+ channels during hypercapnia, our current studies indicate that the mechanisms for the inhibition of Kir2.3 are related to the specific structure of the channel protein. We have found that fast and reversible inhibition of Kir2.3 activity by high CO2 or low pH can be seen in cell-free excised patches, indicating that cytosolic soluble factors such as second messengers, Mg2+, and polyamines are not players. Also, CO2/pH sensing is seen in Kir2.3 but not in Kir2.1, which has a nearly 80% homology to Kir2.3 in amino acid sequence, suggesting that a specific sequence in Kir2.3 protein underlies this sensitivity. Moreover, our data do not support the idea that the inhibition of Kir2.3 during hypercapnia or intracellular acidification is mediated by phosphorylation of channel proteins. There are chemical compounds in our intracellular solution to prevent channel rundown that are inhibitors of phosphatases and phosphodiesterases. This observation plus the lack of ATP and Mg2+ in our intracellular solution strongly suggests that the turnover of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in gating Kir2.3 may not occur under such an experimental condition. Also our results have shown that the inhibition of Kir2.3 activity by CO2 is not affected by the blockade of protein kinases C and A. Therefore, specific structures on Kir2.3 channel protein seem to be responsible for CO2 and pH sensing. If protons have a direct effect on channel functions, they may bind to the channel protein through certain titratable amino acid residues and alter conformation and activity of the channel. Also, protons can affect channel activity if they are involved in the binding of the channel protein with another protein. In any case, the channel protein should have specific sequences for these interactions. To locate these sites, we have studied the pH sensitivity of Kir2.3 channel by selectively replacing amino acid residues and peptide sequences in this channel with those in Kir2.1, which is not sensitive to a pH change in physiological ranges. These molecular genetic interventions have led us to look closely at the structure-functional relationship in the Kir2.3 channel in CO2/pH sensing. Consistent with the idea that the sensing mechanism is related to the channel protein, we have found that CO2/pH sensitivity requires the presence of the N-terminal region of Kir2.3. To find proton-binding sites in the N terminus, we have examined all of the histidine residues by substituting them with aspartate, a negatively charged amino acid, or by deleting all of them with another nine residues at the very end of the N terminus. However, none of these mutants has shown a change in its sensitivity to CO2 and pH, indicating that these histidines are not the pH sensor. Interestingly, the extracellular pH sensor does not involve titratable histidine residues either. Although an extracellular domain including a histidine is crucial in pHo sensing, it does not seem to have a proton-binding site. Indeed, selective substitution of the histidine residue in this cluster has no effect on the pHosensitivity of Kir2.3 (15Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, Coulter et al. (15Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) believe that an unidentified cysteine residue may play a role. Using these chimerical and site-directed mutant Kir channels, we have identified a consensus sequence in the N-terminal region of Kir2.3 that is crucial for Kir2.3 gating by CO2 and pHi. This motif is located in a conserved region near the M1 membrane-spanning domain. Although there are only three residues that are different between Kir2.3 and Kir2.1, this motif may involve some neighboring residues. Mutation of any of these residues causes a marked reduction in CO2 sensitivity. Of these three residues, the Thr53 is the key. Mutation of this residue leads to an almost complete loss of channel sensitivity to pHi and CO2, whereas creation of this residue in Kir2.1 makes the mutant channel pH-sensitive. Interestingly, threonine is not a titratable amino acid, and thereby pH change should not affect either its charges or its polarity. Thus, protons may not act directly on this residue to change channel conformation and activity. Then how can this residue be involved in CO2/pH sensing and the modulation of channel activity? We believe that there are at least three potential ways by which this threonine residue can participate in the modulation of channel activity during hypercapnia. 1) This residue may be engaged in the maintenance of the pK value of another amino acid residue(s) titratable at high or low pH, as suggested previously in Kir1.1 (20Jiang C. Agulian S. Haddad G.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 697-708Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer L.G. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar). 2) This residue may be involved in a motif that is required for protein-protein interactions in CO2/pH sensing. 3) Phosphorylation at this residue may occur during CO2/pHi exposure. Is it possible that protons bind to ionizable amino acids other than histidine residues in the N terminus? To answer this question, we have changed nonconserved lysine and arginine residues in the Kir2.3 N terminus into corresponding ones in the Kir2.1 (R6G, R14T, K16Q, and R17Q). Our data reveal that mutations of these residues do not affect CO2/pHi sensitivity. Also, we have systematically divided the N termini of Kir2.3 and Kir2.1 into several segments and rejoined them alternatively to construct chimerical N termini. These extensive interventions would allow us to interrupt the pH sensitivity of Kir2.3 if there were such a proton-binding site, whether on positively or negatively charged residues. Although some of these chimeras, such as the N51–60IH, are shown to be more critical than others in CO2/pH sensing, residues potentially titratable in physiological pH levels do not exist in the sequence of Kir2.3. Interestingly, there are three residues (Asp52, Arg54, and Arg56) that are titratable at extremely high or low pH in the short motif. We have tried to mutate some of them into neutral and polar residues (asparagine) in the Kir1.1 channel. Because they are highly conserved in all Kir channels, these mutations did not produce any functional channels (30Xu H.X. Chanchevalap S. Zhu G. Qu Z. Zhang Y. Haynie H. Jiang C. Abstr. Soc. Neurosci. 1998; 24: 148.8Google Scholar). Therefore, whether some of them are proton sensors with pK levels that can be affected by the Thr53 is still unknown. Because mutations of Thr53 and Tyr57 into nonpolar isoleucine and tryptophan dramatically reduced the CO2 sensitivity of Kir2.3, the polarity of positions 53 and 57 seems important in pH sensing. The periodicity of the three crucial residues (Thr53, Tyr57, and Met60) may suggest a helical structure in the region, but our search using the Chou-Fasman and Robson-Granier analyses did not show any helical structure in this short motif. Our results indicate amino acid sequences other than this motif are also needed to fulfill a complete CO2 and pHisensitivity. In addition to these 10 residues, we have observed that a sequence composed of a total 41 amino acids can produce an effect of CO2/pH as effectively as the entire N terminus. Also, the presence of the C terminus enhances the CO2/pH sensitivity of the mutant Kir channels, although it has no effect on CO2/pH sensing by itself. A simple explanation of these data would be that the C terminus interacts with the N terminus in gating the channel, as suggested recently in Kir1.1 by Schulte et al. (31Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our data, however, do not support the idea that CO2/pH sensing in Kir2.3 is a result of protein phosphorylation, as has been described above. Therefore, it is possible that CO2/pH sensing in Kir2.3 is mediated by an interaction of amino acid residues on the Kir2.3, which is affected by protons and controls the channel activity. Clearly, further understanding of the molecular mechanisms for Kir2.3 modulation by protons may provide information of channel gating under a variety of pathophysiological conditions, and the demonstration of these critical residues in CO2/pH sensing in our current studies constitutes an important step toward this goal. We believe that the molecular basis of pH sensing in Kir2.3 may underlie the CO2 chemoreception in the central nervous system. Studies on central chemoreceptors have shown that a large number of these cells depolarize and their membrane excitability increases during hypercapnia. This change in membrane excitability is not mediated by a change in synaptic transmission, because the depolarization persists with the removal of extracellular Ca2+ or exposure to tetrodotoxin (32Dean J.B. Bayliss D.A. Erickson J.T. Lawing W.L. Millhorn D.E. Neuroscience. 1990; 36: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although several ionic mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of membrane excitability during hypercapnia, K+ channels, especially the inward rectifier K+ channels, seem to be the major player (11Pineda J. Aghajanian G.K. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 723-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Jiang C. Zhu G.Y. Hayashi F. Haddad G.G. Abstr. Soc. Neurosci. 1997; 23: 171.5Google Scholar, 33Hayashi F. Jiang C. Takeda R. Haddad G.G. Abstr. Soc. Neurosci. 1992; 18: 348.10Google Scholar). The inhibition of these inward rectifier K+ channels during hypercapnia produces depolarization and increases membrane excitability (13Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.R. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). With two pH sensors on Kir2.3, cells can sense pH changes on either side of the plasma membranes, in their internal and external environment. Because the primary sensor is a K+ channel, the changes in intra- and extracellular pH can be readily coupled to membrane excitability in the nerve cells that are endowed with this pH sensing mechanism and in the neuronal networks to which these cells project. Because Kir2.3 is expressed in the central nervous system (14Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Karschin C. Karschin A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 10: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the determination of molecular mechanisms in proton sensing may be applicable to the search for unidentified homologues of the Kir2.3 channel in brain stem neurons, which may eventually result in the identification of the CO2 central chemoreceptors. We thank Drs. Lily L. Jan and Carol A. Vandenberg for the gifts of Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 cDNAs."

Mecham R.P. Biology of the Extracellular Matrix. 1. Academic Press, New York1986: 217-320Google Scholar). Neutrophil proteinases could therefore contribute to the development of connective tissue diseases, such as emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, or perionditis, but the involvement of cathepsin G in these processes remains controversial. Recent studies suggest alternative functions for cathepsin G in various cellular processes such as platelet activation (7LaRosa C.A. Rohrer M.J. Benoit S.E. Rodino L.J. Barnard M.R. Michelson A.D. J.

Immunology. 1998; 93: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cathepsin G also has a potent antibacterial activity that is independent of its serine protease activity (10Shafer W.M. Pohl J. Onunka V.C. Bangalore N. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 112-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of cathepsin G has been studied using a variety of protein and peptide substrates. This enzyme is implicated in the proteolysis of elastin, collagen type I and type II, cartilage proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, and immunoglobulins G and M (see Ref. 6Bieth J.G. Mecham R.P. Biology of the Extracellular Matrix. 1. Academic Press, New York1986: 217-320Google Scholar for a review). Cathepsin G is also able to interact with the V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 protein (11Avril L.E. Di Martino-Ferrer M. Brillard-Bourdet M. Gauthier F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and is involved in the proteolytic processing/activation of interleukin-8 (12Padrines M. Wolf M. Walz A. Baggiolini M.

Biochem. 1981; 118: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) has shown that cathepsin G has both chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like specificities but that it is much less active against all of the synthetic substrates assayed so far than are homologous serine proteinases. As no sensitive substrate suitable for enzymatic studies or the search for specific inhibitors of cathepsin G was available, we have developed a series of fluorogenic peptide substrates derived from the inhibitory loop of α1-antichymotrypsin, the main physiological inhibitor of cathepsin G (19Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some other serpins, including α1-proteinase inhibitor (19Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have also been reported to be cathepsin G inhibitors. Interaction of these two serpins with their cognate enzymes involves the cleavage of their reactive inhibitory loop with the production of a SDS-stable complex as a result of the formation of a covalent bond. Therefore, the sequence of serpin reactive loops may be used to develop peptide substrates of the corresponding target enzyme(s), as has been shown recently for human kallikreins hK1 1The abbreviations used are: hK1/hK2/hK3, human kallikreins 1, 2, and 3, respectively; Abz, ortho-aminobenzoic acid; AC, antichymotrypsin-derived substrate; ACT, α1-antichymotrypsin; EDDnp, N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; pNA, para-nitroanilide; SCCA, squamous cell carcinoma antigen; RSL, reactive site loop and hK2 (20Bourgeois L. Brillard-Bourdet M. Deperthes D. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Tremblay R.R. Dube J.Y. Gauthier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29590-29595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore prepared a series of intramolecularly quenched substrates of cathepsin G based on the sequence of various serpin-reactive site loops and bearing an ortho-aminobenzoyl (Abz) and quenching N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) ethylenediamine (EDDnp) as donor-acceptor pairs at the N and C termini of the peptides, respectively. The hydrolytic activity of cathepsin G was compared with that of such chymotrypsin-like enzymes as chymotrypsin, chymase, and human Kallikrein hK3 (also called prostate-specific antigen). The effects of residues at the P1 and P2 positions on substrate binding were assessed using the crystal structure of human cathepsin G (21Hof P. Mayr I. Huber R. Korzus E. Potempa J. Travis J. Powers J.C. Bode W. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5481-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The nomenclature used for the individual amino acid residues (P1, P2, etc.) of the substrate and corresponding residues of the enzyme subsites (S1, S2, etc.) is that of Schechter and Berger (22Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar). Human cathepsin G (EC 3.4.21.20) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, bovine chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and human recombinant chymase (EC 3.4.21.39) was kindly provided by Prof. Norman Schechter (Dept. of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). hK3 was purified as described previously (23Wang M.C. Valenzuela L.A. Murphy G.P. Chu T.M. Invest. Urol. 1979; 17: 159-163PubMed Google Scholar). N,N-Dimethylformamide and acetonitrile were from Merck, and C18 cartridges for reverse-phase chromatography were from Brownlee Laboratories. All other reagents were of analytical grade. All quenched fluorogenic substrates were synthesized by solid-phase procedures with the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology using a multiple automated peptide synthesizer (PSSM-8, Shimadzu Co.) according to previously described procedures (24Hirata I.Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M. Juliano L. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Oliveira M.C. Hirata I.Y. Chagas J.R. Boschcov P.

Biochem. 1991; 192: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Glutamine was the C-terminal residue in all peptides because of a requirement of the synthesis strategy (24Hirata I.Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M. Juliano L. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Substrate purity was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF; Micromass, TofSpec-E) and by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column eluted at 2 ml/min with a 10-min linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–60%) in 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid. Substrate stock solutions (2–5 mm) were prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide and diluted with activity buffer. Assays were carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl for cathepsin G and chymotrypsin, in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1.8 m NaCl for human chymase, and in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA for hK3. The hydrolysis of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrates was followed by measuring the fluorescence at λex = 320 nm and λem = 420 nm in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer. The system was standardized using Abz-FR-OH prepared from the total tryptic hydrolysis of an Abz-FR-pNA solution, and its concentration was determined from the absorbance at 410 nm, assuming ε410 nm = 8,800 m−1cm−1 for p-nitroanilide. Substrate concentrations of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp were determined by measuring the absorbance at 365 nm using ε365 nm = 17,300m−1 cm−1 for EDDnp. Specificity constants (k cat/K m) were determined under first-order conditions using a substrate concentration far below the K m (0.1–6 μm, depending on the enzyme). Final enzyme concentrations were 40–100 nm for cathepsin G, 18–70 nm for chymotrypsin, and 10–200 nm for chymase. Under these conditions, the Michaelis-Menten equation is reduced to the following:v = k obs·S, wherek obs =V m/K m. Integrating this equation over time gives ln [S] = −k obs.t + ln[S]o with [S]o and [S] being the substrate concentrations at time 0 and time t, respectively. Because V m =k cat·[E]t, where [E]t is the final enzyme concentration, dividing k obs by [E]tgave the k cat/K m ratio. The kobs for the first-order substrate hydrolysis was calculated by fitting experimental data to the first-order law using Enzfitter software (Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam). Cathepsin G and chymotrypsin were titrated with α1-antichymotrypsin as described previously (27Ermolieff J. Boudier C. Laine A. Meyer B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29502-29508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the concentration of active chymase was determined under standard assay conditions using 1 mmsuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA as a substrate and assuming a specific activity of 2.7 μmol of p-nitroaniline released min−1/nmol of chymase (28Schechter N.M. Jordan L.M. James A.M. Cooperman B.S. Wang Z.M. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23626-23633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K m and V m for the hydrolysis of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrates by cathepsin G were determined using 8–10 substrate concentrations (1–15 μm). The final concentration of cathepsin G was 20–100 nm depending on the substrate used. Experimental data were fitted to the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten rate equation using Enzfitter software. Values for k cat were obtained fromV m/[E]t =k cat. Fluorogenic substrates (4–80 μm final concentration) were incubated with cathepsin G (200–400 nm), chymotrypsin (7–75 nm), or chymase (20–120 nm) at 37 °C in their respective buffers. The reaction was blocked by adding 3 μl of trifluoroacetic acid, and aliquots (200 μl) were removed at times ranging from 2 min to 1 h depending on the substrate and enzyme used. The substrate fragments generated were purified by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column (2.1 × 30 mm, Brownlee), a P200 pump (Thermo Separation Products), and a Spectrasystem UV3000 detector ((Thermo Separation Products), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with a linear (0–60%, v/v) gradient of acetonitrile in 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid over 12 min. Eluted peaks were simultaneously monitored at three wavelengths (220, 320, and 360 nm), which allowed the direct identification of EDDnp-containing peptides prior to sequencing or amino acid analysis. Cleavage sites were identified by N-terminal sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 477A pulsed liquid sequencer with the chemicals and program recommended by the manufacturer. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were identified with an on-line model 120A analyzer. Alternatively, cleavage sites were identified by the amino acid composition of Abz-containing hydrolysis products by acid hydrolysis of the fragments in 6 n HCl at 165 °C for 90 min and an Applied Biosystems 420A derivatizer coupled to a 130A separation system. Phenylthiocarbamide-amino acids were detected at 254 nm and identified and quantified by reference to phenylthiocarbamide-amino acid standards. The model of a P3-P3′ hexapeptide (TPFSAL) complexed to cathepsin G was constructed using the Insight II and Discover molecular modeling and energy minimization programs (Biosym Technologies Inc.). The coordinates for cathepsin G (Protein Data Bank code 1cgh) (21Hof P. Mayr I. Huber R. Korzus E. Potempa J. Travis J. Powers J.C. Bode W. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5481-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), where the complexed succinyl-Val-Pro-PheP-(Oph)2 inhibitor (where (Oph)2 is diphenyl ester) was first removed, were optimally superimposed onto the ecotin-crab collagenase complex (29Perona J.J. Tsu C.A. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5381-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The P3-P3′ side chains in bound ecotin were changed to those for the model substrate by keeping the same conformation, except for Phe at the P1 position, in which the side chain was manually moved to adopt a conformation similar to that of the Phe occupying the S1 pocket of cathepsin G. Flanking residues were deleted and the substrate-cathepsin G complex was minimized using the steepest descent algorithm until the derivative was <0.1 kcal/mol/Å, with the cathepsin G atoms fixed to their crystallographic positions and the atoms of the substrate backbone tethered with a force constant of 500 kcal/mol/Å2. The activity of proteolytic enzymes is generally measured by the amidolytic release of a chromophore or a fluorophore covalently attached to a peptide moiety that confers the specificity to the enzyme under study. Cathepsin G, like some other serine proteases including proteinase 3 or hK3 (also called prostate-specific antigen), has little activity toward these substrates because of a low intrinsic catalytic activity of the proteinase or a low affinity with the peptide moiety. We have therefore used peptide sequences derived from proteolytically sensitive loops in natural serpin inhibitors to synthesize substrates with intramolecularly quenched fluorescence (TableI) that have residues on both sides of the cleavage site. The interaction of serpins with their cognate enzymes results in cleavage of the reactive loop, leading to either the formation of a covalent, enzymatically inactive, complex (inhibitory pathway) or the release of an inactive serpin of lower intramolecular energy that has undergone a large conformational change (substrate pathway). This conformational change results in the insertion of the cleaved loop in a β-sheet of the protein. Partitioning of serpin between the substrate and the inhibitor pathway depends on the serpin-proteinase pair and explains why there can be stoichiometries of inhibition >1 (30Schechter N.M. Sprows J.L. Schoenberger O.L. Lazarus G.S. Cooperman B.S. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21308-21315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because serpin specificity toward a proteinase is governed mainly by the inhibitory loop sequence, synthetic peptides derived from the variable loop structure of individual serpin inhibitors should be good substrates for the corresponding cognate serine proteinase(s). This approach was recently used to develop substrates of hK2 and hK1 (20Bourgeois L. Brillard-Bourdet M. Deperthes D. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Tremblay R.R. Dube J.Y. Gauthier F. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The sequence alignment is based on the scissile bond at the P1-P1′ site in the corresponding native serpins. α1-Antichymotrypsin (ACT) is the major physiological inhibitor of cathepsin G and is also an inhibitor of chymase and chymotrypsin (31Hayem A. Marko D. Laine A. Davril M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 240: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Peptide substrates of increasing length (Table I), reproducing the sequence of human ACT loop from P5 to P15′ (nomenclature based on the Leu-Ser cleavage site in the ACT reactive loop denoted as P1-P′1 (22Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar)), were synthesized and assayed as substrates of cathepsin G and related enzymes having chymotrypsin-like specificity, such as human chymase, bovine chymotrypsin, and human kallikrein hK3. The specificity constantsk cat/K m for the hydrolysis of substrates were determined under first-order conditions,i.e. using substrate concentrations far below the supposedK m, thus avoiding the intermolecular quenching that occurs when the substrate concentration and/or length increases. As the specificity constant is not influenced by the nature of the rate-limiting step or by nonproductive substrate binding (32Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 105-111Google Scholar), it can be compared for different substrates and enzymes. All ACT-derived substrates were hydrolyzed by cathepsin G, chymotrypsin, and chymase (Table II), although at different rates, in keeping with the inhibition spectrum of ACT. The three enzymes cleaved the shortest substrate of the series (AC-2) with the same k cat/K m, but the specificity constant increased dramatically with the peptide length using chymotrypsin and chymase, except for the longest substrate (AC-6), whereas it remains essentially constant for cathepsin G. This shows the importance of the residues from P13 to P5, and to a lesser extent of residues at P4′-P5′, for the interaction between the substrate and chymotrypsin-like proteinases. Under the experimental conditions used, we found no significant hydrolysis of these substrates by hK3, despite the fact that this chymotrypsin-like enzyme is inhibited by α1-antichymotrypsin in vivo (33Christensson A. Laurell C.B. Lilja H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). This result could be because of the low reactivity of hK3 against synthetic substrates (33Christensson A. Laurell C.B. Lilja H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) or because the inhibition mechanism of this proteinase by ACT is different and results in a different site of cleavage or no cleavage of the reactive loop.Table IISpecificity constants kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of fluorogenic substrates derived from the α1-antichymotrypsin-reactive site loop by cathepsin G, chymotrypsin, and chymaseSubstrateNo.k cat/K mCathepsin GChymotrypsinChymasemm −1 s −1Abz-LLSALQ-EDDnpAC-27.7 ± 0.2aValues are means ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Cleavage sites in ACT-derived substrates were identified by reverse-phase HPLC fractionation of hydrolysis products and sequencing of the EDDnp-containing fragment(s) and/or by amino acid analysis of the Abz-containing fragment. Cathepsin G, chymotrypsin, and chymase all cleaved the same Leu-Ser bond in all substrates tested, whatever the substrate length (Fig. 1). This cleavage site is identical to that in α1-antichymotrypsin-proteinase complexes. This result emphasizes the importance of this sequence as a whole fitting into the enzyme active site, because there was no further cleavage after the other two Leu residues. Substrates derived from the sequence of α1-proteinase inhibitor and squamous cell carcinoma antigen-2 (SCCA2) (34Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A.

All enzymes cleaved at the same Met-Ser bond as that reported in α1-proteinase inhibitor upon interaction with most of target proteinases. A different cleavage site, at the Phe352-Leu353 bond of the α1-proteinase inhibitor, has been reported for chymase (28Schechter N.M. Jordan L.M. James A.M. Cooperman B.S. Wang Z.M. Rubin H. J. Biol.

This finding could explain the low activity of chymase on the α1-proteinase inhibitor-derived substrate AP-1, which does not contain the Phe-Leu pair. The SCCA2-derived substrate SC-2 was poorly hydrolyzed by cathepsin G but was very efficiently cleaved by chymase at the same Leu-Ser bond. Chymotrypsin did not hydrolyze the SCCA2-derived substrate SC-2, which agrees with the fact that it is not inhibited by native SCCA2, unlike cathepsin G or chymase (34Schick C. Kamachi Y.

P., Leslie, A. G. W., Lutter, R., and Walker, J. E. (1994)Nature 370, 621–628). To test this hypothesis we selectively deleted C-terminal residues from the chloroplast γ subunit, two at a time starting at the sixth residue from the end and finishing at the 20th residue from the end. The mutant γ genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and assembled with a native α3β3 complex. All the mutant forms of γ assembled as effectively as the wild-type γ. Deletion of the terminal 6 residues of γ resulted in a significant increase (>50%) in the Ca-dependent ATPase activity when compared with the wild-type assembly. The increased activity persisted even after deletion of the C-terminal 14 residues, well beyond the seven residues proposed to form the spindle. Further deletions resulted in a decreased activity to ∼19% of that of the wild-type enzyme after deleting all 20 C-terminal residues. The results indicate that the tip of the γC terminus is not essential for catalysis and raise questions about the role of the C terminus as a spindle for rotation. It has been suggested that the last seven to nine amino acid residues at the C terminus of the γ subunit of the ATP synthase act as a spindle for rotation of the γ subunit with respect to the αβ subunits during catalysis (Abrahams, J.

The ATP synthase enzymes of the inner membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, couple the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The general structural features of the enzyme are highly conserved from one organism to another. It is comprised of an integral membrane-spanning H+-translocating segment (F0 or factor O) and a peripheral membrane segment (F1 or factor 1) which contains the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. The F1 segment is comprised of five different polypeptide subunits designated α to ε in order of decreasing molecular weight. The subunit stoichiometry is α3β3γ1δ1 and ε1. Nucleotide binding is associated with the α and β subunits, whereas the γ and ε subunits play regulatory and/or structural roles. The δ subunit is likely to be involved in binding the F1 segment to the F0 segment (reviewed in Ref. 1Richter M.L. Mills D.A. Yocum C. Ort D. Advances in Photosynthesis. IV. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1996: 453-468Google Scholar).A high resolution crystal structure of the core catalytic portion of the mitochondrial F1 enzyme was reported recently (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits alternate with each other to form a hexameric ring with one nucleotide binding site located at each of the six αβ subunit interfaces. Part of the structure of the γ subunit was also solved, including well conserved regions of the N and C termini. The C terminus, from residues 209 to 272 forms a single α helix that stretches from below the base to the top of the αβ hexamer (see Fig. 5). The last nine residues of this remarkably long helix are predominantly hydrophobic in nature and pass through a greasy sleeve formed by a ring of hydrophobic residues provided by interacting N-terminal β barrel domains of all six of the α and β subunits. On the basis of this unusual asymmetric structure, it was suggested that the C-terminal helix of the γ subunit forms a spindle around which the αβ hexamer rotates, rotation being facilitated by the hydrophobic (greasy) nature of the amino acids involved. That is, the αβ subunits provide a bearing through which the tip of the γ subunit passes and within which the γ subunit rotates. Although the amino acid sequences of γ subunits from different organisms show little overall homology, segments near the N and C termini are quite well conserved suggesting that they may be involved in forming important contacts with other F1 subunits (3Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 4Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The crystal structure of F1 indicated that the three αβ pairs of the αβ hexamer also make direct contact with other regions of the γ subunit to induce different conformational states of the nucleotide binding sites at the α/β subunit interfaces. During rotation, each nucleotide binding site would sequentially alternate between three different conformational states, each state dictated by a different type of interaction with the γ subunit. Such rotation has been predicted from kinetic studies (5Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), has been supported by several recent experiments (7Duncan T.M. Bulygin V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar).In this study we have tested the “bearing” hypothesis specifically suggested by the crystal structure, by selectively deleting amino acid residues from the extreme C-terminal end of the γ subunit, which, in the mitochondrial enzyme, extends through the greasy sleeve of the αβ hexamer. To do this we utilized an efficient reconstitution system reported earlier (11Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9763-9769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in which the native γ subunit isolated from CF1 1The abbreviations used are: CF1, chloroplast coupling factor 1; CF1(−δε), CF1 deficient in the δ and ε subunits; PCR, polymerase chain reation; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild type 1The abbreviations used are: CF1, chloroplast coupling factor 1; CF1(−δε), CF1 deficient in the δ and ε subunits; PCR, polymerase chain reation; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild type was reconstituted with an isolated αβ subunit complex. The cloned γ subunit could effectively replace the native γ subunit in reconstitution of the core enzyme complex. 2M. Sokolov, L. Lu, W. Tucker, F. Gao, P. A. Gegenheimer, and M. L. Richter, manuscript in preparation. 2M. Sokolov, L. Lu, W. Tucker, F. Gao, P. A. Gegenheimer, and M. L. Richter, manuscript in preparation. Eight genetically engineered γ subunits, lacking between 6 and 20 of the C-terminal amino acids, were tested for assembly with the αβ subunits, and the catalytic activities of the assembled complexes were examined. The results demonstrate that the tip of the C terminus of the γ subunit, from residues 304 to 323 (chloroplast numbering), is not essential for rapid turnover by CF1.DISCUSSIONA cross-sectional view through the structure of the beef heart mitochondrial F1 is shown in Fig.5. The tip of the C terminus of the γ subunit, more specifically the last 7–10 residues, is surrounded by a sleeve of residues formed by part of the tightly packed β barrel domains of the six α and β subunits. The sleeve residues, located in the region marked A on the β subunit in Fig. 5, have an overall hydrophobic character as do the nearby residues on the γ subunit. A hydrophobic contact between γ and the surrounding sleeve could allow the γ subunit to act as a spindle around which the αβ hexamer could rotate with minimum frictional resistance (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The base of the C-terminal helix of γ is offset from the central axis of the hexamer by ∼7 Å, so that, provided it remained rigid, it would sequentially and reversibly come into contact with regions of the α and β subunits during rotation to create the required asymmetry among the nucleotide binding sites.The remarkably high amino acid sequence conservation among the α and β subunits of F1 enzymes from different species, together with the fact that the structures of the α and β subunits of a thermophilic bacterium can be essentially superimposed upon those of the mitochondrial F1 subunits (26Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), are cogent reasons for assuming that all of the F1 enzymes have a very similar overall structure and utilize the same basic mechanism for ATP synthesis. There is, however, some evidence suggesting that there may be some minor structural differences among the F1 enzymes. For example, site mapping studies of the chloroplast F1using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (27Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5755-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as well as chemical cross-linking experiments (28Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8951-8955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated that cysteine 322, which is the second last amino acid residue at the C terminus of the CF1 γ subunit, is located near the base of the αβ hexamer, more than 60 Å away from its position in the mitochondrial F1. The reason for this difference is not understood at this time but is particularly intriguing given the significant amino acid sequence homology which is apparent in the C-terminal domains of γ subunits from different organisms (Ref. 4Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar; also see Fig. 1). Moreover, a different location for the γC terminus implies that the idea that the C-terminal helix of γ acts as a spindle for rotation is probably not correct, at least not as originally envisioned based on the mitochondrial F1 structure (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar).We have selectively deleted part of γC terminus reasoning that if this region of γ was indeed acting as the tip of a spindle for rotation, or if it was in any way critical for catalysis by CF1, the deletion should result in a complete loss of catalytic activity. However, the enzyme containing mutant γ subunits missing up to 20 amino acids from the C terminus was still capable of significant catalytic activity, which, with the exception of the D20 mutant, was sensitive to specific allosteric inhibitors of CF1; a strong indication that the mutant enzymes followed the usual cooperative catalytic pathway and that their activities were not artifactual. It is noteworthy that a similar result was obtained for E. coli F1 (29Iwamoto A. Miki J. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5043-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that case, membranes containing the mutant enzyme retained a limited catalytic activity (∼10% of both ATP hydrolysis and synthesis) following deletion of 10 residues from the C terminus. Deletion more than 10 residues from the C terminus resulted in a complete loss of activity in that case, although the enzyme still apparently correctly assembled on the membrane. The greater sensitivity of the E. coli enzyme to deletion of the C terminus may reflect a different structural requirement for catalysis by the F0-F1 complex than for the isolated F1. The activity of the E. coli F1mutants following isolation from the membrane was not investigated in that study.The initial activation of enzyme turnover upon deletion of up to 14 residues from the C terminus of γ occurred for both the calcium- and the magnesium-dependent ATPase activities. One likely explanation for this effect is that the deletions resulted in a partial loosening of the structure of the enzyme to a point where it weakened binding of the cation-ADP reaction product at the catalytic site(s) in the interfacial region between α and β subunits. Since the off-rate of the cation-ADP limits the overall reaction rate, the end result is to increase the K cat of the enzyme. This would also explain why the sulfite-stimulated activity is inhibited rather than stimulated by the deletions. Assuming that the presence of high concentrations of sulfite maximally reduce the off-rate of cation-ADP so that the on-rate of the cation-ATP now becomes rate-limiting, a further reduction in nucleotide affinity at the catalytic site caused by the γ deletions would result in a reduction in the on-rate for the cation-ATP substrate and thus a reduction in theK cat. This could also explain the reduced apparent affinities for the ε subunit and for tentoxin, which resulted from the C-terminal deletions. Both inhibitors are known to block cooperative release of bound nucleotides, probably by stabilizing a rigid inhibited conformation of CF1 (1Richter M.L. Mills D.A. Yocum C. Ort D. Advances in Photosynthesis. IV. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1996: 453-468Google Scholar, 12Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8536-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus a loosening of the F1 structure might favor the activated conformation over the inhibited conformation. The structural change resulting in altered inhibitor affinity does not necessarily have to be large, since small perturbations of γ structure, such as reduction of the γ disulfide bond or single-site cleavage of γ by trypsin, are known to markedly decrease the affinity of CF1 for the ε subunit (30Soteropoulos P. Suss K.-H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The chloroplast γ subunit has a glycine residue at position 310, 14 residues in from the C-terminal end (Fig. 1). Most secondary structural prediction algorithms predict a break in the C-terminal helix of γ at Gly-310. If the CF1 γ were to turn back on itself at this point, the cysteine at position 322 would face toward the bottom part of CF1 (i.e. toward the membrane in CF1-F0) and come close to the position of this residue determined by fluorescence distance mapping (27Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5755-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This would create a three-helix bundle in the central cavity of the enzyme rather than the two-helix bundle identified in the mitochondrial enzyme (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). If this is the case, the important binding interactions between γ and the αβ subunits identified in the mitochondrial enzyme, and which are likely to be primarily responsible for creating asymmetry among the different catalytic sites, might also be preserved in CF1. Deleting the 14 C-terminal residues from CF1 γ would remove the third helix from the central bundle, possibly decreasing the number of contacts between γ and the αβ subunits. This could feasibly have the effect of loosening the structure, thereby weakening the nucleotide affinity. The sharp decrease in catalytic activity, which occurred upon deleting residues beyond the first 14, may have resulted from an interference with the important γ-αβ interactions. For example, the arginines at positions 254 and 256 in MF1 are surrounded by a ring of 9 charged residues located on six loop segments of the α and β subunits marked “B” on one of the β subunits in Fig. 5. In the MF1 structure, Arg-254 and Gln-255 form hydrogen bonds with adjacent residues in the β subunit loop to form one of the few sites of direct contact between γ and the α and β subunits (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Assuming that CF1 has the same arrangement in this region of γ, deleting residues in the near vicinity of the site of contact would be expected to significantly compromise catalytic function as was observed.Interestingly, an earlier study of the E. coli enzyme (31Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 867-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that mutations near the C terminus of the γ subunit were able to restore catalytic function to functionally impaired enzymes which contained mutations near the N terminus. The original interpretation of these results was that the two mutations are in close proximity to each other. If this is true it would place the C terminus of the E. coli γ in a location very close to that of the chloroplast γ as determined by the fluorescence mapping experiments, assuming of course that the position of the N terminus of the E. coliγ is similar to that of the mitochondrial enzyme.In conclusion, the results of this study have demonstrated that the extreme C-terminal 20 residues of the γ subunit of CF1are not essential for normal cooperative catalytic turnover by the isolated enzyme. The results eliminate the possibility of a catalytic mechanism that is universal to all F1 enzymes in which the tip of the C terminus of the γ subunit must act as a spindle for rotational catalysis. The lack of functional importance of this part of the γ subunit for rapid turnover by CF1 is consistent with earlier work indicating that the conformation of the C-terminal portion of the γ subunit of the chloroplast ATP synthase may differ from that of the mitochondrial enzyme. The results further suggest that the contacts between the α, β, and γ subunits of the enzyme, which are essential for rotational catalysis must be provided by regions of the γ subunit other than the extreme C terminus. The ATP synthase enzymes of the inner membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, couple the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The general structural features of the enzyme are highly conserved from one organism to another.

This would also explain why the sulfite-stimulated activity is inhibited rather than stimulated by the deletions. Assuming that the presence of high concentrations of sulfite maximally reduce the off-rate of cation-ADP so that the on-rate of the cation-ATP now becomes rate-limiting, a further reduction in nucleotide affinity at the catalytic site caused by the γ deletions would result in a reduction in the on-rate for the cation-ATP substrate and thus a reduction in theK cat. This could also explain the reduced apparent affinities for the ε subunit and for tentoxin, which resulted from the C-terminal deletions. Both inhibitors are known to block cooperative release of bound nucleotides, probably by stabilizing a rigid inhibited conformation of CF1 (1Richter M.L. Mills D.A. Yocum C. Ort D. Advances in Photosynthesis. IV. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1996: 453-468Google Scholar, 12Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8536-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus a loosening of the F1 structure might favor the activated conformation over the inhibited conformation. The structural change resulting in altered inhibitor affinity does not necessarily have to be large, since small perturbations of γ structure, such as reduction of the γ disulfide bond or single-site cleavage of γ by trypsin, are known to markedly decrease the affinity of CF1 for the ε subunit (30Soteropoulos P. Suss K.-H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The chloroplast γ subunit has a glycine residue at position 310, 14 residues in from the C-terminal end (Fig. 1). Most secondary structural prediction algorithms predict a break in the C-terminal helix of γ at Gly-310. If the CF1 γ were to turn back on itself at this point, the cysteine at position 322 would face toward the bottom part of CF1 (i.e. toward the membrane in CF1-F0) and come close to the position of this residue determined by fluorescence distance mapping (27Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5755-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This would create a three-helix bundle in the central cavity of the enzyme rather than the two-helix bundle identified in the mitochondrial enzyme (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). If this is the case, the important binding interactions between γ and the αβ subunits identified in the mitochondrial enzyme, and which are likely to be primarily responsible for creating asymmetry among the different catalytic sites, might also be preserved in CF1. Deleting the 14 C-terminal residues from CF1 γ would remove the third helix from the central bundle, possibly decreasing the number of contacts between γ and the αβ subunits. This could feasibly have the effect of loosening the structure, thereby weakening the nucleotide affinity. The sharp decrease in catalytic activity, which occurred upon deleting residues beyond the first 14, may have resulted from an interference with the important γ-αβ interactions. For example, the arginines at positions 254 and 256 in MF1 are surrounded by a ring of 9 charged residues located on six loop segments of the α and β subunits marked “B” on one of the β subunits in Fig. 5. In the MF1 structure, Arg-254 and Gln-255 form hydrogen bonds with adjacent residues in the β subunit loop to form one of the few sites of direct contact between γ and the α and β subunits (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Assuming that CF1 has the same arrangement in this region of γ, deleting residues in the near vicinity of the site of contact would be expected to significantly compromise catalytic function as was observed.Interestingly, an earlier study of the E. coli enzyme (31Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 867-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that mutations near the C terminus of the γ subunit were able to restore catalytic function to functionally impaired enzymes which contained mutations near the N terminus. The original interpretation of these results was that the two mutations are in close proximity to each other. If this is true it would place the C terminus of the E. coli γ in a location very close to that of the chloroplast γ as determined by the fluorescence mapping experiments, assuming of course that the position of the N terminus of the E. coliγ is similar to that of the mitochondrial enzyme.In conclusion, the results of this study have demonstrated that the extreme C-terminal 20 residues of the γ subunit of CF1are not essential for normal cooperative catalytic turnover by the isolated enzyme. The results eliminate the possibility of a catalytic mechanism that is universal to all F1 enzymes in which the tip of the C terminus of the γ subunit must act as a spindle for rotational catalysis. The lack of functional importance of this part of the γ subunit for rapid turnover by CF1 is consistent with earlier work indicating that the conformation of the C-terminal portion of the γ subunit of the chloroplast ATP synthase may differ from that of the mitochondrial enzyme. The results further suggest that the contacts between the α, β, and γ subunits of the enzyme, which are essential for rotational catalysis must be provided by regions of the γ subunit other than the extreme C terminus. A cross-sectional view through the structure of the beef heart mitochondrial F1 is shown in Fig.5. The tip of the C terminus of the γ subunit, more specifically the last 7–10 residues, is surrounded by a sleeve of residues formed by part of the tightly packed β barrel domains of the six α and β subunits. The sleeve residues, located in the region marked A on the β subunit in Fig. 5, have an overall hydrophobic character as do the nearby residues on the γ subunit. A hydrophobic contact between γ and the surrounding sleeve could allow the γ subunit to act as a spindle around which the αβ hexamer could rotate with minimum frictional resistance (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The base of the C-terminal helix of γ is offset from the central axis of the hexamer by ∼7 Å, so that, provided it remained rigid, it would sequentially and reversibly come into contact with regions of the α and β subunits during rotation to create the required asymmetry among the nucleotide binding sites. The remarkably high amino acid sequence conservation among the α and β subunits of F1 enzymes from different species, together with the fact that the structures of the α and β subunits of a thermophilic bacterium can be essentially superimposed upon those of the mitochondrial F1 subunits (26Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), are cogent reasons for assuming that all of the F1 enzymes have a very similar overall structure and utilize the same basic mechanism for ATP synthesis. There is, however, some evidence suggesting that there may be some minor structural differences among the F1 enzymes. For example, site mapping studies of the chloroplast F1using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (27Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5755-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as well as chemical cross-linking experiments (28Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8951-8955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated that cysteine 322, which is the second last amino acid residue at the C terminus of the CF1 γ subunit, is located near the base of the αβ hexamer, more than 60 Å away from its position in the mitochondrial F1. The reason for this difference is not understood at this time but is particularly intriguing given the significant amino acid sequence homology which is apparent in the C-terminal domains of γ subunits from different organisms (Ref. 4Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar; also see Fig. 1). Moreover, a different location for the γC terminus implies that the idea that the C-terminal helix of γ acts as a spindle for rotation is probably not correct, at least not as originally envisioned based on the mitochondrial F1 structure (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). We have selectively deleted part of γC terminus reasoning that if this region of γ was indeed acting as the tip of a spindle for rotation, or if it was in any way critical for catalysis by CF1, the deletion should result in a complete loss of catalytic activity. However, the enzyme containing mutant γ subunits missing up to 20 amino acids from the C terminus was still capable of significant catalytic activity, which, with the exception of the D20 mutant, was sensitive to specific allosteric inhibitors of CF1; a strong indication that the mutant enzymes followed the usual cooperative catalytic pathway and that their activities were not artifactual. It is noteworthy that a similar result was obtained for E. coli F1 (29Iwamoto A. Miki J. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5043-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that case, membranes containing the mutant enzyme retained a limited catalytic activity (∼10% of both ATP hydrolysis and synthesis) following deletion of 10 residues from the C terminus. Deletion more than 10 residues from the C terminus resulted in a complete loss of activity in that case, although the enzyme still apparently correctly assembled on the membrane. The greater sensitivity of the E. coli enzyme to deletion of the C terminus may reflect a different structural requirement for catalysis by the F0-F1 complex than for the isolated F1. The activity of the E. coli F1mutants following isolation from the membrane was not investigated in that study. The initial activation of enzyme turnover upon deletion of up to 14 residues from the C terminus of γ occurred for both the calcium- and the magnesium-dependent ATPase activities. One likely explanation for this effect is that the deletions resulted in a partial loosening of the structure of the enzyme to a point where it weakened binding of the cation-ADP reaction product at the catalytic site(s) in the interfacial region between α and β subunits. Since the off-rate of the cation-ADP limits the overall reaction rate, the end result is to increase the K cat of the enzyme. This would also explain why the sulfite-stimulated activity is inhibited rather than stimulated by the deletions. Assuming that the presence of high concentrations of sulfite maximally reduce the off-rate of cation-ADP so that the on-rate of the cation-ATP now becomes rate-limiting, a further reduction in nucleotide affinity at the catalytic site caused by the γ deletions would result in a reduction in the on-rate for the cation-ATP substrate and thus a reduction in theK cat. This could also explain the reduced apparent affinities for the ε subunit and for tentoxin, which resulted from the C-terminal deletions. Both inhibitors are known to block cooperative release of bound nucleotides, probably by stabilizing a rigid inhibited conformation of CF1 (1Richter M.L. Mills D.A. Yocum C. Ort D. Advances in Photosynthesis. IV. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1996: 453-468Google Scholar, 12Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8536-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus a loosening of the F1 structure might favor the activated conformation over the inhibited conformation. The structural change resulting in altered inhibitor affinity does not necessarily have to be large, since small perturbations of γ structure, such as reduction of the γ disulfide bond or single-site cleavage of γ by trypsin, are known to markedly decrease the affinity of CF1 for the ε subunit (30Soteropoulos P. Suss K.-H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chloroplast γ subunit has a glycine residue at position 310, 14 residues in from the C-terminal end (Fig. 1). Most secondary structural prediction algorithms predict a break in the C-terminal helix of γ at Gly-310. If the CF1 γ were to turn back on itself at this point, the cysteine at position 322 would face toward the bottom part of CF1 (i.e. toward the membrane in CF1-F0) and come close to the position of this residue determined by fluorescence distance mapping (27Richter M.L.

Genetic tagging and mapping of the mutations revealed that two loci in the E. coli linkage map are involved in creating a novel ribose transport mechanism. One mutation was found in ptsG, the glucose-specific transporter of phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system and the other in mlc, recently reported to be involved in the regulation of ptsG. Five different mutations in ptsG were characterized, whose growth on d-ribose medium was about 80% that of the high affinity system (Rbs+). Two of them were found in the predicted periplasmic loops, whereas three others are in the transmembrane region. Ribose uptakes in the mutants, competitively inhibited by d-glucose, d-xylose, ord-allose, were much lower than that of the high affinity transporter but higher than those of the Als and Xyl systems. Further analyses of the mutants revealed that the rbsK (ribokinase) and rbsD (function unknown) genes are involved in the ribose transport through PtsG, indicating that the phosphorylation of ribose is not mediated by PtsG and that some unknown metabolic function mediated by RbsD is required. It was also found thatd-xylose, another sugar not involved in phosphorylation, was efficiently transported through the wild-type or mutant PtsG inmlc-negative background. The efficiencies of xylose and glucose transports are variable in the PtsG mutants, depending on their locations, either in the periplasm or in the membrane. In an extreme case of the transmembrane change (I283T), xylose transport is virtually abolished, indicating that the residue is directly involved in determining sugar specificity. We propose that there are at least two domains for substrate specificity in PtsG with slightly altered recognition properties.

We propose that there are at least two domains for substrate specificity in PtsG with slightly altered recognition properties. d-Ribose is a pentose sugar commonly found as a component of nucleic acids. It can be utilized by many bacteria as a sole carbon source. In Escherichia coli, the sugar is transported via the high affinity RbsACB transporter, a member of the ABC 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP binding cassette; PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system; bp, base pair(s) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP binding cassette; PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system; bp, base pair(s)-type permeases (1Iida A.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylated by ribokinase (3Hope J.N. Bell A.W. Hermodson M.A. Groake J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7663-7668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lopilato et al.(4Lopilato J.E. Garwin J.L. Emr S.D. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed genetically that at least one low affinity ribose transport system exists which shares the kinase activity with the high affinity ribose transporter. Therefore, it has been believed that a specific low affinity transporter for ribose may exist, similar to xylE for d-xylose andaraE for l-arabinose. On the other hand, it was recently reported that d-ribose can be transported through another high affinity transport system for d-xylose (5Song S. Park C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 255-261PubMed Google Scholar) andd-allose (6Kim C. Song S. Park C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7631-7637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), structurally related to d-ribose, by a mutational derepression allowing an elevated level of transport components. The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) couples translocation and phosphorylation for the PTS sugars, e.g. glucose, mannose, and mannitol. Permeases of the PTS system differ in their substrate specificity but share the two general cytoplasmic PTS proteins, the enzymes I encoded byptsI and HPr by ptsH, which sequentially transfer phosphoryl groups from phosphoenolpyruvate to their specific sugars. The glucose transporter consists of two subunits, IIAGlcencoded by the crr gene and IIBCGlc encoded byptsG. IIAGlc is a hydrophilic protein phosphorylated in its His-90 residue (7Dorschug M. Frank R. Kalbitzer H.R. Hengstenberg W. Deutscher J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is a central regulatory molecule in catabolite repression. IIBCGlc (PtsG) consists of the N-terminal domain with eight transmembrane peptides (8Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the hydrophilic C-terminal domain containing a phosphorylation site at Cys-421 (9Meins M. Jeno P. Muller D. Richter W.J. Rosenbush J.R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of PtsG protein is homologous to that ofN-acetylglucosamine transporter, which has three domains corresponding to IIBCGlc and IIAGlc in a single polypeptide, and that of malX gene product, which can complement ptsG when expressed constitutively (10Riedl J. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4862-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to glucose, PtsG is involved in the transport of other sugars that are structurally related to glucose, i.e. methyl α-glucoside, 2-deoxyglucose, glucosamine, mannose,l-sorbose, and 5-thioglucose. Even though transport does not occur in the PTS system without phosphorylation, there are mutations in ptsG that allow facilitated diffusion of glucose without phosphorylation (11Ruijter G.J.G. Van Meurs G. Verwey M.A. Postma P.W. Van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2843-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or vice versa (12Buhr A. Daniels G.A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3847-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation that alters the substrate specificity to allow transport of mannitol, another PTS sugar, was mapped in one of the transmembrane helices of PtsG (13Begley G.S. Warner K.A. Arents J.C. Postma P.W. Jacobson G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 940-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the coupling between phosphorylation and translocation or about the structure determining substrate specificity. The Mlc protein was at first reported as a factor affecting glucose transport, causing an enlarged colony size when overproduced because of a decrease in acetate production as a result of a reduced glucose utilization (14Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that it is involved in the regulation of several sugar operons, i.e. manXYZ (14Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), malT(15Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and ptsG (16Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mlc is a 406-amino acid protein containing a putative helix-turn-helix motif at its C-terminal residue that seems to be required for DNA binding involved in a repression. In searching for secondary d-ribose transporters different from the high affinity system, we discovered that two mutations were simultaneously required for the utilization of ribose, one at theptsG gene, a glucose-specific PTS permease, and the other atmlc, a negative regulator of ptsG (16Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mutations in ptsG alter specificity of substrate to allowd-ribose transport, whereas the mlc mutation renders ptsG expression constitutive. As part of characterizing the mutant phenotype, we first examined the effect of the mlc mutation on ptsG expression. We further analyzed the ptsG mutations allowing ribose transport in terms of changes in their substrate specificity to glucose, xylose, and allose. Patterns of sugar specificities and locations of the mutations provide insight into an organization of the sugar-binding domains and their coupling with the phosphorylation domain of PtsG. All strains used are E. coli K12 derivatives that are listed in TableI. MC4100 or ZSC112ΔG was used as a parent for most strains. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium, tryptone broth modified from the preparation according to Miller (18Miller J.H. Experiment in Molecular Genetics.

The resulting 1.9-kilobase DNA fragment was inserted into the pUC19 vector previously cleaved with XbaI andSmaI. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The clones were named pOH106 (mlc +) and pOH108 (mlc-101). The P1vir phage was used for transduction experiments (18Miller J.H. Experiment in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). To characterize the ptsGmutation, the TnphoA132 transposon was used to obtain an insertion linked to the mutation. Random insertion of the transposon was generated with λ::TnphoA132 for the MC4100 strain from which P1 lysate was prepared to obtain a pool of 20,000 independent insertions. Using the P1 lysate, transduction was carried out for CP1046 showing enhanced growth on ribose, and small colonies that resulted from an exchange of the mutated gene with the wild type were isolated on 0.05% ribose minimal plate containing tetracycline. Auxotrophic mutations were excluded by examining growth on 0.2% glucose minimal medium. The candidate insertions were tested for their cotransduction frequencies (Tetr) with the ribose growth phenotype to measure their linkages. For localization of the insertion sites, the transposons were transferred to thepolA ts strain (22Song S. Park C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7025-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). After appropriate recombination, the flanking regions of the insertions were characterized by DNA sequencing and through a data base search with BLAST. All sequencing reactions were carried out with the DNA sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and ABI PRISMTM377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). A 1074-bp fragment with KpnI ends, comprising part of theptsG structural gene and the 455-bp upstream sequence, was obtained as a polymerase chain reaction product whose sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fragment containing the promoter region of ptsG was cloned into pUC19 using KpnI, obtained by EcoRI and BamHI digestions, and cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pRS415, alacZ operon fusion plasmid (23Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene. 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), yielding pOH115. The promoter region was transferred to λRS45 and lysogenized into an appropriate host. A single-copy λ prophage was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with three primers recognizing theattB, attP, and int genes (24Powell B.S. Court D.L. Nakamura Y. Rivas M.P. Turnbough C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5765-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to an optical density of 0.4–0.8 at A 600 in H1 minimal medium (19Park C. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 101-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.4% glycerol and 0.2% glucose. β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to the method of Miller (18Miller J.H. Experiment in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). All data were averaged from at least three independent experiments. CP1035/pOH106 (mlc +) and CP1036/pOH108 (mlc-101) were grown to late log phase in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g) for 10 min, resuspended in 0.05 volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA and sonicated in ice. The mixture was then centrifuged to remove insoluble fraction. Protein concentration in the soluble fraction was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce). The supernatant was kept frozen at −20 °C. The ptsG promoter region (568 bp from the KpnI toPvuII sites) was inserted into pUC19 with KpnI and HincII. The target DNA fragment containing theptsG promoter was isolated by EcoRI andHindIII digestions, which were dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The assay was carried out in a 20-μl solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol with crude extract (0.5–5 μg of protein) mixed with about 0.3 ng of the radiolabeled ptsG promoter DNA and 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA as a competitor. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C and subjected to electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gel (60:1) with 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mmTris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature. The gels were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. Cultures grown to late log phase were harvested and washed three times with equal volumes of KEP buffer (10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Cell density was then adjusted to 2.5 at A 600 ford-[14C]ribose (51.1 mCi/mmol, New England Biolabs) uptake and to 0.25 at A 600 ford-[U-14C]glucose (310 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and for d-[U-14C]xylose (91 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each 0.5-ml aliquot of culture was stored in ice. After preincubation for about 15 min at 30 °C, 20 μmd-[14C]ribose, 0.2 μmd-[U-14C]glucose, and 0.2 μmd-[U-14C]xylose were added to the cultures. For an inhibition experiment, unlabeled competitor sugar (2 mmd-glucose,d-xylose, and d-allose) was added withd-[14C]ribose. A 120-μl sample was taken at 10, 20, 30, and 40 s and filtered through a 0.45-μm size nitrocellulose filter (Amicon). After drying, radioactivities were counted (25Davis E.O. Henderson P.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13928-13932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even with a defect in the high affinity ribose transport, the ribokinase-proficientE. coli K12 strain can use ribose as a sole carbon source, albeit less efficiently (4Lopilato J.E. Garwin J.L. Emr S.D. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that this growth deficiency could be partially recovered by a regulatory mutation in the allose (6Kim C. Song S. Park C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7631-7637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the xylose (5Song S. Park C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 255-261PubMed Google Scholar) operons, both of which enhance expression of the low affinity transporter for ribose. When the high affinity transport system as well as the low affinity transporter genes (Δals(R-K) andxylG::TnphoA′-2) were inactivated in OW1, anE. coli K12 strain, a mutation-enhancing ribose growth still appeared spontaneously at a frequency of 10−8–10−9. This indicates that there are some other loci involved in ribose transport. To characterize those loci, transposon insertions with TnphoA132 were generated to isolate a tag associated with the mutations. About 20,000 independent insertions in MC4100 were pooled and transduced into the OW1 mutant showing enhanced growth on ribose. Analysis of the mutational locations linked to insertions revealed that two chromosomal loci, one at 36 min and the other at 25 min, are involved in the ribose growth. The high frequency (10−8–10−9) of the original mutation, which lowers the possibility of a double mutation, led us to suspect that one of the mutations might already be present in the parental strain. Indeed, the mutation at 36 min was resident in the OW1 strain, although it was not found in other E. coli strains such as MC4100 and W3110. Further characterization of the mutations revealed that the mutation at 25 min was found in ptsG, encoding the glucose transporter of the PTS system. A total of seven independent mutants was sequenced, in which five different mutational changes were observed: one for F37Y, G176D, and G281D and two for I283T and L289Q. Repeated occurrence of the mutations indicates an apparent saturation of the changes. F37Y and G176D were found in the predicted periplasmic loops, whereas G281D, I283T, and L289Q are in the transmembrane region (Fig.1). The mutation at 36 min was characterized to have a change in mlc that has been implicated in the regulation of ptsG (16Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This allele in OW1 was named mlc-101 and was sequenced to have C instead of T at the first base of Gln-369, causing an introduction of the UAG stop codon. To test whether ribose transport through the mutated PtsGs results from an altered level of the transporter, as reported in the Als and Xyl systems (5Song S. Park C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 255-261PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kim C. Song S. Park C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7631-7637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined a transcriptional effect of Mlc-101 onptsG expression by using DNA mobility shift assay and theptsG-lacZ fusion. The 568-bpKpnI/PvuII fragment containing theptsG promoter region was obtained from pOH116 and mixed with crude extract prepared from CP1035/pOH106 (mlc +) and CP1036/pOH108 (mlc-101). A band shift was observed only with the wild-type Mlc but not with the truncated Mlc-101 (Fig.2). This observation is consistent with the ptsG-lacZ fusion analysis and uptake assay ofd-[14C]glucose in which the ptsGtranscription was derepressed at about 7-fold, whereas the uptake rates were increased about 33-fold in mlc-101 background (data not shown). Because Mlc-101 lacks the C-terminal peptide containing a putative DNA binding motif, it seems likely that the protein loses its function as a repressor. Growths of the various ptsG mutants were examined on minimal plate with 0.05% ribose, rates of which were comparable with that of the Rbs+ strain and found to be correlated with the uptakes of [14C]ribose (Table II). Among them, I283T, located in the transmembrane region, exhibited the highest growth and uptake rates. Although the uptake rates through the mutated PtsG were far less than that of the Rbs transport system, they were considerably better than the transport through the Als or Xyl systems, low affinity transporters for d-ribose (5Song S. Park C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 255-261PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kim C. Song S. Park C. J.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the effect of PtsG mutations on glucose transport, growth and uptake rates for glucose were measured. Growths showed little differences from that of wild-type PtsG (data not shown), whereas the uptake rates were reduced (Table II). Because the tested strain contained the manZ and glk mutations, the coupling between transport and phosphorylation must occur in the mutant proteins (26Curtis S.J. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the three transmembrane mutations reduce the specificity toward glucose more than the two periplasmic mutations, which is inversely correlated with the affinities to ribose. The I283T mutation with the highest ribose specificity reduced the uptake of glucose at about 50% of the wild-type PtsG, suggesting that at least the I283 residue, and perhaps other mutated residues, plays a key role in determining the substrate specificity. Unlike glucose, ribose transport through PtsG occurs without phosphorylation. Thus, it seems possible that PTS and non-PTS sugars might use different mechanisms for their transports. However, the ribose transport through PtsG is inhibited by the presence of glucose, xylose, and allose as shown in Table II. The glucose effect is fairly strong, whereas d-xylose exerts a weaker inhibition. Unexpectedly, d-allose shows some inhibitory effects on ribose transport although the sugar was not transported by the mutated PtsG (data not shown). The apparent diversity of the inhibition pattern may reflect a multiplicity of substrate binding specificity of the transporter. To test whether d-ribose transport through PtsG is coupled to phosphorylation, the requirement of ribokinase was assessed for F37Y. When the whole rbsoperon was deleted (ΔrbsD-R), the mutant no longer maintained its enhanced growth phenotype on ribose (TableIII), indicating that some rbscomponent(s) is required. An addition of rbsK on the pYP60 plasmid, however, did not entirely restore the enhanced growth phenotype. After testing other components of the rbs operon, we discovered that the maximal level of enhanced growth and transport was observed when both rbsD and rbsK were expressed. The rbsD gene is a part of the rbsoperon, which codes for a protein with unknown function. The results indicate that the transported ribose is phosphorylated not by the PTS system but by ribokinase and that RbsD somehow plays a critical role in the PtsG-mediated ribose transport. The requirement of rbsDwas also demonstrated in other ptsG mutants and in other low affinity transporters, such as the Xyl and Als systems (data not shown).Table IIIRequirement of RbsK and RbsD for ribose transport mediated by PtsGGenotypeaAll the strains tested are CP1042 derivatives.

Open table in a new tab Because it was demonstrated that ribose transport can be mediated by the Als and Xyl systems, we tested whether d-xylose is recognized by the mutated PtsG. The ribose uptake through these transporters appears to be based on the structural similarities of the sugars tod-ribose as shown in Fig. 3. Interestingly, it was found that xylose can be transported even through the wild-type PtsG only when there is a mutation in mlc, indicating that the xylose transport through PtsG is dose-dependent in terms of the level of transporter (TableIV). The experiment was done in the strain with xylF::TnphoA′-1, an insertion in the gene coding for the xylose-binding protein that inactivates the high affinity transporter for xylose. The OW1 strain that hasxylA (xylose isomerase) and mlc mutations did not grow on xylose minimal plate in the absence of xylFGH (data not shown), indicating that as in ribose transport, xylose is phosphorylated not by the PTS system but by xylulose kinase encoded byxylB. The presence of the ribose-specific mutations tends to reduce the xylose uptake rate in both the periplasmic and transmembrane mutants. The impairments of glucose uptake (Table II) are more notable in the membrane mutants than in the periplasmic ones. The degree of reduction, I283T > G281D > L289Q for both xylose and glucose, appears to be correlated with the specificity changes to ribose.Table IVTransport of xylose through PtsGGenotypeaAll strains are CP1036 derivatives.Generation timebStrains were grown in H1 minimal medium with 0.2%d-xylose, and their optical densities were measured at 1-h intervals.UptakecCells were grown at 37 °C to midlog phase in H1 minimal medium containing 0.2% d-xylose.

The uptake assay was performed with 0.2 μm d-[14C]xylose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The xylose transport rate was measured and expressed in pmol/min/107 cells. Open table in a new tab We report here that in addition to Rbs, Als, and Xyl transporters,d-ribose can be transported through PtsG when mutated specifically and derepressed by an inactivation of mlc, encoding a negative regulator of ptsG (16Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that d-xylose, structurally analogous tod-glucose and d-ribose, is transported through PtsG in the absence of Mlc. d-Ribose exists primarily as a pyranose form in solution as shown in Fig. 3. It is the one interacting with the periplasmic binding protein (27Mowbray S.L. Cole L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 693-696Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This form shows similarity to d-allose, d-glucose, andd-xylose, explaining the cross-specificity between these sugars in sharing the transporters. Besides glucose, PtsG is involved in the transport of other sugars that are structurally related to glucose such as mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, glucosamine, α-methylglucoside, l-sorbose, and 5-thioglucose (Fig. 3). Among these, the first three sugars differ from glucose at their C-2 positions, indicating flexibility in recognizing the configuration around C-2. The same is true for α-methylglucoside at the C-1 position and 5-thioglucose at C-5. d-Mannitol (1-deoxymannose) was reported to be taken up through PtsG when Gly-320 is mutated to valine and thus modified to recognize the change ofd-mannose at C-1 (13Begley G.S. Warner K.A. Arents J.C. Postma P.W. Jacobson G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 940-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the differences in structures, the glucose analogs have some common features; they can be transported and phosphorylated by PtsG, which is not the case ind-ribose and d-xylose, which require their own kinases for recognizing a furanose form of sugar. The lack of phosphorylation coupling in transport of these sugars might lie in the fact that the hydroxyl group at C-5, normally exposed in the furanose form, is hidden in the transported sugar. The necessity ofmlc mutation for the xylose transport, not found in the transport of other phosphorylated glucose analogs, may indicate that an uptake of nonphosphorylated sugar through PtsG requires a higher level of gene expression. In addition to the C-6 hydroxyl group accepting phosphorylation,d-ribose differs from d-glucose in the hydroxyl group at C-3. Unlike d-ribose, the pyranose form ofd-xylose has exactly the same configuration asd-glucose at all carbon positions except for C-6, a site for phosphorylation. Therefore, it seems likely that the configuration at C-3 is a major specificity determinant, more so than the ones at C-1, C-2, or C-6, which is consistent with the fact that an additional mutation is required for the transport of d-ribose and not for d-xylose. The tendency of the ribose-specific mutations toward losing specificities to xylose and glucose is exemplified in the extreme case of I283T. A slight deviation from this general trend is illustrated in the mutations localized in the periplasmic domain in which the glucose specificities were not substantially reduced. This may reflect the differences between the mutations in two locations, which might form two different pores with altered specificities. It is conceivable that a unique feature in the periplasmic pore lies in its discrimination of the C-6 residue. In fact, even though both glucose and xylose are transported, the xylose uptake rate ofptsG + was about half that of glucose, even under a derepressed condition (Table II), which may indicate that the phosphorylation of sugar affects transport, perhaps through an intramolecular signaling. In other words, there might be a coupling between transport and phosphorylation which is likely to be manifested by a structural change in PtsG during sugar phosphorylation. The possibility of two pores in PtsG could also be discussed in terms of its structural organization. Unlike the ABC transporter, the PTS system has no periplasmic sugar-binding protein, which may explain the fact that PTS has broader substrate specificity than the ABC transporters. It seems likely that in PtsG, the periplasmic region as well as the transmembrane region confers substrate specificities, and the absence of a binding protein may be functionally compensated by the presence of the periplasmic specificity domain, which might be explained by a model proposed here as the “two-sieve mechanism.” A similar mechanism was reported to occur in the potassium channel, in which both the narrow selectivity filter recognizing K+located on the outer surface and the wider, hydrophobic inner pore structure stabilizing a cation exist (28Declan D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Mackinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5644) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that the d-mannitol-specific mutation of G320V was found in helix VIII (13Begley G.S. Warner K.A. Arents J.C. Postma P.W. Jacobson G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 940-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and three other mutations involved in facilitated diffusion, including ours, were found in helices VI and VII (11Ruijter G.J.G. Van Meurs G. Verwey M.A. Postma P.W. Van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2843-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that these helices form a channel for sugar specificity and transport. It was thought that the hydrophobic pocket plays an important role in sliding of sugar during translocation through the channel of PtsG. Also in the potassium channel, the lining of hydrophobic amino acids in the channel was suggested to facilitate a final release of ligand by loosening an association with the substrate (28Declan D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Mackinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5644) Google Scholar). In this regard, a change into hydrophilic amino acid as found in our mutations, especially ones located in the transmembrane region, may elicit a negative effect on phosphorylation-mediated glucose transport but a positive effect on ribose transport, perhaps occurring as facilitated diffusion. During the study of the Rbs component involved in ribose transport though PtsG, we found that RbsD is required in addition to ribokinase. RbsD was originally proposed as a member of the membrane permease associating with RbsC (29Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, it apparently lacks a region predicted to be in the membrane. Furthermore, a mutation in RbsD does not abolish ribose transport, 2H. Oh, Y. Park, and C. Park, unpublished data. suggesting that it is not directly involved in the permease function. There is no functional homolog found for RbsD based on its sequence similarity. The only clue about its function is that it enhances the utilization of ribose when the sugar is transported through a low affinity transporter. In other words, the role of RbsD is independent of specific types of transporters, implying that RbsD is involved in the step after membrane transport, such as acceleration of the ribose metabolism. The function of RbsD is currently under investigation. We thank B. Erni for providing strains."

It is, however, still unclear how CFTR regulates the activity of ENaC. In the present study we examined whether CFTR interacts with ENaC by interfering with the Nedd4- and ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis of ENaC. Various C-terminal mutations were introduced into the three α-, β-, and γ-subunits of the rat epithelial Na+ channel, thereby eliminating PY motifs, which are important binding domains for the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, most of the ENaC stop (α-H647X, β-P565X, γ-S608X) or point (α-P671A, β-Y618A, γ-P(624–626)A) mutations induced enhanced Na+ currents when compared with wild type α,β,γ-rENaC. However, ENaC currents formed by either of the mutant α-, β-, or γ-subunits were inhibited during activation of CFTR by forskolin (10 μmol/l) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mmol/l). Antibodies to dynamin or ubiquitin enhanced α,β,γ-rENaC whole cell Na+ conductance but did not interfere with inhibition of ENaC by CFTR. Another mutant, β-T592m,T593A-ENaC, also showed enhanced Na+currents, which were down-regulated by CFTR. Moreover, activation of ENaC by extracellular proteases and xCAP1 does not disturb CFTR-dependent inhibition of ENaC. We conclude that regulation of ENaC by CFTR is distal to other regulatory limbs and does not involve Nedd4-dependent ubiquitination. Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) are inhibited by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) upon activation by protein kinase A. It is, however, still unclear how CFTR regulates the activity of ENaC. In the present study we examined whether CFTR interacts with ENaC by interfering with the Nedd4- and ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis of ENaC. Various C-terminal mutations were introduced into the three α-, β-, and γ-subunits of the rat epithelial Na+ channel, thereby eliminating PY motifs, which are important binding domains for the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, most of the ENaC stop (α-H647X, β-P565X, γ-S608X) or point (α-P671A, β-Y618A, γ-P(624–626)A) mutations induced enhanced Na+ currents when compared with wild type α,β,γ-rENaC.

We conclude that regulation of ENaC by CFTR is distal to other regulatory limbs and does not involve Nedd4-dependent ubiquitination. Recent studies have indicated that epithelial Na+channels (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel(s); CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; wt, wild type; l, liter; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel(s); CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; wt, wild type; l, liter; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine are inhibited during activation of Cl− secretion in human airways and the colonic epithelium (1Mall M.

These tissues coexpress both CFTR and α,β,γ-rENaC and demonstrate that CFTR, when activated by cAMP, inhibits epithelial Na+ channels. In fact, recent studies in cells expressing both recombinant CFTR and ENaC indicate CFTR-dependent inhibition of ENaC (3Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C.

Currently, several models for regulation may be proposed: (i) we have shown recently that CFTR and α,β,γ-rENaC may interact directly (5Kunzelmann K. Kiser G. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Two independent groups detected inhibition of ENaC single channel currents by CFTR in isolated membranes (6Stutts M.J.

The results of the latter study are supported by the notion that Cl− movement through the activated CFTR Cl− channel is essential for the inhibition of ENaC (10Briel M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 825-836Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Very recently, a C-terminal CFTR domain was detected that binds to PDZ domains of proteins that anchor CFTR to the cytoskeleton (11Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A.

Along this line, the cytoskeleton has been suggested for a long time to participate in the regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel (13Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Fuller C.M. Prat A.G.

Nedd4-dependent ubiquitination turned out to be an important regulatory pathway for ENaC that is also of clinical relevance in Liddle's disease (14Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K.

Regulation by Nedd4 includes binding of Nedd4 to a PY motif in the C terminus of all three ENaC subunits via WW domain interaction with subsequent ubiquitination- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis of ENaC (17Schild L.

In the present paper we addressed the question to what extent the PY motifs in the three rENaC subunits contribute to the CFTR-dependent regulation of rENaC and whether elimination of respective motifs interferes with the ability of CFTR to down-regulate rENaC. This seems to be of particular importance since Liddle's disease patients do not suffer from pulmonary symptoms that would be caused by an enhanced Na+conductance in the airways along with hyperabsorption of the airway surface fluid. In addition, preliminary results demonstrate inhibition of α,β,γ573X-ENaC by CFTR in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (20Stutts M.J. Homolya V. Robinson J. Zhou J. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1998; 17 (abstr.): 217Google Scholar). In this study we coexpressed various ENaC mutants that show a gain of function. We examined the inhibitory effects of CFTR on these ENaC mutants. In addition, we analyzed whether another, recently identified regulatory pathway for ENaC, the epithelial serine protease CAP1 (21Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), interferes with CFTR-dependent inhibition of ENaC. Mutations of the rat epithelial Na+ channel subunits were generated by polymerase chain reaction. For the C-terminal stop mutations α-H647X, β-P565X, γ-S608X the following sense (s) and antisense (as) oligonucleotides (5′-3′) were used: α-H647X, CGACCCACGCGTCGCG (s); AGGACAGAAACGGGACG (as); β-P565X, CCCACGCGTCCGACC (s), GCCGCCTCCTGCGCA (as); γ-S608X, TCGACCCACGCGTCC (s), AGGTAAAAGTGGGCAGGTC (as). C-terminal point mutations α-P671A, β-Y618A, γ-P (624–626)A were generated using GACAGCCCCTCCAGCTGCCTATGCTACT (s), AGTAGCATAGCCAGCTGGAGGG-GCTGTC (as) for α-P671A); GCACTCCACCTCCCAATGCGCACTCCCTGAGGCTG (s), CAGCCTCAGGGAGTGGCGATTGGGAGGTGGAGTGC (as) for β-Y618A; GGTGCCTGGCACAGCGGCCGCCAGATACAATA (s), TATTGTATCTGGCGGCCGCTGTGCCTGGTATT (as) for γ-P (624–626)A). βT592m,T593A was created using the oligonucleotides TCTTCCAGCCTGACATGGCTAGCTGCAGGCCCAAT (s), ATTGGGCCTGCAGCTAGCCATGTCAGGCTGGAA (as). ENaC mutations were checked for correct sequences by restriction digest and by cycle sequencing (PRISM, Perkin-Elmer). cDNAs encoding α,β,γ-rENaC and the serine protease xCAP1 were kindly provided by Prof. Dr. B. Rossier, Pharmacological Institute of Lausanne, Switzerland. cDNAs encoding wild type human CFTR, the three (α, β, γ) subunits of the rat amiloride-inhibitable Na+ channel ENaC, and theXenopus protease xCAP1 were linearized using eitherNotI or KpnI, and cRNA was in vitrotranscribed using T7, T3, or SP6 polymerases and a 5′-cap (mCAP mRNA capping kit, Stratagene). Isolation and microinjection of oocytes have been described in a previous report (10Briel M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 825-836Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, after isolation from adult Xenopus laevisfemale frogs oocytes were dispersed and defolliculated by a 0.5-h treatment with collagenase (type A, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). Subsequently oocytes were rinsed and kept in ND96 buffer (in mmol/l): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, pH 7.55, supplemented with theophylline (0.5 mmol/l) and gentamycin (5 mg/l) at 18 °C. Oocytes of identical batches were injected with cRNA of either wt or mutant α,β,γ-rENaC (each subunit 10 ng), xCAP1, and CFTR (each 20 ng), respectively, after dissolving cRNAs in about 50 nl of double-distilled water (PV830 pneumatic pico pump, WPI, Berlin, Germany). Oocytes injected with 50 nl of double-distilled water served as controls. For some experimental protocols oocytes were injected with 50 ng of either sense or antisense oligonucleotides of the serine proteasexCAP1 (21Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). 2–4 days after injection oocytes were impaled with two electrodes (Clark instruments), which had resistances of 1 MΩ when filled with 2.7 mol/l KCl. A flowing (2.7 mol/l) KCl electrode served as bath reference. Membrane currents were measured by voltage clamping of the oocytes (OOC-1 amplifier, WPI) in intervals from −90 to +30 mV in steps of 10 mV. Current data were filtered at 400 Hz (OOC-1 amplifier). Between intervals, oocytes were voltage-clamped to their spontaneous membrane voltage for 20 s. Data were collected continuously on a computer hard disc and analyzed by using the programs chart and scope (McLab, AD-Instruments, Macintosh). Conductances were calculated for the voltage clamp range of −90 to +30 mV according to Ohm's law. During the whole experiment the bath was continuously perfused at a rate of 5–10 ml/min. All used compounds were of highest available grade of purity. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), forskolin, trypsin, and amiloride were all from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). The dynamin and ubiquitin antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany) and Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides of the protease xCAP1 were synthesized by the facility of the local University and were stabilized by phosphorothioate modification. The oligonucleotides had the following (5′-3′) sequence: ATGGAGCCTCTTCCACTTCTC (sense) and GAGAAGTGGAAGTGGCTCCAT (antisense). Statistical analysis was performed according to Student's t test. p values <0.05 were accepted to indicate statistical significance. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). PY motifs in either α-, β-, or γ-subunits of rENaC were deleted by either C-terminal point (α-P671A, β-Y618A, γ-P(624–626)A) or C-terminal stop mutations (α-H647X, β-P565X, γ-S608X). A representative record of the whole cell current from an oocyte coexpressing β-P565X with wild type α- and γ-subunits is shown in the lower trace of Fig.1. This current is enhanced when compared with that induced by α,β,γ-rENaC (Fig. 1, upper trace). Amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductances (GENaC-mut) were calculated for the various mutations and were compared with that of α,β,γ-rENaC (GENaC-mut/GENaC-wt). As demonstrated in Fig.2 GENaC was significantly enhanced for β-P565X, γ-S608X, α-P671A, and β-Y618A, while α-H647X and γ-P(624–626)A did not produce enhanced conductances. These results confirm those of previous studies (17Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO.

As demonstrated in Fig.3 A, the whole cell conductance that is produced by α,β,γ-rENaC and is inhibited by 10 μmol/l amiloride (A) is attenuated after stimulation of CFTR by IBMX (1 mmol/l) and forskolin (10 μmol/l). The summary (Fig.3 C) indicates significant inhibition of α,β,γ-rENaC by CFTR, while no effects of IBMX and forskolin could be detected in the absence of CFTR. Similar to α,β,γ-rENaC, also α,β,γ-S608X-rENaC whole cell conductances were down-regulated upon stimulation of CFTR with IBMX and forskolin (Fig. 3 B). The results from the various ENaC mutants coexpressed with CFTR are summarized in Fig. 4. It is shown that GENaC caused by each of the C-terminal stop (A) or point (B) mutants is significantly attenuated upon stimulation of CFTR by IBMX and forskolin (black bars). We, therefore, conclude that PY motifs do not participate in CFTR-dependent regulation of ENaC.Figure 4CFTR-dependent inhibition of ENaC carrying C-terminal deletions (A, B) or point mutations (A, C) in either α-, β-, or γ-subunits of rENaC.

When coinjected with ENaC, both of these antibodies enhanced GENaC when compared with amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductances measured in oocytes from the same batch and injected solely with α,β,γ-rENaC (Fig.5 A). In another series of experiments, we coinjected α,β,γ-rENaC together with CFTR and ubiquitin or dynamin antibodies. The summary of these experiments indicates that even after interfering with both intracellular ubiquitin and dynamin, CFTR is able to inhibit ENaC (Fig. 5 B). According to previous reports, a mutation in the β-subunit of the human ENaC (β-T594m) causes a loss of protein kinase C inhibition and leads to salt-sensitive hypertension in the African-American population (23Cui Y. Su Y.R. Rutkowski M. Reif M. Menon A.G. Pun R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9962-9966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We examined whether the respective mutations in the rat ENaC β-subunit interferes with CFTR-dependent inhibition. βT592m,T593A-rENaC, when coexpressed with equal amounts of α- and γ-subunits, led to an amiloride sensitive Na+conductance that was significantly higher than in oocytes from the same batch injected with wt α,β,γ-ENaC (Fig.6 B). Stimulation with IBMX and forskolin had no effect on α,βT592m,T593A,γ-rENaC Na+ conductance (13.7 ± 1.2 versus13.5 ± 1.9 microsiemens; n = 4). When coexpressed with CFTR, α,βT592m,T593A,γ-rENaC conductance was significantly attenuated by stimulation with IBMX and forskolin (Fig.6, A and C). Thus, gain of function mutations of ENaC do not limit inhibition of ENaC by CFTR. It was shown recently that extracellular proteases activate ENaC probably by interfering with the extracellular loop of ENaC (21Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We also found augmentation of GENaC by trypsin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7 B). In an oocyte coexpressing both ENaC and CFTR the amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance was enhanced after exposure to 2 μg/ml trypsin (Fig. 7 A). Upon stimulation by IBMX (1 mmol/l) and forskolin (10 μmol/l) and activation of a CFTR whole cell conductance, the inhibitory effect of amiloride was largely attenuated. The summary shown in Fig.7 C indicates a significant increase of GENaC by trypsin and inhibition of GENaC by CFTR. The results demonstrate the ability of CFTR to inhibit ENaC in the presence of extracellular protease activity and suggest that the portion of GENaC that is activated by trypsin is also subjected to down-regulation by CFTR. In order to investigate the impact of the serine protease xCAP1, we blocked expression of xCAP1 by injection of xCAP1 antisense oligonucleotides. The summary of the results is shown in Fig. 8, A andB, and demonstrate attenuation of GENaC in oocytes coinjected with CFTR/ENaC/xCAP1 antisense compared with oocytes coinjected with CFTR/ENaC/xCAP1 sense. However, when CFTR was activated by IBMX and forskolin, GENaC was inhibited in both sense- and antisense-injected oocytes. In a second approach we overexpressed xCAP1 together with ENaC and xCAP1 together with ENaC and CFTR. The summary of the results from these experiments is shown in Fig.8 C. The data demonstrate that GENaC was approximately doubled when ENaC was coexpressed with xCAP1. However, a smaller GENaC value was detected when CFTR was coexpressed with both rENaC and xCAP1. It is shown that in the presence of xCAP1, CFTR was still able to down-regulate ENaC. We conclude that larger ENaC currents that are detected in the presence of protease activity are inhibited by CFTR. The amplitude of the epithelial Na+ current is determined by the number of ENaC channels present in the cell membrane and by the activity of membrane resident channels (18Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P.

Correspondingly, dual effects of Liddle's mutation onPo and the number of Na+ channels expressed at the cell surface have been described (19Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, endocytosis of ENaC by a Nedd4/ubiquitin/dynamin-dependent pathway is probably the predominant mechanism for regulation of epithelial Na+ absorption (14Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Thus, a loss of Nedd4 recognition site causes enhanced Na+ absorption in kidney collecting ducts and a salt-sensitive hypertension (15Hansson J.H. Nelson-Williams C. Suzuki H. Schild L. Shimkets R.

Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The well known Na+ feedback (24Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) detected in mouse mandibular duct cells occurs via activation of G0 proteins through increase of intracellular Na+ and probably also via Nedd4-dependent retrieval of Na+ channels from the cell membrane (25Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, in Xenopus oocytes inhibition of ENaC channels by Na+ occurs without changing the number of ENaC channels (2Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Rossier B.C. Schild L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Because Nedd4 and ubiquitination play such a central role in ENaC regulation, we examined whether down-regulation of ENaC by CFTR occurs via this regulatory axis. According to the present results, however, this seems rather unlikely, since ENaC channels containing either α-, β-, or γ-subunits with defective PY motifs were inhibited during activation of CFTR. Moreover, the data indicate strong inhibition by CFTR for most of the ENaC mutants, which may suggest that the additional portion of Na+ conductance that is due to limited retrieval from the cell membrane and enhanced ENaC activity is also inhibited by CFTR. Similar holds true for βT592m,T593A-ENaC and ENaC currents activated by proteases. We may therefore assume that CFTR-dependent inhibition of ENaC is superior to the regulation by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway and extracellular proteases, including xCAP1. This also applies to other gain of function mutations like βT592m,T593A-rENaC, which was not regulated directly by cAMP in our hands (23Cui Y. Su Y.R. Rutkowski M. Reif M. Menon A.G. Pun R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9962-9966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The results of the present report also explain why Liddle's disease patients, unlike CF patients, do not show enhanced Na+ conductance in their airways and therefore do not suffer from pulmonary symptoms (20Stutts M.J. Homolya V. Robinson J. Zhou J. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1998; 17 (abstr.): 217Google Scholar). Nedd4/ubiquitin-dependent regulation of ENaC does not provide a mechanism through which ENaC is regulated by CFTR. The relatively fast onset and reversibility of the inhibitory effects of CFTR on ENaC (10Briel M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Physiol.

The question regarding the mechanisms underlying the CFTR-dependent regulation of ENaC can therefore not completely be answered at the moment. We know from previous reports that interaction of CFTR with ENaC takes place even in isolated membranes and after reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers (6Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J.

The interaction does not require full-length CFTR but only cytosolic domains of CFTR (5Kunzelmann K. Kiser G. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R.

Additional studies are needed to show whether the recently identified PDZ domain interaction enables functional coupling of CFTR and ENaC.

All transmembrane segments remain within the membrane domain following trypsinization of the intact gastric H,K-ATPase in the presence of K+ ions, identified as M1M2, M3M4, M5M6, and M7, M8, M9, and M10. Removal of K+ ions from this digested preparation results in the selective loss of the M5M6 hairpin from the membrane.

The stabilization of the M5M6 hairpin in the membrane phase by the transported cation as well as loss to the aqueous phase in the absence of the transported cation has been previously observed for another P2-type ATPase, the Na,K-ATPase (Lutsenko, S., Anderko, R., and Kaplan, J.

Thus, the effects of the counter-transported cation on retention of the M5M6 segment in the membrane as compared with the other membrane pairs may be a general feature of P2-ATPase ion pumps, reflecting a flexibility of this region that relates to the mechanism of transport.

Thus, the effects of the counter-transported cation on retention of the M5M6 segment in the membrane as compared with the other membrane pairs may be a general feature of P2-ATPase ion pumps, reflecting a flexibility of this region that relates to the mechanism of transport. Recent functional studies of P-type ATPases have focused on two major activities, the transmembrane transport of cations and the hydrolysis of ATP via a phosphoenzyme intermediate, which appear to be carried out by the actions of two separate protein domains, the intramembrane domain that binds cations and the major cytoplasmic loop responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis (1Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. Gatto C. Daoud S. Kenney L.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 2Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 31: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). P-type ATPases can be classified into two subgroups based upon their function and structure (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A mechanistic aspect of most P2-type ATPases is occlusion of the transported cations during the reaction cycle (4Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Such occlusion is pictured as an intermediate state where cations are bound within the transmembrane segments of the protein without free access to either aqueous compartment. Occlusion was also recently shown to be retained in a post-tryptic preparation of the Na,K-ATPase composed of the transmembrane segments and lacking most of the cytosolically exposed protein (5Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis studies of expressed P2-ATPases have indicated that the M5M6 transmembrane region may have a special importance in cation occlusion and transport (6Rice W.J.

In studies on tryptic membrane preparations of the Na,K-ATPase obtained in the presence of K+, mere removal of K+ ions resulted in the selective release of the M5M6 hairpin from the membrane to the aqueous phase (11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This membrane stabilization of the M5M6 region by the counter-transported cation suggested that the organization and folding of the M5M6 hairpin and the interactions between M5M6 and the rest of the protein may be associated with the transport function (11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The uniqueness of this region of the membrane is also shown by the failure of the M5M6 hairpin to behave as an independent unit in the process of synthesis and insertion inin vitro translation studies of the H,K-ATPase (12Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar conclusions were derived from Cos-1 cell translation of segments of the Na,K-ATPase and from in vitro translation of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (13Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25678-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Xie X. Langhans-Rajasckaran S.A. Bellorino D. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2563-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting a general property of this membrane domain of the P2-type ATPases. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether or not cation-dependent stabilization of the M5M6 hairpin in the membrane was also a feature of the H,K-ATPase, another P2-ATPase. Because this protein can be obtained in a sealed vesicular inside out orientation, the directionality of the release of the M5M6 hairpin from the membrane (toward the cytoplasmic or extracellular space) following K+ removal could also be determined, unlike right side out oriented vesicles achieved in microsomal preparations of Na,K-ATPase (15Lutsenko S. Daoud S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A preliminary report of this work has been presented (16Gatto C.

Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) electroblotting membrane was from Millipore. The H,K-ATPase was isolated from hog gastric mucosa (17Hall K. Perez G. Anderson D. Guttierez C. Munson K. Hersey S.J. Kaplan J.H. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles were aliquoted and stored (3–5 mg/ml protein) in a 34% sucrose solution buffered with 50 mm PIPES (pH 6.8) and frozen at −80 °C until used. H,K-ATPase activity was measured in a standard assay medium containing 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm Na2ATP, 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.9), and 250 mm sucrose in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml nigericin. The suspension was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C (10 mg protein/ml), and the liberation of Pi measured as described by Brotherus et al.(19Brotherus J.B. Moller J.B. Jorgensen P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The difference in activity seen upon the addition of nigericin is a measurement of vesicle integrity. Vesicles used were >70% sealed and oriented cytosolic side out. Maximal enzyme activity was also determined by using 100 mm NH4Cl instead of KCl, with NH4+ acting as a K+ congener. Vesicles do not have to be permeablized for NH4+ to reach the inside because NH3 can freely diffuse across the bilayer. In experiments to determine the appropriate [SDS] required to permeabilize the vesicles, enzyme activity was measured at various ratios of SDS to protein (see Fig. 2) and compared with maximal activity with nigericin or NH4Cl. H,K-ATPase (1 mg/ml) was suspended in medium containing 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8) and incubated at 4 °C for 16–24 h. Then TPCK-treated trypsin (1:10 w/w with respect to H,K-ATPase) was added, and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The reaction was terminated with the addition of the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF (2 mm); AEBSF was present at 1 mm in all subsequent steps. Soluble peptide fragments were separated from membrane-bound fragments by centrifugation (436,000 ×g, 30 min, 4 °C). The membrane fraction was resuspended with buffer and pelleted once more. The pellet (∼500 μg) was resuspended in buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 6.8), and 250 mm sucrose. Samples were split in half and diluted to 1 mg/ml with buffer containing either 200 mm KCl or 5 mm MgPi; the [sucrose] was adjusted accordingly to maintain isosmotic conditions. Samples were incubated (37 °C, 15 min) and centrifuged (436,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Supernatants containing peptides from the extravesicular space were removed and saved. Pellets were resuspended (1 mg/ml) in the same buffer (including KCl and MgPi, respectively) with the addition of 0.05% SDS (w/w) and incubated (37 °C, 15 min) and then centrifuged (436,000 ×g, 30 min, 4 °C). Supernatants containing peptides from the intravesicular space were removed and saved. The pellet from the sample-containing KCl tube was resuspended in buffer (1 mg/ml), but MgPi was added instead of KCl. The suspension was incubated (37 °C, 15 min) and then centrifuged (436,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was removed and saved. All supernatants were treated with 1 mm CPM for better visualization of low molecular weight peptides (15Lutsenko S. Daoud S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Peptides were precipitated with acetone (9:1, v/v) at −20 °C for 16 h and then were run on a 16.5% Tricine gel (20Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, protein fragments were transferred onto PVDF membranes by electroblotting in 10 mm CAPS, 10% MeOH (pH 11.0) (21Matsudaria P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescent CPM-labeled bands were cut from the PVDF and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The two specific questions addressed by our studies were (i) in the H,K-ATPase post-tryptic preparation does the removal of K+ ions lead to the destabilization and selective release of the M5M6 hairpin from the membrane and (ii) if such release occurs, is the hairpin released to the cytoplasmic or extracellular compartment? As shown in Fig. 1, SDS treatment of the vesicle preparation is used to gain access to the intravesicular (extracellular) space. If release of M5M6 occurs to the extracellular space the vesicles will need to be disrupted in order for the M5M6 hairpin to be seen in the supernatant; if release is to the cytoplasmic space, disruption of the vesicles by detergent will not be required, and centrifugation alone will separate the released hairpin from the vesicles. It was necessary first to determine an appropriate SDS concentration that would permeabilize the vesicles but not denature or disrupt the H,K-ATPase. To do this, we made use of the fact that for maximal H,K-ATPase activity K+ ions must gain access to the intravesicular space. Fig.2 demonstrates that SDS ratios ≤0.1% (w/w) were able to disrupt vesicle integrity without denaturing the H,K-ATPase. Just as was originally reported for the Na,K-ATPase (5Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), extensive tryptic digestion of the H,K-ATPase in the presence of K+ ions produces a membrane residue that contains the β-subunit (largely undigested) and four sets of transmembrane segments, M1M2, M3M4, M5M6, and M7–M10 (22Shin J.M. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8642-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The post-tryptic preparations of both the Na,K- and H,K-ATPases retained the ability to occlude K+ ions (5Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23Rabon E.C. Smillie K. Seru V. Rabon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8012-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the Na,K-ATPase, removal of K+ ions from this preparation resulted in a loss of the ability to occlude K+ associated with the release of the M5M6 hairpin from the membrane to the aqueous phase (11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows a single fluorescently labeled peptide (∼10 kDa) that was released from the post-tryptic H,K-ATPase preparation upon the removal of K+ ions. N-terminal amino acid analysis gave a single sequence (NAADMIL … ) that corresponds to the residues in the M5M6 hairpin (Table I). It was shown earlier that both the N and C termini of this fragment are cytoplasmic (24Besancon M. Mercier F. Shin J.M. Munson K. Miller M. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas either (or both) cysteine 813 and 822 within this stretch are located at the extracytoplasmic side (25Besancon M. Simon A. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22438-22446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrated that the M5M6 segment indeed spans the membrane twice. Furthermore, this peptide was not released to the supernatant until after SDS treatment of the proteolyzed vesicles, thus it is released toward the intravesicular (extracellular) space (Fig.3 A). In some experiments, a faint band was apparent (∼10 kDa) in the supernatant prior to SDS treatment (data not shown). This peptide was most likely the M5M6 hairpin, because it was only observed when K+ ions were not present in the trypsinized preparation (i.e. treatments outlined in 3a of Fig. 1). Additionally, because the intensity of this band appeared to vary inversely with the fraction of tight vesicles (as determined by K+ ionophore stimulated ATPase activity), we conclude that the M5M6 hairpin is released to the intravesicular space and then exits from leaky vesicles. Consistent with this conclusion is that SDS permeablization of these preparations subsequently revealed a vivid band at 10 kDa that subsequent amino acid sequencing confirmed as M5M6 (Table I).Table IAmino acid sequence of the peptide fragments released from a post-tryptic membrane preparation of H,K-ATPase after K+removalExperiment numberSequenceH,K-ATPase regionSize[KCl] during digestionkDamm1NAADMILLDDM5M6∼102002NAADMILM5M6∼102003NAADMILM5M6∼102004NAADMM5M6∼1020LVNEPLAAYSM7M8205NAADMM5M6∼1020LVNEPM7M820 Open table in a new tab These findings cannot directly rule out an SDS effect on the post-tryptic H,K-ATPase preparation. That is, does SDS itself promote the release of the M5M6 fragment? To answer this question, we also treated post-tryptic H,K-ATPase vesicles with SDS in the presence of 200 mm K+. Under these conditions, we observed no peptide release (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). However, when K+ was subsequently removed from these permeablized vesicles the M5M6 hairpin appeared in the supernatant (Fig.3 B, lane 2). In the experiments discussed above, the post-tryptic membrane preparation was obtained in the presence of 200 mm KCl. In two initial experiments, when trypsin digestion was performed in the presence of ≤20 mm KCl, we obtained two separate peptide sequences from the released fragment (∼10 kDa; Table I). The first sequence corresponded to M5M6, whereas the second sequence corresponded to the M7M8 transmembrane pair (Table I). It has been previously shown that in the absence of K+ ions an additional trypsin cleavage takes place in the H,K-ATPase between M8 and M9 (22Shin J.M. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8642-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems that this cleavage also takes place at low K+ (i.e. ≤ 20 mm), thus separating the M7M8 hairpin from the ∼21-kDa C terminus. The membrane domain of the P2-type ATPases contains the ion transport pathway, and the results of a large number of studies have been interpreted as showing involvement of M4, M5, M6, and perhaps M8 in ion translocation and ion occlusion (2Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T.

Sci. 1997; 834: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and in vitro translation provided strong evidence for 10 membrane segments in the α-subunit of the P2-type ATPases. Hydropathy algorithms of P2-type ATPases all predict four membrane sequences in the N-terminal sector but predict only a single sequence in the M5M6 region and vary in terms of prediction of the last four segments (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In accord with the ambiguity of these predictions,in vitro translation of individual segments or truncated constructs of the H,K-ATPase were not able to demonstrate transmembrane insertion of M5, M6, and M7 (13Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25678-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Expression of segments or truncated constructs of the Na,K-ATPase also showed that M5 and M6 were not membrane inserted (14Xie X. Langhans-Rajasckaran S.A. Bellorino D. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2563-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Beguin P. Geering K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These results suggested that peptide-peptide interactions were more significant for these segments as compared with the N-terminal segments. Indeed, it was suggested earlier that the M5M6 hairpin of the Na,K-ATPase was involved in protein-protein interactions with other transmembrane segments within the lipid portion (11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results (Ref. 11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and this work) suggest that cations are also required for stabilization in the membrane of the M5M6 hairpin of P2-type ATPases. In the case of the P2-ATPases, results from chemical modification (8Arguello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mutagenesis (6Rice W.J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 834: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have suggested that amino acid residues in M5M6 are intimately associated with cation occlusion and transport, and this hairpin is now believed to play a central role in cation binding and complexation. The loss of the M5M6 hairpin from the membrane and its prevention by K+ (Ref. 11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and this work) suggest that the occluded K+ ions play a role in causing a rearrangement of these membrane segments. One plausible mechanism for the action may be the neutralization of repulsive negative charges in Asp residues of M6 and the Glu in M5. Cation complexation by the electron-donating residues of M5M6 substitute for hydration and stabilize the presence of the charged cation in the membrane. At the same time the positive cation apparently serves to stabilize the anionic and hydrophilic transmembrane segments of M5 and M6 within the membrane. The finding that the M5M6 hairpin of about 10–11 kDa (or about 90 amino acid residues) is lost to the extracellular space shows that this redistribution involves the mobilization across the membrane of a considerable number of charged and hydrophilic amino acid residues. We believe that M5M6 is probably surrounded by other protein helices rather than the membrane lipid (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 11Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this way protein-protein interactions would be greatly modified as cations (e.g.K+) are bound to and released by the pump. Another line of evidence suggested mobility in this region of the enzyme. Pantoprazole (5-difluoromethosy-2-[3,4-methosy-2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole) con-verts to a cationic thiophilic sulfenamide and binds to Cys813 and Cys822 in the loop joining M5 and M6 forming disulfide bonds. Prior to this covalent reaction tryptic cleavage occurs largely at Arg775. After derivatization, cleavage is found only at Lys791 (29Sachs G. Shin J.M. Besancon M. Prinz C. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. Suppl. 1993; 1: 4-12Google Scholar), showing that formation of disulfides within the connecting loop of M5 and M6 results in a change in accessibility of the N-terminal region of M5 to trypsin. Furthermore, the exposure of Cys983 in M10 of the Na,K-ATPase to sulfhydryl-reactive probes (but not of Cys residues in M1, M2, or M4) following the loss of the M5M6 hairpin also provides evidence for interactions between C-terminal segments and M5M6 (15Lutsenko S. Daoud S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions have been reached from in vitrotranslation studies of both the Na,K-ATPase and the Ca-ATPase (13Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25678-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,14Xie X. Langhans-Rajasckaran S.A. Bellorino D. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2563-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition to the release of the M5M6 hairpin, the M7M8 transmembrane pair was also released from the membrane following digestion by trypsin in low K+ conditions (Table I) where the 21-kDa fragment is cleaved between M7M8 and M9M10, also suggesting a weak interaction between the bilayer and this pair of transmembrane segments. Prior to cleavage between M8 and M9, the M5M6 tryptic fragment remains associated with the 21-kDa C terminus; conversely, in the absence of K+, when cleavage occurs between M8 and M9 the association vanishes, suggesting that M5 and M6 are in the vicinity of M7–M10 (22Shin J.M. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8642-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, although M8 acts as a stop transfer sequence in in vitro translation, M7 is unable to membrane insert either as a stop transfer or a signal anchor sequence (its putative role). However, in in vivo expression in frog oocytes, M7 is able to act as a membrane inserted sequence provided the β-subunit is co-translated, consistent with the strong interaction observed between the region preceding M8 and the β-subunit of the H,K-ATPase (12Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gatto C. Wang A.X. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11147-11154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the M7 segment in the H,K-ATPase is significantly lower than that of corresponding segment of the Na,K-ATPase consistent with its easier release from the membrane after cleavage of the connecting cytoplasmic linkage. The striking mobility of the M5M6 hairpin with respect to the membrane that is modified by the presence of the occluded and transported cation probably plays a significant role in the transport cycle. Indeed, the direct link between the M5M6 hairpin and the large intracellular loop, shown to contain the ATP binding site (33Beggah A.T. Beguin P. Bamberg K. Sachs G. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8217-8223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol.

Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that movements of M5M6 in the Na,K-ATPase protein in a direction that is perpendicular to the plane of the membrane may play a role in active transport; on the basis of the present results such a mechanism may apply to other P2-ATPases."

Here we show that pX dramatically stimulates in vitro DNA binding of a variety of cellular proteins that contain basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding domains. The basis for increased DNA binding is a direct interaction between pX and the conserved bZIP basic region, which promotes bZIP dimerization and the increased concentration of the bZIP homodimer then drives the DNA binding reaction. Unexpectedly, we found that the DNA binding specificity of various pX-bZIP complexes differs from one another and from that of the bZIP itself. Thus, through recognition of the conserved basic region, pX promotes dimerization, increases DNA binding, and alters DNA recognition. These properties of pX are remarkably similar to those of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I Tax protein. Although Tax and pX are not homologous, we show that the regions of the two proteins that stimulate bZIP binding contain apparent metal binding sites. Finally, consistent with thisin vitro activity, we provide evidence that both Tax and pX activate transcription in vivo, at least in part, by facilitating occupancy of bZIPs on target promoters.

The HBV genome is 3.2 kb in length and contains four open reading frames: pre-S/S, which encodes the surface antigens; core/e, which encodes the core protein; pol, which encodes the viral reverse transcriptase; and the X protein (pX) (for review, see Ref. 6Ganem D.

Like several other viral activators, pX activity is promiscuous; in addition to the cognate HBV promoter, pX can activate transcription from a diverse set of cellular and viral promoters that appear to have little in common (12Twu J.-S.

The mechanism by which pX activates transcription is controversial; it has been proposed that pX acts through various protein kinase signal transduction pathways (25Lucito R. Schneider R.J. J.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2837-2843PubMed Google Scholar), is itself a protein kinase (29Wu J.Y. Zhou Z.Y. Judd A. Cartwright C.A. Robinson W.S. Cell. 1990; 16: 687-695Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar), has a ribo/deoxy ATPase activity (30De-Medina T.I. Haviv N.S. Shaul Y. Virology. 1994; 202: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and is a protease inhibitor (31Takada S. Kido H. Fukutomi A. Mori T. Koike K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar). We have noted several similarities between HBV pX and the Tax protein of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I (HTLV-I). First, like pX, Tax activates transcription from its own promoter as well as heterologous promoters (for review, see Ref. 32Yoshida M. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 131-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Second, the HTLV-I long terminal repeat and the HBV enhancer contain binding sites for ATF proteins (ATFs) (33Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A. Science. 1991; 252: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 34Beimling P. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar, 35Xu X. Kang S.H. Heidenreich O. Brown D.A. Neremberg M.I. Virology. 1996; 218: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), an extensive family of cellular transcription factors that contain homologous basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding domains (36Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). These viral ATF binding sites have been directly implicated in the Tax (reviewed in Ref. 37Feuer G. Chen I.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 223-233PubMed Google Scholar) and pX (33Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A. Science. 1991; 252: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) transcriptional responses. Third, like Tax, pX is present in the nucleus of expressing cells (10Hohne M. Schaefer S. Seifer M. Feitelston M.A. Paul D. Gerlich W.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 38Doria M. Klein N. Lucito R. Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4747-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Finally, and of particular significance, Tax can substitute for pX in transcriptional activation of the HBV enhancer (2Zahm P. Hofschneider P.H. Koshy R. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 169-177PubMed Google Scholar,39Faktor O. Shaul Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar, 40Marriot S.J. Lee T.H. Slagle B.L. Butel J.S. Virology. 1996; 224: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that pX and Tax may stimulate transcription by a common mechanism. Recent studies have helped clarify the mechanism by which Tax functions. Tax can dramatically increase the in vitro DNA binding of proteins containing bZIP DNA binding domain (41Armstrong A.P.

Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). bZIP domains comprise a leucine-rich dimerization motif and a basic region that mediates DNA contact (46Blatter E.E. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 47Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C.

This DNA binding increase occurs by a mechanism in which Tax promotes dimerization of the bZIP domain in the absence of DNA and the elevated concentration of the bZIP homodimer then drives the DNA binding reaction (43Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 44Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm M.K. Gleber H.A. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we show that pX functions in a manner remarkably similar to Tax. Sequences were as follows: collagenase TRE, 5′-AGCTTTGACTCATCCGGA-3′; CRE, 5′-TCCTAAGTGACGTCAGTGGAA-3′; C/EBP binding site, 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAAT CTGCA-3′; OR1 site of the λ phage PRM/PR promoter, 5′-TATCACCGCCAGAGGTA-3′. pX cDNA was cloned in the pRSET-C vector (Invitrogen) and expressed as a His-tagged derivative in the BL21(pLysE) Escherichia coli strain. BL21 cells were grown at 30 °C in the presence of 50 μmZnCl2, and pX expression was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 2 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (1 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20 μmZnCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 40 mm imidazole), frozen on dry ice, and then thawed on ice and sonicated. The bacterial lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was incubated with NTA-Ni2+-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 4 h. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. pX protein was eluted with 0.5 m imidazole, pH 7.5, and dialyzed twice against buffer X (0.2 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 20 mm ZnCl2, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF). pX was first cloned in the pGEX-CS vector (50Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and subsequently digested with the appropriate enzymes to generate CΔ1, CΔ2, and CΔ3 mutants. To generate CΔ1, pX vector was digested with HincII andHindIII, treated with Klenow, and self-ligated. CΔ2 and CΔ3 were obtained in the same way except that CSP1/HindIII and AatII/HindIII were used, respectively. Ligation products were transformed in the E. coli BL21 (pLysE) strain. CΔ4 was instead obtained by PCR amplification of the region between aa 1 and 36. The primers were oligo X5′ (CAT GCC ATG GCT GCT CGG GTG TGC TGC) and oligo XΔ4 (CGG AAT TCT TAT TAG AGA GTC CCA ACC GGC CCG CA). The PCR product was then digested with NcoI andEcoRI and cloned in pGEX-CS vector. pX N-terminal deletions were also obtained by PCR amplification. NΔ1 sequences were oligo X N1 (CAT GCC ATG CGT CCC GTC GGC GCT GAA TCC) and oligo X3′ (CGG AAT TCT TAT TTA GGC AGA GGT GAA AAA CAA AC). NΔ2 sequences were oligo X N2 (CAT GCC ATG CTC TCT TTA CGC GGT CTC CCC) and oligo X3. PCR products were digested with NcoI/EcoRI and cloned in the pGEX-CS vector. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mmIPTG for 2 h at 30 °C. Protein mutants were purified on a glutathione affinity column and then dialyzed against buffer X. The GST moiety was removed by cleaving the GST fusion proteins with TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) and by incubating the protein with fresh glutathione-agarose beads. Beads were spun down, and the supernatant containing the pX proteins was dialyzed against buffer X. Tax mutants were obtained by PCR amplification. Oligonucleotides used to generate Tax constructs were as follows: Tax wt: oligo T5′ (TCC AAC AAC ATG GCC CAC TCC CCA GGG TTT GGA) and oligo T3′ (AAA GGG GGA TCC TCA GAC TTC TGT TTC TCG GAA ATG); Tax CΔ1:oligo T5′ and oligo TD31 (AAA GGG GGA TCC TCA ATG AAA GGA AGA GTA CTG TAT GAG); Tax CΔ2: oligo T5′ and oligo TD32 (AAA GGG GGA TCC TCA GCC ATC GGT AAA TGT CCA AAT AAG); Tax CΔ3: oligo T5′ and oligo TD33 (AAA GGG GGA TCC TCA CCC TGT GGT GAG GGA AAT TTT ATA); Tax CΔ4: oligo T5′ and oligo TD34 (AAA GGG GGA TCC TCA GCA GAC AAC GGA GCC TCC CCA GAG); Tax CΔ5: oligo T5′ and oligo TD35 (AAA GGG GGA TCC TCA GGG TGG AAT GTT GGG GGT TGT ATG); Tax CΔ6: oligo T5′ and oligo TD36 (AAA GGG GGA TCC TCA CTG ATG CTC TGG ACA GGT GGC CAG). PCR products were digested with NcoI and BamHI and cloned in pGEX-CS vector. Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (43Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). cDNA sequences of CREB (aa 23–341), ATF-1 (aa 57–271), and ATF-2 (aa 144–505) were cloned in pGEX vectors and expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. The C/EBP Δ1–2 derivative (a gift from P. Rorth) was expressed by IPTG induction. After sonication, cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant used in gel-shift assays. Histidine-tagged JUN (aa 225–334) was obtained from T. Curran. Epstein-Barr virus ZTA peptide (aa 175–229) containing the DNA binding domain only was a gift from M. Carey. The FOS-ZTA chimera was obtained from D. S. Hayward. The construct containing the c-Fos basic region (aa 133–162) and the ZTA coiled-coil domain (aa 197–229) was PCR-amplified and cloned in the pGEX-2T vector. λ-ZIP protein was obtained by IPTG induction of JH372(pJH370) E. coli (a gift from R. T. Sauer). Crude extracts were prepared and dialyzed against 1× buffer D. The synthetic peptide BR-CC (NH-ALKRARNTEAARRSRARKLQRMKQLEDVKELEEKLKALEEKLKALEEKLKALG-COOH; Ref. 51O'Neil K.T. Hoess R.H. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 249: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by W. DeGrado, and the basic region peptide br1s (NH4-ALKRARNTEA-ARRSRARKLQRMKQGGC; Ref. 52Talanian R.V. McKnight C.J. Kim P.S. Science. 1990; 249: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of P. Kim. Each reaction mixture contained 1 μg of BSA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.5× buffer D, and 0.1 ng of a32P-labeled CRE oligoduplex. The amount of DNA-binding protein and pX used is indicated in the figure legends. The reaction products were analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide, 0.5× TBE gel except where otherwise noted. The indicated amounts of GCN4 polypeptide were incubated with 200 ng of BSA or 100 ng of pX. Cross-linking was performed by adding glutaraldehyde (Fisher) to a final concentration of 0.02% and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by addition of 0.5 μl of 0.5m Tris, pH 8.0. Monomers and dimers were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The filter was probed with an anti-GCN4 polyclonal serum (kindly provided by Peter Kim). 20 ng of H6-T7tag-pX were incubated for 10 min with glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.01%. Multimers were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with an anti-T7tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen). Purified proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore). The filter was preincubated in far-Western buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and 5% BSA). After 2 h of incubation, [35S]methionine-labeled pX was added and incubation continued for 4 h. The membrane was washed twice with far-Western buffer for 15 min, dried, and autoradiographed. HepG2 cell were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), antibiotics, and 10% FBS (HyClone). Cell transfections were carried out by using Opti-MEM reduced serum medium and LipofectAMINE reagent as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). To investigate the mechanism of pX action a series of recombinant bZIP proteins were tested for DNA binding in the presence and absence of pX. pX was expressed in E. coli as a histidine-tagged derivative and purified according to a nondenaturing procedure (see “Materials and Methods”). For reasons described below, DNA binding was performed at several protein concentrations, which, in the absence of pX, gave rise to a low level of DNA binding. Fig.1 shows that, under these conditions, addition of purified pX greatly increased DNA binding of proteins of the ATF family (CREB, ATF-1, ATF-2), c-Jun family (c-Jun, GCN4), and C/EBP family (C/EBP). Significantly, however, pX did not stimulate DNA binding of all bZIPs (e.g. ATF-4; Fig. 5 B). pX cannot enhance the DNA binding activity of the ATF-4 bZIP transcription factor (36Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Neither an E. coli crude extract nor unrelated recombinant proteins stimulated DNA binding (data not shown; and see Ref. 43Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). pX comparably stimulated DNA binding of bZIP derivatives containing or lacking a GST moiety. Consistent with previous studies (33Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A. Science. 1991; 252: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 39Faktor O. Shaul Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar), we could not detect an interaction between purified pX and DNA (data not shown).Figure 5pX requires the bZIP basic region to stimulate DNA binding. A, λ-ZIP, a chimera containing the λ repressor DNA binding domain (aa 1–101) fused to the GCN4 leucine zipper (aa 250–281) was tested for binding to the OR1 site of the λ phage PRM/PR promoter in the absence (lanes 1 and 3) or presence (lanes 2 and 4) of pX. A schematic diagram of the λ-ZIP protein is shown below. B, several concentrations of GST-ATF4 protein were tested for binding to the ATF-C site (see “Materials and Methods”) in the absence or presence of pX. Comparison of the ATF4 and GCN4 basic region is shown below. Non-conserved amino acids are shaded. C,upper panel, equal amounts of proteins were fractionated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue for protein quantitation. Lower panel, far-Western analysis; purified GST-bZIP derivatives were fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon membrane. The filter was probed with 35S-labeled pX. Excess probe was removed and bound pX visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the possible role of bZIP concentration in the pX-mediated DNA binding increase, we measured the effect of pX at GCN4 concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 20 nm. Fig. 2 shows that maximal stimulation of DNA binding was observed at peptide concentrations below 4 nm and, at higher protein concentrations, pX did not significantly increase DNA binding. The failure to increase DNA binding at higher bZIP concentrations was not due to a limiting amount of pX; DNA binding was again not affected when the concentration of pX was increased (data not shown). These results indicate that pX overcomes a concentration-dependent step that normally limits the extent of DNA binding. Dimerization of bZIP proteins occurs in the absence of DNA and is a prerequisite for DNA binding (51O'Neil K.T. Hoess R.H. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 249: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 52Talanian R.V. McKnight C.J. Kim P.S. Science. 1990; 249: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 53O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 54Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). pX could therefore stimulate DNA binding by increasing either dimerization or the subsequent interaction between the bZIP homodimer and DNA. We measured the effect of pX on bZIP dimerization in the absence of DNA using a chemical cross-linking assay. Previous studies have shown that the two subunits of bZIP dimers can be cross-linked to one another with glutaraldehyde, a bifunctional cross-linking reagent (53O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In Fig.3 A, GCN4 was incubated in the presence or absence of pX, and following addition of glutaraldehyde the products were fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting. At a concentration of 0.1 μm, GCN4 is predominantly a monomer (lane 2) and as the concentration of GCN4 was raised, homodimer formation increased (lane 5). Significantly, addition of pX dramatically increased the amount of GCN4 homodimer (comparelanes 2 to 3 and 5 to6). An additional band with an approximate size of 46 kDa (arrow) appeared only when pX and GCN4 were both present. We suspect that this product results from a pX dimer cross-linked to a GCN4 dimer, but further experimentation would be required to confirm this supposition. To confirm that bZIP dimerization was required for the pX-mediated DNA binding increase, we analyzed the ability of pX to stimulate DNA binding of a “pre-dimerized” protein. The synthetic peptide br1s (52Talanian R.V. McKnight C.J. Kim P.S. Science. 1990; 249: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) contains two GCN4 basic regions joined by a disulfide linkage. Fig. 3 B shows that pX did not stimulate DNA binding of br1s, under the same conditions in which DNA binding of GCN4 was markedly enhanced. Thus, pX function requires a protein with an appropriate dimerization domain, consistent with the ability of pX to promote dimerization. The fact that pX can stimulate DNA binding of proteins containing only a bZIP (GST-JUN bZIP, GST-ATF2 bZIP, GCN4) implies that this domain is the target of pX action. To delineate the portion of the bZIP required for pX recognition, we analyzed a series of bZIP derivatives. Because pX increases dimerization, we began by examining the role of the leucine zipper. The synthetic peptide BR-CC contains the basic region of the yeast GCN4 bZIP protein attached to an idealized coiled-coil dimerization motif (51O'Neil K.T. Hoess R.H. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 249: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). BR-CC contains the canonical leucine repeat, but otherwise the dimerization domains of GCN4 and BR-CC bear no similarity (Fig. 4, bottom). BR-CC dimerizes and binds an AP-1 site with an affinity similar to GCN4 and Fig. 4 shows that pX stimulated DNA binding of BR-CC and GCN4 comparably. We next asked whether the leucines were important for pX recognition. The DNA binding domain of Zta, an Epstein-Barr virus protein, is a highly divergent member of the bZIP family (55Chang Y.-N. Dong D.L.-Y. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3358-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Lieberman P.M. Hardwick J.M. Sample J. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the Zta basic region is similar to that of other bZIP proteins, the dimerization domain is not a typical leucine zipper. Nevertheless, this domain assumes a coiled-coil structure that supports dimerization and DNA binding. Fig. 4 (right) shows that pX efficiently stimulated binding of ZTA to the collagenase promoter AP-1 site. Similarly, pX increased DNA binding of a chimeric protein containing the human c-Fos basic region fused to the ZTA dimerization domain (Fig.4, right). The combined data of Fig. 4 indicate that no specific sequence of the leucine zipper is required for pX function. To test whether the conserved basic region is the target for pX, we first analyzed a hybrid protein, λ-ZIP, in which the DNA binding domain of bacteriophage λ repressor cI was fused in-frame to the GCN4 leucine zipper (57Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). λ-ZIP efficiently dimerizes through the leucine zipper and binds to the OR1 site of bacteriophage phage PRM/PRpromoter. Fig. 5 A shows that pX failed to stimulate DNA binding of λ-ZIP, indicating that the leucine zipper is not sufficient for pX responsiveness and suggesting an essential role for the basic region. Likewise, ATF4 (36Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), a bZIP protein with an atypical basic region that diverges at several residues from the consensus (Fig. 5 B, bottom), was also not pX-responsive (Fig. 5 B, top). To confirm that pX interacted directly with the basic region, we performed a far-Western blotting experiment. bZIP derivatives were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 35S-labeled pX. The results show that pX efficiently bound to proteins that contain a complete bZIP (Fig. 5 C). In addition, pX interacted with a GST-ATF2 derivative containing the ATF2 basic region alone but not with ATF2 or c-Jun derivatives containing only the leucine zipper. Moreover, pX did not interact with ATF-4, consistent with its inability to stimulate ATF-4 DNA binding. These results provide strong evidence that pX binds to the bZIP basic region. The fact that pX interacts with the basic region, which mediates DNA contact, prompted us to investigate the DNA binding specificity of pX-bZIP complexes. We analyzed the ability of pX to increase DNA binding of several bZIP proteins to four different DNA binding sites. These DNA probes contained an AP1 or an ATF consensus flanked by sequences derived from either the collagenase promoter (AP1-C, ATF-C) or a synthetic polylinker (AP1-S, ATF-S) (Fig.6, bottom). Remarkably, the requisite combination of consensus binding site and flanking sequence differed for each bZIP protein tested. For example, pX stimulated DNA binding of CREB only to the AP1-C, ATF-C, and ATF-S sites. For GCN4, the pX-mediated DNA binding increase occurred with AP1-C, AP1-S, and ATF-C but was very modest with ATF-S. The effect of pX on FOS-ZTA DNA binding was maximal only with collagenase flanking sequences and independent of the core binding sites. In contrast, pX-mediated stimulation of ATF2 DNA binding depended only on the ATF core site. To exclude that the diverse bZIP response to pX was n"

We report here the signal transduction pathway involved in TNF-α-induced Mo7e cell proliferation. Mo7e cells spontaneously die in the absence of growth factors, but treating the cells with interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, thrombopoietin, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or TNF-α promotes their survival and proliferation. Although most of these factors activate MAP kinase and Jun NH2-terminal kinase/signal transducer and activators of transcription signaling pathways, TNF-α fails to activate either pathway. When Mo7e cells were treated with TNF-α, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) was activated transiently. The activated NF-κB consisted of heterodimers of p65 and p50 subunits. The degradation of IκBα coincided with activation of NF-κB in TNF-α-treated cells. To investigate the role of activated NF-κB in TNF-α-induced Mo7e proliferation, a cell-permeable peptide (SN50) carrying the nuclear localization sequence of p50 NF-κB was used to block nuclear translocation of activated NF-κB. Pretreating Mo7e cells with SN50 blocked TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and inhibited TNF-α-induced Mo7e cell survival and proliferation. A mutant SN50 peptide did not affect TNF-α-induced Mo7e cell growth. SN50 had no effects on IL-3- or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced Mo7e cell proliferation.

TNF-α also stimulates the proliferation of primary leukemia cells isolated from patients (16Brach M.A. Herrmann F. Leukemia. 1993; 7 Suppl. 2: S22-S26PubMed Google Scholar, 17Aderka D. Maor Y.

In an ultrastructural study of primary leukemia cells from patients, TNF-α did not induce direct cytotoxicity or apoptosis, but instead stimulated leukemia cells (19Munker R. Greither L. Darsow M. Ellwart J.W. Mailhammer R. Wilmanns W. Acta Haematol. 1993; 90: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we and others have found that low doses of TNF-α act synergistically with other cytokines, such as IL-4, to stimulate Mo7e leukemic cell growth (14Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar,15Wadhwa M. Dilger P. Meager A. Walker B. Gaines-Das R. Thorpe R. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of the signaling pathway(s) in TNF-α-induced leukemic cell proliferation remain unclear. Extensive studies show that TNF-α is an extremely pleiotropic factor, which can induce activation of phagocytic and endothelial cells, induction of prostaglandins, alterations in lipid metabolism, and regulated expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens, oncogenes, and transcription factors (1Old L.J. Science. 1985; 230: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 2Carswell E.A. Old L.J. Kassel R.L. Green S. Fiore N. Williamson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3666-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (3760) Google Scholar). The capacity for TNF-α to induce such a wide variety of effects is attributable, in part, to its ability to activate multiple signal transduction pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and/or STATs in numerous cell lines (20Winston B.W.

TNF-α-induced recruitment of the signal transducer FADD to type I TNF receptors may mediate TNF-α-induced apoptosis, but TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB protects against TNF-α-induced apoptosis in some cell lines (30Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Conventional NF-κB is a heterodimer that consists of p65 and p50 subunits. Both subunits of NF-κB are members of the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors, which also includes c-Rel, RelB, and p52 (31Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14899-14907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The activity of NF-κB is strictly regulated by an inhibitor, IκBα, that forms a complex with NF-κB and keeps NF-κB in the cytoplasm (23Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). When cells receive signals that activate NF-κB, IκBα is phosphorylated and degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The degradation of IκBα triggers the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Although increasing evidence shows that the activation of NF-κB is involved in cell activation and proliferation, several lines of evidence also indicate that activation of NF-κB may result in apoptosis (32Qin Z.H. Wang Y. Nakai M. Chase T.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 33Bessho R. Matsubara K. Kubota M. Kuwakado K. Hirota H. Wakazono Y. Lin Y.W. Okuda A. Kawai M.

The fact that TNF-α stimulates the proliferation of human leukemic cell lines as well as primary leukemia cells led us to investigate the TNF-α-induced activation of signaling pathways in Mo7e and other cell lines. Specifically, we addressed the questions of what signal transduction pathways are activated in leukemic cells treated with TNF-α and whether the activated signal transduction pathway(s) is/are involved in TNF-α-induced Mo7e cell proliferation. We found that TNF-α transiently induced activation of NF-κB, but not the MAPK or STAT signaling pathways, which are activated by IL-3, GM-CSF, and thrombopoietin (TPO) in Mo7e and other cell lines. Pretreatment of Mo7e cells with a synthesized membrane-permeable peptide, SN50, blocked the TNF-α-induced translocation of NF-κB to the nuclei in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreating Mo7e cells with SN50 specifically inhibited TNF-α-induced but not IL-3- or GM-CSF-induced Mo7e cell proliferation. Thus, the data presented here provide direct evidence that the activation and function of NF-κB is essential to TNF-α-induced proliferation of Mo7e cells.

Both Meg-01 and HEL cell lines were purchased from ATCC, and the Mo7e cell line was obtained from Genetics Institute (Boston, MA). In experiments to detect effects of cytokines, Mo7e cells were prepared by washing three times with serum-free medium and were starved for 18 h in medium without cytokine (14Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar). Meg-01 and HEL cells were cultured in serum-free medium with 1× Nutridoma HU (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 18 h before cytokine treatments. SN50, a peptide that has been reported to have the capacity to block the nuclear translocation of activated NF-κB (34Qin Z.H. Wang Y. Nakai M. Chase T.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,39Lin Y.-Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

SN50mt, a mutant SN50, contains membrane-permeable signal sequences of Kaposi's fibroblast growth factor and the mutant nuclear translocation motif of human NF-κB p50 (39Lin Y.-Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Both SN50 and SN50mt were synthesized commercially (Genemed Synthesis, South San Francisco, CA). The peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the molecular weight of the purified peptides was verified by mass spectrometry analysis. To track the intracellular localization of the membrane-permeable peptides in Mo7e cells, SN50 was labeled with FITC. The synthesized peptides were dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 100 μg/μl and mixed directly with culture medium (1:500–1000) before use. To determine the effects of TNF-α on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation in freshly prepared cells. The assays were performed in triplicate, using a total of 4 × 105 Mo7e or Meg-01 cells, or 2 × 105 HEL cells. Mo7e cells in IMDM with 10% FCS, and Meg-01 and HEL cells in medium with 1× Nutridoma HU, were cultured for 72 h in the presence or absence of TNF-α or other cytokines. After that, the cells were labeled with 4 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for an additional 4 h. The radioactivity incorporated into DNA (counts per minute) was determined by a liquid scintillation counter according to a previously described protocol (14Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar). All assays for [3H]thymidine incorporation were repeated at least three times. Some of our data from [3H]thymidine incorporation assays also were compared with those obtained from the Non-radioactive Cell Proliferation Wst-1 kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Both methods yielded consistent results, but only the data from [3H]thymidine incorporation assays are presented. The functional activity of MAP kinase kinase (MEK) was detected by the kinase-induced phosphorylation of a kinase-defective p42mapk (K52R) labeled with [32P]ATP, following a published protocol (14Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar). For the detection of tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), cells treated with or without cytokines were boiled in SDS buffer. Total cellular proteins (30 μg) were loaded into each lane and subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with an anti-PhosphoPlus MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs), which reacts only with MAPK that is phosphorylated on Thr-202 and Tyr-204, or with an anti-total (unphosphorylated and phosphorylated) MAPK antibody as a control. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was examined by 10% SDS-PAGE Western blotting with specific anti-phosphorylated-STAT1 and anti-phosphorylated-STAT3 antibodies (New England Biolabs), according to the methods suggested by the manufacturer. For comparison, total STAT1 and STAT3 (both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) also were examined with anti-STAT1 and -STAT3 antibodies. Western blots were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Preparation of nuclear extracts and gel mobility shift assays were performed according to methods described previously (40Liu R.Y. Li X. Li L. Li G.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3667-3673PubMed Google Scholar, 41Olashaw N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30307-30310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the NF-κB-binding oligonucleotide used as a radioactive DNA probe was 5′-TCGACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGC-3′. Equal amounts of nuclear proteins (5–10 μg) for each sample were incubated with 1 ng of 32P-labeled probe. The DNA binding reaction was performed at room temperature in a volume of 25 μl, which contained binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 μm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1.8 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA), 1 ng of 3′-labeled probe, and 5–10 μg of nuclear proteins. After incubation for 15 min, the samples were electrophoresed on native 6% acrylamide, 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA gels. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Competition was performed by adding 50–100 m excess of each unlabeled DNA fragment along with the 32P-labeled probe. For gel mobility supershift assays, nuclear extracts were co-incubated with the indicated specific anti-NF-κB subunit antibodies and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes. The DNA-protein complexes and unbound probe were separated electrophoretically on 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 44.5 mm boric acid). The gels were fixed and dried, and the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography at −70 °C with Kodak X-Omat film and a DuPont Cranex Lightning Plus intensifying screen. A FACScan flow cytometer was used to examine Mo7e cell cycle status, intracellular localization of SN50 peptides, and apoptosis. Mo7e cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml FITC-labeled SN50 peptide for various periods or with various amounts of FITC-SN50 for 30 min to investigate the intercellular incorporation of the peptides. The status of apoptosis was analyzed by incubating cells with FITC-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide (PI), following the manufacturer's suggested procedure. For the analysis of cell cycle status and cellular DNA ploidy, the cells were fixed with methanol and stained with PI according to the published method (14Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar). When the electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to examine the activation of NF-κB in Mo7e, HEL, and K562 human leukemic cell lines, no detectable activation of NF-κB was observed in the cells without cytokine exposure (Fig.1 a, CTL). However, exposure of the cells to 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min significantly induced the activation of NF-κB in Mo7e, HEL, and K562 cells (Fig.1 a, TNF). The Mo7e cells were used to further investigate the dynamics of the activation of NF-κB. When Mo7e cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 0–120 min, the activation of NF-κB was first detected within 5 min, attained a maximal level at 30 min, and declined thereafter (Fig. 1 b). Supershift EMSA was then used to examine the components of the DNA-protein complexes. The results showed that both anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies induced a supershift of the DNA-protein complex in nuclear extracts from Mo7e, HEL, and K562 cells treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min (Fig.2, a and b), indicating that the TNF-α-induced DNA-protein complexes in these cells contained both p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits. When the nuclear extracts from cells treated with TNF-α were incubated with anti-p52, anti-RelB, or anti-c-Rel antibodies, no supershift was observed (data not shown). Furthermore, the formation of the NF-κB-DNA complex was inhibited competitively by an unlabeled NF-κB DNA probe in a dose-dependent manner. A 100-fold molar excess of nonradioactive DNA containing the NF-κB binding site completely prevented binding of the activated NF-κB to the32P-labeled NF-κB-binding probe (Fig. 2 c), but did not affect the nonspecific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 2,bands marked as NS). The results, therefore, demonstrate clearly that the NF-κB p65/p50 heterodimer is activated in these leukemic cell lines in response to TNF-α.Figure 2Identification of the components of activated NF-κB in the DNA-protein complex by EMSA . a, nuclear extracts from Mo7e, HEL, and K562 cells treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α were incubated with 32P-labeled NF-κB-binding probe alone (lanes 1–3), with radioactive probe and anti-NF-κB p65 subunit antibody (lanes 4–6). b, nuclear extracts from Mo7e, HEL, and K562 cells treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α were incubated with 32P-labeled NF-κB-binding probe alone (lanes 1–3), with radioactive probe and anti-NF-κB p50 subunit antibody (lanes 4–6).NS indicates the nonspecific DNA-binding band, and the arrow indicates the supershift complexes. c, nuclear extracts from Mo7e cells treated without TNF-α (lane 1) or with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min were incubated with32P-labeled NF-κB-binding probe alone (lane 2) or 32P-labeled probe and the indicated -fold molar excess of unlabeled probe containing the NF-κB binding site (lanes 2–6) to determine the specificity of the binding of activated transcriptional factors to the NF-κB-binding probe. The DNA-binding complexes were separated in 6% native polyacrylamide gels. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. The autoradiograph shows the location of NF-κB and the nonspecific band (NS).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined the effect of TNF-α treatment on the localization of NF-κB in Mo7e cells by Western blotting with specific antibodies against the p65 NF-κB subunit. Before stimulation, p65 was detected exclusively in the cytoplasmic lysates (Fig. 3 a,lane 1). When Mo7e cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 5–120 min, the level of cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 declined gradually (Fig. 3 a, lanes 2–7). When nuclear extracts were used in Western blotting to analyze the level of nuclear NF-κB p65, there was no detectable NF-κB p65 in the nucleus of Mo7e cells without TNF-α exposure (Fig.3 b, lane 1). However, NF-κB was detectable in the nucleus within 5 min, and the level of nuclear NF-κB p65 increased markedly in cells exposed to TNF-α, with a maximal level within 30–60 min of the treatment (Fig. 3 b,lanes 4–7). When nonimmune immunoglobulins were used as the first antibody, no NF-κB p65 was detected in the nuclear extracts from Mo7e cells (data not shown). The results from Western blotting analysis of cytoplasmic lysates and nuclear extracts confirm and extend the EMSA findings of activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB in Mo7e cells treated with TNF-α. A common feature of the regulation of NF-κB is its sequestration in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with IκBα in the basal state. To investigate the role of IκBα in the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α, phosphorylation and the total level of IκBα were analyzed by Western blotting, and the results were compared with the dynamics of NF-κB activation in Mo7e cells after TNF-α stimulation. When nuclear extracts from Mo7e cells treated with TNF-α were analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody specific for phosphorylated IκBα, the phosphorylation of IκBα became detectable in cells treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 1 min, reached the maximum level at 5 min, and then declined rapidly (Fig.4 a, lanes 2–6). Western blotting analysis of cytoplasmic lysates showed that the rapid decline of nuclear IκBα in TNF-α-treated Mo7e cells was due to a decrease of total IκBα rather than dephosphorylation of IκBα, since the level of total IκBα (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) also was decreased markedly upon TNF-α treatment (Fig. 4 b). Comparison of these results to those in Fig. 3, which showed that the activation of NF-κB induced by TNF-α was first detected within 5 min and maximal at 30 min, indicate clearly that the degradation of IκBα coincides with the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB in Mo7e cells. MAPK and STAT signal transduction pathways have been reported to be activated by several hemopoietic growth factors and to be involved in growth factor-induced Mo7e cell proliferation (14Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar, 42Liu R.Y. Fan C. Garcia R. Jove R. Zuckerman K.S. Blood. 1999; 93: 2369-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether these signal transduction pathways are activated by TNF-α and whether they are involved in TNF-α-induced cell proliferation, we examined the effect of TNF-α on the activation of MAPK and STAT signal transduction pathways. When Mo7e cells were treated with 5 ng/ml IL-3 or GM-CSF for 30–60 min, no significant activation of NF-κB was observed (Fig. 5 a,lanes 3–6), although TNF-α treatment induced significant activation of NF-κB (Fig. 5 a, lane 2). When the activation of the STAT5 signal transduction pathway in Mo7e cells was examined by EMSA, the results, which were similar to those that we reported previously (14Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar), showed that STAT5 activation was observed in Mo7e cells treated with GM-CSF, IL-3, TPO, and IL-6, but not in cells treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 10–60 min (data not shown). When the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 was examined by EMSA, supershift EMSA, or Western blotting with specific anti-phosphorylated STAT1 or STAT3 antibodies, no significant activation or phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT3 was observed in Mo7e cells treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α, IL-3, or GM-CSF for 10–60 min (data not shown). However, a significant activation of STAT1 and STAT3 was detected in control SK-BR-3 cells treated with 2 ng/ml epidermal growth factor for 30 min, which we reported previously as the positive control for detecting activation of STAT1 and STAT3 (42Liu R"
https://openalex.org/W2118548564,"Lethal toxin (LT) from Clostridium sordellii has been shown in HeLa cells to glucosylate and inactivate Ras and Rac and, hence, to disorganize the actin cytoskeleton. In the present work, we demonstrate that LT treatment provokes the same effects in HL-60 cells. We show that guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)-stimulated phospholipase D (PLD) activity is inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner after an overnight treatment with LT. A similar dose response to the toxin was found when PLD activity was stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate via the protein kinase C pathway. The toxin effect on actin organization seemed unlikely to account directly for PLD inhibition as cytochalasin D and iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens E disorganize the actin cytoskeleton without modifying PLD activity. However, the enzyme inhibition and actin cytoskeleton disorganization could both be related to a major decrease observed in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). Likely in a relationship with this decrease, recombinant ADP-ribosylation factor, RhoA, Rac, and RalA were not able to reconstitute PLD activity in LT-treated cells permeabilized and depleted of cytosol. Studies of phosphoinositide kinase activities did not allow us to attribute the decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2to inactivation of PtdIns4P 5-kinase. LT was also found to provoke a major inhibition in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that could not account for the inhibition of PLD activity because wortmannin, at doses that fully inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, had no effect on the phospholipase activity. Among the three small G-proteins, Ras, Rac, and RalA, inactivated by LT and involved in PLD regulation, inactivation of Ral proteins appeared to be responsible for PLD inhibition as LT toxin (strain 9048) unable to glucosylate Ral proteins did not modify PLD activity. In HL-60 cells, LT treatment appeared also to modify cytosol components in relationship with PLD inhibition as a cytosol prepared from LT-treated cells was less efficient than one from control HL-60 cells in stimulating PLD activity. Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins involved in the regulation of polyphosphoinositides and ADP-ribosylation factor, a major cytosolic PLD activator in HL-60 cells, were unchanged, whereas the level of cytosolic protein kinase Cα was decreased after LT treatment. We conclude that in HL-60 cells, lethal toxin from C. sordellii, in inactivating small G-proteins involved in PLD regulation, provokes major modifications at the membrane and the cytosol levels that participate in the inhibition of PLD activity. Although Ral appeared to play an essential role in PLD activity, we discuss the role of other small G-proteins inactivated by LT in the different modifications observed in HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1979671267,"The ATPase activity of ArsA, the catalytic subunit of the plasmid-encoded, ATP-dependent extrusion pump for arsenicals and antimonials in Escherichia coli, is allosterically activated by arsenite or antimonite. Magnesium is essential for ATPase activity. To examine the role of Asp45, mutants were constructed in which Asp45was changed to Glu, Asn, or Ala. Cells expressing these mutatedarsA genes lost arsenite resistance to varying degrees. Purified D45A and D45N enzymes were inactive. The purified D45E enzyme exhibited approximately 5% of the wild type activity with about a 5-fold decrease in affinity for Mg2+. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was used to probe Mg2+ binding.

D45N and D45A remained protected by ATP and Sb(III) but lost the Mg2+ effect. D45E exhibited an intermediate Mg2+ response.

These results indicate that Asp45 is a Mg2+-responsive residue, consistent with its function as a Mg2+ ligand. The ars operon of conjugative R-factor R773 encodes an arsenite extrusion system that confers arsenite or antimonite resistance to Escherichia coli by extruding arsenicals and antimonials out of the cell, thus lowering their intracellular concentration (1Xu C. Zhou T. Kuroda M. Rosen B.P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This efflux pump is composed of two types of subunits, ArsA and ArsB. The 63-kDa ArsA ATPase is the catalytic subunit. The 45-kDa ArsB subunit is an integral membrane protein that acts as the membrane anchor for ArsA and the oxyanion-translocating sector of the pump (2Dey S. Dou D. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, ArsA is found in the cytosol and purified as a soluble protein (3Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From its primary sequence, ArsA is composed of N-terminal (A1) and C-terminal (A2) halves that are homologous to each other, most likely the result of an ancestral gene duplication and fusion (4Chen C.M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each half contains a consensus sequence for the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) of an ATP-binding site (5Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that both ATP-binding sites are required for catalysis and resistance (6Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of intergenic complementation and intragenic suppression studies have suggested a model in which catalysis occurs at the interface of the A1 and A2 ATP-binding sites (8Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, a highly conserved DTAP consensus sequence has been identified in ArsA homologues. These homologues are found in members of every kingdom from bacteria to humans (9Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). From the results of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, we have suggested this domain may act as a signal transduction domain that relays the communication between ATP-binding sites and the allosteric As(III)/Sb(III)-binding site. From the sequence alignment of ArsA homologues with other enzymes such as nitrogenase iron protein (NifH) (10Joerger R.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RecA (11Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), and GTP-binding proteins, including Ras p21 (12Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), there is a highly conserved Asp-Pro (Fig. 1), which, in G-proteins, forms part of an effector loop. From the crystal structure of Ras p21 with GTP bound, the conserved Asp residue was shown to form a portion of the Mg2+-binding site (12Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In GTPases a magnesium ion brings together diverse components of the GTP-binding core, facilitating the information flow between domains. Elucidation of the Mg2+coordination is therefore important for deciphering the mechanism of nucleotide-binding proteins. Sequence alignment of ArsA with GTPases and other ATPases suggests that Asp45-Pro46 are the corresponding residues in ArsA. In this study Asp45 was changed by mutagenesis to several other residues. The properties of the resulting mutant strains and the purified ArsAs support this postulate. First, an acidic residue is required at position 45 for ArsA ATPase activity. The wild type enzyme exhibited 20-fold more ATPase activity than the D45E derivative, with 5-fold higher affinity for Mg2+. The D45A and D45N derivatives were inactive. Second, using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (13Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and accessibility to trypsin to detect conformational changes upon ligand binding (3Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Asp45 was shown to be required for Mg2+-dependent responses.

Restriction enzymes and nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The WizardTM plus minipreps DNA purification system and the WizardTM DNA clean-up system (Promega) were used to prepare plasmid DNA for restriction enzyme digestion and to recover DNA fragments from low melting agarose gels, respectively. Mutations in thearsA gene were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered SitesTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) with plasmid pTZ3H6 containing the arsA andarsB genes (9Zhou T.

In this plasmid the arsA gene was previously mutated to contain only a single tryptophan codon (Trp159), and the sequence for six histidine codons was added at the 3′ end. This plasmid was used as the template to produce arsA mutants with D45E, D45A, or D45N substitutions. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used and the respective changes (underlined) obtained were as follows: D45A, 5′-TGAGGCCGGAGCGGTACTGAC-3′; D45E, 5′-TTGAGGCCGGCTCGGTACTGA-3′; D45N, 5′-GAGGCCGGATTGGTACTGACC-3′. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire arsAgene using a Cy5-AUTOREAD sequencing kit with an ALFexpress system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid DNA for sequencing was prepared with a Mini kit (QIAGEN). Strain JM109 cells harboring the indicated plasmids were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium to the mid-exponential phase of growth, at which point 0.1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to inducearsA expression. The cells were grown for another 2.5 h before being harvested by centrifugation. The soluble ArsA proteins were purified as described (9Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using an NADH-coupled assay (16Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with 5 mm ATP and 2.5 mm MgCl2 unless otherwise noted. Fluorescence measurements were performed using an SLM-8000C spectrofluorometer with a built-in magnetic stirrer. The bandwidths for emission and excitation monochromators were 4 nm. Tryptophan fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 337 nm. The fluorescence of the buffer (50 mmMOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid -KOH, pH 7.5) alone was subtracted from protein spectra. ArsA (1.25 μm), ATP (5 mm), and MgCl2 (2.5 mm) were added as indicated. Limited trypsin digestion was performed at room temperature and terminated at the indicated times by the addition of a 3-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor to the reaction mixture as described previously (3Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were then analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). E. coli cells harboring plasmid pTZ3H6 exhibited resistance to 4 mm sodium arsenite (Fig.2). The arsA gene in this plasmid encodes a modified ArsA (W159H6) in which there is only a single tryptophan residue at position 159 and six histidine residues fused to the C terminus. Resistance conferred by this plasmid was the same as a plasmid bearing a wild type arsA gene (9Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), so this modified arsA gene was used as the parent for all D45X mutants. Mutational replacement of Asp45with glutamic acid resulted in a reduction in arsenite resistance. Substitution of Asp45 with asparagine resulted in a further decrease in resistance, and cells expressing a D45A substitution lost arsenite resistance. The W159H6 ArsA and its D45X derivatives were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography to greater than 95% homogeneity, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Blue, and the ATPase activity of each protein was determined. In the presence of 5 mm ATP, 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm potassium antimonial tartrate, D45E ArsA exhibited approximately 5% of wild type ATPase activity (data not shown). In contrast, no activity was observed with either the D45A or D45N enzymes. ATPase activity was measured at varying concentrations of MgCl2. With the parental enzyme, the concentration of MgCl2 required for half-maximal ATPase activity was 0.8 mm (Fig. 3). The activity of the D45E enzyme was too low to obtain an accurate fit of the data, but it required at least 5-fold more divalent cation for maximal activity than the wild type. This suggests that the introduction of a glutamic acid residue at position 45 lowered the affinity for Mg2+, consistent with a role of Asp45 in coordination of the divalent cation. In the parental ArsA, Trp159has a maximum emission at 337 nm in the native enzyme and at 353 nm in the denatured protein when excited at 295 nm (9Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Each of the D45X proteins had the same emission maximum as the parental (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that the substitutions of Asp45 with Glu, Asn, or Ala per se have little effect on the overall protein conformation. In the wild type ArsA the fluorescence of Trp159 has been shown to respond to MgATP binding (13Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To produce an effect, both the divalent cation and ATP must be present (Fig. 4 B). Compared with the parental enzyme, fluorescence of the D45E ArsA exhibited a smaller response to MgATP addition. With both parental and D45E enzymes the fluorescent enhancement produced by MgATP was reversed by the addition of disodium EDTA. In contrast, neither the D45A nor the D45N enzyme responded to the addition of Mg2+. Limited trypsin digestion has been used to study the surface accessibility of arginine and lysine residues in the 63-kDa ArsA (3Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial cleavage by trypsin produces a fragment of approximately 50 kDa with subsequent cleavage to smaller polypeptides. The rate of cleavage was decreased synergistically by the binding of both ATP and Sb(III), suggesting that the enzyme undergoes a conformational change when both substrate and allosteric effector sites are filled (13Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, those results were obtained in the absence of Mg2+. The addition of Mg2+ proved to be antagonistic to the protection conferred by ATP and Sb(III), increasing the rate of trypsin cleavage (Fig. 5). This suggests that the binding of Mg2+ to the enzyme in which the substrate and allosteric sites are already filled produces a conformational change that makes a tryptic site more accessible. ATP and antimonite synergistically protected each D45Xprotein to the same extent as the parental ArsA, indicating that substitutions of Asp45 do not grossly affect the filling of the allosteric and substrate sites (Fig. 5). However, Mg2+caused no effect on the tryptic pattern in the D45A or D45N proteins and a partial response with the D45E ArsA. The antagonism by Mg2+ on the parental and D45E ArsAs was reversed by EDTA, indicating that the effect of Mg2+ requires an acidic residue at position 45. Coordination of Mg2+ in ATP- and GTP-binding proteins frequently involves aspartate residues (18Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Larsen T.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H.

ArsA, the catalytic subunit of the bacterial arsenite pump, hydrolyzes ATP to provide energy for arsenite efflux from cells (22Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mg2+ has been shown to be required for ArsA ATPase activity (3Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results described in this study indicate that the ArsA residue Asp45 is one ligand to the divalent cation. First, sequence alignment of ArsA homologues demonstrates a conserved pair of residues that corresponds to Asp45-Pro46 in the R773 ArsA (Fig. 1). This DP sequence is conserved in other GTPases and ATPases, for example Asp33-Pro34 in Ras p21 (12Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), Asp100-Pro101 in RecA (11Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), and Asp39-Pro40 in the NifH iron protein subunit of nitrogenase (23Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). From the crystal structure of Ras p21 it was shown that in the GTP binding state Asp33 is a Mg2+ ligand. Similarly, from the crystal structure of NifH, Asp39 is in close proximity to the Mg2+ in the ATP-binding site. Based on the sequence comparisons, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Asp45 in ArsA may be involved in the coordination of the Mg2+ complexed with ATP. Second, substitution of Asp45 in ArsA with Asn, Ala, or Glu resulted in reduced arsenite resistance for cells harboring the respective plasmid, indicating that an aspartate residue at position 45 promotes ArsA catalysis. Although an aspartate residue is not absolutely required, because the D45E and D45N mutants retained partial resistance, the wild type enzyme is approximately 20-fold more active than the purified D45E ArsA and has about a 5-fold higher affinity for Mg2+ (Fig. 3). Third, Mg2+ produces conformational changes in ArsA that can be detected from the effect of the cation on the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp159 (Fig. 4) or on the surface accessibility of the protein to trypsin (Fig. 5). As shown previously, the fluorescence of Trp159 responds specifically to Mg2+ and ATP (13Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). With the D45E ArsA, the addition of Mg2+ and ATP induced an intermediate fluorescence enhancement that was reversed by EDTA. However, the fluorescence of the D45A or D45N proteins did not respond to MgATP. Moreover, the reversal of protection from trypsin digestion that Mg2+ afforded the wild type enzyme was absent in the D45N and D45A proteins and reduced in the D45E. These results strongly point to a role for Asp45 in binding Mg2+. Several lines of evidence indicate that the substitutions did not affect the overall conformation of the proteins or their ability to bind the substrate ATP or the allosteric activator Sb(III). First, the emission spectra of all of the proteins were superimposable, indicating that the environment of Trp159 was the same in each (Fig.4 A). Second, the tryptic patterns of all the proteins were similar in the absence of ligands (data not shown) or in the presence of the nucleotide and the allosteric effector (Fig. 5), indicating that the surface of the proteins had reasonably equal accessibility to large molecules such as trypsin. The protection from trypsin afforded by the combination of ATP and Sb(III) (but in the absence of Mg2+) shows that the binding of a substrate or an allosteric effector was not substantially altered by the replacement of Asp45 with another acidic residue (glutamate), a neutral residue (asparagine), or a smaller residue (alanine)."
https://openalex.org/W2017470960,"The mitochondrial metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids with conjugated double bonds at odd-numbered positions,e.g. 9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoic acid, was investigated. These fatty acids are substrates of β-oxidation in isolated rat liver mitochondria and hence are expected to yield 5,7-dienoyl-CoA intermediates. 5,7-Decadienoyl-CoA was used to study the degradation of these intermediates. After introduction of a 2-trans-double bond by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase or acyl-CoA oxidase, the resultant 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA can either continue its pass through the β-oxidation cycle or be converted by Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase to 3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA. The latter compound was isomerized by a novel enzyme, named Δ3,5,7,Δ2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA isomerase, to 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA, which is a substrate of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (Wang, H.-Y. and Schulz, H. (1989)Biochem. J. 264, 47–52) and hence can be completely degraded via β-oxidation. Δ3,5,7,Δ2,4,6-Trienoyl-CoA isomerase was purified from pig heart to apparent homogeneity and found to be a component enzyme of Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Although the direct β-oxidation of 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA seems to be the major pathway, the degradation via 2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA makes a significant contribution to the total β-oxidation of this intermediate.

Although the direct β-oxidation of 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA seems to be the major pathway, the degradation via 2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA makes a significant contribution to the total β-oxidation of this intermediate. The β-oxidation of typical polyunsaturated fatty acids requires the involvement of three auxiliary enzymes in addition to the enzymes that catalyze the four basic reactions of the β-oxidation spiral (1Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The auxiliary enzymes are Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (Δ3-cis-Δ2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase, EC 5.3.3.8; referred to hereafter as enoyl-CoA isomerase), 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (4-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH), EC 1.3.1.34), and Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (referred to hereafter as dienoyl-CoA isomerase). These enzymes catalyze either the reduction or isomerization of double bonds once the double bonds are close to the thioester function as the result of chain shortening. Consequently, double bonds either are reductively removed or are shifted to yield 2-trans-enoyl-CoAs, which are intermediates of the β-oxidation spiral. Polyunsaturated fatty acid with conjugated double bonds may yield intermediates with more extended chromophores. For example, a fatty acid with two conjugated double bonds at even-numbered positions is assumed to be chain-shortened by β-oxidation to 4,6-dienoyl-CoA and is then converted to 2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The further metabolism of this intermediate is facilitated by 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of one double bond of the 2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA chromophore to yield 3,6-dienoyl-CoA (2Wang H.-Y. Schulz H. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The β-oxidation of a fatty acid with two conjugated double bonds at odd-numbered positions would produce 5,7-dienoyl-CoA, which may be dehydrogenated by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to 2,5,7-trienoyl-CoA. The latter compound may be chain-shortened to 3,5-dienoyl-CoA or isomerized to 3,5,7-trienoyl-CoA by enoyl-CoA isomerase. The further metabolism of 3,5,7-trienoyl-CoA would require the action of a Δ3,5,7,Δ2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA isomerase. Such an enzyme has not been described so far. Since polyunsaturated fatty acids with conjugated double bonds (such as, for example, conjugated linoleic acid) are formed during the partial catalytic hydrogenation of fats (3Dutton H.J. Emken E.A. Dutton H.J. Geometrical and Positional Fatty Acid Isomers. American Oil Chemists' Society, Champaign, IL1979: 1-16Google Scholar) and in ruminants (4Martin J.-C. Banni S. Sébédio J.L. Christie W.W. Trans Fatty Acids in Human Nutrition. Oily Press Ltd., Dundee, Scotland1998: 261-302Google Scholar), they are constituents of the human diet, and hence, their degradation by β-oxidation deserves to be studied. It was the aim of this study to elucidate the further metabolism of 5,7-dienoyl-CoA and to identify, isolate, and characterize a suspected Δ3,5,7,Δ2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA isomerase (referred to hereafter as trienoyl-CoA isomerase).

Twenty mmol of (4-carboxybutyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide in 10 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran were combined with 42 mmol of lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in 42 ml of tetrahydrofuran at 25 °C and under N2 with stirring. After 15 min, 16 mmol oftrans-2-pentenal in 10 ml of tetrahydrofuran were added slowly. The color of the reaction changed from red to yellow. After 60 min, 50 ml of water were added to quench the reaction. The mixture was extracted with ether to remove the unreacted aldehyde. The aqueous solution was acidified with 10% HCl and extracted with ether. The combined ether extracts were extracted with water, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated to yield 0.82 g of 5,7-decadienoic acid (∼30% yield). The structure of the product was confirmed by mass spectrometry, which showed the expected [M + NH4+] peak at 186. Dienoyl-CoA isomerase was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 300 nm on a Hitachi Model U-3000 spectrophotometer at 25 °C as described by Luo et al. (10Luo M.J.

A typical assay mixture contained 20 μm 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA in 0.2 m potassium Pi (pH 8.0). An extinction coefficient of 27,800m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate rates. Trienoyl-CoA isomerase activities were determined by monitoring the absorbance increase at 337 nm. An extinction coefficient of 49,300m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate rates (2Wang H.-Y. Schulz H.

A typical assay mixture contained 20 μm3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA in 0.2 m potassium Pi(pH 8.0) and enzyme to give an absorbance change of 0.02/min. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate to product/min. Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) with bovine liver albumin as the standard. Trienoyl-CoA isomerase was purified by the procedure developed for the purification of dienoyl-CoA isomerase (10Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All operations were carried out at 4 °C. One frozen pig heart (330 g) was minced and blended with 1 liter of 20 mm potassium Pi (pH 8.3) containing 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 6500 ×g for 20 min. Polyethylene glycol was added to the supernatant to achieve a final concentration of 10%. After keeping the suspension for 30 min, it was centrifuged at 6500 × gfor 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of buffer A containing 0.2 m KCl. After stirring it overnight, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was diluted with 4 volumes of buffer A to lower the salt concentration and was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (2.5 × 50 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was extensively washed with buffer A and then eluted with 600 ml of buffer A containing 0.2 m KCl. Fractions with trienoyl-CoA isomerase activity were combined, and the pH was adjusted to 6.3 with 1 mKH2PO4. The mixture was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (2.5 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 5 mm potassium Pi (pH 6.3) containing 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer B). The column was washed with buffer B containing 0.5 m KCl and then was developed with a gradient made up of 300 ml of buffer B and 300 ml of buffer B containing 0.8 m potassium Pi (pH 6.3). Fractions of 6 ml were collected, and the active fractions were combined and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator with a YM-10 membrane. After dialyzing overnight against 25 mmethanolamine/acetic acid (pH 9.4) containing 5 mmmercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol (buffer C), the sample was applied to a chromatofocusing column (1.5 × 25 cm) containing polybuffer exchanger 94 equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with buffer C and then developed with 12 column volumes of polybuffer 96 adjusted to pH 6.0 with acetic acid. Fractions of 5 ml were collected, and the active fractions were combined and concentrated. Thereafter, the sample was passed through a Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, and 25% glycerol (buffer D). The active fractions were combined and loaded onto a reactive red 120 column (1.5 × 13 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer D. After washing with buffer D, the column was eluted with 15 μm2-trans,4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and assayed for both dienoyl-CoA and trienoyl-CoA isomerase activities. Active fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The intensities of the bands were determined by gel scanning with a densitometer. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated as described by Nedergaard and Cannon (17Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For respiration measurements, 1.5 mg of rat liver mitochondria were incubated in 1.9 ml of a basal medium containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm potassium Pi, 0.1m KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA. To this mixture were added, in the indicated orders, bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml), 0.5 mml-carnitine, 0.5 mml-malate, 1 mm ADP, and one of the following: 15 μmlinoleoyl-CoA, 15 μm9-cis,11-trans-octadienoyl-CoA, 0.1 mm decanoic acid, or 0.1 mm 5,7-decadienoic acid. Rates of respiration were measured polarographically with a Clarke-type oxygen electrode attached to a Yellow Springs-oxygraph. The direct β-oxidation of 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA was measured by incubating this compound at concentrations between 5 and 50 μm in 0.2m potassium Pi (pH 8.0) with 1 mmNAD+, 0.3 mm CoASH, and a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria (4 μg/ml). The formation of NADH was determined fluorometrically by excitation at 340 nm and by measuring the emission at 460 nm with a PTI spectrofluorometer. The conversion of 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA to 3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA was coupled to the isomerization of the latter compound to the 2,4,6-isomer in the presence of trienoyl-CoA isomerase (0.25 units/ml). 2,5,7-Decatrienoyl-CoA, at concentrations between 5 and 60 μm in 0.2 m potassium Pi (pH 8.0), was incubated with a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria (4 μg/ml). The increase in absorbance at 337 nm was measured spectrophotometrically. Rates were calculated based on an extinction coefficient of 49,300 m−1 cm−1(2Wang H.-Y. Schulz H. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Dienoyl-CoA isomerase (2 μg) in 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7) containing 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmmercaptoethanol was combined with various amounts of anti-dienoyl-CoA isomerase serum containing between 0 and 300 μg of protein. The total volume was 0.2 ml. This mixture was kept for 20 min at 25 °C and then combined with 0.2 ml of a suspension containing 10% (w/v)S. aureus (Cowan strain). After an additional 10 min of incubation at 25 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 3 min. The supernatant was transferred to clean tubes and kept at 4 °C until assayed for dienoyl-CoA and trienoyl-CoA isomerase activities. Acyl-CoAs were purified or analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Waters μBondapak C18 column (30 cm x 3.9 mm) attached to a Waters gradient HPLC system. The absorbance of the effluent was monitored at 254 nm. Separation of different acyl-CoA thioesters was achieved by linearly increasing the acetonitrile/H2O (9:1, v/v) content of the 50 mm ammonium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) from 20 to 55% at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. When acyl-CoAs were purified, the desired fraction of the effluent was collected. After evaporation of acetonitrile under vacuum, the product was concentrated by use of a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. The β-oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids with conjugated double bonds at odd-numbered positions is expected to produce 5,7-dienoyl-CoA intermediates. To study the metabolism of these intermediates, 5,7-decadienoyl-CoA was synthesized. The required 5,7-decadienoic acid was prepared from (4-carboxybutylidene)triphenylphosphorane and 2-trans-pentenal by a Wittig reaction (15Maryanoff B.E. Reitz A.B. Duhl-Emswiler B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 217-226Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Since the synthetic procedure is predicted to yield mostly thetrans-isomer of the newly formed double bond, the major product is expected to be 5-trans,7-trans-decadienoic acid. The CoA derivative of this acid was obtained in pure form after converting the acid to the CoA thioester and isolating the major product by HPLC (Fig.1 A). In a preliminary experiment, the capacity of mitochondria to oxidize fatty acids with odd-numbered conjugated double bonds was assessed. The data presented in Table I demonstrate that such fatty acids supported the respiration of coupled rat liver mitochondria at rates that were slightly lower than those obtained with the corresponding fatty acids having either non-conjugated double bonds or no double bond at all. This result suggests the presence of a mitochondrial pathway for the β-oxidation of fatty acids that have odd-numbered conjugated double bonds.Table IRates of respiration supported by fatty acid oxidation in coupled rat liver mitochondriaSubstrateRates of respirationaValues are means ± S.D. based on the number of measurements indicated in parentheses.nmol O/min/mg protein9-cis,12-cis-Octadecadienoyl-CoA (linoleoyl-CoA)81.4 ± 1.6 (3)9-cis,11-trans-Octadecadienoyl-CoA64.3 ± 1.3 (3)Decanoic acid110.4 ± 3.3 (3)5-trans,7-trans-Decadienoic acid84.3 ± 1.8 (3)a Values are means ± S.D. based on the number of measurements indicated in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The step-by-step degradation of 5,7-decadienoyl-CoA was studied spectrophotometrically by use of purified enzymes. The spectrum of 5,7-decadienoyl-CoA (shown in Fig.2 A, spectrum 1) is characterized by a major absorbance band centered around 230 nm and a shoulder at 260 nm. These absorbances are attributed to the diene and CoA chromophores, respectively. Treatment of 5,7-decadienoyl-CoA with acyl-CoA oxidase produced a 40% increase in the absorbance at 263 nm (Fig. 2 A, compare spectra 3 and 1). Such a change in absorbance agrees with the conversion of an acyl-CoA to 2-trans-enoyl-CoA. 5,7-Decadienoyl-CoA is also a substrate of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. In fact, it is a better substrate than is decanoyl-CoA (0.66 versus 0.45 units/mg). When 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA was treated with enoyl-CoA isomerase, the absorbance at 260 nm increased, whereas the absorbance around 230 nm decreased (Fig. 2 A). These absorbance changes agree with the isomerization of a conjugated diene to a conjugated triene that would take place during the conversion of 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA to 3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA. The same absorbance changes were observed when 5,7-decadienoyl-CoA was reacted with acyl-CoA oxidase and peroxisomal multifunctional protein I, which harbors enoyl-CoA isomerase activity (Fig. 2 B). When the suspected 3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA was treated with a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria or a partially purified preparation of dienoyl-CoA isomerase, an absorbance band close to 340 nm appeared, whereas the absorbance at 260 nm declined (Fig. 2 C). The increase in the absorbance at 340 nm agrees with the formation of a 2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA, which was reported to have an absorbance maximum at 337 nm (2Wang H.-Y. Schulz H. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Since 2,4,6-octatrienoyl-CoA was reported to be reduced by NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (2Wang H.-Y. Schulz H. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), this reaction was used to confirm the structure of the suspected 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA (Fig. 2, C, spectrum 5; and D, spectrum 1). As shown in Fig.2 D, the chromophore at 340 nm disappeared in a time-dependent manner when NADPH and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase were added to the buffered solution of 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA. Further evidence for the identity of 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA was obtained by its enzymatic conversion and HPLC analysis of the resultant products. For this purpose, synthetic 5,7-decadienoyl-CoA (Fig.1 A) was converted to 3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA by acyl-CoA oxidase and peroxisomal multifunctional protein I. The resultant two compounds (Fig. 1 B) are assumed to be the 3-cis-isomer (minor peak) and 3-trans-isomer (major peak) of 3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA because both are converted to 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA by a partially purified preparation of dienoyl-CoA isomerase exhibiting trienoyl-CoA isomerase activity (Fig.1 C). The reduction of 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA (Fig.1 D) by NADPH in the presence of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase from Escherichia coli yielded a single product that was eluted at the same position as was the starting material (Fig. 1, compare D and E). However, the addition of crotonase to the reaction product, presumed to be 2,6-decadienoyl-CoA because the E. coli reductase catalyzes the reduction of the 4,5-double bond, produced a more polar compound, most likely 3-hydroxydec-6-enoyl-CoA (Fig. 1 F). In contrast, the addition of crotonase to 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA (Fig. 1 D) did not produce a product of different polarity. This experiment supports the assigned structures of 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA (Fig.1 D) and 2,6-decadienoyl-CoA (Fig. 1 E) because 2-enoyl-CoA compounds are hydrated to a significant extent only when the 2-double bond is in conjugation with the thioester group, but not when it is part of a more extended chromophore (18Yang S.-Y. Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15390-15395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although 5,7-decadienoyl-CoA can be converted enzymatically to 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA and further degraded after the NADPH-dependent reduction of the latter intermediate, the operation of this pathway in mitochondria had not been demonstrated. Toward this end, the metabolism of 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA by a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria was investigated. Rates of the direct β-oxidation of 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA in the presence of CoASH and NAD+ were determined by measuring fluorometrically the formation of NADH (Fig. 3, curve A). The rates so obtained were compared with rates of 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA formation determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm in the absence of cofactors, but in the presence of excess trienoyl-CoA isomerase (Fig. 3, curve B). Under these conditions, the rate of the 2,5,7-trienoyl-CoA to 3,5,7-trienoyl-CoA isomerization is measured. Since this isomerization is, for all practical purposes, irreversible, it determines the fraction of 2,5,7-trienoyl-CoA that will be metabolized by way of the trienoyl-CoA isomerase-dependent pathway. The direct β-oxidation was found to be the favored pathway (Fig. 3). However, the degradation of 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA via 2,4,6-decatrienoyl-CoA was found to make a significant contribution to the total metabolism of 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA, accounting for almost 50% of the total flux at low and high substrate concentrations. The identification of trienoyl-CoA isomerase prompted its further characterization and purification. Since a partially purified preparation of dienoyl-CoA isomerase exhibited trienoyl-CoA isomerase activity, the relationship between these two enzyme activities was evaluated by an immunoprecipitation experiment. As is apparent from Fig. 4, the trienoyl-CoA isomerase activity was precipitated by antibodies raised against dienoyl-CoA isomerase. The two immunoprecipitation curves were close enough to suspect that the two enzymes might be associated with the same protein. The relationship between trienoyl-CoA and dienoyl-CoA isomerases was further investigated by studying their behaviors during purification. The enzymes were purified from pig heart to minimize a possible interference by peroxisomal forms of these enzymes. The results of this purification effort, summarized in TableII, demonstrate the co-purification of the two enzymes. The activities of trienoyl-CoA and dienoyl-CoA isomerases remained inseparable throughout the procedure even though the dienoyl-CoA isomerase/trienoyl-CoA isomerase ratio changed from 35:1 to 143:1. The result of the last purification step, the elution of the purified enzyme from a reactive red 120 column, is shown in Fig.5 A. The elution of trienoyl-CoA isomerase from this column coincided with the appearance of dienoyl-CoA isomerase and was proportional to the amount of protein present in each fraction. Moreover, an analysis of individual column fractions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of only one band (Fig. 5 B) that corresponded to a protein with a molecular mass close to 32 kDa, which is the mass reported for dienoyl-CoA isomerase.Table IIPurification of dienoyl-CoA and trienoyl-CoA isomerases from pig heartStepTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityActivity ratio DI/TIDIaDI, dienoyl-CoA isomerase; TI, trienoyl-CoA isomerase; PEG, polyethylene glycol.TIDITIunitsmgunits/mgSoluble extract7602211,3400.0670.00234.5PEG precipitation7742027800.2780.00738.7Q-Sepharose590112072.850.05353.6Hydroxylapatite3636.8864.220.07953.4Chromatofocusing1742.115.611.10.13482.8Sepharose CL-6B/reactive red 120560.390.58960.67143a DI, dienoyl-CoA isomerase; TI, trienoyl-CoA isomerase; PEG, polyethylene glycol. Open table in a new tab The observation that the CoA derivatives of fatty acids with two conjugated double bonds at odd-numbered positions, e.g.9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoyl-CoA (Fig.6, compound I), sustain mitochondrial respiration demonstrated their degradation by mitochondrial β-oxidation. Chain shortening of such unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs by β-oxidation is expected to produce 5,7-dienoyl-CoA intermediates (Fig. 6, compound II). Based on evidence obtained with monounsaturated fatty acids that have a double bond at an odd-numbered position (11Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the degradation of 5,7-dienoyl-CoA is predicted to proceed by two different routes. Common to both of them would be the dehydrogenation of 5,7-dienoyl-CoA to 2,5,7-trienoyl-CoA (Fig. 6, compound III) catalyzed by one of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. If 2,5,7-trienoyl-CoA completes the cycle of β-oxidation, the resultant product would be 3,5-dienoyl-CoA. The further metabolism of such intermediates has been shown to require the sequential actions of dienoyl-CoA isomerase, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, and enoyl-CoA isomerase to produce 2-trans-enoyl-CoA, which can reenter the β-oxidation spiral (11Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). If, however, enoyl-CoA isomerase catalyzes the isomerization of the double bond from the 2,3-position to the 3,4-position, 3,5,7-trienoyl-CoA (Fig. 6,compound IV) would be formed. This isomerization would be irreversible for all practical purposes, as is the isomerization of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA (13Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The evidence presented in this report indicates that a significant fraction of the 2,5,7-trienoyl-CoA is converted to the 3,5,7-isomer even though the major portion of 2,5,7-trienoyl-CoA completes the cycle of β-oxidation and thereby bypasses the formation of a trienoyl-CoA intermediate. The further metabolism of 3,5,7-trienoyl-CoA was hitherto unknown. The identification of trienoyl-CoA isomerase suggested a pathway for the complete degradation of 3,5,7-trienoyl-CoAs. Isomerization of 3,5,7-trienoyl-CoA by trienoyl-CoA isomerase yields 2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA, presumably in the all-trans-configuration, as established for the formation of 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA from 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA (Fig. 6, compound V). In liver mitochondria, 2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA can be reduced to 3,6-dienoyl-CoA by NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (2Wang H.-Y. Schulz H. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The complete degradation of the latter intermediate would proceed by well established reactions that require the actions of enoyl-CoA isomerase to shift the odd-numbered double bond from carbon 3 to 2 and of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase to reductively remove the even-numbered double bond. The co-purification of trienoyl-CoA and dienoyl-CoA isomerases as well as the co-immunoprecipitation of these two enzyme activities by antibodies raised against dienoyl-CoA isomerase strongly suggested that both enzymes reside on one protein. The demonstration that one protein, as indicated by a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, exhibited both trienoyl-CoA and dienoyl-CoA isomerase activities confirmed the conclusion about the association of both enzyme activities with one protein. Dienoyl-CoA isomerase was first isolated from rat liver mitochondria and reported to have a subunit molecular mass of 32 kDa (10Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, peroxisomes were shown to contain a form of this enzyme that cross-reacted with antibodies raised against the mitochondrial enzyme (19He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The molecular cloning of dienoyl-CoA isomerase yielded a cDNA sequence that strongly suggested peroxisomal as well as mitochondrial localizations of this enzyme (20Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D. FitzPatrick D.R Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Evidence in support of the dual subcellular localization of this protein was obtained by immunoelectron microscopy. However, the precise terminal sequences of the mature forms of dienoyl-CoA isomerase detected in mitochondria and peroxisomes have not been reported. Since the published cDNA sequence encodes a 36-kDa polypeptide, molecular masses >36 kDa reported for this enzyme (19He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Chen L.-S. Jin S.-J. Tserng K.-Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10527-10534Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) must be those of other polypeptides. Finally, expression of a fragment of the cDNA coding for dienoyl-CoA isomerase yielded an active protein that was crystallized and analyzed by x-ray diffraction (22Modis Y. Filppula S.A Novikov D.K. Norledge B. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. Structure. 1998; 6: 957-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The crystal structure revealed an active-site pocket that is hydrophobic except for the side chains of three acidic residues. Two of these residues, Glu-196 and Asp-204, were proposed to facilitate the proton removal from carbon 2 and the proton addition to carbon 6, respectively, of the substrate, 3,5-dienoyl-CoA. If 3,5,7-trienoyl-CoA binds to the same active site, the proton abstraction from carbon 2 could also be facilitated by Glu-196. However, the residue involved in the protonation of carbon 8 remains to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W2028512534,"Abstract The ADP binding site within two types of bovine brain glutamate dehydrogenase isoproteins (GDH I and GDH II) was identified using photoaffinity labeling with [α-32P]8-azidoadenosine 5′-diphosphate (8N3ADP). 8N3ADP, without photolysis, mimicked the activatory properties of ADP on GDH I and GDH II activities, although maximal activity with 8N3ADP was about 75% of maximal ADP-stimulated activity. Saturation of photoinsertion with [α-32P]8N3ADP occurred at around 40∼50 μm photoprobe with apparent K d values near 25 and 40 μm for GDH I and GDH II, respectively. Photoinsertion of [α-32P]8N3ADP was decreased best by ADP in comparison with other nucleotides. With the combination of immobilized aluminum affinity chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, photolabel-containing peptides generated by tryptic digestion were isolated. This identified a portion of the adenine ring binding domain of GDH isoproteins as in the region containing the sequence, EMSWIADTYASTIGHYDIN. Photolabeling of the peptide was prevented over 90% by the presence of 1 mm ADP during photolysis, while other nucleotides could not reduce the amount of photoinsertion as effectively as ADP. These results demonstrate selectivity of the photoprobe for the ADP binding site and suggest that the photolabeled peptide with the residues Glu179–Asn197 is within the ADP binding domain of the brain GDH isoproteins."

Although the interaction between CD14 and LPS is a key event in the signaling cascade, the molecular mechanism by which cellular activation occurs remains obscure.

The identification of CD14 as a mediator of LPS-inducible signal transduction was a crucial event in understanding the mechanism by which LPS-induced cellular activation occurs. CD14, a 55-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein present on the surface of phagocytic leukocytes, has been shown to bind LPS and to mediate cellular activation (4Haziot A.A. Chen S.

In addition, a soluble form of CD14 (sCD14) is also capable of binding LPS and activating some CD14-deficient cells, such as endothelial cells (7Arditi M. Zhou J. Dorio R. Rong G.W. Goyert S.M. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp.

For example, because CD14 lacks a transmembrane domain, it is unlikely that CD14 alone is responsible for directly transmitting a signal across the plasma membrane. Many groups have hypothesized that CD14 and LPS must interact, either directly or indirectly, with a second transmembrane receptor, which would be the actual LPS signal transducer (reviewed in Ref. 11Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CD14 could mediate cellular activation via a biophysical mechanism. Wright and colleagues (12Thieblemont N. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2095-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Thieblemont N. Thieringer R. Wright S.D. Immunity. 1998; 8: 771-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) observed that CD14 could move LPS into lipid bilayers that resemble mammalian cell membranes. Furthermore, they observed that trafficking of LPS from the membrane to the Golgi correlated with the ability to induce signaling.The CD11/CD18 (β2) integrins are a second group of LPS receptors (14Wright S.D. Jong M.T.C. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1876-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The observation that CD11/CD18 could enable LPS responsiveness independently of CD14 when expressed on the surface of CHO cells (15Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1473-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Ingalls R.R. Arnaout M.A. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 433-438PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the ability of CD14 to participate in the LPS signaling cascade was not unique. We hypothesized that the common function shared by these two LPS receptors was their ability to bind LPS and bring it in close proximity to the plasma membrane, where it could then interact with a signal transducer. To further investigate the role of LPS binding in cellular signaling, we decided to exploit the activity of two other proteins known to bind LPS, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI).LBP and BPI are members of the lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide binding gene family, which includes cholesteryl ester transfer protein and phospholipid transfer protein (reviewed in Ref. 17Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). LBP and BPI share approximately 45% homology at the amino acid level and are encoded in the same region of human chromosome 20, suggesting that they arose by gene duplication (18Gray P.W. Flaggs G.

LBP, a soluble protein secreted by hepatocytes into the blood stream, accelerates the binding of LPS monomers to CD14 (20Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 21Wurfel M.M. Wright S.D. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1995; 392: 287-295PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it enhances the sensitivity of cells to LPS, and may be important in the host recognition of and response to Gram-negative bacteria (11Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). In contrast, BPI, which is found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, is bactericidal toward Gram-negative bacteria, and inhibits the biologic activity of LPS (22Elsbach P. Weiss J. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Elsbach P. Weiss J. Doerfler M. Shu C. Kohn F. Ammons W.S. Kung A.H. Meszaros K.K. Parent J.B. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 388: 41-51PubMed Google Scholar).To test the hypothesis that cellular binding alone of LPS would be sufficient to initiate cellular signaling, we constructed chimeric proteins consisting of LBP or BPI attached to the GPI anchor of decay accelerating factor (DAF) (24Medof M.E. Walter E.I. Roberts W.L. Haas R. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6740-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Nicholson-Weller A. March J.P. Rosen C.E. Spicer D.B. Austen K.F. Blood. 1985; 65: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of these constructs would thus create an artificial LPS receptor on the surface of the transfected cell. We found that CHO-K1 fibroblasts expressing GPI-anchored LBP or BPI could bind both LPS and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, they could initiate the LPS signaling cascade in a CD14-independent manner, similar to CD11/CD18-transfected cell lines. We conclude from this that the ability of an LPS binding protein to focus LPS on the surface membrane of a cell, where it can interact with a second receptor, is sufficient to activate the specific LPS-signaling apparatus.DISCUSSIONThe current understanding of LPS signaling consists of LPS binding to either membrane or soluble CD14 followed by cellular activation. The mechanism by which this occurs, at least at the molecular level, is still unclear. The central role of CD14 in the process is supported, in part, by the observation that CD14-deficient mice are highly resistant to the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS and Gram-negative bacteria (46Haziot A. Ferrero E. Kontgen F. Hijiya N. Yamamoto S. Silver J. Stewart C.L. Goyert S.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). However, although CD14 is clearly an important LPS binding protein that participates in the initiation of LPS signaling events, one could argue that it is not truly an LPS receptor in the sense that it does not directly activate the signaling cascade. Furthermore, this ability to participate in LPS signaling events is not a characteristic that is unique to CD14. In fact, we have shown that other known surface LPS binding proteins, specifically the CD11/CD18 (β2) integrins, are also sufficient for imparting LPS responsiveness when overexpressed in CHO-K1 cells (15Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1473-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Ingalls R.R. Arnaout M.A. Golenbock D.T. J.

Res. 1997; 73: 85-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).As soluble LPS-binding proteins, LBP and BPI have never been shown to enable LPS signaling in the absence of CD14. In fact, BPI has been shown to inhibit LPS activity (22Elsbach P. Weiss J. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Elsbach P. Weiss J. Doerfler M. Shu C. Kohn F. Ammons W.S. Kung A.H. Meszaros K.K. Parent J.B. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 388: 41-51PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of a soluble LPS-binding protein to participate in cell activation appears to be unique to soluble CD14. In contrast, our data demonstrates that LBP and BPI, when expressed on the surface of a CHO cell, can enable cellular activation in a manner similar to that of membrane CD14. One possible interpretation of the data is that high expression of LBP on the surface of the CHO cell enhanced signaling by efficiently transferring LPS to any contaminating soluble CD14 in our system. However, this interpretation would not explain the signaling observed in the CHO/BPI line, because BPI does not possess the same LPS-transferase activity as that of LBP (48Abrahamson S.L. Wu H.M. Williams R.E. Der K. Ottah N. Little R. Gazzano-Santoro H. Theofan G. Bauer R. Leigh S. Orme A. Horwitz A.H. Carroll S.F. Dedrick R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Both LBP and BPI share the ability to bind LPS with high affinity, and we believe that it is their ability to bind LPS and bring it in close proximity to the cell surface that enables them to mediate activation of the LPS signaling cascade. We believe that LPS is activating the CHO/LBP and CHO/BPI lines in the same manner as CHO/CD14. This is supported by the ability of the specific LPS antagonist B1287 to block signaling events. However, there appears to be at least one unique aspect of CD14-mediated signaling, at least in the transfected CHO lines—the time course of cellular activation. Unlike LBP, BPI, and CD11/CD18, CD14 is the only LPS-binding protein that turns off the signal for NF-κB translocation after 1 h; the other three lines all consistently have been shown to sustain the signal for more than 3 h. In addition, CHO cells co-transfected with both CD14 and CD11/CD18 show a time course consistent with activation via both receptors with a rapid peak and a sustained activation for up to 5 h. 2R. R. Ingalls and D. T. Golenbock, unpublished observation. Thus, expression of these surface LPS binding proteins in our system has not entirely duplicated CD14-initiated signaling. It is possible that the signaling events initiated by CD14 diverge from those of the other LPS receptors at some point on the way to NF-κB translocation. In fact, this ability of CD14 to down-regulate its own signal may hold physiologic relevance.These data are consistent with our current model of LPS signaling in which CD14 binds LPS and brings it in close proximity to the cell membrane where it can then interact with a transmembrane receptor. This second protein would be the actual LPS signal transducer/receptor. Alternate models of LPS signaling, whereby LPS uptake or intercalation into the membrane is an integral part of the downstream signaling events, are supported less well. Although LBP and CD14 can transport LPS into phospholipid bilayers (49Wurfel M.M. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3925-3934PubMed Google Scholar), neither BPI nor the CD11/CD18 integrins are known to have such activity. The important observation appears to be that any protein that can bind LPS and concentrate it on the cell membrane is capable of activating the LPS-specific signaling pathway. These LPS-binding proteins thus enhance sensitivity to endotoxin, but lack the specificity usually observed with true signal transducing receptors.Recently two Toll-like receptors, TLR-2 and TLR-4, have been implicated in LPS signaling (50Yang R.-B.

Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), and it is possible that one of the TLRs receive endotoxin from these natural and engineered surface receptors. However, any conclusions about the relevance of the TLRs in LPS signaling will have to account for the properties of the anchored LPS-binding proteins, as well as the species-specific effects of the LPS inhibitors. The ability of GPI-anchored LBP and BPI to enhance signaling in response to LPS exposure underscores the complex interactions between the multiple receptors involved in LPS recognition and cellular activation. Endotoxic shock is an acute septic syndrome caused by the overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators during a bloodstream infection with Gram-negative bacteria. The pathogenesis of the shock is presumed to be secondary to excessive stimulation of host cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; LBP, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; BPI, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein; DAF, decay accelerating factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCS, fetal calf serum; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; BODIPY, boron dipyrromethane; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorter; TLR, Toll-like receptor; RSLA, Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; LBP, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; BPI, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein; DAF, decay accelerating factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCS, fetal calf serum; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; BODIPY, boron dipyrromethane; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorter; TLR, Toll-like receptor; RSLA, Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A endotoxin), leading to the synthesis and release of cytokines, arachidonic acid metabolites, and various other mediators (1Raetz C.R.H.

The identification of CD14 as a mediator of LPS-inducible signal transduction was a crucial event in understanding the mechanism by which LPS-induced cellular activation occurs. CD14, a 55-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein present on the surface of phagocytic leukocytes, has been shown to bind LPS and to mediate cellular activation (4Haziot A.A. Chen S. Ferrero E. Low M.G. Silber R. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 547-552PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). In addition, a soluble form of CD14 (sCD14) is also capable of binding LPS and activating some CD14-deficient cells, such as endothelial cells (7Arditi M. Zhou J. Dorio R. Rong G.W. Goyert S.M. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp.

Although it is generally agreed that the interaction between lipid A and CD14 is central to cellular activation by LPS, details of the downstream events, which follow, remain obscure. For example, because CD14 lacks a transmembrane domain, it is unlikely that CD14 alone is responsible for directly transmitting a signal across the plasma membrane. Many groups have hypothesized that CD14 and LPS must interact, either directly or indirectly, with a second transmembrane receptor, which would be the actual LPS signal transducer (reviewed in Ref. 11Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CD14 could mediate cellular activation via a biophysical mechanism. Wright and colleagues (12Thieblemont N. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2095-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Thieblemont N. Thieringer R. Wright S.D. Immunity. 1998; 8: 771-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) observed that CD14 could move LPS into lipid bilayers that resemble mammalian cell membranes. Furthermore, they observed that trafficking of LPS from the membrane to the Golgi correlated with the ability to induce signaling. The CD11/CD18 (β2) integrins are a second group of LPS receptors (14Wright S.D. Jong M.T.C. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1876-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The observation that CD11/CD18 could enable LPS responsiveness independently of CD14 when expressed on the surface of CHO cells (15Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1473-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Ingalls R.R. Arnaout M.A. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 433-438PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the ability of CD14 to participate in the LPS signaling cascade was not unique. We hypothesized that the common function shared by these two LPS receptors was their ability to bind LPS and bring it in close proximity to the plasma membrane, where it could then interact with a signal transducer. To further investigate the role of LPS binding in cellular signaling, we decided to exploit the activity of two other proteins known to bind LPS, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI). LBP and BPI are members of the lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide binding gene family, which includes cholesteryl ester transfer protein and phospholipid transfer protein (reviewed in Ref. 17Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). LBP and BPI share approximately 45% homology at the amino acid level and are encoded in the same region of human chromosome 20, suggesting that they arose by gene duplication (18Gray P.W. Flaggs G.

LBP, a soluble protein secreted by hepatocytes into the blood stream, accelerates the binding of LPS monomers to CD14 (20Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M.

Thus, it enhances the sensitivity of cells to LPS, and may be important in the host recognition of and response to Gram-negative bacteria (11Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). In contrast, BPI, which is found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, is bactericidal toward Gram-negative bacteria, and inhibits the biologic activity of LPS (22Elsbach P. Weiss J.

However, this interpretation would not explain the signaling observed in the CHO/BPI line, because BPI does not possess the same LPS-transferase activity as that of LBP (48Abrahamson S.L. Wu H.M. Williams R.E. Der K. Ottah N. Little R. Gazzano-Santoro H. Theofan G. Bauer R. Leigh S. Orme A. Horwitz A.H. Carroll S.F. Dedrick R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both LBP and BPI share the ability to bind LPS with high affinity, and we believe that it is their ability to bind LPS and bring it in close proximity to the cell surface that enables them to mediate activation of the LPS signaling cascade. We believe that LPS is activating the CHO/LBP and CHO/BPI lines in the same manner as CHO/CD14. This is supported by the ability of the specific LPS antagonist B1287 to block signaling events. However, there appears to be at least one unique aspect of CD14-mediated signaling, at least in the transfected CHO lines—the time course of cellular activation. Unlike LBP, BPI, and CD11/CD18, CD14 is the only LPS-binding protein that turns off the signal for NF-κB translocation after 1 h; the other three lines all consistently have been shown to sustain the signal for more than 3 h. In addition, CHO cells co-transfected with both CD14 and CD11/CD18 show a time course consistent with activation via both receptors with a rapid peak and a sustained activation for up to 5 h. 2R. R. Ingalls and D. T. Golenbock, unpublished observation. Thus, expression of these surface LPS binding proteins in our system has not entirely duplicated CD14-initiated signaling. It is possible that the signaling events initiated by CD14 diverge from those of the other LPS receptors at some point on the way to NF-κB translocation. In fact, this ability of CD14 to down-regulate its own signal may hold physiologic relevance. These data are consistent with our current model of LPS signaling in which CD14 binds LPS and brings it in close proximity to the cell membrane where it can then interact with a transmembrane receptor. This second protein would be the actual LPS signal transducer/receptor. Alternate models of LPS signaling, whereby LPS uptake or intercalation into the membrane is an integral part of the downstream signaling events, are supported less well. Although LBP and CD14 can transport LPS into phospholipid bilayers (49Wurfel M.M. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3925-3934PubMed Google Scholar), neither BPI nor the CD11/CD18 integrins are known to have such activity. The important observation appears to be that any protein that can bind LPS and concentrate it on the cell membrane is capable of activating the LPS-specific signaling pathway. These LPS-binding proteins thus enhance sensitivity to endotoxin, but lack the specificity usually observed with true signal transducing receptors. Recently two Toll-like receptors, TLR-2 and TLR-4, have been implicated in LPS signaling (50Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J.

Ayres T.M. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), and it is possible that one of the TLRs receive endotoxin from these natural and engineered surface receptors. However, any conclusions about the relevance of the TLRs in LPS signaling will have to account for the properties of the anchored LPS-binding proteins, as well as the species-specific effects of the LPS inhibitors. The ability of GPI-anchored LBP and BPI to enhance signaling in response to LPS exposure underscores the complex interactions between the multiple receptors involved in LPS recognition and cellular activation.

Our results show that neonatal and adult LMMs associate preferentially, although not exclusively, as homodimeric coiled-coils. Using chimeric LMM constructs combining neonatal and adult sequences, we observed that a stretch of 183 amino acids of sequence identity at the N terminus of the LMM was sufficient to allow the adult LMM to dimerize in a non-selective manner. In contrast, sequence identity in the remaining C-terminal 465 amino acids had only a modest effect on the dimerization selectivity of the adult isoform. Sequence identity at the N terminus also promoted dimerization of the neonatal LMM to a greater degree than sequence identity at the C terminus. However, the N terminus had only a partial effect on the dimerization specificity of the neonatal sequence, and residues distributed throughout the LMM were capable of affecting dimerization selectivity of this isoform. These results indicated that dimerization preference of the neonatal and adult isoforms was affected to a different extent by sequence identity at a given region of the LMM.

The two heavy chains (MyHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MyHC, myosin heavy chain; Ad, adult LMM; CD, circular dichroism; DTT, dithiothreitol; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; HAd, his-tagged adult LMM; HNeo, his-tagged neonatal LMM; LMM, light meromyosin; NaPPi, sodium pyrophosphate; NDE, nondenaturing electrophoresis; Neo, neonatal LMM; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a myosin molecule dimerize through their C-terminal 1098 amino acids, forming an α-helical coiled-coil structure known as myosin rod. In all vertebrates, sarcomeric MyHCs are represented by multiple isoforms that are differentially expressed at various developmental stages and in different muscle fiber types (1Bandman E. Int. Rev.

Frequently, several MyHC isoforms are expressed in a single muscle cell (3Gauthier G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Taylor L.D. Bandman E. J.

Dyn. 1997; 208: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that at stages when either embryonic and neonatal isoforms or neonatal and adult isoforms are being simultaneously expressed in the same muscle fiber, chicken myosin molecules are found as dimers of identical MyHC isoforms (11Lowey S. Waller G.S. Bandman E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Kerwin B. Bandman E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments, using proteolytic rod fragments, showed that under conditions where isoform exchange was induced by denaturation of the coiled-coil, chicken myosin rods folded back into homodimers, indicating that the amino acid differences in the rod domain of these isoforms were sufficient to code for their dimerization selectivity (12Kerwin B. Bandman E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the rod follows the seven-amino acid repeat (abcdefg)n characteristic of α-helical coiled-coil proteins, in which positions a and d are mostly occupied by hydrophobic residues and charged residues are often found at positions e and g (13Conway J.F.

A large body of experimental evidence implicates charged amino acids at g and e positions in the regulation of dimerization specificity of Fos and Jun and other leucine zippers (21John M.

Besides interhelical ionic interactions between g and e′ residues, general unfavorable electrostatic effects in the dimer interface have been suggested to modulate preferential heterodimerization of coiled-coil proteins (24O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 699-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Rashid D.J. Wedaman K.P. Scholey J.M. J. Mol.

Biol. 1995; 254: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if these interhelical electrostatic interactions control the association of peptide sequences that preferentially form homodimeric coiled-coils (31Pu W.T. Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4348-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive work on dimerization specificity of leucine zippers and model coiled-coils, little is known about the molecular mechanism that controls myosin dimerization specificity. The ability of two isoforms to form heterodimeric myosin molecules has been correlated with sequence conservation; therefore, it has been suggested that sequence homology controls dimerization specificity (11Lowey S. Waller G.S. Bandman E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid sequences of chicken myosins are highly conserved (>95% identical) (32Moore L.A. Tidyman W.E. Arrizubieta M.J. Bandman E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and yet they do not form stable heterodimeric coiled-coils. To investigate the sequence elements that determine the preference of chicken myosin isoforms to associate as homodimers, we have analyzed the dimerization of the chicken LMM domain, a rod fragment encompassing the C-terminal 650 amino acids of the MyHC. Recombinant LMM constructs were expressed with or without a polyhistidine tag at the N terminus, and their ability to dimerize was analyzed by metal chelation chromatography. Homo- and heterodimers between histidine-tagged and untagged LMM constructs could be fractionated based on the different affinity exhibited by LMM dimers containing zero, one or two histidine-tagged strands for binding to the Ni-NTA resin. Our results showed that denatured neonatal and adult LMMs could refold into heterodimeric coiled-coils although they preferentially associated as homodimeric molecules. The contribution of the amino acid differences present in the LMM region of these isoforms to dimerization selectivity was studied by construction of chimeric proteins combining neonatal and adult sequences. Our results indicated that, although sequence homology indeed stabilized the dimer, not all amino acid differences had an equivalent effect on heterodimer stability. Sequence identity at the N terminus of the LMM had a greater effect on dimer stability than sequence identity at the C terminus. In addition, our experiments indicated that dimerization selectivity of the neonatal and adult isoforms was affected differently by sequence identity at a given region of the LMM. Recombinant LMMs were expressed using the T7 RNA polymerase-based (33Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) ampicillin-resistant pET expression vectors (Novagen, Madison, WI). cDNA clones encoding the rod sequences of chicken neonatal and adult MyHC isoforms have been previously characterized (9Moore L.A. Arrizubieta M.J.W.E.T. Herman L. Bandman E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cDNA clone E1 (9Moore L.A. Arrizubieta M.J.W.E.T. Herman L. Bandman E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was digested with SspI, DraI, and EcoRI restriction enzymes, and the SspI-EcoRI 2-kilobase pair fragment coding for the neonatal LMM sequence subcloned into pBluescript vector (digested with SmaI and EcoRI) resulting in the LNbs clone. The 2-kilobase pairBamHI-EcoRI fragment of LNbs clone was ligated into the pET-5c expression vector (Novagen). The resulting clone, termed pET-5cNeoLMM, encoded the 648 C-terminal amino acids of the chicken neonatal LMM and at its N terminus contained 15 amino acids (MASMTGGNNMGRIPH) translated from vector sequences. An analogous strategy was used to subclone the adult LMM from clone AA-4 (9Moore L.A. Arrizubieta M.J.W.E.T. Herman L. Bandman E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) resulting in the clone pET-5cAdultLMM. These clones were used to express neonatal (Neo) and adult (Ad) LMM constructs. The 2-kilobase pairBamHI-EcoRI insert of either pET-5cNeoLMM or pET-5cAdultLMM, coding for the LMM sequence of the neonatal or adult MyHC isoforms, respectively, was subcloned into the pET-15b vector (Novagen). Polymerase chain reaction was used to delete one nucleotide at the 5′ end of the insert in order to correct the reading frame of the insert. The sequence of the forward primer containing the deletion was: 5′-GCTCGAGGATCCCCATTCACGCCAG-3′. The reverse primer within the LMM sequence was: 5′- AGGTCCTCCACCTCATTCTG -3′. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified region was subcloned as aBamHI-StuI fragment into the parental vector, replacing the corresponding wild type BamHI-StuI fragment. The resulting clones were termed pET-15b-NeoLMM-StuI and pET-15b-AdultLMM-StuI, and were used to express histidine-tagged neonatal (HNeo) and histidine-tagged adult (HAd) LMMs, respectively. DNA sequencing confirmed the reading frame change and the absence of additional mutations. The N-terminal 25 amino acids of the fusion proteins (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLGDPH) expressed from these constructs were encoded by vector sequences and included a hexahistidine tag flanked by a thrombin proteolytic site. Chimeric LMM proteins A386, A278, and A183 were constructed by substituting 386, 278, or 183 amino acids at the N terminus of the neonatal LMM with the corresponding adult sequences. Plasmids pET5c-NeoLMM and pET5c-AdultLMM were digested withBamHI and either NcoI, SstI, orStuI restriction enzymes. BamH-NcoI (1158 base pairs), BamHI-SstI (834 base pairs), and BamHI-StuI (549 base pairs) fragments of the adult LMM sequence were ligated to the double-digested pET-5c-NeoLMM plasmid to substitute the corresponding neonatalBamH-NcoI, BamHI-SstI, orBamHI-StuI fragments. An analogous strategy was used to produce construct N183. N386 was constructed by replacing theStuI-EcoRI fragment at the 3′ end of the neonatal sequence in pET5c-NeoLMM with the corresponding adult sequence. The correct clones were identified by their restriction digestion patterns. BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells (33Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) transformed with recombinant pET plasmids were cultured according to manufacturer's directions (Novagen). The bacterial cultures were harvested 3 h after induction, centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 10 min in a GSA rotor, and the pellet stored at −80 °C. The frozen bacterial pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm KCl, 2 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8), 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 1/40 of the volume of the bacterial culture, and sonicated on ice to decrease viscosity. The LMM proteins were purified according to the method previously described to purify myosin from chicken muscle (34Bandman E. Matsuda R. Strohman R.C. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and further purified by gel permeation chromatography under denaturing conditions. The LMM preparations were denatured by dialysis against 4m (or 6 m) GdmCl, 40 mmNaPPi, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, centrifuged (14,000 × g, 15 min., 4 °C), and the supernatant loaded onto a Bio-Gel A-15m (Bio-Rad) column (2 × 50 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with the equilibration buffer at 10 ml/h at room temperature. The fractions with the highest degree of homogeneity were pooled, renatured, and stored at −20 °C in 80 mm NaPPi, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, 50% glycerol. LMM constructs containing a polyhistidine tag at the N terminus were purified by Ni-NTA chromatography under denaturing conditions. The procedure was similar to the one described below for Ni-NTA column except that 4 m GdmCl was added to all the buffers and that after washing with 10 mm imidazole buffer, the column was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel permeation chromatography under denaturing conditions. Concentration of protein preparations was estimated by scanning densitometry (Pharmacia LKB, Bromma, Sweden) of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Increasing amounts of the protein preparations were loaded, and the slope obtained for each protein preparation was compared with the slope of a standard LMM preparation of know concentration. The concentration of the standard had been estimated by lyophilization of the protein and resuspension to a known concentration. Circular dichroism measurements were carried out on a Jasco-700 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) at 25 °C, under nitrogen flush, in a 0.1-cm cell, with protein concentration of 0.1–0.4 mg/ml. The instrument was calibrated with ammonium d(+)-10-camphor sulfonate at 290.5 nm. CD spectra were the average of five scans obtained by collecting data at 10 nm/min, with a time constant of 2 min. The mean residue molar ellipticity ([θ], degrees cm2 dmol−1) was calculated as described by Zhou et al. (35Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 500-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Denaturation curves of the recombinant LMMs were obtained at 25 °C by following the decrease in ellipticity at 222 nm in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdmCl as described by Pace et al. (36Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). The molarity of the GdmCl solutions was determined by refractive index measurements as described by Nozaki (37Nozaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Parameters of the unfolding reaction were calculated as described by Pace et al.(36Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed as described by Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis was carried out on 1.5-mm slab gels according to the method of Waller and Lowey (39Waller G.S. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of two proteins in 40 mm NaPPi buffer (1–1.5 mg of total protein), only one of which contained a polyhistidine tag, were mixed and denatured by addition of denaturation buffer (8 mGdmCl, 40 mm NaPPi, pH 7.5, 10 mmDTT) to a final 5 m GdmCl concentration. Protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml and, after incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the preparation was renatured by dialysis in 40 mm NaPPi, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT for 4 h at 4 °C. The renatured samples were dialyzed overnight against Ni-NTA loading buffer (10 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 0.4 m GdmCl, pH 7.8, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10,000 ×g for 30 min. at 4 °C), the sample was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column. The renatured sample equilibrated in the Ni-NTA loading buffer was loaded onto 0.8 ml of packed Ni-NTA resin. All exchange experiments were carried out with Ni-NTA resin (Quiagen, lot nos. R9419 and RA97008). The column was run in a continuous flow mode at 10 ml/h. The loading buffer was 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.4 mGdmCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.8. The column was washed with 12 column volumes of loading buffer and eluted with 18 column volumes of 50 mm imidazole buffer (50 mmimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.4 m GdmCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.8), followed by 12 volumes of 1 m imidazole buffer (1 m imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 0.4 m GdmCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.8). Protein containing fractions were detected by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots corresponding to 1/10 of the volume of each of the three protein peaks eluted from the resin were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (40Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 191-223Google Scholar). 20 μl of a β-galactosidase solution (0.32 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) was added to each of the three fractions (10 mm, 50 mm, and 1 m imidazole) prior to precipitation. Increasing amounts of each precipitated fraction were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel and the β-galactosidase and LMM protein bands analyzed by densitometry. The slope of the plot of the LMM absorbanceversus loaded volume for each one of the three fractions (10 mm, 50 mm, 1 m imidazole) was standardized to the slope obtained for the β-galactosidase of the corresponding fraction. The amount of heterodimers formed in each exchange experiments was estimated either as the percentage of recovered protein eluting in the 50 mm imidazole fraction or, alternatively, as the percentage of loaded protein eluting in the 50 mm imidazole fraction. In those exchange experiments in which the two methods were used, the values obtained were very similar (±6%). Recombinant LMM sequences encompassing the C-terminal 648 amino acids of the chicken fast neonatal and adult isoforms were expressed either with or without a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus (Fig. 1), and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig.2 A shows samples of these preparations analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were estimated to be >95% homogeneous by scanning densitometry.Figure 2Electrophoretic mobility of LMM constructs.

The mobility of the recombinant LMMs on NDE gels was intermediate between that of the rod and the LMM fragments obtained by chymotryptic digestion of native myosin molecules (Fig. 2 B). This was expected for dimers of these constructs since their M r was higher than that of LMM fragments obtained by proteolysis (Fig. 2 A). The CD spectra of the recombinant LMM preparations presented a double minima at 222 and 208 nm as well as a maximum close to 190 nm. The high molar ellipticity value at 222 nm indicated that the protein was predominantly α-helical (Fig.3 A). The molar ellipticity ratio was greater than 1 ([θ]222/[θ]208= 1.044), which has been described to be characteristic of α-helical coiled-coils (18Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the dimerization experiments described in this report, strand exchange between LMM constructs was promoted by denaturant-mediated unfolding of the coiled-coil followed by refolding upon removal of the denaturing agent. As shown in Fig. 3 B, GdmCl concentrations below 1 m had no effect on the folding state of the LMM, whereas the unfolding was practically complete above 2 mGdmCl. The transition midpoint was at about 1.5 m GdmCl ([GdmCl]½) (TableI). The conformational stability of the LMM constructs in the absence of denaturant (Table I) was estimated assuming a two-state transition, as described by Pace et al.(36Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). No significant differences were found in the denaturation of the Neo, Ad, and HNeo LMM constructs.Table ISummary of denaturation experiments of recombinant LMMsLMM construct[GdmHCl]1/2ΔG H2Omkcal/molNeoLMM1.445.789−4.029E+3HisNeoLMM1.50 ± 0.025.950 ± 0.153−3.973E+3 ± 0.148E+3AdultLMM1.50 ± 0.035.806 ± 0.116−3.879E+3 ± 0.178E+3[GdmHCl]1/2 is the midpoint of the unfolding transition,i.e. guanidinium concentration at which 50% of the LMM molecules are unfolded. Since the free energy of unfolding, ΔG u, varies linearly with GdmCl concentration in the limited region where ΔG u can be measured, the conformational stability of the protein in the absence of GdmC (ΔG H2O) was estimated by extrapolation of the regression line defined by the ΔGmeasured at the various [GdmC].

Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). The hexahistidine tag confers upon the LMM constructs the ability to selectively bind to the Ni-NTA resin. In the presence of 10 mm imidazole, untagged LMMs do not bind to the column and elute in the wash fraction. In contrast, histidine-tagged LMMs bind to the column at 10 mm imidazole and elute at 80–100 mm imidazole. This different affinity is shown in Fig. 4 A, where a mixture of HNeo and Ad LMMs was fractionated by the metal chelation column into two protein components. When the histidine-tagged and untagged constructs were denatured together and then renatured prior to loading, three protein peaks were recovered from the column, indicating the presence of a new protein species of intermediate affinity (Fig. 4, B andC). The fact that this new species, eluting in the 50 mm imidazole fraction, was recovered only when strand exchange between tagged and untagged LMMs had been promoted by denaturing and refolding of the coiled-coil structure indicated that it probably corresponded to heterodimers between tagged and untagged constructs containing a single histidine tag per dimer. The Western blot and SDS-PAGE analysis of Ni-NTA column fractions shown in Fig. 4(B and C) indicated that both tagged and untagged LMM constructs were present in the 50 mm imidazole fraction and that the two proteins were in equimolar amounts. The presence of untagged LMMs in a fraction bound to the Ni-NTA column would require association with a histidine-tagged strand. Furthermore, the observation that this fraction was eluted from the resin at lower imidazole concentration than histidine-tagged dimers is consistent with the formation of hybrid molecules, containing one tagged and one untagged strand, during renaturation. In order to analyze dimerization between neonatal and adult LMMs, equimolar amounts of a tagged and an untagged LMM construct were mixed, denatured in guanidinium, and renatured by dialysis. The renatured sample was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column, and the 50 mm imidazole heterodimer fraction was quantitated. In exchange experiments between HNeo and Neo LMMs, the 50 mm fraction represented about 47.4 ± 2.6% of the total protein in the three fractions, close to the 50% value expected for random exchange. In exchange experiments between HNeo and Ad LMMs, the 50 mm fraction represented about 25.4 ± 2.1% of the total protein (Fig. 5). Similarly, in exchange experiments between HAd and Ad LMMs, around 48.3 ± 3.9% of the protein was recovered in the heterodimer fraction, whereas in exchange experiments between HAd and Neo LMMs, the heterodimer represented 28.5 ± 4.1% of the total protein (Fig. 5). Therefore, the heterodimers formed during exchange experiments between different isoforms was about half that of the 50 mmimidazole fraction in exchange experiments between identical LMM sequences. The LMM sequences of the neonatal and adult isoforms differ in 35 amino acids, only 18 of which are at heptad positions a, d, g, and e, which participate in interhelical contacts and thus can have the largest contribution to dimer stability and specificity (41Alber T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 42O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). In order to investigate which of these amino acid differences were relevant to the preferential formation of homo-versus heterodimeric LMMs, three chimeric LMM proteins were constructed that combined neonatal and adult sequences (Fig. 1). The N-terminal 183, 278, and 386 amino acids of the neonatal LMM were substituted with the corresponding adult sequences, resulting in the chimeric LMMs termed A183, A278, and A386, respectively. The three chimeric LMMs were virtually identical to the neonatal and adult recombinant LMMs, as judged by NDE mobility (Fig. 2 B). Their reactivity with isoform-specific mAb reflected that their sequence contained both neonatal and adult epitopes (9Moore L.A. Arrizubieta M.J.W.E.T. Herman L. Bandman E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In exchange experiments between HNeo and the chimeric LMMs, the proportion of eluted protein present in the 50 mm imidazole fraction was 28.9 (± 2.7), 37.1 (± 2.8), 38.4 (± 2.3)%, for chimeric LMMs A386, A278, and A183, respectively (Fig.6). The amino acid sequences of these three chimeric LMMs contained 22, 15, and 11 differences (10, 6, and 4 at a, d, g, and e positions) with respect to the neonatal sequence. In exchange experiments with HAd LMM, the proportion of heterodimers formed was 47.3 (± 2.6), 49.0 (± 3.2), and 49.6 (± 4.1)%, for chimeric constructs A183, A278 and A386, respectively. The amino acid sequences of these three chimeric LMMs contained 24, 20, and 13 differences (14, 12, and 8 at a, d, g, and e positions) with respect to the adult sequence. The differences in amount of heterodimers formed in exchange experiments between HAd and either one of these chimeric LMMs or the Ad LMM were not statistically significant at the 5% level. The fact that replacement of the 183 N-terminal amino acids of the neonatal LMM with the corresponding adult sequence was sufficient to obtain virtually random exchange between chimera A183 and HAd LMM suggested a predominant role of these residues in the determination of the dimerization selectivity. To test if absence of substitutions in the N-terminal 183 amino acids was sufficient to stabilize LMM dimers, we built construct N183 (N-terminal 183 residues corresponded to the neonatal sequence and the remaining 465 C-terminal amino acids to the adult sequence) and tested its ability to form dimers with the HNeo and HAd LMMs. Chimera N183 formed 36.1% heterodimers with HNeo LMM. Although this amount was considerable higher than that obtained in exchange experiments between Ad and HNeo LMMs, it did not represent random dimerization. In exchange experiments with HAd LMM, N183 formed about 28.0% heterodimers, virtually the same values obtained in exchange experiments between HAd and Neo LMMs. Further incrementing the extent of neonatal sequence at the N terminus (chimera N386) resulted in an additional increase in the amount of heterodimers formed between the chimera and HNeo (41.5% heterodimers), without reaching values expected for non-selective dimerization. The present work addressed the problem of which sequence elements control dimerization specificity in the coiled-coil of the chicken myosin rod. We have developed a method using Ni-NTA chromatography that is capable of fractionating coiled-coil dimers according to the number of histidine-tagged strands they contain. Subsequently, we have used this method to study dimerization specificity of chicken neonatal and adult myosin LMM fragments by monitoring dimerization between histidine-tagged and untagged LMM constructs. We showed that, during in vitro refolding of denatured neonatal and adult LMMs, dimerization between sequences of identical isoforms was favored. The 35 amino acid differences between the neonatal and adult LMMs reduced by 50% the extent of strand exchange between histidine-tagged and untagged LMM constructs. It is not likely that the preferential homodimer formation between neonatal and adult LMMs is caused by trapping of folding intermediates at low temperature, as described for α and β tropomyosin isoforms (43Lehrer S.S. Qian Y. Hvidt S. Science. 1989; 246: 926-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), since increasing the temperature of refolding did not favor heterodimer formation (data not shown). In addition, in the case of α and β tropomyosin the relative instability of the ββ homodimers favored the formation of the αβ heterodimer (44Lehrer S.S. Stafford W.F.I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5682-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In our case, no differences in the free energy of dissociation of neonatal and adult LMMs were observed (Table I). In studies on the dimerization specificity of full-length chicken neonatal and adult myosin rods, heterodimers represented less than 5% of the refolded dimers (12Kerwin B. Bandman E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our observation that neonatal and adult myosin LMMs could form up to 28% heterodimers could be explained if amino acid differences outside the LMM region contribute to further destabilization of the heterodimeric myosin rod. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the sensitivity of the two methods used to quantify heterodimers is different. Nevertheless, the neonatal and adult LMMs still exhibit preferential dimerization with the homologous sequence. Exchange experiments conducted between HNeo and chimeric LMMs A386, A278, or A183 indicated that the lower the number of amino acid differences between the two polypeptides, the higher the degree of heterodimerization. These results were consistent with the proposal that sequence homology plays a key role in myosin dimerization specificity (11Lowey S. Waller G.S. Bandman E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, any of these chimeric LMMs was able to dimerize with HAd to virtually the same extent as the adult LMM (Ad), despite all the amino acid differences present. The extent of dimerization between A183 and HAd was especially remarkable, since the sequences of the two constructs differed in 24 positions out of the 35 amino acid differences present between neonatal and adult LMMs. The observation that removing 11 amino acid differences in the N terminus of the molecule remarkably increased the amount of heterodimers formed (compare HAd × A183 versus HAd × Neo), whereas removing 13 amino acid differences from the C terminus had little effect on dimerization (compare HNeo × A386 versusHNeo × Ad), indicated that not all substitutions had the same contribution to destabilization of heterodimers and suggested that the N terminus of the LMM played a crucial role in dimerization selectivity. However, chimeric construct N183, where the N-terminal 183 amino acids corresponded to the neonatal sequence, did not dimerize randomly with HNeo. HNeo formed about the same amount of heterodimers with N183 as with A278. Thus, a stretch of 183 amino acids of identity at the N terminus of the molecule stabilized the heterodimer to the same extent as a stretch of 372 amino acids at the C terminus. These results were also consistent with the idea of sequence identity at the N terminus of he LMM being more relevant to dimer stabilization than sequence identity at the C terminus. The amount of heterodimers formed for each pair of proteins is a function of the difference between the free energy of dissociation of the heterodimer and the half sum of the free energy of dissociation of the two homodimeric species. Since the untagged homodimer species in exchange experiments (HAd × A183) and (HNeo × A183) is the same (Fig. 7), if we assume similar free energy of dissociation for HNeo and HAd dimers (as would be expected based on the data in Table I), then the higher amount of heterodimers formed between HAd and A183 indicated that the HAd-A183 heterodimer is more stable than HNeo-A183 heterodimer, despite the fact that the former pair of constructs differ at 24 positions and the latter pair of constructs only at 11 positions. Similarly, the higher amount of heterodimers obtained in exchange experiments (HNeo × N183)versus (HAd × N183) indicated that the HNeo-N183 dimer is more stable than HAd-N183 dimer, despite the higher number of amino acid differences. Thus, in either case heterodimers between pairs of constructs with no amino acid differences at the N-terminal 183 residues are more stable than heterodimers between constructs with no amino acid differences at the C-terminal 465 residues. The fact that amino acid substitutions in the N- and C terminus affect dimerization selectivity differently indicate that the residues in these regions contribute in a non-uniform manner to dimer stability. Positional effects of amino acid mutations have been noticed both in globular and in α-helical coiled-coil proteins (15Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 18Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in general it is accepted that mutations are less detrimental to protein stability when they occur in regions that are not closely packed in the interior of the native molecule. Similarly, it is possible that the LMM coiled-coil is more flexible at its C terminus with a less closely packed dimer interface than at its N terminus. Examination of the sequence of the N-terminal 183 amino acids and C-terminal 264-amino acid stretch reveals regional differences in the amino acid composition. The proportion of alanine at a and d positions in the C-terminal-264 region (22.2%) is double of that of the whole myosin rod (12.15%, (13Conway J.F. Parry D.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1990; 12: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)), and triple of that of the N-terminal-183 region (7.6%). In addition, the density of potential interhelical salt-bridges (45Arrizubieta M.J. Bandman E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) in the C-terminal-264 region is only half of the density in the N-terminal-183 region. These features could result in a less stable interface at the C-terminal region and underlie the low effect that amino acid differences in this region exert on dimerization specificity. The different effect of the N versus C terminus of the molecule in dimerization selectivity was more marked in exchange experiments with HAd than in experiments with HNeo. The dimerization selectivity of HAd was determined almost exclusively by the N-terminal 183 residues of the LMM. On one hand, HAd dimerized virtually in a non- selective manner with A183, and on the other hand exchange experiments between HAd and construct N183 resulted in as much inhibition of heterodimerization as exchange experiments between HAd and Neo LMM. In contrast, sequence identity at the N terminus had only a partial effect on dimerization selectivity of HNeo LMM. The amount of heterodimers formed between HNeo and N183 was significantly higher than the values obtained in exchange experiments with the heterologous isoform (HNeo × Ad), but did not reach the values obtained in exchange experiments with the homologous isoform (HNeo × Neo). Even 386 amino acids of sequence identity at the N terminus was not able to produce random exchange between HNeo and construct N386, indicating that amino acid differences at the C terminus conferred some destabilization to the HNeo-N386 heterodimer. The different effect of sequence identity at the N terminus on the dimerization selectivity of adult and neonatal sequences might indicate a different contribution of this region to stabilization of the adult and neonatal structures either during folding or in the native state. This difference could underlie the observed preference of these isoforms to associate as homodimeric coiled-coils."
