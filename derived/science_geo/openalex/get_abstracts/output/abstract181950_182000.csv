https://openalex.org/W2133631618,"Extensive research causally links amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) to Alzheimer's disease, although the pathologically relevant Aβ conformation remains unclear. Aβ spontaneously aggregates into the fibrils that deposit in senile plaques. However, recent in vivo and in vitroreports describe a potent biological activity for oligomeric assemblies of Aβ. To consistently prepare in vitro oligomeric and fibrillar forms of Aβ1–42, a detailed knowledge of how solution parameters influence structure is required. This manuscript represents the first study using a single chemically and structurally homogeneous unaggregated starting material to demonstrate that the formation of oligomers, fibrils, and fibrillar aggregates is determined by time, concentration, temperature, pH, ionic strength, and Aβ species. We recently reported that oligomers inhibit neuronal viability 10-fold more than fibrils and ∼40-fold more than unaggregated peptide, with oligomeric Aβ1–42-induced neurotoxicity significant at 10 nm. In addition, we were able to differentiate by structure and neurotoxic activity wild-type Aβ1–42 from isoforms containing familial mutations (Dahlgren, K. N., Manelli, A. M., Stine, W. B., Jr., Baker, L. K., Krafft, G. A., and LaDu, M. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 32046–32053). Understanding the biological role of specific Aβ conformations may define the link between Aβ and Alzheimer's disease, re-focusing therapeutic approaches by identifying the pernicious species of Aβ ultimately responsible for the cognitive dysfunction that defines the disease.

Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β atomic force microscopy 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid distilled H2O N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Amyloid plaques are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD).1Genetic findings over the past decade have further supported the pivotal and likely causal role that amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) plays in the etiology of AD (1Goate A.

This research demonstrates that autosomal dominant mutations affecting the total amount or relative amount of the 42- versus 40-residue form of Aβ are sufficient to cause the disease (for review, see Ref. 5Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2002; 3: 67-99Google Scholar). However, a direct causal relationship between amyloid plaques and cognitive impairment remains unclear (6Cummings B.J.

This apparent disconnect between plaque burden and neuronal dysfunction and loss has also been described in transgenic mouse models of AD (8Irizarry M.C. Soriano F. McNamara M. Page K.J. Schenk D.

Recent theories that reconcile these findings point to small soluble oligomeric or protofibrillar assemblies of Aβ that would likely escape the immunostaining and histopathological staining used to detect both diffuse amyloid deposits and senile plaques (10Klein W.L.

Experimental in vivo and in vitro evidence linking oligomeric assemblies to neurodegeneration is reflected in a recent revision to the amyloid hypothesis of AD (22Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Google Scholar) and other diseases involving amyloidogenic proteins (for review, see Ref. 23Kirkitadze M.D. Bitan G. Teplow D.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 567-577Google Scholar). A complete study of Aβ, either in vivo or in vitro, requires an understanding of the conditions that drive peptide assembly toward one conformational state or another. Any change that affects the conformation of Aβ likely affects its biological activity. In light of genetic and in vivo evidence, we have chosen to specifically focus on the longer, more hydrophobic Aβ1–42 species. We have determined that the critical initial step in the controlled assembly of Aβ1–42 is to remove preexisting structure. Using this chemically and structurally uniform unaggregated starting material, we demonstrate that changes in incubation time, concentration, temperature, ionic strength, and pH result in distinct structural species including soluble oligomers, protofibrils and short fibrils, extended fibrils, and insoluble fibrillar aggregates. We have reported recently (24Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Google Scholar) that oligomers formed using these methods inhibit neuronal viability 10-fold more than fibrils and ∼40-fold more than unaggregated peptide, with oligomeric Aβ1–42-induced inhibition significant at 10 nm. In addition, we were able to differentiate by structure and neurotoxic activity wild-type Aβ1–42 from isoforms containing known familial mutations (24Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Google Scholar). Considering the difficulties in detecting unaggregated and oligomeric Aβ using traditional light and electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was chosen for this study as the primary means of characterizing Aβ assembly state. AFM has proven uniquely well suited to the study of Aβ (15Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S.

This technique is capable of characterizing the wide range of structures present in aggregated Aβ mixtures with sufficient resolution to detect individual 0.9-nm structures in unaggregated preparations that appear monomeric up to multi-micron dense fibrillar aggregates. For the present study, samples were also characterized by Western blot analysis of SDS-PAGE, a technique used in previous publications to identify SDS-stable Aβ assemblies (11Walsh D.M. Tseng B.P.

These techniques were used to characterize the structural heterogeneity present in lyophilized stocks of commercial Aβ peptide and define conditions that eliminate any preformed peptide assemblies. Using this common homogeneous unaggregated starting material we characterized how concentration, time, temperature, pH, and ionic strength influence Aβ1–42 assembly. In addition, the solubility of these Aβ1−42 preparations was estimated by centrifugation. Finally, solution conditions that favored oligomer and fibril formation for Aβ1–42 were applied to Aβ1–40. These results demonstrate the importance of a common homogeneous starting material and how specific conditions determine the formation of distinct conformations of Aβ, thus providing the necessary foundation for controlling their assembly. Understanding the biological roles that specific conformations of Aβ play in the pathogenesis of AD may define the link between Aβ and AD, re-focusing therapeutic approaches by identifying the pernicious species of Aβ ultimately responsible for the cognitive dysfunction that is the primary symptom of the disease. The peptide used in these studies was produced either by chemical synthesis (American Peptide, Sunnyvale, CA) or recombinant expression (Recombinant Peptide Technologies, Athens, GA). Both sources yielded peptide of greater than 95% purity by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and demonstrated the correct molecular mass by mass spectrometry analysis. Lyophilized peptide was stored in sealed glass vials in desiccated containers at −80 °C. Prior to resuspension, each vial was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 min to avoid condensation upon opening the vial. The first step in resuspending the lyophilized peptide was treatment in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP; catalog number H8508; Sigma). All work with HFIP was done in a chemical fume hood with adequate protection. Each vial of peptide was diluted in 100% HFIP to 1 mm using a glass gas-tight Hamilton syringe with a Teflon plunger. The clear solution containing the dissolved peptide was then aliquoted in microcentrifuge tubes (VWR, 20170–293) using a positive displacement repeat pipette (Multipette; Eppendorf). The HFIP was allowed to evaporate in the fume hood, and the resulting clear peptide films were dried under vacuum (6.7 mtorr) in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments) and stored desiccated at −20 °C. The HFIP-treated peptide aliquots were re-checked for chemical purity by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Immediately prior to use, the HFIP-treated aliquots were carefully and completely resuspended to 5 mmin anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (D2650; catalog numberd-2650; Sigma) by pipette mixing followed by bath sonication for 10 min (model 2120; Branson). Aβ1–42 oligomers were prepared by diluting 5 mm Aβ1–42 in Me2SO to 100 μm in ice-cold cell culture medium (phenol red-free Ham's F-12; BioSource), immediately vortexing for 30 s, and incubating at 4 °C for 24 h (19Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6448-6453Google Scholar). Aβ1–42 fibrils were prepared by diluting 5 mm Aβ1–42 in Me2SO to 100 μm in 10 mm HCl, immediately vortexing for 30 s, and incubating at 37 °C for 24 h. HFIP-treated Aβ (1–40 and 1–42) samples prepared using the methods described above were diluted to 50 μm with HFIP. CD spectra were collected on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were obtained from 190 to 260 nm (1-nm steps, 1-nm bandwidth, 20-millidegree sensitivity) in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell fitted with a Teflon stopper to control for evaporation. All spectra were solvent-subtracted and smoothed with the Savitzky-Golay algorithm according to the manufacturer's instructions provided by Jasco. Spectra were then converted to mean residue ellipticity and fitted by using a linear least squares method with the program CDFIT for Jasco data (JFIT; written by Bernhard Rupp, 1997. This software was provided by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and more information can be found at www-structure.llnl.gov/cd/cdtutorial.htm#Program%20CDFIT). Peptide solutions were characterized using a NanoScope IIIa scanning probe work station equipped with a MultiMode head using an E-series piezoceramic scanner (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). AFM probes were single-crystal silicon microcantilevers with 300-kHz resonant frequency and 42 Newton/meter spring constant model OMCL-AC160TS-W2 (Olympus). Samples were imaged under dry helium. 10–50 μl of sample solution was spotted on freshly cleaved mica, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, rinsed with 0.02 μm of filtered (Whatman Anotop 10) deionized NANOpure water (Barnstad Thermoline), and blown dry with tetrafluoroethane (CleanTex MicroDuster III). Image data were acquired at scan rates between 1 and 2 Hz with drive amplitude and contact force kept to a minimum. Gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen) as described previously (24Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Google Scholar). Briefly, unheated samples in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer were applied to 12% bis-Tris NuPAGE gels were electrophoresed using MES running buffer and transferred to 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.0625% Tween 20. Blots were incubated in the primary antibody 6E10 (mouse monoclonal against Aβ residues 1–16; Signet, Dedham, MA) or 4G8 (mouse monoclonal against Aβ residues 17–24; Signet, Dedham, MA). Immunoreactivity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and imaged on an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 440CF. Molecular weight values were estimated using rainbow pre-stained molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences). Aβ1–42 preparations were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at either 16,000 × g in an Eppendorf 5415D microcentrifuge (Brinkmann Instruments) or at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Optima MAX ultracentrifuge using a TLA 120.1 rotor in 8 × 34-mm polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter Instruments). Aβ supernatant and pellet fractions were extracted by dilution to 70% formic acid (EM Science), bath sonicated (model 2120; Branson) for 5 min, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Control samples were prepared in an identical manner using the same tubes and solutions in the absence of centrifugation. Values from these control samples were used to determine non-sedimenting background and were subtracted from test samples. For dot blot analysis, Aβ supernatant and pellet fractions were diluted to 23.3% formic acid in deionized water. Quantitative dot blot analysis was performed using a series 1055 96-well vacuum dot blot apparatus (Invitrogen) fitted with a 0.45-μm Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). 40 μl of each diluted fraction was applied to the membrane and developed using the same methods described for Western blot analysis. Quantitation of immunoreactivity was determined using Kodak one-dimensional image analysis software (version 3.5.4). In vitro studies necessary to define the structure and activity differences between small oligomeric and fibrillar assemblies of Aβ need to be based on procedures that consistently produce fully characterized, homogeneous structural populations. To achieve this goal, the first point to address is the intrinsic structural variability between different lots of Aβ peptide. This variability can exist between chemically identical peptide lots and often results in changes in biological activity in vitro (33Howlett D.R. Jennings K.H. Lee D.C. Clark M.S. Brown F. Wetzel R. Wood S.J. Camilleri P. Roberts G.W. Neurodegeneration. 1995; 4: 23-32Google Scholar, 34Soto C. Castano E.M. Kumar R.A. Beavis R.C. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 105-108Google Scholar). Removal of any preexisting structures in lyophilized stocks of Aβ1−42 peptide is required for controlled aggregation studies. In this study, lyophilized Aβ directly dissolved to 5 mm in 100% HFIP was characterized by AFM. This treatment resulted in a dense, homogeneous field of unaggregated peptide immediately after resuspension (Fig.1 A). After a 24-h incubation at room temperature, no aggregates, fibrils, or protofibrils were detected in these HFIP Aβ solutions. The z-height value for the individual peptide structures as measured by AFM was 1.0 (± 0.3) nm, which agrees the expected size of a single Aβ monomer. However this technique is not capable of absolute molecular weight determination and therefore does not provide proof that these structures are monomeric. HFIP is a corrosive alcohol and is not compatible with in vitro and cell-based assays. For this reason, it was removed by evaporation in a fume hood followed by incubation in a 6.7-mtorr vacuum, and samples were stored as peptide films. Fluorinated alcohols including HFIP and trifluoroethanol have been shown to break down β-sheet structure, disrupt hydrophobic forces in aggregated amyloid preparations, and promote α-helical secondary structure (35Barrow C.J. Zagorski M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 179-182Google Scholar, 36Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Google Scholar, 37Wood S.J. Maleeff B. Hart T. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 870-877Google Scholar). CD is commonly used to determine changes in secondary structure averaged for a given sample solution. Thus, CD spectroscopy is a bulk solution technique that might not detect small quantities of fibrillar seeds that differ in secondary structure. Aβ preparations containing primarily fibrillar peptide as determined by electron microscopy produce a CD spectra consistent with a predominately β-sheet conformation (38Tomski S.J. Murphy R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 630-638Google Scholar). However, despite random coil CD spectra, aggregates can be detected by AFM in Aβ1–40 directly resuspended in dH2O (39Yang D.S. Yip C.M. Huang T.H. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32970-32974Google Scholar). In the present study, using 100% HFIP to remove structural history resulted in CD spectra for Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 solutions indicating a secondary structure almost entirely α-helical (∼50–70%) and random coil (∼30–50%), with little β-sheet (<1%) (Table I). These data are in agreement with previous CD results using either HFIP or trifluoroethanol to induce α-helical structure (36Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Google Scholar, 40Fezoui Y. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 30: 30Google Scholar). Taken together, these CD studies indicate that dissolving Aβ1–42 in 100% HFIP removes any preexisting β-sheet secondary structure, yielding predominately α-helix and random coil. These results are also in agreement with the AFM analysis of Aβ1–42 solutions in HFIP that demonstrate the peptide assumes a uniform, unaggregated conformation that shows no signs of aggregation after incubation for 24 h (Fig.1 A).Table ICD spectroscopy of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in HFIPPeptideα-Helixβ-SheetRandom coilpercentAβ1–4067< 133Aβ1–4253< 147CD spectrum of 50 μM, Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were acquired in 100% HFIP at room temperature.

Analytical ultracentrifugation studies have demonstrated that Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 are primarily monomeric in 100% anhydrous Me2SO (42Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Wang G.T. Barrett L.W.

In the current study, AFM analysis of different commercial lots of synthetic and recombinant Aβ1–42 directly resuspended to 5 mm in 100% anhydrous Me2SO without HFIP pretreatment demonstrated that the peptide appears primarily unaggregated immediately after solubilization, with structures measuring 1.1 (± 0.3) nm (Fig.1 A). However, in some cases small diameter (∼2-nm) fibrils were observed (Fig. 1 A, inset). After 24 h at room temperature, additional small Aβ fibrils were detected in Aβ1–42 Me2SO solutions, even in preparations that were initially fibril-free. These small fibrillar structures were stable in Me2SO for several weeks and formed even after HFIP pretreatment (data not shown). These results indicate that 100% anhydrous Me2SO alone is not a sufficiently strong solvent to remove all structural history present in lyophilized Aβ or maintain a concentrated unaggregated peptide solution. Resuspension of lyophilized Aβ1−42 directly in dH2O or aqueous buffer is also used by investigators (44Schenk D. Barbour R. Dunn W. Gordon G. Grajeda H. Guido T. Hu K. Huang J. Johnson-Wood K.

Science. 2001; 293: 1491-1495Google Scholar) and recommended by commercial manufacturers (AnaSpec, Bachem, U.S. Peptide, Inc.). To determine the extent of structural heterogeneity present in lyophilized stocks of Aβ1–42, peptide was directly resuspended to 5 mm in dH2O and characterized by AFM. Analysis of these solutions revealed a wide size range of peptide aggregates and extended fibrils immediately after resuspension (Fig. 1 A). These structures included large (10–15-nm z-height) and small (2–5-nm z-height) amorphous peptide aggregates and intermediate diameter fibrils (4–6 nm) greater than 1 μm in length. These structures persisted after 24 h at room temperature, in addition to an increase in the number of 2–5-nm globular aggregates. However, the extent of all the structures observed under these conditions is highly dependent on seeded aggregation and thus dependent on the initial lyophilized peptide. These data indicate that direct resuspension of lyophilized Aβ1–42 in dH2O produces heterogeneous structural populations incompatible with controlled aggregation studies. Note that the z-height range for this H2O preparation was maintained at 5 nm, resulting in a greater contrast compared with images of HFIP- and Me2SO-solubilized peptide. To ensure that the HFIP-treated Aβ1–42 peptide film was fully solubilized, peptide stocks were resuspended to 5 mm in Me2SO. The resulting solution contained unaggregated structures (Fig. 1 B) that measured 1.0 (± 0.3) nm by AFM (Fig. 1 B, inset), comparable with the measurements for Aβ1–42 structures measured directly in HFIP or Me2SO (Fig. 1 A). Solubilization of the HFIP-treated peptide directly into dH2O or aggregation buffer does not produce a fully resuspended unaggregated solution. The thin film resulting from the HFIP treatment is not easily resuspended directly in dH2O without the use of sonication or other methods. The peptide film is more soluble in Me2SO facilitating complete resuspension of the HFIP-treated peptide (data not shown). Once conditions were established that consistently produce unaggregated Aβ preparations, two different aggregation protocols were used with the HFIP-treated Me2SO peptide stocks. Previous studies demonstrated the formation of small soluble oligomeric assemblies derived from Aβ1–42 either incubated in the presence of apolipoprotein J under physiologic conditions (18Oda T.

We have performed a comparative study of optimized antisense oligonucleotides designed to work by an RNA interference mechanism to oligonucleotides designed to work by an RNase H-dependent mechanism in human cells. The potency, maximal effectiveness, duration of action, and sequence specificity of optimized RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide duplexes were evaluated and found to be comparable. Effects of base mismatches on activity were determined to be position-dependent for both siRNA oligonucleotides and RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides. In addition, we determined that the activity of both siRNA oligonucleotides and RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides is affected by the secondary structure of the target mRNA. To determine whether positions on target RNA identified as being susceptible for RNase H-mediated degradation would be coincident with siRNA target sites, we evaluated the effectiveness of siRNAs designed to bind the same position on the target mRNA as RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides. Examination of 80 siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes designed to bind to RNA from four distinct human genes revealed that, in general, activity correlated with the activity to RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides designed to the same site, although some exceptions were noted. The one major difference between the two strategies is that RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides were determined to be active when directed against targets in the pre-mRNA, whereas siRNAs were not. These results demonstrate that siRNA oligonucleotide- and RNase H-dependent antisense strategies are both valid strategies for evaluating function of genes in cell-based assays.

Introduction of long double-stranded RNA into the cells of these organisms leads to the sequence-specific degradation of homologous gene transcripts. The long double-stranded RNA molecules are metabolized to small 21–23-nucleotide interfering RNAs (siRNAs)1 by the action of an endogenous ribonuclease, Dicer (3Grishok A. Tabara H. Mello C.C.

The siRNA molecules bind to a protein complex, termed RNA-induced silencing complex, which contains a helicase activity that unwinds the two strands of RNA molecules, allowing the antisense strand to bind to the targeted RNA molecule (4Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2000; 101: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Zamore P.D. Science. 2002; 296: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and an endonuclease activity that hydrolyzes the target RNA at the site where the antisense strand is bound. It is unknown whether the antisense RNA molecule is also hydrolyzed or recycles and binds to another RNA molecule. Therefore, RNA interference is an antisense mechanism of action, since ultimately a single-stranded RNA molecule binds to the target RNA molecule by Watson-Crick base pairing rules and recruits a ribonuclease that degrades the target RNA. In mammalian cells, long double-stranded RNA molecules were found to promote a global change in gene expression, obscuring any gene-specific silencing (6Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. Lehmann R. Barkel D.P.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This reduction in global gene expression is thought to be mediated in part through activation of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase which phosphorylates and inactivates the translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (8Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that transfection of synthetic 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes into mammalian cells does not elicit the RNA-activated protein kinase response, allowing effective inhibition of endogenous genes in a sequence-specific manner (9Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar, 10Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). These siRNAs are too short to trigger the nonspecific double-stranded RNA responses, but they still promote degradation of complementary RNA sequences (9Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar, 11Novina C.D. Murray M.F. Dykxhoorn D.M. Beresford P.J. Riess J. Lee S.-K. Collman R.G.

Multiple mechanisms exist by which short synthetic oligonucleotides can be used to modulate gene expression in mammalian cells (12Crooke S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 30-42Google Scholar). A commonly exploited antisense mechanism is RNase H-dependent degradation of the targeted RNA. RNase H is a ubiquitously expressed endonuclease that recognizes a DNA-RNA heteroduplex, hydrolyzing the RNA strand (13Crouch R.J. Dirksen M.L. Cold Spring Harbor Monogr. Ser. 1982; 14: 211-254Google Scholar, 14Lima W.F. Wu H. Crooke S.T. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides that contain at least five consecutive deoxynucleotides are substrates for human RNase H (15Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28270-28278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, the RNase H-dependent antisense mechanism differs from the siRNA mechanism by utilizing RNase H, instead of a double-stranded RNase, as the terminating mechanism. Initial reports in which siRNA was compared with single-stranded antisense approaches to gene knockdown have indicated that the siRNA is more potent and effective than a traditional antisense approach (4Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2000; 101: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). However, the antisense molecules used in these experiments were single-stranded unmodified RNA, which is rapidly degraded and does not recruit RNase H to cleave the target. Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides are first generation antisense agents that have been widely used to modulate gene expression in cell-based assays, in animal models, and in the clinic (18Henry S.P. Monteith D. Levin A.A. Anti-cancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 395-408PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorothioate modification dramatically increases the nuclease resistance of the oligonucleotide and still supports RNase H activity (19Eckstein F. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2000; 10: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Further improvements to phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides have been made, resulting in second generation oligonucleotides such as 2′-O-methyl or 2′-O-methoxyethyl modifications (15Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Agrawal S. Jiang Z.

The 2′-O-methoxyethyl modification is particularly attractive, since it increases the potency of the oligonucleotide, further increases nuclease resistance, decreases toxicity, and increases oral bioavailability (21Henry S.

In this report, we compare oligonucleotides that were designed to work by a siRNA mechanism (siRNA oligonucleotides) to optimized first and second generation antisense oligonucleotides that were designed to work by an RNase H-dependent mechanism (RNase H oligonucleotides). Active siRNA oligonucleotides and homologous RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides were evaluated for relative potency, efficacy, duration of action, sequence specificity, and site of action within the cell to determine whether significant advantages could be found for the different antisense strategies in cell-based assays. Our results suggest that in human cell culture assays, double-stranded oligoribonucleotides that work by siRNA mechanism exhibit similar potency, efficacy, specificity, and duration of action as RNase H oligonucleotides. Furthermore, as we have previously found for RNase H oligonucleotides, not all sites on the target RNA are good target sites for siRNA molecules. Like RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides, activity of siRNAs is affected by the secondary structure of the target RNA. Finally, siRNAs and RNase H oligonucleotides appear to work upon the target mRNA at different stages of its processing/metabolism. Synthesis and purification of phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides or chimeric 2′-O-methoxyethyl/deoxyphosphorothioate modified oligonucleotides was performed using an Applied Biosystems 380B automated DNA synthesizer as described previously (22McKay R.A.

Sequences of oligonucleotides and placement of 2′-O-methoxyethyl modifications are detailed in Tables I and II. RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO). siRNA duplexes were formed by combining 30 μl of each 50 μmRNA oligonucleotide solution and 15 μl of 5× annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) followed by heating for 1 min at 90 °C and then 1 h at 37 °C. Successful annealing was confirmed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The melting temperatures (T m) were experimentally determined for a subset of siRNA tested as described previously (15Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M.

Oligonucleotides were administered to cells using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (25Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Zounes M.A. Freier S.M. Lima W.F. Bennett C.F. J. Biol.

Other transfection reagents were evaluated (e.g. Transit TKO, LipofectAMINE 2000, and Oligofectamine) and found to provide similar levels of siRNA-mediated target reduction in T24 cells (data not shown); however, Lipofectin was determined to be superior to the other transfection reagents for RNase H-dependent oligonucleotide administration. In addition, LipofectAMINE was found to be more toxic to the cells than Lipofectin, and Transit TKO failed to provide consistent results for delivery of siRNA molecules. Optimal Lipofectin/oligonucleotide ratios were empirically determined for both siRNAs and RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides. For RNase H antisense oligonucleotides, cells were incubated with a mixture of 3 μg/ml Lipofectin per 100 nm oligonucleotide in OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen), whereas siRNA duplexes were incubated with a mixture of 6 μg/ml Lipofectin per 100 nm siRNA duplex. Since concentrations reported in the paper represent concentration of the siRNA duplex, the same weight/Lipofectin ratio was maintained for siRNA duplexes and antisense oligonucleotides. After 4 h, the transfection mixture was aspirated from the cells and replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 until harvest. To induce CD54 mRNA expression, oligonucleotide-treated cells were incubated overnight and then treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 2–3 h prior to harvest of cells for RNA expression analysis. For analysis of cell surface expression of CD54 protein, cells were induced with 5 ng/ml TNF-α immediately following the transfection and incubated overnight. Total RNA was harvested at the indicated times following the beginning of transfection using an RNeasy Mini preparation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Briefly, 200 ng of total RNA was analyzed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 200 nm gene-specific PCR primers, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 75 nm fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probe, 1× RT-PCR buffer, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 units of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and 8 units of ribonuclease inhibitor. Reverse transcription was performed for 30 min at 48 °C followed by PCR: 40 thermal cycles of 30 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 60 °C using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA). All mRNA expression was normalized to levels of GAPDH mRNA, also determined by quantitative RT-PCR, from the same total RNA samples. The following primer/probe sets were used: c-raf kinase (accession number X03484), forward primer (AGCTTGGAAGACGATCAGCAA), reverse primer (AAACTGCTGAACTATTGTAGGAGAGATG), and probe (AGATGCCGTGTTTGATGGCTCCAGCX); CD54 (accession numberJ03132), forward primer (CATAGAGACCCCGTTGCCTAAA), reverse primer (TGGCTATCTTCTTGCACATTGC), and probe (CTCCTGCCTGGGAACAACCGGAAX); PTEN (accession number U92436), forward primer (AATGGCTAAGTGAAGATGACAATCAT), reverse primer (TGCACATATCATTACACCAGTTCGT), and probe (TTGCAGCAATTCACTGTAAAGCTGGAAAGGX); Bcl-x (accession number Z23115), forward primer (TGCAGGTATTGGTGAGTCGG), reverse primer (TCCAAGGCTCTAGGTGGTCATT), and probe (TCGCAGCTTGGATGGCCACTTACCTX); GAPDH (accession numberX01677), forward primer (GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC), reverse primer (GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC), and probe (CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCCX); COREST (accession number NM_015156), forward primer (ACAATCCCATTGACATTGAGGTT), reverse primer (TTTGCTCTATTTTTAGCTTGTGTGCT), and probe (AAGGAGGTTCCCCCTACTGAGACAGTTCCTX); Notch homolog 2 (accession number NM_024408), forward primer (TGGCAACTAACGTAGAAACTCAACA), reverse primer (TGCCAAGAGCATGAATACAGAGA), and probe (ACAACTATAGACTTGCTCATTGTTCAGACTGATTGCCX); PAK1 (accession number U51120), forward primer (TGTGATTGAACCACTTCCTGTCA), reverse primer (GGAGTGGTGTTATTTTCAGTAGGTGAA), and probe (TCCAACTCGGGACGTGGCTACAX); CARD-4 (accession number NM_006092), forward primer (GCAGGCGGGACTATCAGGA), reverse primer (AGTTTGCCGACCAGACCTTCT), and probe (TCCACTGCCTCCAT- GATGCAAGCCX). Following oligonucleotide treatment, cells were detached from the plates with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (without calcium and magnesium) supplemented with 4 mm EDTA. Cells were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted at 5000 rpm for 1 min, and washed in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% sodium azide in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. PE anti-human CD54 antibody (catalog no. 555511; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) was then added at 1:20 in 0.1 ml of the above buffer. The antibody was incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed again as above and resuspended in 0.3 ml of PBS buffer with 0.5% paraformaldehyde. Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Results are expressed as percentage of control expression based upon the mean fluorescence intensity. For luciferase-based reporter gene assays, 10 μg of plasmid pGL3-5132-S0 or pGL3-5132-S20 (26Vickers T.A. Wyatt J.R. Freier S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was introduced into COS-7 cells at 70% confluence in 10-cm dishes using SuperFect Reagent (Qiagen). Following a 2-h treatment, cells were trypsinized and split into 24-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h, and then RNase H or siRNA oligonucleotides were added in the presence of Lipofectin reagent as detailed above. All oligonucleotide treatments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Following the 4-h oligonucleotide treatment, cells were washed, and fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The following morning, cells were harvested in 150 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 60 μl of lysate was added to each well of a black 96-well plate followed by 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Luminescence was measured using a Packard TopCount microplate scintillation counter. Simple statistical analyses were conducted to examine the association between siRNA and RNase H oligonucleotide screens. Similarity between the two screens for a given gene was measured by using correlation coefficients and average difference. Two different correlation measures were employed: Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient, which measures a linear relationship between siRNA and RNase H oligonucleotide screens, and Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient, which measures a linear relationship between the potency of siRNA and RNase H oligonucleotide screens. One-sample one-tailed t tests were conducted for observed correlation coefficients to assess whether they are significantly greater than the null hypothesis of no correlation. Statistical inference on observed average difference was conducted by randomizing sample pairs of siRNA and RNase H oligonucleotide screen. Again, one-tailed tests were used to determine whether the observed distances are significantly smaller than those expected from random chance. The association between siRNA and RNase H oligonucleotide screen was further examined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. First, siRNAs were classified as potent when the percentage inhibition rate was smaller than the median value of 67.4% for the CD54 siRNA screen and 57.1% for the PTEN screen. An arbitrary cut-off was then set for RNase H oligonucleotide screens. RNase H oligonucleotides with percentage inhibition rates smaller than this cut-off value were classified as potent. From the classification of siRNAs and RNase H oligonucleotides, a 2 × 2 contingency table was constructed. Finally, true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) were determined based on this table. For example, TPR is the number of cases where potent RNase H oligonucleotides correspond to potent siRNAs divided by the number of potent siRNAs. Similarly, FPR is the number of cases where potent RNase H oligonucleotides corresponds to nonpotent siRNAs divided by the number of nonpotent siRNAs. For CD54, a cut-off value of 70% gives TPR = 75% and FPR = 45%. For the PTEN gene, a cut-off of 40% gives TPR = 72% and FPR = 44%. By varying these cut-off values, a ROC curve can be drawn on a plane spanned by FPR and TPR. The area under the ROC curve provides a measure of overall accuracy. Since both siRNAs and RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides must hybridize to target RNA and subsequently direct specific RNases to bind and cleave the bound RNA (15Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C.

Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar), we examined whether an active RNase H oligonucleotide site would also be an active siRNA site. Initially, siRNAs were designed and synthesized based upon the target sequences of active RNase H oligonucleotides previously identified. ISIS 5132 is a 20-base phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide that targets the 3′-untranslated region of human c-raf kinase mRNA and specifically reduces expression of both mRNA and protein (29Monia B.P. Sasmor H. Johnston J.F. Freier S.M. Lesnik E.A. Muller M. Geiger T. Altmann K.-H. Moser H. Fabbro D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15481-15484Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An siRNA duplex (si5132) composed of 21-nt sense and 21-nt antisense strands was designed using the first 19 nucleotides of the target site for ISIS 5132 in the paired region and unpaired 2-nt 3′-dTdT overhangs. T24 cells were treated with oligonucleotides at doses ranging from 3 to 300 nm as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Total RNA was analyzed for expression of c-raf mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. The results, shown in Fig.1 A, are normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. Both ISIS 5132 (solid bars) and the corresponding siRNA to the same target site (open bars) were found to inhibit the expression of the c-raf kinase mRNA, each with an IC50 of ∼50 nm. siRNAs targeted to human CD54 and Bcl-X had no effect on the expression of c-raf (data not shown).

In this study, we have combined two experimental approaches, induction of peroxisome proliferation by Pex11pβ and expression of dominant-negative mutants, to test whether DLP1 plays a role in peroxisomal growth and division. We were able to localize DLP1 in spots on tubular peroxisomes in HepG2 cells. In addition, immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of DLP1 in highly purified peroxisomal fractions from rat liver and an increase of DLP1 after treatment of rats with the peroxisome proliferator bezafibrate. Expression of a dominant negative DLP1 mutant deficient in GTP hydrolysis (K38A) either alone or in combination with Pex11pβ caused the appearance of tubular peroxisomes but had no influence on their intracellular distribution. In co-expressing cells, the formation of tubulo-reticular networks of peroxisomes was promoted, and peroxisomal division was completely inhibited. These findings were confirmed by silencing of DLP1 using siRNA. We propose a direct role for the dynamin-like protein DLP1 in peroxisomal fission and in the maintenance of peroxisomal morphology in mammalian cells.

Schutgens R.B. Wanders R.J. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Google Scholar). Like other subcellular organelles, peroxisomes have the capacity to proliferate and multiply or to be degraded in response to nutritional and environmental stimuli (2Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Google Scholar). According to the “growth and division model” of Lazarow and Fujiki (3Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Google Scholar), new peroxisomes form by division and fission of preexisting ones after the import of newly synthesized proteins from the cytosol. Although accumulating evidence suggests that vesicles that originate from the endoplasmic reticulum or other kinds of endomembranes might be involved in the de novo formation of peroxisomes in a multistep process (4Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Swaving G.J. Harder W. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4785-4794Google Scholar, 5South S.T. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 255-266Google Scholar, 6Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 22-29Google Scholar), the “growth and division model” has been broadly accepted (7Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Google Scholar). The peroxisomal membrane protein Pex11p appears to be directly involved in the regulation of peroxisomal growth in size and number and, thus, in peroxisomal division. Pex11p-deficient yeast cells contain a small number of “giant” peroxisomes, whereas overexpression results in a high degree of peroxisome proliferation (8Marshall P.A. Krimkevich Y.I. Lark R.H. Dyer J.M. Veenhuis M. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 345-355Google Scholar,9Erdmann R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Google Scholar). In mammals, three Pex11p molecules, Pex11pα (10Abe I. Okumoto K. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 468-472Google Scholar, 11Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 373-383Google Scholar), Pex11pβ, and Pex11pγ, have been described, which are supposed to control peroxisome proliferation under induced and basal conditions, respectively (12Abe I. Fujiki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 529-533Google Scholar, 13Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Obie C. Stroh T.A. Valle D. Schroer T.A. Gould S.J. J. Biol.

When overexpressed, Pex11pβ induces a pronounced peroxisome proliferation through a multistep process involving peroxisome elongation and segregation of Pex11pβ from other peroxisomal membrane proteins, followed by peroxisome division (13Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Obie C. Stroh T.A. Valle D. Schroer T.A. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29607-29614Google Scholar). Tubulation and fission processes of elongated peroxisomes have also been observed under conditions of rapid cellular growth or stimulation of cultured cells with defined growth factors, fatty acids, or free radicals and have been proposed to contribute to peroxisome proliferation (15Schrader M. Burkhardt J.K. Baumgart E. Luers G. Spring H. Volkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 24-35Google Scholar, 16Schrader M. Krieglstein K. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J.

At present, however, little information is available on the exact function of such complex tubular or reticular peroxisomal structures, their dynamic behavior, and the molecular machinery required for their formation and division (18Schrader M. King S.J. Stroh T.A. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3663-3671Google Scholar). Proteins of the dynamin family are large GTPases, which have been implicated in tubulation and fission events of cellular membranes, either as a molecular switch or as a pinchase-like mechanoenzyme (19McNiven M.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 151-154Google Scholar, 20McNiven M.A. Cao H.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 454-460Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies have indicated that conventional dynamin has the ability to tubulate spherical liposomes and, upon GTP hydrolysis, constrict, deform, or sever membrane tubules into discrete vesicles (23Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Google Scholar, 24Takei K. Haucke V. Slepnev V. Farsad K. Salazar M. Chen H. De Camilli P. Cell. 1998; 94: 131-141Google Scholar, 25Takei K. Slepnev V.I.

The dynamin-like proteins Dnm1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), DRP-1 (Caenorhabditis elegans), and mammalian DLP11 are homologues involved in the control of mitochondrial morphology and division (21Margolin W.

The mammalian DLP1 is suggested to function in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology (31Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Ryazantsev S.N. van der Bliek A.M. J.

It forms a homotetrameric complex similar to dynamin (35Shin H.W. Takatsu H. Mukai H. Munekata E. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2780-2785Google Scholar) and has been localized to mitochondria but also to other cellular organelles (34Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1341-1349Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that DLP1 is able to form rings and tubulate membranes in a nucleotide-dependent manner both in living cells andin vitro (38Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated whether DLP1 has an influence on peroxisomal morphology and division. Using Pex11pβ expression to induce tubular peroxisomes as well as peroxisome proliferation, we were able to localize DLP1 in spots on elongated peroxisomes. Expression of a dominant-negative DLP1 mutant deficient in GTP hydrolysis or silencing of DLP1 by siRNA inhibited peroxisomal fission and caused tubulation of peroxisomes. These findings provide the first evidence suggesting that a dynamin-like protein, DLP1, is involved in peroxisomal fission and in the maintenance of peroxisomal morphology in mammalian cells. Wild-type DLP1 (DLP1-WT), DLP1 fused to GFP (DLP1-WT-GFP), and the point mutants GFP-DLP1-K38A and GFP-Dyn2(aa)-K44A were described previously (34Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. Mol.

The monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (DM1α) was obtained from Sigma. Species-specific anti-IgG antibodies conjugated to TRITC or fluorescein isothiocyanate were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). HepG2 and COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (all from PAA Laboratories GmbH) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with DNA constructs by incubation with polyethyleneimine (25 kDa; Sigma) as described (42Fischer D. Bieber T. Li Y. Elsasser H.P. Kissel T. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1999; 16: 1273-1279Google Scholar) and processed for immunofluorescence 24–48 h after transfection. The level of Pex11pβmyc overexpression was 1.5–4-fold. 21-Nucleotide RNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, LA) and annealed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The siRNA sequence targeting human DLP1 (accession number NM012062) corresponded to the coding region 785–803 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. Transfection of siRNA was carried out using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were assayed for silencing and peroxisome morphology 48 h after transfection by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting with anti-DLP1 and anti-tubulin antibodies. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 or 25 μg/ml digitonin, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as described (13Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Obie C. Stroh T.A. Valle D. Schroer T.A. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29607-29614Google Scholar). Transfected cells were processed for immunofluorescence 24–48 h after transfection. For double-labeling experiments, cells transfected with GFP constructs were incubated with rabbit anti-PMP70 (or other peroxisomal marker proteins) and subsequently with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to TRITC. For visualization of Pex11pβmyc, cells were labeled with anti-Myc (TRITC) antibodies. Samples were examined using a Leitz Diaplan (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) or an Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with the appropriate filter combinations and photographed on Eastman Kodak Co. TMY film or digitalized. Confocal images (150-nm sections) were captured with a Leica TCS MP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany) with appropriate spectrometer settings for each fluorophor. Digital images were optimized for contrast and brightness using Micrograph Picture Publisher software. Peroxisomes were isolated from rat liver according to a protocol described previously (43Volkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 257-265Google Scholar). For some experiments, peroxisomes were isolated from the livers of adult male Wistar rats (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany), which were fed with the potent peroxisome proliferator bezafibrate (41Beier K. Volkl A. Hashimoto T. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 383-393Google Scholar) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, one liver was homogenized (1 stroke, 2 min, 1000 rpm) using a Potter S homogenizer (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) in ice-cold homogenization buffer (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% ethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmε-aminocaproic acid, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). After subcellular fractionation, a crude peroxisomal fraction (light mitochondrial fraction D) was sedimented into exponentially shaped OptiPrep (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) gradients (40Luers G. Hashimoto T. Fahimi H.D. Volkl A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1271-1280Google Scholar). The highly purified peroxisomal fraction with a density of 1.24 g/ml (usually >95% pure) was used for further experiments. For determination of marker enzyme activities, the following standard procedures were employed: catalase (44Baudhuin P. Beaufay H. Rahman-Li Y. Sellinger O.Z. Wattiaux R. Jacques P. De Duve C. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 179-184Google Scholar), esterase (45Beaufay H. Amar-Costesec A. Thines-Sempoux D. Wibo M. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 213-231Google Scholar), and cytochrome coxidase (46Cooperstein S.J. Lazarow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 189: 665-670Google Scholar). The assay for β-glucuronidase was performed at 56 °C (47Meisler M. Paigen K. Science. 1972; 177: 894-896Google Scholar). Protein was determined using standard procedures. All assays were run with a recording spectrophotometer (Uvikon 810 (Kontron, Munich, Germany) or Beckman model 24). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schüll) using a semidry apparatus and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblots were processed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (AmershamBiosciences). For quantification, immunoblots were scanned and processed using Pcbas software. For quantitative evaluation of peroxisome morphology, 100–200 cells per coverslip were examined and categorized as cells with tubular (2–5 μm in length; Figs. 1 B and 4 D), rod-shaped (0.5–1 μm; Figs. 1 A and 4 E), or spherical peroxisomes (0.1–0.3 μm; Fig. 9 A) as described (15Schrader M. Burkhardt J.K. Baumgart E. Luers G. Spring H. Volkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 24-35Google Scholar, 16Schrader M. Krieglstein K. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J.

Cells co-expressing Pex11pβmyc and GFP-DLP1-K38A were usually filled with extremely elongated (up to 15 μm) peroxisomes (hypertubulation). Usually, 3–5 coverslips per preparation were analyzed, and 4–8 independent experiments were performed. Significant differences between experimental groups were detected by analysis of variance for unpaired variables using Microsoft Excel. Data are presented as means ± S.D., with an unpaired t test used to determine statistical differences. p values <0.05 are considered as significant, and p values <0.01 are considered as highly significant.Figure 4Inhibition of DLP1 function induces “hypertubulation” of peroxisomes in Pex11βp-expressing cells.

Bars, 10 μm (A–D) or 5 μm (E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the role of DLP1 in peroxisome fission and maintenance of morphology, we took advantage of the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2, which has been recently used to propose a general model for peroxisome morphogenesis (16Schrader M. Krieglstein K. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 87-96Google Scholar, 48Grabenbauer M. Satzler K. Baumgart E. Fahimi H.D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 32: 37-49Google Scholar). The peroxisomal compartment in HepG2 cells exhibits marked morphological heterogeneity (15Schrader M. Burkhardt J.K. Baumgart E. Luers G. Spring H. Volkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 24-35Google Scholar). Elongated and tubular peroxisomes, which are frequently detected in cultured cells, undergo dynamic changes and are observed to divide into spherical organelles (Fig. 1 A). Overexpression of the human PEX11β gene alone was sufficient to induce a pronounced proliferation of peroxisomes through a multistep process involving peroxisome elongation (Fig. 1, B and D) and segregation of Pex11pβ from other peroxisomal membrane proteins (Fig. 1 B), followed by peroxisome division (Fig. 1,C and D) (16Schrader M. Krieglstein K. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 87-96Google Scholar). Only 6 h after transfection, the peroxisomes in 90% of the Pex11pβmyc-expressing cells displayed an elongated, tubular morphology. Peroxisome tubules declined rapidly in abundance over the following 24–48 h and were replaced by numerous, small spherical peroxisomes (Fig. 1, C and D). In controls (untransfected or vector alone), 30–40% of the cells exhibited tubular peroxisomes after ∼20 h, which is dependent on culture conditions (15Schrader M. Burkhardt J.K. Baumgart E. Luers G. Spring H. Volkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 24-35Google Scholar, 16Schrader M. Krieglstein K. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 87-96Google Scholar). However, elongated peroxisomes in controls were also observed to divide and declined with time in culture, giving rise to spherical organelles (Fig. 1, C and D). These observations indicate that HepG2 cells, and especially those expressing Pex11pβmyc provide an excellent model system to study peroxisomal elongation and fission in more detail. As described previously (36Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Google Scholar, 34Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4403-4417Google Scholar), DLP1 has been localized to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum tubules and other, yet unidentified cellular organelles in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig.2, affinity-purified antibodies to DLP1 stain punctate vesicular structures in HepG2 cells that are concentrated at the perinuclear region and appear to form linear arrays (Fig. 2, A and B). The intensity of the fine punctate staining pattern was increased by transfection of HepG2 cells with either a wild type DLP1 construct (Fig. 2 B) or expression of a wild type DLP1-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 2 C). The expression of the constructs did not influence the normal intracellular distribution of DLP1. Similar observations have been made in other mammalian cells (36Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Google Scholar, 34Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4403-4417Google Scholar). To determine whether DLP1 associates with multiplying peroxisomes, HepG2 cells expressing Pex11pβmyc were fixed, permeabilized, and double-stained with antibodies to DLP1 and to the Myc tag of Pex11pβmyc. In addition, HepG2 cells were co-transfected with Pex11pβmyc and DLP1-WT-GFP. Interestingly, DLP1-positive structures were found to distribute along the length of elongated peroxisomes (Fig. 2, D–H). DLP1 was found to align along some tubular peroxisomes in spots and was associated with the tips of some tubules (Fig. 2, D and E). In addition, other nonperoxisomal intracellular structures, presumably mitochondria, were positive for DLP1. Co-localization with tubulo-reticular peroxisomes was confirmed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. DLP1 (Fig. 2 F) or DLP1-WT-GFP (Fig.2 H) were found to form small patches along the tubular structures and at the tips. Similar observations were made in untransfected controls; however, co-localization was less frequent (Fig. 2 G). In contrast, colocalization with peroxisomes was not observed when an antibody to dynamin II, an ubiquitously expressed dynamin isoform, was used (not shown). To determine whether DLP1 was associated with isolated peroxisomes, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments with rat liver. A crude peroxisomal fraction, which was obtained by differential centrifugation, was further purified on exponentially shaped OptiPrep gradients (Fig.3 A). Peroxisomes were mainly recovered in fractions 2–4 with the mean equilibrium density of 1.24 g/ml. Mitochondria mostly band in a density range of about 1.15 g/ml (fractions 12 and 13), and microsomes (density of about 1.11 g/ml) were predominantly found in fractions 14 and 15. Some activity of the peroxisomal marker enzyme catalase was also found in the uppermost gradient fractions, reflecting the fragmentation of the fragile peroxisomes during centrifugation (Fig. 3 A). The determination of marker enzyme activities in the main organelle fractions revealed no contamination of the peroxisomal fraction with mitochondria, microsomes, or lysosomes (TableI). These data demonstrate that the isolated peroxisomal fraction is well separated from other cell organelles and highly pure (43Volkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 257-265Google Scholar). The resulting fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-DLP1 antibody, which has been characterized previously on rat liver subcellular fractions (36Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Google Scholar). The DLP1-specific antibody detected a single band of the expected size (80 kDa) in rat liver cytosol and in a rat brain homogenate (Fig.3 B). Brain DLP1 ran slightly higher on SDS-PAGE than DLP1 from the cytosolic fraction or from other rat tissues (36Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Google Scholar). Whereas DLP1 was prominent in the cytosolic fraction, there was a small but reproducible amount of DLP1 in the highly purified peroxisomal fraction. In addition, a small amount was detected in the mitochondrial and the microsomal fractions under our experimental conditions (Fig.3 B). In contrast, DLP1 was absent from a lysosomal fraction, which has been suggested previously (36Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Google Scholar).Table IProperties of the purified organelle fractionsFraction (No.)RSACatalaseCytcOxEsteraseβ-GlucPeroxisomes (3)4.83 ± 1.10.02 ± 0.100Mitochondria (12)1.7 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.50.69 ± 0.30.47 ± 0.2Microsomes (15)0.16 ± 0.20.36 ± 0.21.13 ± 0.450.82 ± 0.14Lysosomes (17)0.5 ± 0.20.33 ± 0.20.86 ± 0.21.86 ± 0.7The relative specific activity (RSA) was determined with respect to the crude peroxisomal fraction.

The data are from three independent experiments. CytcOx, cytochromec oxidase; β-Gluc, β-glucuronidase. To investigate whether the amount of DLP1 in the peroxisomal fraction was increased after the induction of peroxisome proliferation by pharmacological compounds, rats were treated with the potent peroxisome proliferator bezafibrate (41Beier K. Volkl A. Hashimoto T. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 383-393Google Scholar). Rodents are known to respond to a variety of xenobiotics with a massive peroxisome proliferation, whereas primates are “low responders.” Peroxisome proliferation is usually accompanied by an induction of peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes and an increase in peroxisome size and number. After treatment of rats with bezafibrate, an induction of acyl-CoA oxidase, a key enzyme of peroxisomal β-oxidation, was observed in a highly purified peroxisomal fraction when compared with untreated controls (Fig.3 C). In contrast, catalase is not induced or is only slightly induced (Fig. 3 C). The determination of marker enzyme activities in the peroxisomal fractions isolated from bezafibrate-treated rats revealed a purity similar to the controls (not shown). In electron microscopic studies, an increase in the size and number of peroxisomes was also observed (41Beier K. Volkl A. Hashimoto T. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 383-393Google Scholar). After immunoblotting, DLP1 was found to be increased about 2-fold in the peroxisome fractions obtained from bezafibrate-treated animals when compared with controls (Fig. 3 C). Similar results were obtained when rat Fao cells were treated with the potent peroxisome proliferator ETYA (not shown). To examine whether a mutated DLP1 affects peroxisome morphology, we transfected HepG2 cells with a DLP1-GFP construct harboring a lysine-to-alanine (K38A) mutation in GTP binding element 1 (34Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4403-4417Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that recombinant DLP1-K38A protein is capable of binding GTP but is deficient in its hydrolysis due to reduced GTPase activity (38Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2894-2905Google Scholar). We transiently co-transfected HepG2 cells with Pex11pβmyc and the mutated GFP-DLP"

However, intracellular levels of this nutrient must be controlled because it is potentially toxic in excess concentrations. The hCtr1 protein functions in high affinity copper uptake at the plasma membrane of human cells. In this study, we demonstrate that levels of the hCtr1 protein at the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells were reduced when cells were exposed to elevated copper. This decrease in surface hCtr1 levels was associated with an increased rate of endocytosis, and low micromolar concentrations of copper were sufficient to stimulate this process. Inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis prevented the trafficking of hCtr1 from the plasma membrane, and newly internalized hCtr1 and transferrin were co-localized. Significantly, elevated copper concentrations also resulted in the degradation of the hCtr1 protein. Our findings suggest that hCtr1-mediated copper uptake into mammalian cells is regulated by a post-translational mechanism involving copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation of the transporter.

Our findings suggest that hCtr1-mediated copper uptake into mammalian cells is regulated by a post-translational mechanism involving copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation of the transporter. Copper is an essential nutrient for all organisms because it is required by a variety of enzymes that are involved in critical areas of metabolism (1Pena M.M.O. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Google Scholar). Because copper is also potentially toxic when it accumulates beyond cellular needs, intracellular levels of this nutrient must be precisely regulated. In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yCtr1 and yCtr3, are plasma membrane-associated high affinity copper transporters (2Knight S.A. Labbe S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Google Scholar, 3Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified the human and mouse high affinity copper uptake proteins, hCtr1 and mCtr1 (4Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Google Scholar, 5Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst .). 2000; 254: 87-96Google Scholar). Like the yCtr1 protein, the mammalian homologues possess three predicted membrane spanning regions and form oligomeric complexes, possibly to facilitate formation of a membrane pore for copper uptake (6Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Google Scholar, 7Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Google Scholar, 8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). Deletion of the mCtr1 gene in mice results in embryonic lethality, suggesting mCtr1-mediated copper uptake is essential during mammalian embryogenesis (9Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar, 10Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6836-6841Google Scholar). In mouse embryonic cell lines in which both mCtr1 alleles have been disrupted, we have recently shown that a myc-tagged human Ctr1 protein functions in copper uptake and delivery to the copper-dependent enzymes cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and tyrosinase (11Lee J. Petris M.J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40253-40259Google Scholar). In the cultured human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, 1The abbreviations used are: HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin the hCtr1-myc protein is predominantly located at the plasma membrane and functions in copper uptake in a time-, temperature-, pH-, and K+-dependent manner (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that hCtr1 is predominantly in perinuclear vesicles in some cell lines, whereas in others it is at the plasma membrane (7Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Google Scholar, 8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). The basis for this variability in hCtr1 localization in different cell lines is unknown. In yeast, the expression of yCtr1 is up-regulated via the Mac1p transcription factor when extracellular copper levels are low (12Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Google Scholar, 13Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Google Scholar, 14Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Google Scholar). In addition to this transcriptional regulation of yCtr1 expression, the levels of the protein at the plasma membrane are post-translationally regulated by copper availability. When yeast cells are exposed to low micromolar levels of copper, yCtr1 is stimulated to endocytose from the plasma membrane to cytoplasmic vesicles (15Ooi C.E. Rabinowich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Google Scholar). This could serve to rapidly prevent excessive copper uptake via yCtr1 and reduce the potential for copper toxicity, or alternatively, provide a vesicular route for yCtr1-mediated copper uptake. At higher concentrations of copper (∼10 μm) the yCtr1 protein is degraded at the plasma membrane via a mechanism that is independent of endocytosis (15Ooi C.E. Rabinowich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Google Scholar). Despite progress in understanding the biochemical aspects of hCtr1-mediated copper transport in human cells, it is unknown whether the function of hCtr1 is regulated by copper availability. Unlike yeast, there is currently no evidence for copper-regulated transcription of mammalian Ctr1 (5Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst .). 2000; 254: 87-96Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether copper levels in the growth media regulate hCtr1 distribution in cultured mammalian cells. Using HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines transfected with a functional myc-tagged hCtr1 protein, we showed that the level of hCtr1 protein at the plasma membrane was reduced when cells were exposed to elevated copper in the media. The reduced levels of hCtr1 at the plasma membrane were associated with an increased rate of hCtr1 endocytosis, which was specifically inducible by low micromolar copper levels. Higher copper levels resulted in the degradation of hCtr1. Our findings suggest that copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation of the hCtr1 protein could play a key role in regulating copper entry across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. The human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell lines expressing either the myc-tagged hCtr1 protein, or pcDNA3.1 vector, were isolated by transfection using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). The functional c-myc epitope-tagged hCtr1 expression construct in pcDNA3.1(+) vector and pTK-Hyg (Clontech) were cotransfected in HEK293 cells. Hygromycin-resistant cell lines were established by the selection of transfected cells with the supplementation of 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) in the culture medium. hCtr1 expression was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-myc antibody and by measuring stimulation of 64Cu uptake, as described previously (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). CHO cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 using the pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the myc-tagged hCtr1 cDNA as previously described (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. Monoclonal anti-myc antibody, 9E10, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate, and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to HRP were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Alexa 488 anti-mouse antibodies, transferrin-biotin conjugate, and transferrin-Texas Red were purchased from Molecular Probes. Chlorpromazine, cycloheximide, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin were purchased from Sigma. Cells were grown in 24-well trays for 48 h on sterile glass coverslips. In some experiments, copper was added to the media at the indicated concentrations and times. To detect the total pool of hCtr1-myc protein, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and fixed for 10 min at 25 °C using 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% skim milk in PBS, and then probed with the anti-myc antibodies (10 μg/ml) followed by Alexa 488 anti-mouse antibodies (1/1000). To label only the surface pool of hCtr1-myc, the Triton X-100 permeabilization step was omitted and fixed cells were blocked and probed with the anti-myc and Alexa 488 antibodies as described above. The endocytosis of hCtr1-myc was assessed by detecting the uptake of anti-myc antibodies added to the media of Hek/hCtr1-myc cells. Cells were pre-grown for 48 h in basal media and then incubated for either 2 or 5 min in basal- or copper-supplemented media containing 10 μg/ml anti-myc antibodies at 37 °C. Cells were transferred to ice to prevent further trafficking of hCtr1-myc, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and the surface-bound antibodies were removed by three washes for 2 min with acidic buffer on ice (100 mm glycine, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium chloride, pH 2.2). After a further two washes with PBS on ice, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and processed for immunofluorescence as described above. In double labeling endocytosis experiments, 100 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated transferrin and 10 μg/ml anti-myc antibodies were added to the media of cells for 2 min and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described above. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with a ×60 oil objective and an IX70 Olympus microscope fitted with a Bioradiance 2000 laser (Bio-Rad). The pool of hCtr1-myc at the plasma membrane was assessed by measuring the levels of anti-myc antibodies bound to the surface of Hek/hCtr1-myc cells. Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were cultured for 48 h in 6-well trays, washed twice with PBS on ice, and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde without subsequent permeabilization steps. Cells were then blocked using 3% skim milk in PBS, and incubated with the anti-myc antibody (1/500) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed five times in PBS to remove unbound antibodies, and then lysed by sonication in SDS buffer solution containing 62 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). Cell lysates containing the solubilized anti-myc antibodies that were bound to the hCtr1-myc protein at the plasma membrane were separated using 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the anti-myc antibodies were then detected using anti-mouse HRP antibodies (1/5000) by chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Tubulin protein levels were detected on parallel immunoblots using anti-tubulin antibodies (1:40,000; Sigma). The endocytosis of hCtr1-myc was determined by measuring the uptake of anti-myc antibodies added to the cultured media of Hek/hCtr1-myc cells. Cells were pregrown in 6-well trays for 48 h in basal media, and then incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in basal- or copper-supplemented media containing 10 μg/ml anti-myc antibodies. Cells were washed twice with PBS on ice, and surface-bound antibodies were removed by three washes in ice-cold acidic buffer (above). Cells were harvested by scraping into ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 ×g. The cell pellets were solubilized in SDS buffer (above), and 20 μg of lysates containing internalized anti-myc antibodies were separated using 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by chemiluminescence using anti-mouse HRP antibodies, as described above. In some experiments, 100 μg/ml biotinylated transferrin was added to the media instead of anti-myc antibodies and the internalized transferrin was detected using streptavidin-peroxidase on Western blots. Immunoblot detection of hCtr1-myc protein was essentially as described previously (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). Cells cultured in 25-cm2 flasks were scraped into ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. After several washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g and 20 μg of protein lysates were separated using 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by chemiluminescence using anti-myc antibodies (1:1000) followed by anti-mouse HRP antibodies (1/5000). This study was aimed at determining whether the levels and distribution of the hCtr1 copper transporter is subject to regulation by copper. We previously engineered a human Ctr1 cDNA with an amino-terminal myc epitope (hCtr1-myc) in the expression plasmid pcDNA 3.1, and demonstrated this tagged protein is a functional copper transporter and located at the plasma membrane in transfected HEK293 cells (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). Our initial studies investigated the localization of hCtr1-myc transiently expressed in CHO cells cultured in growth media containing elevated copper. Immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-myc antibody revealed strong labeling of hCtr1-myc at the plasma membrane of CHO cells grown in basal media, with some punctate vesicular labeling in the cytoplasm (Fig.1 A). However, in cells exposed to elevated copper there was a striking change in localization to a punctate vesicular distribution throughout the cytoplasm, and a marked reduction in levels of hCtr1-myc at the plasma membrane (Fig.1 B). These observations suggested that the location of hCtr1-myc in CHO cells was altered by elevated copper levels. We then investigated the effect of copper on the location of hCtr1-myc in the HEK293 cell line, Hek/hCtr1-myc, which stably expresses the hCtr1-myc protein (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). The plasma membrane location for hCtr1-myc in Hek/hCtr1-myc cells grown in basal medium was confirmed (Fig.1 C). However, similar to that observed for CHO cells, when Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were exposed to elevated copper levels the hCtr1-myc protein was localized in a perinuclear distribution, and there was little apparent staining at the cell periphery (Fig.1 D). There was no immunofluoresence signal detected in CHO or HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector alone (data not shown). These data suggest that elevated copper concentrations reduced the levels of hCtr1-myc at the plasma membrane in both HEK293 and CHO cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that the amino terminus of hCtr1 is extracellular (6Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Google Scholar, 16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Google Scholar), and this topology allowed us to take advantage of the amino-terminal position of the myc epitope tag to directly test whether elevated copper reduces hCtr1 levels at the plasma membrane. Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were grown in basal media or media containing 100 μm copper for 16 h, and immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out with the anti-myc antibodies using intact paraformaldehyde-fixed cells that had not been permeabilized. Strong labeling of hCtr1-myc was observed at the surface of intact Hek/hCtr1-myc cells grown in basal medium (Fig. 1 E), however, there was no surface labeling of hCtr-myc in copper-treated cells (Fig. 1 F). The integrity of the plasma membrane was confirmed after fixation by the absence of labeling with antibodies against the intracellular protein, protein-disulfide isomerase (data not shown). As an independent assay, immunoblots were used to assess the reduced levels of hCtr1-myc protein at the plasma membrane of copper-treated Hek/hCtr1-myc cells. This was achieved by measuring the levels of anti-myc antibodies that were recovered from the surface of intact Hek/hCtr1-myc cells after these cells were probed with anti-myc antibodies. Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were grown in basal- or copper-supplemented media, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and the intact cells were then probed with the anti-myc antibodies to label hCtr1-myc protein at the plasma membrane. After extensive washing of cells with PBS to remove unbound antibodies, the cells were lysed with SDS buffer and the solubilized anti-myc antibodies were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to HRP. As a control, the affinity purified anti-myc antibodies were run on the same gel and detected as a single 100-kDa band (Fig.2 A, lane 1). The 100-kDa band was strongly detected in the sample from Hek/hCtr1-myc cells grown in basal medium, demonstrating abundant levels of anti-myc antibodies on the surface because of the myc epitope of hCtr1 (Fig.2 A, lane 2). Markedly reduced levels of anti-myc antibodies were recovered from the surface of cells grown in elevated copper (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). There were no detectable anti-myc antibodies bound to the surface of untreated- or copper-treated HEK293 cells stably transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and5). These findings independently confirmed the immunofluorescence microscopy results and suggested that elevated copper reduces the level of hCtr1-myc protein at the plasma membrane. We then explored the kinetics of hCtr1 clearance from the plasma membrane following exposure of Hek/hCtr1-myc cells to elevated copper. A clear reduction in the levels of surface-bound anti-myc antibodies occurred after a 10-min exposure to elevated copper, and decreased over the course of 180 min (Fig. 2 B). This decrease in surface hCtr1-myc expression occurred independently of de novoprotein synthesis, because we observed the same effect in cells pretreated with the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, for 30 min followed by exposure to media containing both copper and cycloheximide (data not shown). The rapidity with which surface levels of hCtr1 were reduced in response to elevated copper prompted us to test whether this is accomplished through copper-stimulated endocytosis of hCtr1. We exploited the extracellular location of the myc epitope of hCtr1-myc to assess endocytosis of the protein. Using the same strategy previously employed to assess endocytosis of the Menkes disease copper transporter, ATP7A (17Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2107-21175Google Scholar), we surmised that if hCtr1-myc endocytosed from the plasma membrane, anti-myc antibodies added to the growth media would bind to hCtr1-myc and be internalized by Hek/hCtr1-myc cells. Initially, immunofluorescence microscopy was used demonstrate that the surface pool of hCtr1-myc could be labeled by the anti-myc antibodies added to the media of living Hek/hCtr1-myc cells that were cooled on ice to inhibit endocytosis (Fig. 3 A). There was no labeling by HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector (data not shown), indicating that the anti-myc antibodies were specifically bound to the extracellular myc epitope of the hCtr1-myc protein in Hek/hCtr-myc cells. We found that several washes with cold acidic buffer removed the surface-bound antibody (Fig. 3 B). This washing step was important in establishing conditions that would remove surface antibodies and permit the visualization of internalized antibodies in subsequent endocytosis experiments. To test the effect of copper on the endocytosis of hCtr1-myc, cells were pre-grown for 48 h in basal media and then incubated for 2 or 5 min in basal or elevated copper media containing anti-myc antibodies to allow uptake of the antibodies via hCtr1-myc endocytosis. After these antibody uptake time periods were completed, cells were rapidly cooled on ice and the surface-bound anti-myc antibodies were removed by washing cells with ice-cold acidic buffer. The protected internalized antibodies were then detected by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. After 2 min there was no apparent uptake of anti-myc antibodies by cells in basal media (Fig. 3 C). However, after 2 min in elevated copper, anti-myc antibodies were detected in vesicular compartments close to the cell periphery (Fig. 3 D). Interestingly, by 5 min in basal media, the anti-myc antibodies had accumulated to low levels in peripheral compartments (Fig. 3 E). This indicated that endocytosis of hCtr1-myc had occurred in the absence of copper supplementation. However, after 5 min in elevated copper the staining of intracellular anti-myc antibodies was more intense than in basal media and there was a substantial concentration in the perinuclear region (Fig.3 F). There was no internalization of anti-myc antibodies by untreated or copper-treated HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector (data not shown), suggesting that the uptake of anti-myc antibodies in the Hek/hCtr1-myc cells occurred through specific binding to hCtr1-myc protein. These data suggest that the hCtr1-myc protein undergoes endocytosis in basal media, and that elevated copper stimulates this process. To more quantitatively demonstrate copper-induced endocytosis of hCtr1-myc, we measured levels of internalized anti-myc antibodies by immunoblotting experiments. As we had done earlier for the immunofluorescence experiments, we initially confirmed that washing cells with acidic buffer removes surface-bound anti-myc antibodies. Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were pre-grown for 48 h in basal media, cooled on ice, and then incubated for 10 min with the anti-myc antibodies to label hCtr1-myc protein at the plasma membrane. Cells were either washed with PBS or acidic buffer on ice, lysed in SDS buffer, and the anti-myc antibodies were detected on Western blots. The 100-kDa band corresponding to the anti-myc antibody was detected in the samples derived from PBS-washed cells (Fig. 4,lane 1), however, this was absent from cells that were washed with acidic buffer (Fig. 4, lane 2). This indicated that surface-bound anti-myc antibodies were removed by this acidic buffer treatment. To explore the effect of elevated copper on the endocytosis of hCtr1-myc, the Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were pre-grown for 48 h in basal media and then incubated in either basal or 100 μm copper media containing the anti-myc antibodies. Cells were transferred to ice to prevent further trafficking, washed extensively with acidic buffer to remove surface-bound anti-myc antibodies, and cell lysates were prepared to allow intracellular anti-myc antibodies to be detected on immunoblots. After a 2-min uptake period, internalized anti-myc antibodies were detected in copper-treated cells (Fig. 4, lane 4), however, no signal was detected in cells exposed to basal media (Fig. 4, lane 3). However, after 5 min of uptake the anti-myc antibodies were weakly detected in cells exposed to basal media (Fig. 4, lane 5), but the levels were 20-fold lower than in the copper-treated cells, as determined by densitometry measurements of band intensity (Fig. 4, lane 6). This elevated uptake of anti-myc antibodies in copper-treated cells relative to untreated cells was also apparent at the 10-min time point (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and8). As we found earlier in the immunofluorescence studies, there was no internalization of anti-myc antibodies in HEK293 cells stably transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector alone (data not shown). To address the specificity of copper-induced hCtr1-myc endocytosis, the effects of copper treatment on the uptake of transferrin was evaluated in Hek/hCtr1-myc cells. Elevated copper did not alter the uptake of transferrin (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 10), indicating that the increased uptake of anti-myc antibodies in copper-treated cells was not because of a general increase in endocytosis from the plasma membrane. These data suggest that elevated copper specifically stimulates the endocytosis of hCtr1-myc from the plasma membrane, and are consistent with earlier results showing a copper-induced decrease in surface levels of hCtr1. To begin to understand the pathway of hCtr1-myc endocytosis, we determined if newly internalized anti-myc antibodies co-localized with transferrin, a marker of early endosomes originating from clathrin-mediated endocytosis (18Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Google Scholar). Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were exposed to elevated copper media containing both the anti-myc antibodies and human transferrin conjugated to the Texas Red fluorophore. After a 2-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with cold acidic buffer to remove any anti-myc antibodies and transferrin bound to the cell surface. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and the internal anti-myc antibodies were detected with anti-mouse Alexa 488 antibodies. The internalized transferrin (Fig.5 A, red) and anti-myc antibodies (Fig. 5 B, green) were co-localized within vesicular compartments, as shown by the predominantly yellow labeling in the overlay image (Fig.5 C). These findings suggested that newly internalized hCtr1-myc and transferrin co-localize with early endosomes. Because transferrin is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the finding that newly internalized transferrin and hCtr1-myc were co-localized prompted us to test whether the internalization of hCtr1-myc was clathrin-dependent. Chlorpromazine and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) have been used extensively to inhibit endocytosis of surface proteins. Chlorpromazine is a cationic amphiphilic drug that inhibits the assembly of the clathrin adaptor protein, AP2, on clathrin-coated pits (19Wang L.H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Google Scholar), whereas MCD is a more general inhibitor of endocytosis through its ability to extract cholesterol from the plasma membrane and inhibit formation of clathrin-coated pits and caveolae (20Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Google Scholar). Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were incubated for 20 min with either chlopromazine or MCD, prior to a 2-h incubation in the presence of the inhibitor plus elevated copper. Immunofluorescence microscopy was then used to assess the intracellular location of hCtr1-myc protein. The expected internalization of hCtr1-myc protein to cytoplasmic vesicles in copper-treated cells was observed in the absence of endocytosis inhibitors (Fig.6 B), as shown earlier (Fig.1 D). Chlorpromazine and MCD treatments did not alter the plasma membrane location of hCtr1-myc in cells in basal media (Fig. 6,C and E). However, the copper-induced internalization of hCtr1-myc protein from the plasma membrane was inhibited in cells treated with chlorpromazine or MCD (Fig. 6,D and F). In control experiments, the uptake of transferrin was inhibited by both chlorpromazine and MCD (data not shown). These observations suggest that hCtr1 is internalized by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Our earlier finding that anti-myc antibodies were internalized by hCtr1-myc cells in basal media suggested that the hCtr1-myc protein may constitutively cycle via the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in the absence of elevated copper. To further explore whether hCtr1-myc constantly cycles via the plasma membrane, we tested whether endocytosis inhibitors would result in elevated levels of hCtr1-myc protein at the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the surface levels of hCtr1-myc protein after incubating hCtr1-myc cells in basal media containing chlorpromazine or MCD. hCtr1-myc cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in basal media containing either chlorpromazine or MCD, and surface levels of the hCtr1-myc protein were determined by assessing the recovery of surface-bound anti-myc antibodies from the surface of intact cells. As shown in Fig. 6 G, the surface levels of hCtr1-myc protein were elevated in cells treated with chlorpromazine and MCD, relative to untreated cells. These data suggest that although the hCtr1-myc protein has a steady-state localization at the plasma membrane, the protein cycles via intracellular compartments in the absence of elevated copper. To further characterize the process of copper-stimulated hCtr1-myc endocytosis, we determined the sensitivity of this response. Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were pre-grown in basal media for 48 h, and the uptake of anti-myc antibodies was assessed after 10 min in media containing a range of copper levels. Copper levels as low as 0.5–1.0 μm stimulated the increased internalization of anti-myc antibodies compared with basal media (Fig.7 A, lanes 3 and4), and this progressively increased until saturation was between 5 and 20 μm copper (Fig. 7 A,lanes 6 and 7). To test metal specificity, the uptake of anti-myc antibodies was investigated in media containing 5 or 20 μm AgNO3, FeCl2, or ZnCl2 (Fig. 7 B). The uptake of anti-myc antibodies was stimulated by 5 and 20 μm silver ions with similar efficiency to equimolar levels of copper, whereas iron or zinc had relatively little, if any, effect on uptake. Therefore, the stimulation of hCtr1-myc endocytosis is sensitive to low copper concentrations and is somewhat specific for this metal ion. To further explore the role of copper in regulating the function of hCtr1, we investigated whether levels of the protein were altered in response to elevated copper in the growth media. Hek/hCtr1-myc cells were pre-grown in basal media for 48 h and pretreated for 20 min with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis. Copper was then added to the cycloheximide-containing media at a range of concentrations for 2 h prior to immunoblot analysis of steady-state hCtr1-myc protein levels using anti-myc antibodies (Fig. 8). We and others have previously shown that the hCtr1 protein migrates as a 30–35-kDa monomer and 60–70-kDa dimer by SDS-PAGE (7Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Google Scholar, 8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). These expected sizes for the hCtr1-myc protein were observed in Hek/hCtr1-myc cells after probing Western blots with the anti-myc antibody (Fig. 8,lane 3, arrows). Both the 35- and 70-kDa forms of the hCtr1-myc proteins were absent in nontransfected HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells transfected with the expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (Fig.8, lanes 1 and 2). Despite the presence of two weakly cross-reacting proteins endogenous within HEK293 cells (Fig. 8,asterisks), the effect of copper on the levels of hCtr1-myc protein was readily detected using the anti-myc antibody. A substantial decrease in levels of hCtr1-myc protein was observed in media containing 1–5 μm copper (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and5), which was further exacerbated at copper concentrations between 5 and 20 μm. Both the 35- and 70-kDa forms of the hCtr1-myc protein (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 6) were decreased by copper treatment. Together with our earlier data, these findings suggest that copper triggers both the endocytosis and degradation of the hCtr1 protein. Copper homeostasis is controlled via a number of finely tuned mechanisms through uptake, distribution, and excretion. As a continuation of our previous studies defining the biochemical and physiological function of hCtr1 in copper uptake, we explored whether hCtr1 levels at the plasma membrane are altered in response to changes in copper concentration. Analysis of hCtr1-myc expressed in CHO and HEK293 cell lines demonstrated that the protein was located at the plasma membrane. Significantly, the surface expression of hCtr1-myc was decreased when CHO and HEK293 cells were exposed to elevated copper in the growth media, although the extent of this decrease was more pronounced in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1). Further analysis using nonpermeabilized Hek/hCtr1-myc cells demonstrated reduced levels of hCtr1-myc at the plasma membrane after a 10-min exposure to 100 μm copper. This observation led us to ask whether copper decreases the surface expression of hCtr1-myc by stimulating hCtr1-myc endocytosis. The extracellular orientation of the myc epitope in hCtr1-myc allowed us to assess endocytosis of the protein by measuring the uptake of anti-myc antibodies from the culture media by Hek293/hCtr1-myc cells. Using both confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblots, a time-dependent uptake of anti-myc antibodies was observed in both untreated and copper-treated cells. However, the rate of antibody internalization in copper-treated cells was markedly elevated relative to untreated cells. Collectively, these data suggest that elevated copper reduces the levels of hCtr1-myc at the plasma membrane, and that this is associated with increased endocytosis of the protein. The finding that silver also strongly stimulated the endocytosis of hCtr1-myc was significant, as it suggested that monovalent copper, rather than the divalent ion, is the primary substrate for this process. It is also noteworthy that Cu(I) is the primary substrate for copper uptake via hCtr1 (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). The inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, chlorpromazine and methyl-β-cyclodextrin, prevented the copper-induced relocalization of hCtr1-myc protein from the plasma membrane to cytoplasmic vesicles. Moreover, newly internalized anti-myc antibodies and transferrin were co-localized. Taken together, these data support the notion that hCtr1 enters cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and is trafficked to early endosomes. The ability of the hCtr1-myc protein to internalize anti-myc antibodies from basal media suggested the protein was endocytosed in the absence of elevated copper. Moreover, the increased levels of hCtr1-myc protein at the plasma membrane of cells exposed to endocytosis inhibitors provided further evidence supporting the notion that hCtr1 is constantly endocytosed in basal media. The reduced levels of hCtr1-myc protein at the plasma membrane following copper-stimulated endocytosis is consistent with a homeostatic control mechanism. Under low copper conditions the abundant expression of hCtr1 at the plasma membrane would permit high affinity uptake of copper. However, when extracellular copper concentrations are elevated, the clearance of hCtr1 from the plasma membrane would prevent excessive copper uptake and potential copper toxicity. A notable finding of our study was that elevated copper levels also resulted in the degradation of the hCtr1 protein. The degradation of the protein would provide an additional means to down-regulate copper uptake when copper is present at elevated concentrations, and may also serve to prevent recycling of internalized hCtr1 protein to the plasma membrane. Our findings, together with previous findings that the yeast Ctr1 protein also undergoes copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation, reveal a remarkably conserved mechanism for regulating copper uptake by eukaryotic cells that probably originated early during evolution. A significant finding of our study was that copper supplementation of ∼0.5–1.0 μm in the culture media was sufficient to increase the endocytosis of hCtr1-myc from the plasma membrane. Interestingly, copper uptake via hCtr1-myc in the Hek/hCtr1-myc cell line has a K m of 1.71 ± 0.39 μm(8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). Hence, the concentrations of copper that stimulate copper uptake via hCtr1 are similar to copper levels that enhance its endocytosis. This observation raises the question of how hCtr1 mediates the uptake of copper into cells. Does copper pass through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane as a transport substrate of hCtr1, or as a ligand that enters the cell via endocytosis of a copper-hCtr1 complex? One possibility is that the binding of copper to an extracellular region of hCtr1 protein may trigger endocytosis of the copper-hCtr1 complex to an intracellular compartment from which copper is subsequently transported into the cytoplasm by hCtr1 or an alternative transporter. This endocytic model of copper uptake is reminiscent of the uptake of transferrin-bound iron by the transferrin receptor (21Sullivan A.L. Grasso J.A. Weintraub L.R. Blood. 1976; 47: 133-143Google Scholar). The observation that hCtr1 undergoes endocytosis in basal media is consistent with an endocytic model of copper uptake. Alternatively, copper may enter the cell via two separate hCtr1-dependent processes: the first via direct hCtr1-mediated transport of copper across the plasma membrane, and the second via endocytosis of the copper-hCtr1 complex. This latter mechanism involving endocytosis may function to supply copper to specific intracellular organelles, either for the purposes of copper storage or for specific metabolic processes. The copper-stimulated endocytosis of hCtr1 is reminiscent of copper-stimulated endocytosis that has been reported for the mouse and chicken homologues of the prion protein (22Pauly P.C. Harris D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Google Scholar). Unlike prion protein endocytosis, which is stimulated by high copper levels (>100 μm), we observed increased hCtr1 endocytosis at low micromolar copper levels. Although this difference in sensitivity clearly distinguishes copper-induced endocytosis of hCtr1 from that of the prion protein, it remains to be shown whether a common copper-responsive mechanism underlies the endocytosis of both proteins. It will be important to establish whether the copper-stimulated endocytosis of hCtr1 occurs in all cell types that express the protein. The localization of the hCtr1 protein appears to be cell type specific. In HeLa, H441, A549, and HepG2 cell lines, hCtr1 is predominantly located in perinuclear vesicles, however, the protein is localized at the plasma membrane in CaCo2, Ht29, and HEK293 cells (7Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Google Scholar, 8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). This variability in hCtr1 localization may be because of cell type differences in the rates of hCtr1 trafficking between the cell surface and intracellular compartments. Indeed, the recent finding that an inhibitor of endocytosis causes the vesicular pool of hCtr1 to shift to a plasma membrane distribution in HeLa cells suggests that this intracellular pool of hCtr1 cycles via the plasma membrane (7Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Google Scholar). However, the same study found no evidence that elevated copper affects the steady state location of hCtr1 in CaCo2 or HeLa cells (7Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Google Scholar), the reasons for which are currently unclear. It is conceivable that copper-stimulated endocytosis of hCtr1 only occurs in certain cell types. Alternatively, elevated copper may not alter the steady-state location of hCtr1 in some cell types because only a small fraction of the total pool of hCtr1 traffics via the plasma membrane, or that different cell types have distinct regulatory pools of copper available to stimulate hCtr1 trafficking. In summary, we have identified a post-translational mechanism for regulating high-affinity copper uptake in mammalian cells involving copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation of the hCtr1 copper transporter. We are currently exploring the mechanisms involved in sensing copper, the sorting signals involved in triggering hCtr1 endocytosis, and the vesicular compartments through which hCtr1 traffics. The discovery of copper-stimulated endocytosis of hCtr1 broadens our understanding of how cytoplasmic copper levels are regulated in mammalian cells. Our findings, together with previous studies, which show that copper triggers the relocalization of the Menkes and Wilson copper exporters from thetrans-Golgi network (23Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Google Scholar, 24Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Google Scholar), suggest that copper-induced trafficking regulates the function of all three known high affinity mammalian copper transporters. Understanding how the trafficking of these transporters is coordinated to maintain copper homeostasis will be an important goal of future studies. We thank Drs. David Eide and Elizabeth Rogers for critical evaluation of the manuscript and helpful discussions."

Sialylation of glycoproteins can be regulated by expression of specific sialyltransferases that transfer sialic acid in a specific linkage to defined saccharide acceptor substrates and by expression of particular glycoproteins bearing saccharide acceptors preferentially recognized by different sialyltransferases.

To determine whether addition of α2,6-linked sialic acid to lactosamine sequences on T cell glycoproteins inhibits galectin-1 death, we expressed the ST6Gal I enzyme in a galectin-1-sensitive murine T cell line. ST6Gal I expression reduced galectin-1 binding to the cells and reduced susceptibility of the cells to galectin-1-induced cell death. Because the ST6Gal I preferentially utilizes N-glycans as acceptor substrates, we determined that N-glycans are essential for galectin-1-induced T cell death. Expression of the ST6Gal I specifically resulted in increased sialylation of N-glycans on CD45, a receptor tyrosine phosphatase that is a T cell receptor for galectin-1. ST6Gal I expression abrogated the reduction in CD45 tyrosine phosphatase activity that results from galectin-1 binding. Sialylation of CD45 by the ST6Gal I also prevented galectin-1-induced clustering of CD45 on the T cell surface, an initial step in galectin-1 cell death. Thus, regulation of glycoprotein sialylation may control susceptibility to cell death at specific points during T cell development and peripheral activation.

Sialylation of CD45 by the ST6Gal I also prevented galectin-1-induced clustering of CD45 on the T cell surface, an initial step in galectin-1 cell death. Thus, regulation of glycoprotein sialylation may control susceptibility to cell death at specific points during T cell development and peripheral activation.

The role of glycosylation in these functions is specific, i.e. the different functions require specific sugars on specific glycoprotein acceptors. Regulated glycosylation of specific acceptor substrates can affect immune function by creating or masking ligands for endogenous lectins. For example, modification of cell surface oligosaccharides by the C2GnT and Fuc TVII glycosyltransferases results in specific selectin-mediated trafficking patterns for Th1 and Th2 subsets (3Blander J.M. Visintin I. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3746-3752PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, modification of CD45 by the C2GnT glycosyltransferase regulates thymocyte susceptibility to cell death induced by galectin-1 (10Nguyen J.T. Evans D.P. Galvan M. Pace K.E. Leitenberg D. Bui T.N. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5697-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).

In the human thymus, different members of the sialyltransferase family are expressed in distinct anatomic compartments, so cells in those compartments bear unique complements of sialylated oligosaccharides. For example, the SAα2,6Gal sequence, the product of the ST6Gal I sialyltransferase, is detected only on mature medullary thymocytes (12Baum L.G. Derbin K. Perillo N.L. Pang M. Wu T. Uittenbogaart C.

Intriguingly, mature medullary thymocytes displaying SAα2,6Gal sequences are resistant to galectin-1-induced cell death (13Perillo N.L. Uittenbogaart C. Nguyen J. Baum L.G. J. Exp.

Because the addition of sialic acid in the α2,6 linkage to galactose could mask terminal galactose residues required for galectin-1 binding to T cell glycoproteins (15Di Virgilio S. Glushka J.

Following selection in G418, positive PhaR2.1 clones were identified by SNA flow cytometry. Positive T200− clones were identified by RT-PCR, performed essentially according to the protocol provided in the Super ScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), using the primers 94 sense (TATGAGGCCCCTTACACTG) and 943A antisense (GCCGGAGGATGGGGGATTTGG) (18Ma J.

After washing, the cells were incubated with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (5 μg/ml) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 45 min at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Galectin death assays were performed as described (16Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G.

Apoptotic cells were identified using annexin V and propidium iodide as previously described (10Nguyen J.T. Evans D.P. Galvan M. Pace K.E. Leitenberg D. Bui T.N. Baum L.G. J.

To precipitate SNA-binding glycoproteins, the lysates were precleared for 1 h with biotinylated bovine serum albumin (0.25 μg/225 μl cell lysate) and ImmunoPure Immobilized Streptavidin (Pierce). After centrifugation to remove insoluble material, the supernatants were incubated with SNA-biotin (5 μg/300 μl cell lysate) and ImmunoPure Immobilized Streptavidin overnight. The precipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. All of the steps were performed at 4 °C. To precipitate CD45, the supernatants were precleared with purified rat IgG2b,κ (0.25 μg/300 μl cell lysate) (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein G (Pierce), and CD45 was precipitated with monoclonal antibody 30-F11 (3 μg/300 μl cell lysate) (Pharmingen) and ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein G overnight. CD45 or SNA precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with polyclonal goat anti-mouse CD45 (0.2 μg/ml) (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) or SNA-biotin (1 μg/ml). Bound reagent was detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG (Bio-Rad) or streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, respectively, and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). ST6Gal I immunoblotting of whole cell lysates was performed as described in Ref. 12Baum L.G. Derbin K. Perillo N.L. Pang M. Wu T. Uittenbogaart C. J. Biol.

Cell lysates (106 cells) were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose and probed with polyclonal goat anti-mouse CD45 (M-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The band corresponding to CD45 was excised from the nitrocellulose, and the bound antibody was stripped with Restore buffer (Pierce). After washing two times with 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.5 (TBS-T) followed by two washes with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, the membrane was incubated with 1.5 ml of 50 mmsodium phosphate containing 10,000 units of PNGase F (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) overnight at 37 °C with rocking. The enzyme-treated membrane was washed with TBS-T and probed with SNA-biotin, as described above. The cells were lysed in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 100 μl of lysates (3 × 106 cells) were incubated with 1.5 μmCMP-β-d-sialic acid (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 500 μg of asialofetuin (Sigma) in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 1 mm MgCl2, for 2 h at 37 °C. To stop the reaction, the mixtures were incubated for 10 min on ice. Fetuin was precipitated with anti-fetuin antibody (Accurate Chemical Co., Westbury, NY) (5 μl/150 μl lysate), and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with SNA-biotin, as described above. Band intensity was determined using the MultiImage Light Cabinet, model 2.1.1 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) with ChemiImager 5500 software. The cells were treated with or without galectin-1 as in the death assays. After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched with 0.2 m glycine for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cells were blocked with in 10% goat serum for 1.5 h at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with polyclonal goat anti-mouse CD45 conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Pharmingen) in 2% goat serum for 1.5 h at room temperature in the dark. After washing, the cells were mounted on slides with Prolong Anti-fade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR). CD45 cell surface localization was analyzed on a Fluoview laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus America Inc, Melville, NY), at 100×. The number of cells demonstrating CD45 segregation or clustering and the total number of cells were counted for six randomly selected fields for each experiment. Approximately 50 cells were counted in six fields. Percent CD45 segregation was calculated as [100 × (number of CD45 segregated cells/total number of cells)]. 4 × 106 cells were incubated at 37 °C in 400 μl of medium containing PBS as a control (0 min) or 30 μg of galectin-1 for 1, 5, 15, or 30 min. At the indicated times, the cells were cooled on ice, washed in PBS at 4 °C, and lysed (12Baum L.G. Derbin K. Perillo N.L. Pang M. Wu T. Uittenbogaart C. J. Biol.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Calbiochem) as a substrate in the presence of okadaic acid to inhibit protein Ser/Thr phosphatases. Cell lysate (20 μg/25 μl) was incubated at room temperature for 4 h in 475 μl of PTP assay buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 nm okadaic acid) either in the absence or presence of 50 μm bpV (phen) (potassium bisperoxo (1,10-phenanthraline)oxo-vanadate(v)) as a specific PTP inhibitor (10Nguyen J.T.

The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 1 n NaOH, and released p-nitrophenol was measured atA 415 against appropriate blanks. Galectin-1 preferentially recognizes Galβ1,4GlcNAc (LacNAc) sequences that can be presented on N- or O-linked glycans (15Di Virgilio S. Glushka J. Moremen K. Pierce M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although prior work from our lab demonstrated that O-glycans participate in galectin-1 T cell death (9Galvan M. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16730-16737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the role ofN-glycans in galectin-1 cell death is not clear. In addition, the ST6Gal I enzyme preferentially sialylates terminal galactose residues on N-glycans (12Baum L.G. Derbin K. Perillo N.L. Pang M. Wu T. Uittenbogaart C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10793-10799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Weinstein J. de Souza-e-Silva U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13845-13853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); if the ST6Gal I participated in regulating galectin-1 cell death in vivo, it would likely occur through the modification ofN-glycans. To determine whether N-glycans are necessary for galectin-1 induced death, human and murine T cell lines were treated with the mannosidase I inhibitor DMNJ, to block trimming of terminal mannose residues and subsequent elongation of N-glycans with LacNAc sequences. The effectiveness of DMNJ treatment was determined by analyzing treated cells with the PHA, because inhibition of mannosidase I activity would prevent elongation of the N-glycan chain recognized by PHA (19Cummings R.D. Trowbridge I.S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13421-13427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells treated with DMNJ showed a marked reduction in PHA binding compared with cells cultured in medium alone; importantly, DMNJ treatment did not affect the level of cell surface expression of galectin-1 receptors CD43 or CD45, as determined by flow cytometric analysis using the relevant antibodies (data not shown). DMNJ-treated cells were examined for susceptibility to galectin-1-induced cell death (Fig. 1). The PhaR2.1, CEM, and MOLT-4 cell lines are all susceptible to galectin-1-induced cell death, whereas the BW5147 cells are resistant to galectin-1 because of the lack of core 2O-glycans on cell surface glycoproteins (9Galvan M. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16730-16737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Nguyen J.T. Evans D.P. Galvan M. Pace K.E. Leitenberg D.

Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). DMNJ treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in galectin-1-induced cell death of the galectin-1-susceptible murine (PhaR2.1) and human (CEM, MOLT-4) T cell lines. Although previous studies demonstrated that the glycosylation inhibitors benzyl-α-GalNAc and swainsonine reduced T cell susceptibility to galectin-1 (9Galvan M. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16730-16737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), neither benzyl-α-GalNAc nor swainsonine had the dramatic inhibitory effect on cell death that we observed with DNMJ treatment. These results demonstrated that N-linked glycans are essential for galectin-1-mediated T cell death. The addition of terminal α2,6-linked sialic acid can block galectin-1 binding to the preferred saccharide ligand LacNAc. This has been demonstrated for individual LacNAc units and for poly-LacNAc chains (15Di Virgilio S. Glushka J. Moremen K. Pierce M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Sparrow C.P. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol.

The ability of a terminal SAα2,6Gal sequence to block galectin-1 binding suggested that the addition of α2,6-linked sialic acid to T cell surface glycoproteins (12Baum L.G. Derbin K. Perillo N.L. Pang M. Wu T. Uittenbogaart C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10793-10799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) could regulate the susceptibility of thymocytes and T cells to galectin-1. To directly examine whether addition of α2,6-linked sialic acid would affect susceptibility to galectin-1, we expressed the ST6Gal I in the galectin-1-susceptible murine T cell line PhaR2.1. The plant lectin SNA recognizes the SAα2,6Gal sequence (12Baum L.G. Derbin K. Perillo N.L. Pang M. Wu T. Uittenbogaart C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10793-10799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Broekaert W.F. Nsimba-Lubaki M. Peeters B. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1596-1601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used SNA binding, detected by flow cytometry, to screen for clones expressing the ST6Gal I. Two SNA+ clones, SNA.1 and SNA.9, demonstrated increased SNA binding compared with a control clone transfected with vector alone (C.2) (Fig.2 A). Both RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis with anti-ST6Gal I serum demonstrated abundant expression of ST6Gal I mRNA and protein in SNA.9 cells (Fig.2 B) and SNA.1 cells (data not shown), whereas no reactivity was observed in control C.2 cells (Fig. 2 B). ST6Gal I expression did not affect the level of expression of galectin-1 receptors CD43 or CD45 on the SNA.1 and SNA.9 cells, determined by flow cytometric analysis, nor the level of CD7 expression, detected by immunoblotting (data not shown). We then determined whether addition of cell surface sialic acid by the ST6Gal I enzyme would reduce galectin-1 binding to T cells. As shown in Fig. 2 C, galectin-1 binding to the SNA.9 cells (closed circles) was markedly reduced compared with the level of binding observed for the C.2 control cells transfected with vector alone (open circles). However, the reduced, but not absent, binding of galectin-1 to SNA.9 cells indicated that some of the potential binding sites on these cells were not modified by the ST6Gal I enzyme. For both SNA.9 and C.2 cells, galectin-1 binding was completely inhibited in the presence of 100 mm lactose (squares), demonstrating that binding was saccharide-dependent. The SNA.1, SNA.9, and C.2 cells were examined for susceptibility to galectin-1-induced death. As shown in Fig.2 D, the C.2 cells transfected with vector alone were susceptible to galectin-1; ∼50% of the cells underwent cell death, determined by annexin V binding and PI uptake. In contrast, the SNA.1 and SNA.9 cells demonstrated only 10 and 18% galectin-1-induced death, respectively. The resistance of the SNA.1 and SNA.9 cells to galectin-1 did not appear to result from a complete block of galectin-1 binding, as demonstrated by the binding curve in Fig. 2 C; in addition, all of the clones demonstrated cell agglutination when galectin-1 was added, and the cell agglutinates were dispersable by the addition of lactose (data not shown). These data demonstrated that expression of the ST6Gal I, resulting in creation of SAα2,6Gal sequences on cell surface glycoproteins, reduced susceptibility to galectin-1-induced T cell death and suggested that sialylation of specific glycoproteins was responsible for resistance to galectin-1-induced cell death. Our laboratory has demonstrated that the T cell surface glycoproteins CD7, CD43, and CD45 are receptors for galectin-1 (24Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these glycoproteins were specifically modified by the ST6Gal I, we examined CD7, CD43, and CD45 for increased sialylation ofN-glycans by SNA and antibody precipitation. Total SNA-binding proteins were precipitated and probed with SNA. As shown in Fig. 3 A, there was only one significant difference in the pattern of SNA-binding glycoproteins precipitated from cells expressing the ST6Gal I (SNA.1) compared with vector-transfected controls (C.2, C.4). In extracts of SNA.1 cells, there was an obvious increase in SNA binding to a band of approximate molecular mass of 200 kDa. Other SNA reactive bands of various sizes were occasionally seen in different experiments (data not shown), but these other bands were not consistently observed. In contrast, the 200-kDa SNA+ band was consistently observed in ST6Gal I-expressing clones. The relative mobility of the 200-kDa band suggested that it could be CD45, a highly glycosylated protein that is known to bear SAα2,6Gal sequences on both murine and human T cells (12Baum L.G. Derbin K. Perillo N.L. Pang M. Wu T. Uittenbogaart C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10793-10799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To specifically determine whether the band exhibiting increased SNA binding was CD45, both SNA and CD45 antibody were used to precipitate material from vector transfected (C.4) and SNA.1 cells, and the precipitates were probed with CD45 (Fig. 3 B). The 200-kDa band exhibiting increased SNA binding reacted with CD45 antibody, demonstrating that CD45 was selectively hypersialylated in the SNA.1 cells. In addition, this band migrated with the same mass as immunoprecipitated CD45. To determine whether the increased sialylation of CD45 occurred on N-glycans, the preferred glycan acceptor for the ST6Gal I, SNA.1 cells were pretreated with DMNJ prior to SNA or CD45 precipitation. DMNJ treatment reduced SNA binding to protein precipitated from SNA.1 cells to the level observed for control cells (C.4) transfected with vector alone (Fig. 3 B). PNGase F treatment confirmed that, in cells overexpressing the ST6Gal I, sialic acid addition to CD45 occurred on N-glycans. Whole cell lysates of SNA.9 cells were probed with antibody to CD45. The CD45 bands were excised from the blot and incubated with or without PNGase F, and the bands were reprobed with SNA. As shown in Fig.3 C, PNGase F dramatically reduced SNA binding to CD45 from SNA.9 cells. Thus, the increased SNA binding to CD45 on cells expressing the ST6Gal I resulted from the specific addition of α2,6-linked sialic acid to N-glycans on CD45. The background level of binding of SNA to CD45 on control cells and on DMNJ-treated cells may reflect SNA recognition of SAα2,6GalNAc sequences on O-glycans on CD45 (23Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J.

As mentioned above, the three primary receptors for galectin-1 on T cells are CD7, CD43, and CD45 (24Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We specifically precipitated CD7 and CD43 from SNA.9, SNA.1, and C.2 cells and saw no difference in SNA binding to CD7 or CD43 (data not shown), indicating that the inhibitory effect on galectin-1 cell death was not due to sialylation of CD7 or CD43. We also did not detect CD7 or CD43 by immunoblotting SNA precipitates with the respective antibodies (data not shown). To further examine the acceptor substrate preference of the ST6Gal I, we expressed the ST6Gal I in the murine T200− cell line, a mutant of the BW5147 line that does not express CD45. Despite repeated attempts, we could not isolate SNA+ clones from T200− cells transfected with ST6Gal I cDNA (SNA.T1), nor could we detect any increase in SNA binding to whole cell lysates of SNA.T1 cells (Fig. 4, A andB). Although RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the ST6Gal I mRNA was present in nine independent clones of ST6Gal I transfected T200− cells (Fig. 4 C), every clone was SNA− by flow cytometry (Fig. 4 A). In addition, we detected ST6Gal I protein by immunoblotting in the ST6Gal I transfected T200− cells (Fig. 4 C), although the cells were SNA−. Finally, to confirm that the ST6Gal I expressed in T200− cells was enzymatically active, we used asialofetuin as an acce"

We have previously shown, based on two-dimensional projection maps, that P-glycoprotein undergoes conformational changes upon binding of nucleotide to the intracellular nucleotide binding domains. Here we present the three-dimensional structures of P-glycoprotein in the presence and absence of nucleotide, at a resolution limit of ∼2 nm, determined by electron crystallography of negatively stained crystals. The data reveal a major reorganization of the transmembrane domains throughout the entire depth of the membrane upon binding of nucleotide. In the absence of nucleotide, the two transmembrane domains form a single barrel 5–6 nm in diameter and about 5 nm deep with a central pore that is open to the extracellular surface and spans much of the membrane depth. Upon binding nucleotide, the transmembrane domains reorganize into three compact domains that are each 2–3 nm in diameter and 5–6 nm deep. This reorganization opens the central pore along its length in a manner that could allow access of hydrophobic drugs (transport substrates) directly from the lipid bilayer to the central pore of the transporter.

ATP binding cassette transmembrane domain nucleotide binding domain P-glycoprotein nucleotide-free P-gp ATP Binding Cassette (ABC)1 transporters are an extended family of membrane proteins defined by a highly conserved domain, the ATP binding cassette (1Higgins C.F. Hiles I.D. Salmond G.P. Gill D.R. Downie J.A. Evan I.J. Holland I.B. Gray L. Buckel S.D. Bell A.W. Hermodson M.A. Nature. 1986; 323: 448-450Google Scholar); they mediate the ATP-dependent transport of a wide variety of compounds across cellular membranes (2Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 5-13Google Scholar, 3Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Google Scholar). The core ABC transporter consists of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). The NBDs are peripherally located at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, bind ATP, and couple ATP hydrolysis to the transport process. All NBDs whose structures have been determined have very similar tertiary folds (4Kerr I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1561: 47-64Google Scholar, 5Gaudet R. Wiley D.C.

Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Google Scholar). The TMDs bind the transported substrate and form the pathway through which it crosses the membrane. In contrast to the NBDs, the TMDs of different ABC transporters share little primary sequence similarity, except between closely related members of a subfamily; this may be because of the variety of substrates transported by different ABC proteins. Little is known about the structures of the TMDs of ABC transporters or how the binding/hydrolysis of ATP by the NBDs is coupled to transmembrane transport of solute. Hydrophobicity plots typically predict six transmembrane α-helices per TMD, but there are notable exceptions with additional predicted transmembrane α-helices (9Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Google Scholar, 10Trowsdale J. Hanson I. Mockridge I. Beck S. Townsend A. Kelly A. Nature. 1990; 348: 741-744.5Google Scholar). The structures of two complete bacterial ABC transporters (9Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Google Scholar, 11Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar) have confirmed that the membrane-spanning segments are indeed α-helical, although the packing of these α-helices within the membrane differs markedly between the two structures. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a mammalian ABC transporter that pumps hydrophobic drugs across the cell membrane and can confer multidrug resistance on cells and tumors. P-gp is probably the best characterized ABC transporter, and much is known about the ATP hydrolytic cycle (12Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

There is a body of biochemical evidence suggesting that the TMDs undergo conformational changes upon nucleotide binding, including changes in epitope accessibility (19Ruth A. Stein W.D. Rose E. Roninson I.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4332-4339Google Scholar, 20Druley T.E. Stein W.D. Roninson I.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4312-4322Google Scholar), protease susceptibility (21Julien M. Gros P.

To understand the mechanism of transport, these biochemical data need to be linked to structural information. We have previously reported low to medium resolution structures for P-gp determined by both single particle image analysis (27Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Google Scholar) and by electron crystallography of two-dimensional crystals (28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar). The two-dimensional projection maps for P-gp trapped at different stages of the hydrolytic cycle suggest substantial conformational changes at the extracellular face of the TMDs upon binding the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) and after vanadate-trapping in the presence of ADP (ADP/Vi state) (28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar). We have now generated a three-dimensional structure for P-gp in the presence of AMP-PNP and compared this with the three-dimensional structure of P-gp in the absence of nucleotide. The data show substantial conformational changes throughout the TMDs of P-gp upon nucleotide binding, requiring significant repacking of the transmembrane α-helices, and opening a central pore along its length, potentially facilitating movement of hydrophobic compounds from the lipid bilayer to the aqueous pore of the transporter. P-glycoprotein was purified from CHrB30 Chinese hamster ovary cells selected for over-expression of P-gp (29Callaghan R. Berridge G. Ferry D.R. Higgins C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 109-124Google Scholar). Two-dimensional crystals were grown in the presence or absence of nucleotide and negatively stained with uranyl acetate, as described previously (28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar), using hanging-drop methods developed by Auer et al. (30Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Google Scholar, 31Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kühlbrandt W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 961-968Google Scholar, 32Crowther R.A. Henderson R.

Where appropriate, 5 mm AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP, was added directly to the crystallization droplet. Electron microscopy was under low-dose conditions. Images were digitized on a UMAX Power Look 3000 densitometer at 0.41 nm/pixel at the specimen level. Lattice unbending and contrast transfer function correction were as described earlier (28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar). Structure factors were merged with ORIGTILTD and averaged with the program LLFILT to give interpolated structure factors along each lattice line (Fig. 1), as previously described (32,33).Determination of the correct orientation of each crystal relative to the core data set was crucial. The crystals are in the p1plane group, the lattice dimensions a and b are similar, and the ab angle (γ) is ∼120o; therefore, in principle there are 12 alternative orientations in which each crystal can be merged with the core data set, of which only one will be correct. A procedure was established in which structure factors for the three alternative lattice refinement options were generated. These were each tested against the core data set with rotation and/or flipping options. The correct orientation was determined on the basis of (a) inter-image phase residual (with the correct orientation having a significantly lower residual than the nearest alternative) and (b) examination of the projection map of the untilted version of the crystal (e.g. identification of the strong but narrow density in the P-gp-AMP-PNP structure, as discussed under “Results”). In ∼95% of the cases there was a single orientation that was better than all the others in terms of interimage phase residual. None of the crystals tested merged best with a 'flipped’ orientation, implying that the crystals preferentially adhere by only one face to the support film (see the “Results” and “Discussion” sections). The three-dimensional maps were generated using the CCP4 software (34Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar), and modeling was carried out using XFIT within the XTALVIEW software suite (35McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-47Google Scholar). Two-dimensional crystals of highly purified P-glycoprotein in detergent were grown in the presence or absence of AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP that is known to bind to the NBDs at the same site as ATP. Three-dimensional structures were generated by electron crystallography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two-dimensional crystals formed more readily in the presence of AMP-PNP, suggesting that this compound favored either the nucleation or stability of the two-dimensional crystals. Crystal order was also slightly better with AMP-PNP, as shown by comparison of the S.D. of the mean phases in most of the resolution ranges for untilted data (Table I). Crystals grown with and without AMP-PNP were similar in size (in excess of 1 micron across), but the unit cell area was slightly smaller in the presence of AMP-PNP (Table I). In both conditions, crystals had a p1plane group, so that symmetry operations could not be used to judge the quality of the structural data. Instead, crystal-to-crystal variation and resolution limits for the data were assessed by analyzing the deviations from the (vector sum) mean phase (Table I). These began to increase around 2 nm resolution for the P-gp-AMP-PNP crystals, but even at this limit phase errors were significantly lower than those expected for random data. Visual assessment of the scatter present in the three-dimensional data for the P-gp-AMP-PNP crystals was achieved by plotting the structure factors of lattice lines along z* in reciprocal space (Fig. 1), suggesting that the three-dimensional structural data could be relied on to about 2 nm resolution. At this limit, domains in P-gp were resolved, but secondary structures such as transmembrane α-helices remained unresolved.Table ICrystallographic image processing data for P-gp-AMP-PNP and nf-P-gp (in parentheses)Untitled data: comparison of P-gp-AMP-PNP crystals with nf-P-gp crystals (data in parentheses)Resolution rangeNo. of structure factorsMean redundancyaMean number of observations of reflections within the resolution range (maximum is 12 or 9 for nf-P-gp).S.D. of mean phaseMean figure of meritbThe weight for each reflection that gives the smallest root mean squared error in the Fourier synthesis (44).nmdegree10.0–5.03 (3)9 (12)11.9 (5.4)0.999 (0.999)5.0–3.03 (6)9 (11.2)7.7 (13.2)0.999 (0.995)3.0–2.23 (6)7.7 (5.8)14.9 (30.7)0.996 (0.959)2.2–2.05 (3)5 (3.3)26.3 (72.7)0.991 (0.898)Three-dimensional data for the P-gp-AMP-PNP crystalsUnit cell parametersa = 6.4 nm, b = 6.5 nm, γ = 119 °, thickness ≈ 10 nm, plane group p1Number of crystalline areas processed46In tilt range0 ° (untitled)91–29 °930–39 °540–49 °1150–59 °12Number of observations to IQ7cIQ is a measure of the signal:noise of reflections (45). and 2 nm454Number of structure factors139Mean interimage phase residualdUp to 2nm resolution and IQ5.

Open table in a new tab In two-dimensional crystals of nucleotide-free-P-gp (nf-P-gp), the molecules were packed such that they are slanted across each other (Fig. 2, panel A, angled away from the observer) with the long axis of each molecule oriented about 25–30o from the normal to the crystal plane. Such packing would be disallowed in crystals formed by reconstitution in lipid bilayers but can be accommodated in these crystals, which were grown in the presence of detergent micelles. In contrast, in crystals of P-gp-AMP-PNP the molecules were aligned with their long axis almost exactly perpendicular to their two-dimensional crystal plane (Fig. 2). These packing differences, at least in part, explain the smaller unit cell area of the P-gp-AMP-PNP crystals (Table I). The three-dimensional maps of nf-P-gp and P-gp-AMP-PNP (Fig. 2) each comprise high and low density regions (the high density region is closest to the observer inpanels A and B and at the top in panel C). The high and low density regions were more pronounced for nf-Pgp (Fig. 2, panel A). Because the high density region is the side of the molecule in contact with the support film, the differences in the two regions are likely to be because of the well documented 'differential staining’ effect (36Harris J.R. Holzenburg A. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 102-112Google Scholar, 37Ruffle S.V. Mustafa A. Kitmitto A. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25692-25696Google Scholar) in which better contrast, and hence higher apparent protein density, is observed in the region closest to the support film. We have previously shown by lectin-gold labeling (27Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Google Scholar, 28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar) that the surface of the P-gp molecule in contact with the support film corresponds to that exposed at the extracellular face of the membrane. Thus, the high-density region corresponds to the TMDs, whereas the low density region corresponds to the NBDs. The three-dimensional structure of nf-P-gp is shown in panel A of Fig. 2. The high density region, corresponding to the TMDs, resembles a barrel 5 to 6 nm in diameter and about 5 nm long. The barrel surrounds a central pore, which appears to be open at the top (equivalent to the extracellular face of the membrane) and closed at the bottom (intracellular). The overall structure of the TMDs is very similar to that determined previously by the entirely different method of single particle image analysis (27Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Google Scholar). The three-dimensional netting display used here gives a clear impression of the full three-dimensional volume, allowing the identification of features in the map not seen previously, in particular a density that protrudes toward the central axis of the pore folding in from the bottom wall of the barrel and a smaller density protruding into the pore from the top of the barrel. After suitable rotation of the structure (see legend to Fig. 3), a view directly down the barrel was obtained (Fig. 3 a, bottom panel). Note that the walls of the barrel are roughly 1–1.5 nm thick, which roughly equates to the diameter of a transmembrane α-helix (see below). In contrast to the nf-P-gp structure, the high density (TMD) region of P-gp-AMP-PNP consists of three clearly segregated domains (designatedA, B, and C in Fig. 2 B). Two of these domains are roughly equivalent in size and shape, with a footprint of about 3 × 1.5 nm and a length perpendicular to the crystal plane of about 4.5 nm. The third domain (C) has a smaller footprint (about 2 nm diameter) but is somewhat longer perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (about 6 nm). Domain C was a useful reference point in the data merging procedure, because its smaller footprint but higher density allowed it to be distinguished from the other two domains in projection maps of individual crystals (see Fig. 2, panel B). The three domains of P-gp-AMP-PNP also enclose a central ‘pore.‘ However, unlike nf-P-gp the pore is less obviously closed at the bottom (intracellular face of the membrane) and, additionally, is open to the lipid phase along one side with a gap appearing between two domains (Fig 2, panel B,arrow). The opening up of this gap may explain why the P-gp-AMP-PNP crystals are less affected by differential staining with apparently better penetration of stain through the molecule (compare Fig. 3, a and d, top panels). The low density regions of each P-gp map correspond to the NBDs (28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar). Because the NBDs are farther from the grid support film, they are less contrasted by heavy atom stain and less well protected against the damaging effects of the high vacuum and electron beam in the microscope (36Harris J.R. Holzenburg A. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 102-112Google Scholar, 37Ruffle S.V. Mustafa A. Kitmitto A. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25692-25696Google Scholar). Thus, densities in this region are weak, especially for nf-P-gp (Fig. 3 a), and are therefore more difficult to interpret than the densities for the TMDs (4Kerr I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1561: 47-64Google Scholar, 8Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F-L. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Google Scholar). The characterization of the NBDs must await a three-dimensional structure for unstained two-dimensional crystals of P-gp obtained by cryo-electron microscopy. The crystal structures of two bacterial ABC transporters, MsbA and BtuCD, have recently been determined (9Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Google Scholar, 11Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar). These structures differ substantially from each other. We attempted to fit high-resolution coordinates for the protein backbone of the TMDs from both bacterial transporters to the high-density (TMD) region of nf-P-gp (the bacterial ABC structures were determined in the absence of nucleotide ligand). The global structure of BtuCD is similar to that of nf-P-gp (Fig. 3), but the 20 transmembrane α-helices of BtuCD could not be readily modeled onto the nf-P-gp map. This is presumably, in part, because the BtuCD TMDs contain a total of 20 transmembrane α-helices, in contrast to the 12 of P-gp. However, it should be noted that the lack of sequence similarity is such that it is not possible to determine which α-helices, if any, of P-gp correspond to which of BtuCD. Similarly, the TMDs of the intact MsbA homodimer (MsbA is equivalent to a half-molecule of P-gp, and a homodimer of two monomers is believed to form the functional molecule) could not be fitted to the P-gp densities (Fig. 3). However, making the assumption that the dimer interface in the MsbA crystals is not the natural interface (38, 39; see also under “Discussion”), the transmembrane regions of two separated MsbA monomers could readily be modeled into the high density (TMD) region of nf-P-gp (Fig. 4). The 'arcuate’ arrangement of the α-helices in each of the two MsbA monomers almost exactly forms the barrel shape of the TMDs of nf-P-gp. The nf-P-gp map is slightly larger than the volume occupied by two MsbA monomers, probably because of different resolution thresholds for the electronversus x-ray crystallography data. We have determined and compared the three-dimensional structures of nf-P-gp and P-gp-AMP-PNP. Because of the way the crystals were grown and stained, the NBDs were not clearly delineated. The TMDs of nf-Pgp form a barrel-like structure surrounding a pore, open at the extracellular face of the membrane and closed at the cytoplasmic face. This structure was similar to that previously determined by us using other approaches (27Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Google Scholar, 28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar), and recently by others at low resolution in a lipid environment (38Lee J.-Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Google Scholar), although in this three-dimensional display more detail could be seen. In particular, small densities protruding into the pore could be seen. Their role in the transport process is unknown. The new structural data show substantial reorganization of the TMDs of P-gp upon binding nucleotide. We have previously reported such structural changes (28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar), but because these were observed from projections of the molecule the maps were restricted to two-dimensions. The three-dimensional structures presented here show that these conformational changes occur throughout the depth of the membrane and must therefore involve repacking of the transmembrane α-helices within the membrane. They show the transformation of a cylindrical, barrel-like structure into three discrete domains, one of which is slightly smaller than the other two but longer perpendicular to the membrane. This conformational change opens one side of the pore throughout much of its length, equivalent to most of the depth of the lipid bilayer. In a membrane environment, this would create access from the lipid bilayer to the central pore. Because hydrophobic drugs interact with P-gp from the lipid phase (40Higgins C.F. Gottesman M.M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 18-21Google Scholar, 41Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggemann E.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3975-3980Google Scholar, 42Hollo Z. Homolya L. Davis C.W. Sarkadi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 384-388Google Scholar), this suggests a model in which the TMDs part to enable hydrophobic drugs in the bilayer to enter the central pore prior to extrusion, rather than a model in which the drug moves across the membrane along a lipid-protein interface at the outer surface of the P-gp molecule. The conformational changes observed are consistent with a 'helix rotation’ model for transport (39Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. Science. 2001; 293: 782-784Google Scholar) but would be difficult to square with a 'tilting helix’ model (11Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar). Finally, it is significant that major conformational change occurs upon ATP binding rather than ATP hydrolysis. Although it has often been assumed that ATP hydrolysis drives the transport process, recent biochemical data show that reductions in drug binding affinity to P-gp are also due to ATP binding rather than hydrolysis (17Martin C. Berridge G. Mistry P. Higgins C.F. Charlton P. Callaghan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11901-11906Google Scholar, 18Martin C. Higgins C.F. Callaghan R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15733-15742Google Scholar,28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar). Thus, ATP binding appears to drive the major conformational changes that reduce drug binding affinity and expose the drug binding site to the extracellular milieu (central aqueous pore); ATP hydrolysis may therefore simply 'reset’ the transporter (14Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Google Scholar). Unlike the NBDs, the TMDs of different ABC transporters share little sequence homology, except within very closely related sub-families. It is therefore unclear whether the TMDs of different subfamilies of ABC transporters are related to each other either evolutionarily or structurally. The two high-resolution structures reported for bacterial TMDs (9Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Google Scholar, 11Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar) are radically different from each other (Fig. 3,b and c). Furthermore, neither the TMDs of the MsbA dimer nor the TMDs of BtuCD can be modeled onto the nf-P-gp TMD structure determined here (note, the MsbA and BtuCD structures were obtained in the absence of bound nucleotide). Confidence in the P-gp structure, although at lower resolution, comes from the fact that a similar structure was obtained by the very different methods of single particle imaging and electron crystallography and that the protein used was shown to be almost fully active both in drug binding and ATP hydrolysis (27Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Google Scholar, 28Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar, 29Callaghan R. Berridge G. Ferry D.R. Higgins C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 109-124Google Scholar). The TMDs of two separated MsbA monomers could, however, readily be mapped onto the TMDs of nf-P-gp (Fig. 4) if they were rotated away from the dimer interface suggested by the original MsbA crystal structure (11Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar). Other considerations suggest that the crystallographic dimer interface reported for MsbA may not reflect thein vivo dimer interface (38Lee J.-Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Google Scholar, 39Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. Science. 2001; 293: 782-784Google Scholar). The question of whether the packing of α-helices in the monomer of MsbA actually reflects that of P-gp awaits more sophisticated modeling and a higher resolution structure for P-gp. Cross-linking data (43Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Google Scholar) 2D. R. Stenham, J. D. Campbell, M. S. P. Sansom, C. F. Higgins, I. D. Kerr, and K. J. Linton, manuscript in preparation. already suggest that there will be important differences. Nevertheless, the present data do show that the densities of the TMDs of nf-P-gp are entirely consistent with a pseudosymmetric structure of 2 × 6 transmembrane α-helices arranged to form a barrel (Fig. 4).

This region has been implicated in the binding of divalent metal ions, particularly copper. PrPC has been suggested to be involved in copper transport and metabolism and in cell defense mechanisms against oxidative insult, possibly through the regulation of the intracellular CuZn superoxide dismutase activity (CuZn-SOD) or a SOD-like activity of PrPC itself. However, up to now the link between PrPC expression and copper metabolism or SOD activity has still to be formally established; particularly because conflicting results have been obtained in vivo. In this study, we report a link between PrPC, copper binding, and resistance to oxidative stress. Radioactive copper (64Cu) was used at a physiological concentration to demonstrate that binding of copper to the outer plasma cell membrane is related to the level of PrPC expression in a cell line expressing a doxycycline-inducible murine PrPC gene. Cellular PIPLC pretreatment indicated that PrPC was not involved in copper delivery at physiological concentrations. We also demonstrated that murine PrPC expression increases several antioxidant enzyme activities and glutathione levels. Prion protein may be a stress sensor sensitive to copper and able to initiate, following copper binding, a signal transduction process acting on the antioxidant systems to improve cell defenses.

Prion diseases form a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders including Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases, Gerstmann-Sträussler Syndrome, Kuru and Fatal Familial Insomnia in humans, and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals (1Parchi P. Gambetti P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1995; 8: 286-293Google Scholar). All these disorders are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein PrPC, 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular isoform of prion protein; SOD, superoxide dismutase; dox, doxycycline; PIPLC, phosphoinositol phospholipase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; MDA, malondialdehyde acid; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of prion protein; MTT, (4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactants 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular isoform of prion protein; SOD, superoxide dismutase; dox, doxycycline; PIPLC, phosphoinositol phospholipase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; MDA, malondialdehyde acid; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of prion protein; MTT, (4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactants denoted PrPSc, which represents the major component of infectious prion diseases (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). The formation of PrPSc from PrPC is accompanied by profound changes in structure and biochemical properties. PrPC rich in α-helical regions is converted into a molecule with highly β-sheeted structures and partial resistance to proteolytic digestion (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 3Horiuchi M. Caughey B. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: R231-R240Google Scholar). The conversion of PrPC into PrPSc remains enigmatic. Biosynthesis of PrPC is necessary for PrPSc formation, as mice lacking PrPC are resistant to scrapie infection (4Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Google Scholar).Human PrPC has 253 amino acids and is mainly expressed on neurons (5Kretzschmar H.A. Stowring L.E. Westaway D. Stubblebine W.H. Prusiner S.B. Dearmond S.J. Dna. 1986; 5: 315-324Google Scholar, 6Kretzschmar H.A. Prusiner S.B. Stowring L.E. DeArmond S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 1-5Google Scholar). In its N-terminal region, a repeated sequence of five octapeptides can be found, which was shown to bind copper and zinc (7Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Google Scholar, 8Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Google Scholar, 9Stockel J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Google Scholar). The protein may have some superoxide dismutase-like activity and therefore a possible protective function against oxidative stress (10Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Google Scholar). Wild-type mouse brains have a significantly higher level of membrane-associated copper than PrPC-deficient mice. Treatment with phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PIPLC) specifically reduced the copper content from wild type mice but had no effect on the copper content of PrPC knockout mice (8Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Google Scholar). However, these results have not been confirmed (11Waggoner D.J. Drisaldi B. Bartnikas T.B. Casareno R.L. Prohaska J.R. Gitlin J.D. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7455-7458Google Scholar). Incorporation of radioactive-labeled copper into CuZn-SOD was found to be proportional to the level of PrP expression (12Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 423-429Google Scholar). Pattison and Jebbett (13Pattison I.H. Jebbett J.N. Nature. 1971; 230: 115-117Google Scholar) noticed more than 30 years ago the similarity between prion histopathology to the histopathology induced by a copper chelator, cuprizone. The incidence of chronic Wasting disease (CWD), a sporadic prion disease of deer and elk, was observed to be higher in regions where the soil had a low copper content (14Purdey M. Med. Hypotheses. 2000; 54: 278-306Google Scholar). Therefore, prion diseases may be related to an alteration of copper transport and a loss of copper-enzyme activities.In a previous work, we demonstrated that neuronal cells infected with prion strains resulted in an alteration of the molecular mechanism promoting cellular resistance to ROS (15Milhavet O. McMahon H.E. Rachidi W. Nishida N. Katamine S. Mange A. Arlotto M. Casanova D. Riondel J. Favier A. Lehmann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13937-13942Google Scholar). The same alteration of antioxidant enzymes was shown in infected animals (16Lee D.W. Sohn H.O. Lim H.B. Lee Y.G. Kim Y.S. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 499-507Google Scholar, 17Choi S.I. Ju W.K. Choi E.K. Kim J. Lea H.Z. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Kim Y.S. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1998; 96: 279-286Google Scholar). In the present study, we used a transfected transgenic cell line with a doxycycline-inducible murine PrPC gene to investigate the involvement of PrPC in copper metabolism and in the resistance mechanism to toxic stress.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used a cellular model derived from a heterologous epithelial cell line (RK13) in which the expression of murine PrPC was regulatable in a dose-dependent manner by a doxycycline treatment. Actually most epithelial cell lines we have tested, unlike, RK13, do express PrP. 2F. Archer and H. Laude, unpublished data. The RK13 cells were chosen because they express no detectable levels of endogenous PrP. The risk that endogenous PrP could interfere with the function of transfected PrP is therefore reduced. This may be a reason why we succeeded in a previous study to infect RK13 cells transfected with ovine PrP (18Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Google Scholar). It was then logical to generate a clone of cells overexpressing murine PrP, which is used for cell biology and transmission studies. RK13 cells are the only available cell lines allowing a PrP expression from zero to high levels. In the present work we used radioactive copper (64Cu) to study the effect of PrPC expression on copper binding and uptake.There is an increasing amount of data supporting a functional role for PrPC in copper metabolism. First the N-terminal half of PrPC contains five or six highly conserved octapeptide tandem motifs of the general form PHGGGWGQ, which are capable of binding copper ions with micromolar affinity (7Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Google Scholar, 8Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Google Scholar). Indeed, PrPC isolated from hamster brain can bind a copper affinity column (29Pan K.M. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1343-1352Google Scholar). Second, copper content of membrane-enriched brain extract from PrP−/− mice is 10–15-fold lower than in wild type controls while no significant difference was observed for other metals (8Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Google Scholar). Third, neuronal CuZn-SOD from PrP−/− mice showed decreased activity linked to decreased copper incorporation by the enzyme (10Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Google Scholar, 30Brown D.R. Wong B.S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Google Scholar). Neurons cultured from PrP−/− mice were also more sensitive to oxidative stress, perhaps because of the alteration of CuZn-SOD (10Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Google Scholar). However, the significance of copper binding on PrPC functions or the role of PrPCcopper metabolism has yet to be clarified. Several hypotheses have been proposed. Copper could have a role in the conformation of the protein (31Wadsworth J.D. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Google Scholar). PrPC could have a role in copper transport across the cell membrane, and this could follow different processes. Copper needs to be mobilized from its extracellular ligands (albumin and histidine), and Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) by unknown metalloreductases at the membrane surface prior to its delivery across the plasma membrane by the high affinity transporter CTR1 (32Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Google Scholar). These processes are still unclear. It is also possible that copper may be transported by more than one transport system, at least in some tissues. The cooperative copper-binding mode of PrPC within the physiological concentration range suggests a role in copper transport (33Kramer M.L. Kratzin H.D. Schmidt B. Romer A. Windl O. Liemann S. Hornemann S. Kretzschmar H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 27Google Scholar). So, the contribution of PrPC, if any, in copper uptake by cells could be a direct transport across the plasma membrane or a binding step allowing either the mobilization of copper from its ligand or its reduction prior to its effective transport by other systems.PrPC is normally attached to the cell membrane via a phosphatidylinositol anchor (34Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Google Scholar). It has been shown that the enzyme PIPLC releases PrPC from the cells into media (35Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5405-5412Google Scholar). Ourex vivo experiments confirm the copper binding activity of the PrPC protein, because we established a correlation between copper binding and PrPC expression. This finding was further confirmed when PrPC was cleaved with PIPLC prior to 64Cu labeling. However, our work does not support that PrPC could be involved in the copper transport across the membrane, as suggested by studies reporting histidine-dependent uptake of 67Cu proportional to PrPC expression in cerebellar cells derived from three lines of mice expressing various amounts of PrPC (36Brown D.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 717-725Google Scholar). However, Pauly and Harris (37Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Google Scholar) have reported that copper stimulates endocytosis of both mouse PrP and chicken PrP on the cell surface of N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells via clathrin-coated pits. They suggested that PrPC could serve as a recycling receptor for the uptake of copper ions from the extracellular milieu. Also, it has been shown that 100 μm copper resulted in the rapid endocytosis of biotinylated murin PrPC expressed in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (38Perera W.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Google Scholar). In these two studies the minimum concentration of CuSO4 required to produce an observable increase in PrPC internalization was ∼100 μm, which is 15-fold greater than the estimatedK d for binding to synthetic PrP peptides and recombinant PrP (7Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Google Scholar, 9Stockel J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Google Scholar, 39Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 993-999Google Scholar). In our work we used very low levels of copper, which we believe renders our results much closer to physiological conditions. In any case when high concentrations of copper (100 μm) are used in our cultures the intracellular copper level increased up to 2-fold in both total and soluble fractions in stimulated cells (see TableII). So, only under high copper concentrations PrPC expression increases copper uptake in the cell. However, our results clearly demonstrated that at physiological concentrations of copper, murine PrPC binds copper at the outer side of the cell membrane but also indicates that PrPC does not function as a copper transporter from the extracellular medium to the cytoplasm. This supports the hypothesis that PrPC may rather be an extracellular copper sensor (33Kramer M.L. Kratzin H.D. Schmidt B. Romer A. Windl O. Liemann S. Hornemann S. Kretzschmar H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 27Google Scholar).Murine PrPC may serve as a copper chelating or buffering agent in the outer side of the cell membrane, and this may serve to protect cells against toxicity of free copper ions or a copper and reactive oxygen species-dependent cleavage of PrP into the octapeptide repeat region. This process may be related to the function of the molecule in the response to oxidative stress and suggests that the binding of copper is important for its processing (40McMahon H.E. Mange A. Nishida N. Creminon C. Casanova D. Lehmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2286-2291Google Scholar).The link between copper and PrPC may explain the mechanism of neurodegeneration in prion diseases because copper and other transition metals play an important role in the neuropathology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (41Sayre L.M. Perry G. Smith M.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 220-225Google Scholar). Copper is an important component of various redox enzymes because of its ability to readily adopt two ionic states Cu(I) and Cu(II). Free copper is also a toxic ion, as exemplified by its ability to inactivate proteins through tyrosine nitration, and both deficiency and excess lead to disorders such as Menkes syndrome or Wilson's disease (42Mercer J.F. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 64-69Google Scholar), illustrating its physiological importance and duality in the central nervous system. In the absence of copper chelating agent on the cell surface, free copper could react with peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide produced by superoxide dismutation or directly by many enzyme catabolites such as monoamine oxidase, urate oxidase, glucose oxidase,d-amino acid oxidase, and others to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (⋅OH), which can initiate lipid peroxidation as well as protein oxidation and cause apoptosis. It has been shown that in the brain, highest concentrations of PrPC are found at synapses, and copper binding by PrPC in the synaptic cleft has a significant influence on synaptic transmission (43Kretzschmar H.A. Tings T. Madlung A. Giese A. Herms J. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 2000; 16: 239-249Google Scholar). Changes in electrophysiological properties such as long-term potentiation (LTP), circadian rhythm between PrP−/− and wild-type mice could be related to a disturbed copper uptake in PrP−/− mice (43Kretzschmar H.A. Tings T. Madlung A. Giese A. Herms J. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 2000; 16: 239-249Google Scholar). Stimulated A74 cells undergo high resistance to copper but not to manganese or cadmium toxicity when compared with unstimulated or control cells. This specific protection against copper toxicity may be due to the chelating or buffering effect of murine PrPC on the cell surface. Previously PC12, cells selected for resistance to copper toxicity and oxidative stress showed high levels of PrPC (44Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1997; 15: 961-972Google Scholar). Primary cerebellar granule culture derived from PrP knockout mice were significantly more susceptible to H2O2 toxicity than wild type; this toxicity was related to a significant decrease in glutathione reductase activity (45White A.R. Collins S.J. Maher F. Jobling M.F. Stewart L.R. Thyer J.M. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Cappai R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1723-1730Google Scholar) Moreover, increased oxidative damage to proteins and lipids was observed in the brain lysates from Prnp−/− as compared with wild type mice of the same genetic background (46Wong B.S. Liu T. Li R. Pan T. Petersen R.B. Smith M.A. Gambetti P. Perry G. Manson J.C. Brown D.R. Sy M.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 565-572Google Scholar, 47bio Klamt F. Dal-Pizzol F. Conte da Frota M.L. Walz R. Andrades M.E. da Silva E.G. Brentani R.R. n Izquierdo I. Fonseca Moreira J.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1137-1144Google Scholar). As oxidative stress has been frequently implicated in neurodegeneration it was very interesting to test the influence of PrP expression in stimulated A74 on antioxidant enzymes activities and resistance to oxidative stress. PrPCinduction in stimulated cells increases significantly CuZn-SOD, catalase, glutathione reductase activities, and glutathione levels in cells. In addition stimulated cells were more resistant to oxidative stress caused by SIN-1. This active metabolite of the vasodilatatory drug molsidomine is frequently used as a model for the continuous release of different free radicals: O 2⨪, NO⋅, and/or NOx, and other potent oxidants such as ONOO−(48Gergel D. Misik V. Ondrias K. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20922-20929Google Scholar). The relationship between PrPC and oxidative stress arose from results showing an alteration in cellular response to stress with the decrease in PrPC expression or conversion to the infectious form. PrP−/− mouse brains have reduced CuZn-SOD, and cerebellar cells derived from these mice were more sensitive to oxidative stress (10Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Google Scholar); increased levels of PrPC were linked to increased levels of CuZn-SOD activity because of an increase in copper incorporation (12Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 423-429Google Scholar). In our model, we believe that increased CuZn-SOD activity in stimulated cells is due to SOD-like activity of PrP-Cu complexes in the outer side of the cell membrane. Indeed, we detected no change in the protein levels of CuZn-SOD in stimulated and unstimulated cells (Fig. 8), and we demonstrated that copper stays at the outer side of the cell membrane. This antioxidant function in the outer of the cell membrane is very important, especially in neurons, to detoxify free radicals such as O 2⨪ and other toxic products like peroxynitrite (ONOO−), from reactions between NO⋅ and O 2⨪, which results in dose-dependent neuronal damage. Peroxynitrite has been reported to oxidize protein and nonprotein sulfhydryls (49Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Google Scholar), to induce membrane lipid peroxidation (50Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 481-487Google Scholar), and nitrotyrosine formation (51Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. van der Woerd M. Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Google Scholar). This nitrotyrosine formation markedly inhibits phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in vitro, possibly interfering with normal signal transduction pathways (52Brito C. Naviliat M. Tiscornia A.C. Vuillier F. Gualco G. Dighiero G. Radi R. Cayota A.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3356-3366Google Scholar). Recently PrPC was involved in signal transduction in neuronal cell cultures (53Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Google Scholar). In contrast, stimulated cells show decreased resistance to H2O2toxicity. This may be due to both the SOD-like activity of murine PrP (Fig. 7 B) and to the Fenton reaction via the increased amount of copper bound to the cell membrane. Stimulated cells show a large increase in glutathione levels and glutathione reductase activity. Glutathione, a tripeptide consisting of glycine, cysteine, and glutamic acid moieties, is a major antioxidant and functions directly in the elimination of ROS. Glutathione acts as a cellular redox buffer and even modest variations in GSH concentrations can strongly modulate redox state. It also may be involved in intracellular copper transport and homeostasis by chelating copper ions and diminishing their ability to generate free radicals. This relationship between PrPC and GSH may be explained by the high resistance to copper toxicity in our cell model when we overexpress murine PrPC and brain metal perturbations observed in scrapie-infected mice (54Wong B.S. Brown D.R. Pan T. Whiteman M. Liu T. Bu X. Li R. Gambetti P. Olesik J. Rubenstein R. Sy M.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 689-698Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have shown that expression of heterologous PrPC (murine PrPC) in rabbit kidney cells (RK13) increases copper binding but not uptake, and several antioxidant enzymes activities confer high resistance to oxidative stress. These findings are of major importance since oxidative stress is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. We can hypothesize that in prion diseases the conversion of PrPC to PrPScinhibited PrP copper binding. This inhibition could affect, the enzymatic activity of PrP-Cu complexes in the outer of the cell membrane and also, the regulation of the anti-oxidant system, which is PrP-dependent in neurons. In the future, it will be important to determine the influence of PrP conversion on copper binding in a similar model permissive to prion replication (18Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Google Scholar) and the influence of trace elements such as copper, zinc, or antioxidant on prion diseases as a new therapeutic agent to re-equilibrate the antioxidant deficiencies in these diseases. Prion diseases form a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders including Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases, Gerstmann-Sträussler Syndrome, Kuru and Fatal Familial Insomnia in humans, and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals (1Parchi P. Gambetti P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1995; 8: 286-293Google Scholar). All these disorders are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein PrPC, 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular isoform of prion protein; SOD, superoxide dismutase; dox, doxycycline; PIPLC, phosphoinositol phospholipase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; MDA, malondialdehyde acid; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of prion protein; MTT, (4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactants 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular isoform of prion protein; SOD, superoxide dismutase; dox, doxycycline; PIPLC, phosphoinositol phospholipase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; MDA, malondialdehyde acid; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of prion protein; MTT, (4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactants denoted PrPSc, which represents the major component of infectious prion diseases (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). The formation of PrPSc from PrPC is accompanied by profound changes in structure and biochemical properties. PrPC rich in α-helical regions is converted into a molecule with highly β-sheeted structures and partial resistance to proteolytic digestion (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 3Horiuchi M. Caughey B. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: R231-R240Google Scholar). The conversion of PrPC into PrPSc remains enigmatic. Biosynthesis of PrPC is necessary for PrPSc formation, as mice lacking PrPC are resistant to scrapie infection (4Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Google Scholar). Human PrPC has 253 amino acids and is mainly expressed on neurons (5Kretzschmar H.A. Stowring L.E. Westaway D. Stubblebine W.H. Prusiner S.B. Dearmond S.J. Dna. 1986; 5: 315-324Google Scholar, 6Kretzschmar H.A. Prusiner S.B. Stowring L.E. DeArmond S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 1-5Google Scholar). In its N-terminal region, a repeated sequence of five octapeptides can be found, which was shown to bind copper and zinc (7Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Google Scholar, 8Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H.

The protein may have some superoxide dismutase-like activity and therefore a possible protective function against oxidative stress (10Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Google Scholar). Wild-type mouse brains have a significantly higher level of membrane-associated copper than PrPC-deficient mice. Treatment with phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PIPLC) specifically reduced the copper content from wild type mice but had no effect on the copper content of PrPC knockout mice (8Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Google Scholar). However, these results have not been confirmed (11Waggoner D.J. Drisaldi B. Bartnikas T.B. Casareno R.L. Prohaska J.R. Gitlin J.D. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7455-7458Google Scholar). Incorporation of radioactive-labeled copper into CuZn-SOD was found to be proportional to the level of PrP expression (12Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 423-429Google Scholar). Pattison and Jebbett (13Pattison I.H. Jebbett J.N. Nature. 1971; 230: 115-117Google Scholar) noticed more than 30 years ago the similarity between prion histopathology to the histopathology induced by a copper chelator, cuprizone. The incidence of chronic Wasting disease (CWD), a sporadic prion disease of deer and elk, was observed to be higher in regions where the soil had a low copper content (14Purdey M. Med. Hypotheses. 2000; 54: 278-306Google Scholar). Therefore, prion diseases may be related to an alteration of copper transport and a loss of copper-enzyme activities. In a previous work, we demonstrated that neuronal cells infected with prion st"

Using catalytically inactive forms of ep24.15 and ep24.16, we have identified new peptide substrates for these enzymes. The enzymatic activity of ep24.15 and ep24.16 was inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues within their conserved HEXXH motifs, without disturbing their secondary structure or peptide binding ability, as shown by circular dichroism and binding assays.

Vincent J.P. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27266-27271Google Scholar) showed 80% similarity and 63% identity with the previously cloned rat testis ep24.15 (4Pierotti A. Dong K. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10323-10329Google Scholar). Both peptidases share most of their natural substrates, including bradykinin, neurotensin, opioids, angiotensin I, and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (5Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G.

All of these natural substrates are hydrolyzed at the same peptide bond and at similar rates, except for neurotensin, which is hydrolyzed by ep24.15 and ep24.16 by cleavage of its Arg8–Arg9 and Pro10–Tyr11 bonds, respectively (7Rioli V.

Functional studies have suggested that ep24.15 and ep24.16 inactivate neuropeptides inside and outside the central nervous system. The central administration ofZ-(Leu,Asp)Phe-ψ(PO2CH2)(Leu,Asp)Ala-Lys-Met, a fully specific endopeptidase ep24.15 inhibitor (8Jiracek J. Yiotakis A. Vincent B. Lecoq A. Nicolaou A. Checler F. Dive V.

Jiracek J. Noble F. Loog M. Roques B. Dive V. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 334: 49-53Google Scholar). Likewise, the intracerebroventricular administration of Pro-Phe-ψ(PO2CH2)-Leu-Pro-NH2, a selective ep24.16 inhibitor (10Jiracek J. Yiotakis A. Vincent B. Checler F. Dive V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19606-19611Google Scholar), significantly increases the neurotensin-induced antinociception of mice in the hot plate test (11Vincent B. Jiracek J. Noble F. Loog M. Roques B. Dive V. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 705-710Google Scholar). Outside the central nervous system,N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Aib-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate, an inhibitor of both ep24.15 and ep24.16, potentiates bradykinin-induced hypotension, which suggests that one or both of these peptidases participate in the metabolism of bradykinin (12Smith A.I. Lew R.A. Shrimpton C.N. Evans R.G. Abbenante G. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 626-630Google Scholar). In macrophages, CFP-AAF-pAb, a mixed inhibitor of ep24.15 and ep24.16 (7Rioli V. Kato A. Portaro F.C.V.

Evans R.G. Abbenante G. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 626-630Google Scholar). Conversely, liposome-mediated introduction of ep24.15 into macrophages stimulates the antigen presentation of MHC-I, but not that of MHC-II. The observation that ep24.15 can degrade or bind to several MHC-I antigenic peptides (13Silva C.L. Portaro F.C.V. Bonato V.L.D. Camargo A.C.M. Ferro E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Google Scholar), raises the possibility that ep24.15 and ep24.16 participate in the intracellular metabolism of peptides. The nature of such peptides is unknown. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE; peptidyldipeptidase A) is a zinc metallopeptidase that cleaves the COOH-terminal dipeptide from angiotensin I to produce the potent vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin II (17Skeggs L.T. Dorer F.E. Levine M. Lentz K.E. Kahn J.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1980; 130: 1-27Google Scholar) and inactivates bradykinin by the sequential removal of two COOH-terminal dipeptides (18Yang H.Y.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 214: 374-376Google Scholar). In addition to these two main physiological substrates, which are involved in blood pressure regulation and water and salt metabolism, ACE also cleaves COOH-terminal dipeptides from various oligopeptides with a free COOH terminus. ACE has also been implicated in a range of physiological processes unrelated to blood pressure regulation, such as immunity, reproduction, and neuropeptide regulation, based on its localization and/or the in vitro cleavage of a range of biologically active peptides. The role of ACE in blood pressure control and water and salt metabolism has been defined mainly by the use of highly specific ACE inhibitors (19Eriksson U. Danilczyk U. Penninger J.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 29: 745-752Google Scholar). These inhibitors are effective in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy (20Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1989; 247: 25-28Google Scholar, 21Ehlers M.R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 27: 5311-5318Google Scholar, 22Hooper N.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 641-647Google Scholar). Moreover, ACE has recently been implicated in the hydrolysis in vivo of the tetrapeptide Ac-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro, which modulates hematopoietic stem cell proliferation by preventing their recruitment into the S phase (23Rieger K.J. Saez-Servent N. Papet M.P. Wdzieczak-Bakala J. Morgat J.L. Thierry J. Voelter W. Lenfant M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 373-378Google Scholar). The acute administration of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, produces a 7-fold increase in the plasma concentration of Ac-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro in normal volunteers, thus demonstrating the importance of ACE in the metabolism of this substrate (24Azizi M. Rousseau A. Ezan E. Guyene T.T. Michelet S. Grognet J.M. Lenfant M. Corvol P. Menard J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 839-844Google Scholar). In this study, we show that ep24.15 and ep24.16, when catalytically inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues within their HEXXH motifs, can be used to identify new endogenous peptides present in crude peptide extracts prepared from rat tissues. The ep24.15 or ep24.16 enzyme-bound peptides were isolated and many of them fully sequenced by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Based on these sequences, synthetic peptides were prepared and shown to interact strongly with ep24.15, ep24.16, and ACE. One of the peptides identified here (PVNFKFLSH), derived from the α1 chain of hemoglobin, was among the best natural substrates identified so far for these enzymes, and caused dose-dependent hypotension in rats. This peptide, which we have named hemopressin, may have a role in blood pressure regulation and in cardiovascular disease. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce a specific point mutation in the wild type ep24.15 or ep24.16 cDNA cloned into the expression vector pGEX4t-2 (7Rioli V. Kato A. Portaro F.C.V. Cury G.K. Te Kaat K. Vincent B. Checler F. Camargo A.C.M. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Hirose S. Ferro E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 5-11Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized with mismatches coding for alanine, based on prokaryotic codon usage rules to obviate the use of rare codons that could hinder subsequent protein expression. Point mutations were specified as H473A, E474A, H477A, and E502A for ep24.15, and H474A, E475A, H478A, and E503A for ep24.16. PCR was done in a 50-μl mixture using 50 ng of template plasmid DNA, 14 pmol of each primer, 10 nmol of dNTPs, and 2.5 units of turbo Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in 0.5× Pfu polymerase reaction buffer. The thermocycler was programmed for an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min followed by 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 15 min, with a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. One microliter (20 units) of DpnI (New England Biolabs) was added to the sample (50 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The sample was then denatured at 65 °C for 30 min. Two microliters of the final sample were used to transform competent Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells by electroporation. Putative positive colonies were confirmed by double-stranded template dideoxy sequencing (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the wild type or mutant proteins for biochemical characterization were done as described (7Rioli V. Kato A. Portaro F.C.V. Cury G.K. Te Kaat K. Vincent B. Checler F. Camargo A.C.M. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Hirose S. Ferro E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 5-11Google Scholar), with all enzymes stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. The homogeneity of the recombinant enzyme preparations was assessed by electrophoresis under reducing conditions in 8% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS-PAGE, as described previously (26Matsudaira P.T. Burgess D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 386-390Google Scholar). Protein bands were detected by staining the gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). DNA was sequenced using a multicapillary MegaBace1000 sequencer, according to the protocol supplied with the DYEnamic ET dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Peptides were synthesized by the Resgen-Invitrogen Corporation using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. A crude peptide extract from rat brain or spleen was prepared as previously described (27Che F.Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Lakshmi A.D. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Google Scholar). Briefly, male Wistar rats were killed and the brain and spleen were removed and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −80 °C. Tissues from five rats were added to boiling 0.1m acetic acid and homogenized (Polytron, Brinkmann). The tissue homogenates were boiled for 10 min, centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through a Millipore centrifugal filter unit with a NMCO of 5,000. The filtrate was adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and then used in the experiments described below. Enzyme (1–5 nmol)-peptide complexes were produced by incubating a specific synthetic peptide or the peptide extract with catalytically inactive ep24.15 or ep24.16 in 200 μl of buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 125 mm NaCl and 0.1% of bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at room temperature. At the end of this period, the reaction mixture was layered onto a dried Sephadex G-25 column (previously washed and equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline followed by centrifugation to remove the buffer) and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 2 min. The flow-through (∼200 μl) was collected and the peptide content analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Chromolith performance column (4.6 mm × 100 mm; Merck), with a linear gradient of 5–35% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, for 20 min, and at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, as previously described (7Rioli V. Kato A. Portaro F.C.V. Cury G.K. Te Kaat K. Vincent B. Checler F. Camargo A.C.M. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Hirose S. Ferro E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 5-11Google Scholar). Control experiments were done by: (i) adding an excess of dynorphin A1–13 (30 μm) to the reaction mixture as a specific competitive inhibitor for ep24.15 and ep24.16, (ii) performing the assay in the presence of wild type active ep24.15 and ep24.16, and (iii) preforming the assay in the absence of ep24.15 and ep24.16 (reaction mixture containing only 0.1% of bovine serum albumin). Peptides were sequenced by positive nano-electrospray ionization (nano-ESI+) using peptide-containing aliquots collected during HPLC. Typical conditions were a capillary voltage of 1 kV, a cone voltage of 30 V, and a desolvation gas temperature of 100 °C. The protonated peptides were subjected to collision-induced dissociation with argon in the 15–45 eV collision energy range. All of the mass spectrometry experiments were done with a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK) in Qq-orthogonal time-of-flight configuration. Peptide sequences were determined manually from the ESI-MS/MS product ion mass spectra with the help of the PepSeq software (Micromass). The peptide bonds cleaved were identified by isolating the fragments by HPLC followed by ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry sequencing, as described above. To identify the putative protein precursors of the peptides sequenced by ESI-MS/MS, a protein data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) was searched for short, nearly exact matches (rodentia origin), as previously described (28Altschul S.F.

When the perfect match for a given peptide was not found in a large protein sequence, more than one putative protein precursor containing part of the identified peptide was listed. The enzymatic activity of wild type and mutant ep24.15 and ep24.16 was determined in duplicate in a continuous assay using the quenched fluorescent substrate (QFS) (7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-dLys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl), as previously described (29Shrimpton C.N. Glucksman M.J. Lew R.A. Tullai J.W. Margulies E.H. Roberts J.L. Smith A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17395-17399Google Scholar, 30Tullai J.W. Cummins P.M. Pabon A. Roberts J.L. Lopingco M.C.

ACE (Sigma) enzymatic activity was measured similarly using the internally quenched fluorescent peptide Abz-FRK(2,4-dinitrophenol)P-OH (31Araujo M.C. Melo R.I. Del Nery E. Alves M.F. Juliano M.A. Casarini D.E. Juliano L. Carmona A.K. J. Hypertens. 1999; 17: 665-672Google Scholar). The relative inhibition constants (K i) of the new synthesized peptides were determined in parallel with well known substrates or competitive inhibitors as a reference. The following equations were used to calculate the K i values: K i =K i,app/(1 + [S]/K m), where [S] = molar concentration of the substrate, K m = Michaelis-Menten constant, andK i,app = apparent inhibition constant, assuming [S] = K m (10 μm) (26). TheK i,app was calculated using the equation, V o/V i = 1 + [I]/K i,app, whereV o = velocity of hydrolysis without the inhibitor,V i = velocity of hydrolysis in the presence of the inhibitor, and [I] = molar inhibitor concentration. In a plot of (V o/V i) − 1versus [I], the slope is 1/K i,app. To determine theK i values, five solutions with synthetic peptide concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 μm were used to construct the graph (V o/V i) − 1 versus [I]. The relative hydrolysis ratio was determined using peptides at a concentration of 100 μm, under zero-order kinetics, with less than 10% of the substrate consumed by the end of the incubation period, which varied from 30 min to 2 h. The enzyme concentration varied from 5 to 50 ng/assay. All assays were done in triplicate. The secondary structure of selected mutants displaying a substantial decrease in catalytic and inhibitor binding capacity was examined by CD spectroscopy using a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter. The instrument calibration was verified using an aqueous solution of d 10-camphorsulfonic acid, and the CD spectra were collected in the wavelength range of 190 to 260 nm at 0.5-nm intervals, with a resolution of 0.5 nm, a response time of 0.5 s, a scan speed of 10 or 20 nm/min for 4 or 5 scans, a cell path length of 0.01 or 0.02 cm, and a temperature of 20–22 °C. Samples were prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Secondary structure estimation of the proteins was done using the SELCON3 algorithm (27Che F.Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Lakshmi A.D. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Google Scholar). For the CD experiments, protein concentrations were determined as described by Gill and von Hippel (33Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). For all other purposes, protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. To examine the action of peptides PVNFKFLSH, LVVYPWTQRY, and FDLTADWPL on blood pressure, male Wistar rats (∼200 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (>60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal; HypnolTM, Cristália, Itapira, SP, Brazil) and placed under a heating lamp to maintain body temperature. The trachea was cannulated to facilitate breathing, and the left carotid artery and left femoral vein were cannulated with polyethylene tubing for the measurement of arterial blood pressure and drug/peptide administration, respectively. The cannulas were kept patent with heparinized 0.9% (w/v) saline. The arterial pressure was recorded continuously via a pressure transducer (Abbott, Chicago, IL) coupled to a computer-controlled data acquisition system (Transonics Systems, Inc., Ithaca, NY). The experiments were initiated after at least 15 min for stabilization. Bradykinin (BK), angiotensin II, and peptides (PVNFKFLSH, LVVYPWTQRY, and FDLTADWPL) were dissolved and administered in 0.9% saline. For PVNFKFLSH, the doses tested ranged from 0.001 to 10 μg/kg, whereas for LVVYPWTQRY and FDLTADWPL, only two doses (10 and 100 μg/kg) were examined. The order of dose administration was randomized in all experiments. The responsiveness of the preparations was assessed by administering a single dose of BK (3 μg/kg) and angiotensin II (3 μg/kg) before peptides PVNFKFLSH, LVVYPWTQRY, and FDLTADWPL, and then at the end of the experiment to assess whether there was any alteration in the response to these two agonists. In separate experiments, enalapril (2 mg/kg, intravenously) was given 10–15 min before administration of the lowest doses (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 μg/kg) of PVNFKFLSH to assess the influence of ACE inhibition on the action of this peptide. In all cases, bolus intravenous injections (100 μl) of peptides were washed in a further 100 μl of saline. The animal protocols and procedures described here were done in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the general principles for the care and use of animals established by the Brazilian College for Animal Experimentation (COBEA). The blood pressure changes were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the peak changes in mean arterial blood pressure (in mm Hg) relative to the values recorded immediately prior to peptide administration. Differences between doses and treatments were compared using Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test, as appropriate. A value ofp < 0.05 indicated significance. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA encoding rat testis ep24.15 and pig liver ep24.16 was used to prepare mutants in which the histidine and glutamic acid residues of the HEXXH motif conserved within an active site α-helix were genetically substituted. Two additional glutamate residues carboxyl to the HEXXH motif, Glu502 in ep24.15 and Glu503 in ep24.16, were also mutated. The wild-type ep24.15 and ep24.16 have previously been expressed in DH5α E. coli in a catalytically active form that resembles the proteins isolated from mammalian tissue (7Rioli V. Kato A. Portaro F.C.V. Cury G.K. Te Kaat K. Vincent B. Checler F. Camargo A.C.M. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Hirose S. Ferro E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 5-11Google Scholar). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of transformed DH5α E. coli triggers a time-dependent overexpression of specific proteins, the apparent molecular weight of which corresponds to the calculated mass of ep24.15 or ep24.16 fused with glutathione S-transferase; the maximal production of the fusion proteins similarly reached a plateau by 4 h (data not shown). Proteolytic removal of glutathione S-transferase and subsequent purification of the recombinant proteins allowed the recovery of apparently homogenous peptidases based on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.1 A). The production yield (∼0.5 mg/liter of culture) was similar for all expressed proteins, suggesting that mutation of the above mentioned amino acid residues did not affect the relative levels of ep24.15 or ep24.16 expression in DH5α E. coli. To ensure that the mutated ep24.15 and ep24.16 had not lost enzymatic activity as a result of gross structural alterations during mutagenesis and subsequent protein expression, the secondary structures of these enzymes were compared with those of the catalytically active wild-type proteins. The CD spectra suggested that both ep24.15 and ep24.16 had a typical α-helix secondary structure (Fig. 1 B) that was not significantly modified by any of the mutations that inactivated the catalytic activity (Table I). The effects of individual mutations on the catalytic activity of ep24.15 and ep24.16 were assessed using a QFS. As expected, complete ablation of enzymatic activity was observed when point mutations were made for H473A, E474A, H477A, and E502A in ep24.15, or H474A, E475A, H478A, and E503A in ep24.16.Table IDeconvolution of the CD spectra shown on Fig. 1BTotal α-helixTotal strandTurnsUnorderedEP24.15 wtawt = wild type0.42 ± 0.050.16 ± 0.040.16 ± 0.030.27 ± 0.05H473A0.40 ± 0.050.20 ± 0.040.15 ± 0.030.26 ± 0.05E474A0.41 ± 0.050.20 ± 0.040.15 ± 0.030.26 ± 0.05H477A0.39 ± 0.050.16 ± 0.040.20 ± 0.030.26 ± 0.05E502A0.41 ± 0.050.16 ± 0.040.17 ± 0.030.25 ± 0.05EP24.16 wt0.47 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.010.26 ± 0.02H474A0.44 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.010.27 ± 0.02E475A0.47 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.010.13 ± 0.010.28 ± 0.02H478A0.44 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.010.15 ± 0.010.27 ± 0.02E503A0.44 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.010.15 ± 0.010.28 ± 0.02E510A0.44 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.010.15 ± 0.010.27 ± 0.02Secondary structure estimation of the proteins was performed using data in the wavelength range of 190–260 nm using CONTIN algorithm (32Sreerama N.

Following the structural characterization of the wild type and mutant ep24.15 and ep24.16, we examined whether the inactive enzymes would bind to bioactive peptides such as dynorphin A1–13 and bradykinin. Initial binding assays done with 125I-dynorphin A1–13 suggested a similar ability of all inactive enzymes to bind this peptide (data not shown). Therefore, the E474A and E475A mutants were selected for further experiments, as this specific glutamic acid is believed to be involved directly in substrate catalysis, whereas the other residues are involved in zinc ion coordination (19Eriksson U. Danilczyk U. Penninger J.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 29: 745-752Google Scholar). To further characterize the ability of the E474A and E475A mutants to bind bioactive peptides, such as bradykinin and dynorphin A1–13, enzyme-peptide complexes were allowed to form in solution and the excess of unbound peptide was removed by gel filtration. The resulting complexes were analyzed by HPLC. The results from these assays (Table II) supported the idea that catalytically inactive ep24.15 (E474A) and ep24.16 (E475A) retained the ability to bind bioactive peptides such as bradykinin and dynorphin A1–13.Table IIQuantitative measurements of the peak area of dynorphin A1–13(Dyn) and BK peptides separated by gel filtration, in the absence or presence of inactive ep24.15 (E474A) or ep24.16 (E475A)Peak areaAverage of first and second runResulting area relative to control experimentsFirst runSecond runDyn20,60519,65720,131Zero (control)Dyn + E474A, 1 nm51,39948,46049,92929,798Dyn + E474A, 5 nm105,235101,016103,12582,994Dyn + E475A, 1 nm59,85459,88059,86739,736Dyn + E475A, 5 nm72,57868,54970,56350,432Bk108,765114,469111,615Zero (control)Bk + E474A, 1 nm132,327137,971135,14923,534Bk + E474A, 5 nm148,450157,923153,18641,571Bk + E475A, 1 nm150,060153,752151,90640,291Bk + E475A, 5 nm164,417161,976163,19651,581The average of the two peaks areas obtained after gel filtration of the peptides in the absence of the inactive enzymes was taken as control (zero).

To assess the usefulness of these mutants for isolating new substrates for ep24.15 and ep24.16, the E474A and E475A mutants were incubated with a rat brain peptide extract and the enzyme-peptide complexes were separated from the excess of free peptides by gel filtration and then subjected to HPLC. The presence of either E474A or E475A in the incubation with peptide extract was critical for obtaining increasing amounts of specific peptide peaks, as shown in the HPLC chromatograms (Fig. 2). In control experiments without the inactive enzymes to complex and arrest the peptides, only small peaks were seen (Fig. 2). For the moment,"

These CDK11p110 complexes have been reported to influence transcription as well as interact with the general pre-mRNA-splicing factor RNPS1. Some of these complexes may also play a role in pre-mRNA splicing. Using a two-hybrid interactive screen, the splicing protein 9G8 was identified as an in vivo partner for CDK11p110. The identification of several splicing-related factors as CDK11p110 interactors along with the close relationship between transcription and splicing indicated that CDK11p110 might influence splicing activity directly. Immunodepletion of CDK11p110 from splicing extracts greatly reduced the appearance of spliced products using anin vitro assay system. Moreover, the re-addition of these CDK11p110 immune complexes to the CDK11p110-immunodepleted splicing reactions completely restored splicing activity. Similarly, the addition of purified CDK11p110 amino-terminal domain protein was sufficient to inhibit the splicing reaction. Finally, 9G8 is a phosphoproteinin vivo and is a substrate for CDK11p110phosphorylation in vitro.

These CDKs are not only regulated during the cell cycle, they are undoubtedly part of a much larger signal transduction pathway that is modulated by numerous extracellular and intracellular signals (8Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Google Scholar). A model is emerging in which the phosphorylation status of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) determines which specific transcription, RNA processing, and polyadenylation factors are recruited to the CTD (5Bond G.L. Prives C. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5310-5320Google Scholar, 7Hirose Y. Tacke R. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Google Scholar, 8Orphanides G. Reinberg D.

The CTD is heavily phosphorylatedin vivo, and a number of protein kinases, particularly CDKs, have been identified that modify this domain in vitro. CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9 are all known CTD protein kinases that regulate different aspects of transcription (10Akoulitchev S. Makela T.P. Weinberg R.A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1995; 377: 557-560Google Scholar, 11Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Google Scholar, 12Cujec T.P.

Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Google Scholar). Sequential phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues within the CTD appears to be regulated by this group of CDKs. These phosphorylation events have been linked to the changes in the composition of RNAP II complexes that are associated with transcription from pre-initiation through termination. However, a functional relationship between a specific CDK and the regulation of pre-mRNA-splicing events has only been inferred (14Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Google Scholar, 15Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25465-25473Google Scholar). Based upon the findings reported in this study as well as others (14Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Google Scholar,15Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25465-25473Google Scholar) demonstrating that the PITSLRE p110 protein kinases associate with the cyclin L regulatory protein, this protein kinase has been renamed CDK11p110. In a previous study, we found that CDK11p110 binds directly to the general splicing factor RNPS1 (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar), and here we show that this protein kinase also interacts with the splicing factor 9G8 and cyclin L in vivo as well. We, therefore, hypothesize that CDK11p110 may play an important role in the regulation of RNA transcript processing in addition to affecting RNA transcript production (17Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Google Scholar). Such broad protein kinase substrate specificity is not too surprising, because >20 isoforms of CDK11p110 are produced ubiquitously in all human cells (18Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-1579420Google Scholar). In addition, others have shown that TAT-SF1 U-snRNP complexes containing CDK9 and cyclin T proteins stimulate splicing in vitro, possibly facilitating the reciprocal activation of transcription and splicing events through its ability to function as a dual-function factor (19Deng L. Ammosova T. Pumfery A. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33922-33929Google Scholar). Here we show that the CDK11p110 protein kinases and associated regulatory proteins such as cyclin L are found in nuclear complexes containing pre-mRNA splicing factors in vivoby a number of criteria. These include immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analyses of the lysate from cells transiently transfected with tagged cyclin L and tagged 9G8 expression constructs as well as indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrating that CDK11p110 and 9G8 co-localize within portions of the nucleus. Furthermore, 9G8 is a phosphoprotein in vivo that can be specifically phosphorylated by the active but not the kinase-inactive form of CDK11p110 in vitro. Depletion of CDK11p110 by RNAi diminishes the amount of phosphorylated 9G8 in vivo as well. Finally, a functional connection between CDK11p110 and splicing was revealed by a combination of immunodepletion and dominant negative studies usingin vitro splicing assays. Thus, the data from this and previous studies show that general splicing factors including RNPS1 (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 20Mayeda A. Badolato J. Kobayashi R. Zhang M.Q. Gardiner E.M. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4560-4570Google Scholar) and 9G8 interact or co-localize with CDK11p110, that CDK11p110 protein complexes containing at least some of these factors are associated with the regulation of cellular splicing activity, and finally, that 9G8 is a phosphoprotein in vivo and that it is a specific in vitro substrate of the CDK11p110 protein kinase. The CDK11p110 bait cDNA was cloned into the pGBT9-DNA-binding domain vector to generate a hybrid protein containing the sequence for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in-frame with CDK11p110. This plasmid, pGBT9/CDK11p110, was then transformed into the yeast strain HF7C using a Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II kit (ZYMO Research). The yeast cells were then selected on a tryptophan-deficient medium. The positive yeast transformants were subsequently transformed with a human B-cell cDNA expression library that contained random cDNAs that had been fused in-frame to the GAL4 transactivator domain of expression vector pACT2 (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar). The transformed yeast cells were then grown on selective minimal plates (SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine) in the presence of 10 mmα-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The yeast clones grown on these triple nutrient-deficient plates were finally subjected to a β-galactosidase assay, and the resulting positive blue clones were selected for further DNA sequence analysis. HeLa Tet-Off cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2% glutamine, and 0.1% gentamicin. Transfections were performed using PolyFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PITSLRE/CDK11 antibodies P2N100 and P1C have been described previously (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 17Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol.

The polyclonal 9G8 antibody was prepared by continuous immunization of rabbits with the purified His6-tagged 9G8 protein (Rockland, Inc.). Commercial antibodies used in these studies included an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) as well as M2 antibody affinity gel (Sigma), a c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Clontech), an α-actin antibody (I-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and c-Myc-agarose beads (Clontech). The His6-tagged 9G8, CDK11p110 (kinase-active form), and CDK11p110-D552N (kinase-inactive form) recombinant proteins were prepared from SF21 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. For the purification of CDK11p110 and CDK11p110-D552N proteins, insect cells overexpressing the His-tagged proteins were lysed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This was followed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) affinity column purification of the His6-tagged proteins from insect cell lysates. Proteins eluted from nickel beads were further purified by DEAE and SP-Sepharose column with the BioLogic HR purification system (Bio-Rad). The 9G8 protein was purified under denaturing conditions. The insect cells expressing the His6-tagged 9G8 were lysed in 6m guanidine-HCl, 100 mmNaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The 9G8 protein eluted from the nickel beads was then re-natured in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol for 24 h. The re-natured 9G8 protein was subjected to further purification using DEAE and SP-Sepharose columns with the BioLogic HR purification system (Bio-Rad). The His6-P2N100 protein used as a dominant-negative competitor in the in vitro splicing assay was prepared as described previously (18Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-1579420Google Scholar). HeLa cells or HeLa cells transfected with the various expression plasmids for 24 h were lysed in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting cell lysates were then incubated with either anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) or anti-c-Myc-agarose beads (Clontech) for 4 h at 4 °C. Washes were performed five times using 1 ml of lysis buffer each time. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar). Orthophosphate labeling was performed on cells in which endogenous CDK11p110 protein levels were substantially reduced (i.e. >70%) within a 36-h time frame without the cells undergoing apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis and cell cycle of the CDK11p110 RNAi-treated HeLa cells were examined by annexin V staining and flow cytometry, respectively. RNA interference conditions were as follows. HeLa cells were treated with a CDK11p110-specific RNAi using pSUPER plasmid as described previously (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar). The sequence of the CDK11p110amino-terminal targeting region, 5′-GGGAGATGGCAAGGGAGCA-3′, corresponds to nucleotides 572–590 of the human CDK11p110 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number U04824). After 24 h of CDK11p110 RNAi treatment (the empty pSUPER was used as a control), the cells were transfected with pcDNA3/N-FLAG-9G8 for 8 h. 8 h post-FLAG-9G8 transfection, the cells were orthophosphate-labeled for 2-h using 0.5 mCi of 32Pi before harvesting the cells. The overexpressed FLAG-9G8 protein was then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads, separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. The corresponding gel bands of the labeled 9G8 were cut from the gel and subjected to Cerenkov counting in a scintillation analyzer (TRI-CARB 2100TR, Packard Instrument Co.). The various immunoblots were performed on cell lysates from HeLa cell lysates harvested 32 h post-RNAi treatment using the indicated antibodies employed as described throughout this study including anti-P1C specific for CDK11p110, anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and anti-M2 specific for the FLAG tag (Sigma). The 9G8/CDK11p110 protein kinase assays were carried out in a protein kinase buffer containing 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 100 μm ATP, 3–5 μCi [α-32P]ATP, 2 mm benzamidine, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.1 mm NaF using a final volume of 30 μl with 100 ng of the purified 9G8 protein and 30 ng of either the purified CDK11p110 or CDK11p110-D552N protein. The reactions were then allowed to incubate for 20 min at 30 °C and were stopped by the addition of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the corresponding gel was then dried and autoradiographed as described previously (18Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-1579420Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled β-globin pre-mRNA substrates were prepared by runoff in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase and BamHI linearized pSP64-HβΔE6 plasmid as the template (23Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Google Scholar, 24Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 309-314Google Scholar). The HeLa cytoplasmic S100 and HeLa nuclear extracts (NEs) used for the in vitro splicing reactions were prepared using 15 liters of cultured HeLa cells obtained from the National Cell Culture Center as performed by Mayeda and Krainer (25Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 315-321Google Scholar). For the preparation of the CDK11p110-immunodepleted nuclear extract, 2 mg of the HeLa nuclear extract was first incubated with 15 μg of the affinity-purified P2N100 CDK11p110 antibody at 40 °C for 2–4 h and the antibody was prepared as described previously (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 18Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-1579420Google Scholar). This was followed by subsequent incubation of the HeLa NE with 15 μg of the P1C monoclonal antibody and 15 μl of γ-bind-Sepharose beads at 40 °C for 2–4 h. The resulting CDK11p110-immunoprecipitated beads were removed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The remaining immunodepleted NE was then subjected to two additional rounds of CDK11p110immunodepletion by repeating this procedure. Normal rabbit IgG protein was used as a control antibody for these immunodepletion experiments.In vitro splicing reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl with 20 μg of NE and 20 fmol of32P-labeled pre-mRNA substrate followed by incubation at 30 °C for 1–3 h. The spliced RNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing 5.5% polyacrylamide, 7 murea gel (24Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 309-314Google Scholar). The CDK11p110-spliced dominant-negative protein competition assay was performed by adding 460 ng of the affinity-purified, truncated CDK11-P2N100 protein that had been expressed in insect cells to the same 25-μl splicing reaction containing the same components with the exception of the two CDK11 antibodies. The CDK11-P2N100 protein was allowed to pre-incubate with the NE for 5 min at 23 °C prior to the addition of the other reagents. The analysis of the spliced RNA products was performed as noted above. The CDK11p110 protein kinase has previously been shown to be involved in transcriptional elongation (18Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-1579420Google Scholar), presumably through its association with a number of transcriptional elongation factors. It has also been demonstrated that CDK11p110 interacts in vivo with the general mRNA-splicing factor RNPS1 (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 20Mayeda A. Badolato J. Kobayashi R. Zhang M.Q. Gardiner E.M. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4560-4570Google Scholar). Other CDK11p110-interacting proteins were identified by chromatographic purification and through the complementary use of two-hybrid yeast systems (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 18Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-1579420Google Scholar). To explore the possible function of the CDK11p110 protein kinase in more detail, we used the wild type CDK11p110 protein kinase as bait for yeast two-hybrid screening of a B-cell cDNA expression library and subsequently identified the splicing factor 9G8 as a novel and specific CDK11p110 interactor. The 9G8 protein belongs to the Ser-Arg-splicing factor protein family and plays a role in alternative splicing (26Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.P. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar, 27Popielarz M. Cavaloc Y. Mattei M.G. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17830-17835Google Scholar) as well as in promoting the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (28Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 899-905Google Scholar). To further verify the interaction between 9G8 and CDK11p110 in mammalian cells, we cloned the 9G8 cDNA into a mammalian expression vector with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope tag and then transfected this construct into HeLa cells. The anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was used to immunoprecipitate the transiently expressed tagged proteins after 36 h, and the products were further analyzed by immunoblotting using the CDK11p110-specific P2N100 antibody. This experiment demonstrated that the FLAG-tagged 9G8 protein specifically interacted with the endogenous CDK11p110 protein kinase, indicating that 9G8 is an in vivo partner of CDK11p110 (Fig.1 A). Evidence that CDK11p110, cyclin L, and 9G8 form a ternary complex in vivo is shown in Fig. 1 B. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either the expression vector only or with constructs expressing FLAG-tagged cyclin L and Myc-tagged 9G8 constructs. Cell lysates were then incubated with the M2 FLAG antibody, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the CDK11p110-specific antibody P2N100, the M2 FLAG antibody (which recognized the transiently expressed cyclin L protein), or an antibody specific for the Myc tag (which recognized the transiently expressed 9G8 protein). The results clearly demonstrate that CDK11p110, cyclin L, and 9G8 immunoprecipitate together as a single complex in vivo. Finally, when a membrane containing a CDK11p110 immunoprecipitation from HeLa cells was immunoblotted with the affinity-purified 9G8 polyclonal antisera, a doublet that migrated between ∼35 and 37 kDa in size was detected (data not shown). This result is consistent with the identity of this protein being 9G8 and also indicates that 9G8 was most probably one of the normal constituents of a portion of the CDK11p110 immunocomplexes found in HeLa cells. To delineate the domain(s) of 9G8 required for its interaction with CDK11p110 in vivo, a number of CDK11p110 truncation or deletion constructs tagged with the FLAG epitope were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated with the M2 antibody. This was followed by immunoblot analysis of the resulting immunoprecipitates using the affinity-purified 9G8-specific polyclonal antibody. 9G8 interacts with the amino-terminal portion of CDK11p110. More specifically, the RE-repeat region (29Gururajan R. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Gruber I. Ambros P.F. Kidd V.J. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 929-939Google Scholar) of the CDK11p110 protein kinase was identified as an important region necessary for 9G8 interaction in vivo (Fig. 1 C). This result is consistent with previous analyses of CDK11p110 functional domains, which indicate that this same region of the amino-terminal domain is necessary for the majority of the protein-protein interactions between this protein kinase and other proteins (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 17Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Google Scholar,21Trembley J.H. Hu D. Slaughter C.A. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2265-2270Google Scholar), whereas the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein encodes the catalytic domain of the protein kinase that is most homologous to CDK2 (18Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-1579420Google Scholar). Finally, the immunolocalization of CDK11p110 and 9G8 within HeLa cells was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. When indirect immunofluorescence was performed using the previously reported CDK11p110 monoclonal antibody (17Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Google Scholar) and an affinity-purified preparation of the newly prepared 9G8 polyclonal antisera, the two proteins were found to be co-localized within a substantial portion of the nucleus; however, this co-localization did not overlap entirely within the nucleus but only certain speckled regions (Fig.1 D). These immunofluorescence results are consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot experiments that are shown in Fig. 1, panels A and B. Previous results from other laboratories demonstrated that the CDK11p110 protein kinase also co-localizes with the splicing factor SC-35 using indirect immunofluorescence (14Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Google Scholar) and that SC-35 can apparently be phosphorylated in vitro by a cyclin L-containing immunocomplex (15Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25465-25473Google Scholar). Coupled to our previous results demonstrating an interaction among CDK11p110, RNPS1 (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar) and multiple transcriptional elongation factors (17Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Google Scholar), these data suggest that the CDK11p110 protein kinase can be found in multiple, distinct complexes containing both transcription and RNA-processing proteins. Because an in vivo interaction between 9G8 and CDK11p110 was established, it became important to investigate the possibility that 9G8 was an in vitroCDK11p110 protein kinase substrate. Therefore, we purified wild-type CDK11p110, CDK11p110-D552N (a catalytically inactive form of the protein kinase), and 9G8 proteins from baculovirus-infected insect cells expressing the corresponding proteins. The inclusion of the kinase-inactive form of the CDK11p110 protein kinase in the in vitrokinase assay was essential for this experiment, since we have previously shown that the casein kinase 2 protein kinase interacts and co-purifies with CDK11p110 (21Trembley J.H. Hu D. Slaughter C.A. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2265-2270Google Scholar). The inclusion of a kinase-inactive form of CDK11p110 also eliminates the possibility that another co-purifying or contaminating protein kinase is responsible for the in vitro phosphorylation of the 9G8 substrate. The apparent molecular mass of 9G8 purified from insect cells is ∼35 kDa, whereas its theoretical molecular mass is 27 kDa. Following orthophosphate labeling of both insect and HeLa cells, the 9G8 protein was immunoprecipitated using the affinity-purified antibody and it was found to be a phosphoprotein. 2D. Hu, A. Mayeda, J. H. Trembley, J. M. Lahti, and V. J. Kidd, unpublished observation. This may account for the difference between the apparent and theoretical molecular weights of 9G8 (this work and Ref. 26Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.P. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar). We then determined whether 9G8 could be phosphorylated by the CDK11p110protein kinase in vitro. The active wild-type CDK11p110 protein kinase as well as an inactive form of CDK11p110 (i.e. CDK11p110-D552N) as a negative control and appropriate bead controls were all included in this experiment (Fig. 2 A). This study demonstrated that the purified wild-type CDK11p110 protein kinase but not the kinase-inactive form of CDK11p110 (CDK11p110-D552N) is capable of phosphorylating 9G8 in vitro. To further determine whether 9G8 is indeed a phosphoprotein in vivo, the His6-tagged form of 9G8 was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus vector followed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column purification of the protein. The purified 9G8 protein was either treated or left untreated with alkaline phosphatase, and the gel then visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2 B). The untreated insect cell lysates containing the purified His6-tagged 9G8 contained two different molecular weight forms of the 9G8 protein, whereas alkaline phosphatase treatment of the same lysates containing purified 9G8 resulted in the loss of the slower migrating form of the protein. To finally demonstrate that the splicing factor 9G8 is a phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated by the CDK11p110 protein kinasein vivo and undoubtedly other kinases as well, we employed RNAi as the method to substantially reduce the levels of this protein kinase in cells. Previous work as well as unpublished work 3T. Li, A. Inoue, J. M. Lahti, and V. J. Kidd, unpublished observations. has demonstrated that the CDK11p110 protein kinase is essential for cell survival (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 17Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Google Scholar, 21Trembley J.H. Hu D. Slaughter C.A. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2265-2270Google Scholar); thus, RNAi (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar) was the method chosen due to the greater possibility so that the levels of CDK11p110 could be reduced transiently in HeLa cells long enough to perform the phospholabeling experiments involving 9G8. As shown in Fig.3, panel A, immunoblotting of the resulting cell lysate from untreated and CDK11p110-RNAi-treated cells shows that the endogenous level of this protein kinase has been reduced by >70% (this number was obtained after scanning the resulting autoradiograph). These same HeLa cells were also transfected with a FLAG-9G8 expression construct, and the expression of the 9G8 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting with an M2 FLAG-specific antibody (Fig. 3 A). Equivalent loading of proteins in the two lanes was verified by immunoblotting with an α-actin antibody control (Fig. 3 A). Of particular interest was the fact that the steady-state level of the slower migrating, phosphorylated form of the two 9G8-specific protein bands was also reduced ∼50–60% in the CDK11p110 RNAi HeLa cells. To conclusively demonstrate that the loss of the endogenous CDK11p110 protein kinase activity resulted in the diminished phosphorylation of the 9G8 protein, control and RNAi-treated HeLa cells were labeled with 32P-labeled inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) for 2 h and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using the same M2 FLAG-specific antibody from the first experiment (Fig. 3 B). Similar to the diminished level of the immunoreactive slower migrating FLAG-tagged 9G8-specific protein band (Fig. 3 A), the level of phosphorylation of this same band was reduced to 42% of the level of the identical band in the control lane in the cellular [32P]orthophosphate-labeling experiments (Fig. 3 B). Additional fine mapping of the specific residue(s) phosphorylated in 9G8 by CDK11p110 is currently being explored; however, the large number of potential Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites and tryptic peptides for the 9G8 protein are creating technical difficulties (e.g. a comparative analysis of two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps) that may take some time to overcome. Considering the experimental evidence suggesting that the CDK11p110 protein kinase is capable of forming multiple distinct multiprotein complexes with RNAP II in vivo that appear to have functions relevant to both transcription and RNA splicing (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 18Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-1579420Google Scholar), we decided to assess the possible role of the CDK11p110 protein kinase in regulating pre-mRNA-splicing activity. Because 9G8 encodes a known splicing factor, in vitro splicing reactions were first performed using a β-globin pre-mRNA template, which is known to be responsive to the addition of the 9G8 protein, as a substrate to verify that our cDNA isolate encoded a bona fide protein capable of stimulating in vitro splicing activity in a 9G8-dependent manner as reported by others previously (26Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.P. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar,27Popielarz M. Cavaloc Y. Mattei M.G. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17830-17835Google Scholar). The 9G8 protein purified from insect cells was added to the splicing-deficient cytoplasmic HeLa S100 cytoplasmic fraction, which is devoid of splicing activity, in increasing amounts, and the resulting splicing reactions and their products were then visualized by using denaturing PAGE analysis (Fig. 4). As expected, a dose-dependent increase in the production of the properly spliced β-globin products was observed, confirming the 9G8 dependence of this particular template using in vitrosplicing assays. To establish next whether the interaction between CDK11p110and 9G8 was functionally relevant, an affinity-purified form of the P2N100 antibody that targets the amino-terminal domain as well as a P1C monoclonal antibody that targets the carboxyl-terminal domain of CDK11p110 was used in combination to partially immunodeplete this protein kinase from HeLa cell NEs. The ability of these partially CDK11p110-immunodepleted extracts to facilitate splicing of the same 9G8-dependent β-globin template was determined by using a standard in vitrosplicing assay. As shown in Fig. 5,left panel, immunodepletion of the CDK11p110protein kinase complexes from the HeLa cell NE resulted in a dramatic decrease in the production of the properly spliced β-globin products that result from the splicing of the template by the exogenously added 9G8 protein. Furthermore, the re-addition of these same CDK11p110 immune complexes to the in vitrosplicing assays, again using the 9G8-dependent β-globin template, was able to substantially restore splicing activity. Because of the rather complex and dynamic nature of CDK11p110immune complexes, it is impossible at this time to add back individual recombinant proteins that represent each of the proteins that are present in these CDK11p110 immune complexes. Furthermore, a number of the CDKp110-interactive proteins from these immune complexes have not yet been identified. We hope to identify a sufficient number of the different protein members of these CDK11p110 immune complexes in the near future to attempt such an experiment. However, a separate and completely distinct approach to this type of experiment can be now performed using a dominant-negative form of the CDK11p110 peptide to disrupt the normal interaction of this protein kinase with other members of this large multiprotein complex. Previous experiments have shown that the interaction among the CDK11p110 protein kinase, 9G8 (this study), RNPS1, and casein kinase 2 (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 17Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Google Scholar, 21Trembley J.H. Hu D. Slaughter C.A. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2265-2270Google Scholar) requires the amino-terminal domain of CDK11p110. Therefore, a dominant-negative strategy was employed to further determine whether interfering with normal CDK11p110 protein/protein interactions would affect splicing activity in vitro by interrupting the formation of the multiprotein complexes necessary for these activities. We hypothesized that an excess of the same amino-terminal region of the CDK11p110 protein kinase used to generate the P2N100 antibody, which was used in the immunodepletion studies described above, might also be able to inhibit splicing activity by competing with the endogenous full-length CDK11p110 for interaction with the proteins that are required for splicing activity. Such an experiment would provide separate and independent confirmation of the involvement of the CDK11p110 protein kinase complex in the regulation of in vitro splicing activity, most probably through the splicing factor 9G8. To test this hypothesis, the amino-terminal fragment of CDK11p110 corresponding to the region of CDK11p110 that was used to generate the P2N100 antibody was affinity-purified from Escherichia coli and used as a competing protein in the in vitro splicing reaction. As shown in Fig. 5, this purified CDK11p110peptide fragment was capable of dramatically inhibiting splicing activity (Fig. 5, right panel), consistent with our hypothesis as well as the data from the immunodepletion studies. Thus, this type of assay further confirms independently the involvement of the CDK11p110 protein kinase in pre-mRNA-splicing events. In the this report, we have demonstrated that the CDK11p110 protein kinase exists in a large multiprotein complex with a previously identified regulatory subunit, cyclin L (14Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Google Scholar), as well as the essential splicing factor 9G8. Of some interest is the fact that others have suggested that cyclin L and CDK11p110, possibly because of its association with this cyclin regulatory partner, may act to regulate splicing factors (e.g. SC-35) (15Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25465-25473Google Scholar). These previous studies (14Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E.

However, we have shown here that 1) the splicing factor 9G8 interacts either directly or indirectly physically with the CDK11p110protein kinase in vivo, 2) that the 9G8-splicing factor is a phosphorylated protein in vivo and that it is phosphorylatedin vitro and in vivo by CDK11p110, 3) that the specific immunodepletion of CDK11p110 protein complexes from nuclear lysates results in a substantial loss ofin vitro splicing activity, whereas its re-addition appears to completely restore this in vitro splicing activity, and finally, 4) that a truncated, dominant-negative form of the CDK11p110 protein used to generate one of the CDK11p110 antibodies (i.e. P2N100) and used in the immunodepletion experiments is also capable of markedly reducing 9G8-dependent in vitro splicing activity. Thus, based upon a number of different types of experiments, we believe that one of the potentially important cellular roles of the CDK11p110 protein kinase is to regulate splicing activity, quite possibly through phosphorylation of the splicing factor 9G8. Although CDK11p110 appears to definitely contribute to the in vitro and in vivophosphorylation status of 9G8, we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that additional protein kinases may also play an important role in 9G8 function during splicing, particularly because there are so many putative phosphorylation sites within this protein. Even so, based upon the work in this study, the CDK11p110 protein kinase is the first CDK that has been functionally linked directly to the regulation of RNA-splicing events most probably through its ability to phosphorylate a splicing factor. In addition, based upon previous experimental evidence involving the CDK11p110 protein kinase, we feel that the protein probably has multiple important functions (16Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Google Scholar, 17Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol.

Others have suggested models of chromatin regulation in which different proteins are recruited to RNAP II complexes based upon the phosphorylation status of the CTD to regulate numerous important cellular functions including transcription, RNA splicing, RNA polyadenylation, and RNA capping (3Hampsey M.

At this time, we can only conclude that one of the major functions of the CDK11p110 protein kinase complexes containing the regulatory partner cyclin L appears to be to help coordinate the regulation of normal splicing and possibly transcription within cells. Finally, this work establishes yet another CDK with an important role in RNAP II regulation of transcription and/or RNA-splicing events, namely CDK11p110, in addition to the functions that are already attributed to three different CDK family members; namely, CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9.

A requirement for proteins to transport fatty acids across the plasma membrane would imply low partitioning of fatty acids into the membrane lipids, and/or a slower rate of diffusion (flip-flop) through the lipid domains compared to the rates of intracellular metabolism of fatty acids. We used both vesicles of the plasma membrane of adipocytes and intact adipocytes to study transmembrane fluxes of externally added oleic acid at concentrations below its solubility limit at pH 7.4. Binding of oleic acid to the plasma membrane was determined by measuring the fluorescent fatty acid-binding protein ADIFAB added to the external medium. Changes in internal pH caused by flip-flop and metabolism were measured by trapping a fluorescent pH indicator in the cells. The metabolic end products of oleic acid were evaluated over the time interval required for the return of intracellular pH to its initial value. The primary findings were that (i) oleic acid rapidly binds with high avidity in the lipid domains of the plasma membrane with an apparent partition coefficient similar to that of protein-free phospholipid bilayers; (ii) oleic acid rapidly crosses the plasma membrane by the flip-flop mechanism (both events occur within 5 s); and (iii) the kinetics of esterification of oleic acid closely follow the time dependence of the recovery of intracellular pH. Any postulated transport mechanism for facilitating translocation of fatty acid across the plasma membrane of adipocytes, including a protein transporter, would have to compete with the highly effective flip-flop mechanism.

FA are trapped in the cytoplasm by conversion to acyl-CoA and stored primarily as triglycerides in lipid droplets (reviewed in Glatzet al. (1Glatz J.F. van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Luiken J.J. Schaap F.G. van der Vusse G.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1997; 57: 373-378Google Scholar)). During lipolysis of stored triglycerides in the fasting state, FA are released from intracellular lipid droplets, move to and cross the plasma membrane, and are released into the interstitial space, where they bind to albumin. Subsequently, the FA pass through the endothelial cells or diffuse through the spaces between them to reach the blood. These large bidirectional fluxes could occur by several postulated mechanisms, both complex and simple. Cytological changes observed in adipocytes during release and deposition of intracellular lipid led to the complex model that large intracellular fluxes of FA occur by formation of vesicles from the plasma membrane of adipocytes and endothelial cells (2Slavin B.G. Anat. Rec. 1979; 195: 63-72Google Scholar, 3Slavin B.G. Intl. Rev. Cytol. 1972; 33: 297-334Google Scholar). It has also been postulated that caveolin, a protein present in invaginations of the plasma membrane (caveolae), plays a role in FA uptake (4Trigatti B.L. Anderson R.G. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 34-39Google Scholar). There are several other candidate proteins for enhancement of FA fluxes into adipocytes and other cells; for a detailed review see Ref. 5Frohnert B.I. Bernlohr D.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 83-107Google Scholar. These include the adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) located in the cytosol (1Glatz J.F. van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Luiken J.J.

Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 266-273Google Scholar). It is not clear whether these proteins enhance the transmembrane movement of FA or catalyze some other step in the overall process of FA uptake (16Hamilton J.A. Kamp F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2255-2269Google Scholar, 17Coe N.R. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I. Watkins P.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Google Scholar, 18Saier Jr., M.H. Kollman J.M. Mol.

The simplest mechanism is that FA diffuse freely and rapidly as monomers from the blood plasma to the cytoplasm (and the reverse) and cross cell membranes by permeation of their un-ionized form. For decades, this has been the paradigm for short-chain FA and other weak electrolytes (20Knittle J.L. Hirsch J. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 565-571Google Scholar, 21Rosen H. Leaf A. Schwartz W.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1964; 48: 379-389Google Scholar, 22Cramer J.A. Prestegard J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 75: 295-301Google Scholar, 23Chu S. Montrose M.H. J. Gen.

American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1978: 1-28Google Scholar, 25Zakim D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 212: 5-14Google Scholar). Membrane permeability coefficients for short- (e.g. acetic acid) and medium-chain (e.g.octanoic acid) FA are high and increase with increasing chain length (hydrophobicity), in accord with the Overton rule, up to a chain length of 12 carbons (24Dietschy J.M. Dietschy J.M. Gotto A.M. Ontko J.A. Disturbances in Lipid and Lipoprotein Metabolism. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1978: 1-28Google Scholar, 26Al-Awqati Q. Nat.

Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) have much lower water solubility (∼6 μm for oleic acid (28Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Google Scholar)) but bind to albumin in a transitory manner to enable large fluxes. Therefore, their permeability coefficients cannot be measured in the same way as those for short- and medium-chain FA (24Dietschy J.M. Dietschy J.M. Gotto A.M. Ontko J.A. Disturbances in Lipid and Lipoprotein Metabolism. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1978: 1-28Google Scholar). However, because LCFA bind more avidly than short-chain FA to phospholipid membranes, the Overton rule would predict that the membrane permeability of long-chain FA should be higher than that of medium-chain FA, as long as association, flip-flop, and desorption are not dramatically hindered by the longer alkyl-chain lengths (16Hamilton J.A.

In cell membranes, transmembrane fluxes of long-chain FA would be limited primarily by diffusion of FA monomers through the unstirred water layers adjacent to the membrane, a limitation that might be overcome by albumin (24Dietschy J.M. Dietschy J.M. Gotto A.M. Ontko J.A. Disturbances in Lipid and Lipoprotein Metabolism. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1978: 1-28Google Scholar,31Barta E. Sideman S. Bassingthwaighte J.B. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2000; 28: 331-345Google Scholar). Previously, we developed a method to monitor the transbilayer movement of FA that uses a fluorescent pH probe (pyranin) trapped inside phospholipid vesicles (32Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Google Scholar, 33Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Google Scholar). This method was designed to test the hypothesis that fatty acids in their un-ionized form will cross the phospholipid bilayer, reach ionization equilibrium in the membrane interface, and release protons that are detected by a water-soluble pH dye. Binding of FA at one side of the membrane is not sufficient to cause pH changes at the opposite site of the membrane, and dissociation of the proton from the FA (but not the desorption of FA from the membrane) is measured. Furthermore, natural FA instead of synthetic derivatives can be studied by this method. The changes in pH measured for several FA by stopped-flow fluorescence were extremely rapid (t 12 <50 ms (34Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Google Scholar)) and matched quantitatively the expected changes based on the vesicle diameter and buffer strength of the internal volume of the vesicles (33Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Google Scholar, 34Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Google Scholar). We concluded that LCFA flip-flop across model phospholipid bilayers readily in their un-ionized form (32Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Google Scholar, 33Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Google Scholar, 34Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Google Scholar). The desorption step from the vesicular membrane is slower than flip-flop but still fast (k off >1 s−1) for FA with an acyl-chain length of up to 18 carbons (35Massey J.B. Bick D.H. Pownall H.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1732-1743Google Scholar, 36Zhang F. Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16055-16060Google Scholar). On the basis of these properties in model membranes, the diffusion mechanism can be considered a viable mechanism for transport of FA across cell membranes (16Hamilton J.A. Kamp F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2255-2269Google Scholar, 25Zakim D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 212: 5-14Google Scholar, 29Hamilton J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 467-481Google Scholar, 37Zakim D. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 101-109Google Scholar). We also extended our measurements of the transmembrane movement of FA to cells with a trapped pH dye (BCECF), both in suspension (38Hamilton J.A. Civelek V.N. Kamp F. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20852-20856Google Scholar, 40Civelek V.N. Hamilton J.A. Tornheim K. Kelly K.L. Corkey B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10139-10144Google Scholar), and as single cells (41Caserta F. Tchkonia T. Civelek V.N. Prentki M. Brown N.F. McGarry J.D. Forse R.A. Corkey B.E. Hamilton J.A. Kirkland J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E238-E247Google Scholar). Decreases in cytosolic pH occurred immediately after the addition of FA to the external medium, supporting the hypothesis that FA diffuse across the plasma membrane by the flip-flop mechanism. Despite these new approaches and results from other laboratories supportive of rapid spontaneous flip-flop of FA in membranes (39Kleinfeld A.M. Storms S. Watts M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8011-8019Google Scholar,42Jezek P. Modriansky M. Garlid K.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 166-170Google Scholar, 43Pohl E.E. Peterson U. Sun J. Pohl P.

Some investigators have proposed that the unfacilitated transmembrane movement (flip-flop) of FA is the rate-limiting step for FA transport in model membranes (30Kleinfeld A.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 79-86Google Scholar,48Kleinfeld A.M. Disalvo E.A. Simon S. Permeability and Stability of Lipid Bilayers. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 241-258Google Scholar, 49Kleinfeld A.M. Chu P. Romero C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14146-14158Google Scholar). Moreover, some have argued that the flip-flop of FA in model membranes might be much faster than in biological membranes, where the different curvature, lipid composition, and the presence of membrane proteins might slow down FA diffusion (9Abumrad N. Harmon C. Ibrahimi A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2309-2318Google Scholar, 10Berk P.D. Stump D.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 17-31Google Scholar, 30Kleinfeld A.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 79-86Google Scholar, 50Schaffer J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E239-E246Google Scholar). Specific FA-binding proteins in the membrane might then catalyze the slow diffusion of FA across the membrane. Although mechanisms have not been established for the candidate transporters, one postulated mechanism is transport of the FA anion, as described in detail recently (51Stump D.D. Fan X. Berk P.D. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 509-520Google Scholar). It has been variously suggested that free diffusion does not compete well with protein-mediated transport of FA anions at low FA concentrations (9Abumrad N. Harmon C. Ibrahimi A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2309-2318Google Scholar,10Berk P.D. Stump D.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 17-31Google Scholar, 51Stump D.D. Fan X. Berk P.D. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 509-520Google Scholar, 52Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Google Scholar), or alternatively at high concentrations (50Schaffer J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E239-E246Google Scholar), or plays no significant role in FA uptake at any concentration (14Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Google Scholar, 15Stahl A. Gimeno R.E. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 266-273Google Scholar). In this study we focus on the adsorption and transmembrane movement steps of FA transport in the plasma membrane of adipocytes. We use a dual fluorescence approach to monitor the adsorption step at the same time as the flux across the membrane is measured. We present new evidence favoring fast adsorption and flip-flop of FA in vesicles prepared from the plasma membrane of adipocytes and in the plasma membrane of intact adipocytes. Protein-free SUV with trapped 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) (1 mm) were prepared by sonication as previously described (32Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Google Scholar). Intact adipocytes were prepared by collagenase digestion of the epididymal fat pads of 2 to 4 male rats (180–200 g) as described (40Civelek V.N. Hamilton J.A. Tornheim K. Kelly K.L. Corkey B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10139-10144Google Scholar). BCECF was trapped by incubating for 30 min with 1 μm BCECF-AM at 37 °C under gentle shaking and washing the cells with albumin-free Krebs buffer (40Civelek V.N. Hamilton J.A. Tornheim K. Kelly K.L. Corkey B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10139-10144Google Scholar). Epididymal fat cells were isolated as above from 20 male rats as described (40Civelek V.N. Hamilton J.A. Tornheim K. Kelly K.L. Corkey B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10139-10144Google Scholar) and subsequently homogenized in buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.40) containing 0.5 mm of the fluorescent probe pyranin. The plasma membrane fraction was isolated by differential centrifugation according to Simpson et al. (53Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Google Scholar) as modified by Kublaoui et al. (54Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Google Scholar), and the untrapped pyranin was removed by gel filtration (Sephadex G-25). The phospholipid and protein contents of the obtained PMV and adipocytes were determined with standard assays (55Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. Rock M.K. J. Biol.

Homogenization of the vesicles by extrusion was not successful, possibly because of the high protein content. Electron micrographs (negative stain) showed that the vesicle population of the preparation was heterogeneous in size and lamellarity yet included a significant fraction of large unilamellar vesicles with a diameter of 100 to 500 nm. Adipocyte PMV made using this protocol have the right-side-out orientation, according to independent analyses of insulin receptor orientation (57Jarett L. Fleischer S. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology. XXXI. Academic Press, New York1974: 60-71Google Scholar). Pyranin, BCECF, and its acetoxymethylester (BCECF-AM) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Vesicles (SUV or plasma membrane vesicles) were suspended in a stirred polystyrene cuvette containing 2.5 ml of buffer at pH 7.4 and 20 °C with, in some cases, 0.2 μm of the engineered fatty acid-binding protein ADIFAB (Molecular Probes). Measurements were done with a SPEX Fluoromax fluorimeter with the sampling time set to 1.0 s (the mixing time in the cuvette). The fluorescence of pyranin was measured using excitation at 455 nm and emission at 509 nm with a 2-nm bandpass. For ADIFAB, excitation was at 390 nm and the emission at 505 nm; 432 nm was sampled alternately with 2.0-s time intervals, and the fluorescence ratio (R) was calculated (bandpass 3–5 nm). For BCECF, excitation wavelengths 439 (pH-dependent) and 505 nm (pH-independent) were used and emission at 535 nm was measured (sampling time, 2.0 s; bandpass 3 nm). Intact adipocytes (106 cells/ml) were suspended in a well stirred cuvette with 2 ml of albumin-free Krebs buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.2 μm ADIFAB at 37 °C. The fluorescent signals of BCECF and ADIFAB were sampled simultaneously, with 4.0-s time intervals, and their fluorescence ratios were evaluated (3-nm bandpass). There was no interference between the signals of BCECF and ADIFAB at the chosen wavelengths. The relationship between internal pH and the BCECF fluorescence ratio was calibrated by permeabilizing the cells or SUV to H+ with 1 μm nigericin (a K+/H+ exchanger) and to K+ with 1 μm valinomycin. The external pH was adjusted with aliquots of KOH (33Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Google Scholar), and the pH was measured with a mini-pH electrode. pH equilibration was ensured by the two ionophores and the relatively high K+ concentration on both sides of the membrane. The fluorescent FA indicator ADIFAB (FFA Sciences, San Diego, CA) was dissolved (0.2 μm) in the buffer used for measurements with PMV or cells. The concentration of unbound aqueous oleic acid ([OA]a) was calculated from [OA]a =K d · 19.5 · (R −R 0)/(11.5-R), whereK d = 0.28 μm for OA, and Ris the fluorescence ratio of ADIFAB. The value ofR 0 was provided by FFA Sciences, or was measured when [OA]a was assumed to be zero (58Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 87-94Google Scholar). [9,10-3H]Oleic acid was used to monitor incorporation of exogenous oleic acid into esterified products. 50 nmol of OA* (i.e. OA with a fraction of labeled OA, 1000 dpm/nmol) was added to 2.0 ml of adipocytes in suspension (106 cells/ml) at 37 °C. All reactions were stopped by mixing the cell suspension with 10 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) at chosen time intervals after addition of OA* (10 s, 1, 5, and 20 min). The lipid phase was extracted according to the method of Folchet al. (59Folch L. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar) and concentrated by evaporating the organic solvent under a stream of nitrogen gas. The mixture of products was subsequently redissolved in 100 μl of chloroform and separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC; hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid, 80:20:1). Because the lipid extract was overwhelmed with triglycerides, unlabeled lipids (diglycerides, phospholipids, and oleic acid) were added as indicators of the minor components. The developed TLC plate was visualized in iodine vapor, and the corresponding lipid components were scraped off and quantified by scintillation counting. Changes in internal pH upon addition of external FA have been observed both in protein-free model membranes and in cells. The rapid flip-flop of un-ionized FA in model membranes does not guarantee that FA redistribute quickly across the plasma membrane of cells by the same mechanism (30Kleinfeld A.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 79-86Google Scholar, 60Krischer S.M. Eisenmann M. Mueller M.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12884-12891Google Scholar). In addition, the observed internal acidification upon the addition of FA to cells might be attributed to an indirect effect on cell metabolism (9Abumrad N. Harmon C. Ibrahimi A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2309-2318Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cytosol contains an abundance of intracellular membranes and FABP that could affect pH changes following exposure to FA. To address such questions, we applied our flip-flop assay (32Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Google Scholar, 33Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Google Scholar) to vesicles prepared from the plasma membrane of rat epididymal fat cells. The isolated PMV contain proteins (including putative FA transport proteins) but do not metabolize FA in the absence of essential co-factors and reactants in the cytosolic compartment. PMV with trapped pyranin were suspended in buffer, and an aliquot of oleic acid (10 nmol, corresponding to a final concentration in the cuvette of 4 μm) was added to the buffer (Fig.1). The pyranine fluorescence intensity dropped, corresponding to a drop in internal pH. This change occurred within a few seconds, the time resolution (mixing time) of the experiment. Furthermore, as with protein-free phospholipid vesicles, the pH gradient persisted because of very slow leakage of H+. We attribute the pH change to fast translocation of un-ionized FA across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane followed by ionization of FA in the inner leaflet, as observed previously in protein-free vesicles (29Hamilton J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 467-481Google Scholar, 32Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Google Scholar, 33Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Google Scholar). Because ionized FA translocate very slowly, as shown previously in experiments with valinomycin (33Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Google Scholar), transport of cyclic H+ is limited and the generated pH gradient dissipates very slowly. To test further our hypothesis that the movement of un-ionized FA through the plasma membrane of adipocytes occurred through the lipid domains (phospholipid bilayer) of the plasma membrane, we addressed whether the added FA bind primarily to the lipid domains or to membrane proteins. The partitioning of FA between the membrane and adjacent water phases could be qualitatively and quantitatively different for plasma membranes compared to protein-free model membranes because of the high protein content of the former. Using the fluorescent FA indicator ADIFAB (58Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 87-94Google Scholar, 61Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Google Scholar), we investigated whether a single partition coefficient can describe FA distribution between the aqueous phase and PMV in the same way as for protein-free model membranes (58Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 87-94Google Scholar). Plasma membrane vesicles were suspended in buffer containing 0.2 μm ADIFAB. The concentration of unbound oleic acid in the water phase outside the vesicles ([OA]a) was evaluated (“Experimental Procedures”) usingR 0 = 0.33. Before oleic acid was added to the suspension of PMV, [OA]a was already 0.24 μm(Fig. 2), most likely because of FA present in the plasma membrane, some of which might have been produced by hydrolysis during the preparation of PMV. When oleic acid was added in aliquots of 2 μm, the ADIFAB fluorescence ratio increased, and the calculated [OA]a increased linearly with the total concentration of OA. Because the solubility limit of oleic acid is about 6 μm (28Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Google Scholar), we assumed that after each addition the added oleic acid bound to the PMV, and that no oleic acid precipitated or bound to the walls of the cuvette (58Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 87-94Google Scholar). The concentration of oleic acid in the membrane phase, [OA]m, is then equal to the difference between the total added oleic and the unbound oleic acid in the water phase after equilibration. Independently, we determined the amount of phospholipid in the PMV preparation (76 μm phospholipid for each experiment illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3) by chemical analysis (“Experimental Procedures”). The volume of the phospholipid phase (V m) was calculated assumingV m/V a = 10−3/(mm phospholipid), whereV a is the volume (2.5 ml) of the water phase (61Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2 encompassed a wide range of concentrations of OA, up to 25 mol % with respect to phospholipid. Partitioning was quantitated from the linear relationship between the membrane-bound oleic acid calculated after every addition of oleic acid (Fig. 2) and [OA]a (not shown). The apparent coefficient (K p = [OA]m/[OA]a) evaluated from the slope was 1.0 × 106, similar to theK p for protein-free vesicles (58Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 87-94Google Scholar, 61Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Google Scholar). When the experiment was repeated with PMV prepared from adipocytes preincubated with insulin, we obtained results (not shown) very similar to those show"
https://openalex.org/W1994156236,"NFBD1/KIAA0170 is a nuclearfactor with an N-terminal FHA (forkhead-associated) domain and a tandem repeat of BRCT (breastcancer susceptibility gene-1 C terminus)domains, both of which are present in a number of proteins involved in DNA repair and/or DNA damage signaling pathways. We have investigated the association of NFBD1 with DNA damage responses. We found that the NFBD1transcript is abundant in the testis relative to other tissues. NFBD1 is a chromatin-associated protein and is modified in G2/M phase or after DNA damage. NFBD1 phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation (IR) was ATM-dependent. NFBD1 exhibited diffuse nuclear staining in the majority of untreated cells analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence and formed discrete nuclear foci after exposure to IR, UV radiation, and hydroxyurea treatment. IR induced NFBD1 foci within 1 min. The foci colocalized with γ-H2AX foci, which have been previously shown to localize at sites of DNA double-strand breaks. IR-induced NFBD1 foci also colocalized with 53BP1 and MRE11/RAD50 foci. Taken together, these results suggest that NFBD1 is a mediator of DNA damage-dependent signaling.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1 pose serious threats to genome stability. DSBs can be induced by exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation (IR), by endogenously generated free radicals produced during normal cellular metabolic reactions, or by replication stress (1van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Google Scholar). DSBs are also naturally occurring intermediates in normal cellular processes such as meiotic recombination and V(D)J recombination (1van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Google Scholar). A sophisticated surveillance network, including checkpoint controls, exists in all eukaryotes to detect and repair damaged DNA before a cell moves on to the next phase of the cell cycle (2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar). One of the earliest events in the cellular response to DSBs is the phosphorylation of a histone H2A variant, H2AX, at sites of DNA damage (3Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Google Scholar, 4Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Google Scholar, 5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Google Scholar). H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated (within 1 min) at an evolutionarily conserved residue, Ser139, when DSBs are induced in mammalian cells, resulting in discrete phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) foci at or near the DNA damage sites. Immunofluorescence studies have revealed that γ-H2AX forms nuclear foci at the sites of DSBs (4Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Google Scholar, 5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Google Scholar). The number of foci increases in the first 10–30 min after irradiation before they gradually decline, correlating with the number of slowly rejoining DSBs (5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Google Scholar). γ-H2AX foci are also found at sites of V(D)J recombination-induced DSBs in developing thymocytes (6Chen H.T. Bhandoola A. Difilippantonio M.J. Zhu J. Brown M.J. Tai X. Rogakou E.P. Brotz T.M. Bonner W.M. Ried T. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2000; 290: 1962-1965Google Scholar), at sites of recombinational DSBs during meiosis (7Mahadevaiah S.K. Turner J.M. Baudat F. Rogakou E.P. de Boer P. Blanco-Rodriguez J. Jasin M. Keeney S. Bonner W.M. Burgoyne P.S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 271-276Google Scholar), and at sites of stalled replication forks (8Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Google Scholar). Thus, γ-H2AX foci are indicators of the presence of DSBs in vivo. Lack of H2AX causes genome instability in mice (9Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Sedelnikova O.A. Reina-San-Martin B. Coppola V. Meffre E. Difilippantonio M.J. Redon C. Pilch D.R. Olaru A. Eckhaus M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Tessarollo L. Livak F. Manova K. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2002; 296: 922-927Google Scholar). H2ax −/− cells fail to recruit DNA damage signaling and repair factors such as NBS1 (Nijmegen breakagesyndrome-1), 53BP1 (p53-bindingprotein-1), and BRCA1 (breastcancer susceptibility gene-1), but not RAD51, to irradiation-induced foci (9Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Sedelnikova O.A. Reina-San-Martin B. Coppola V. Meffre E. Difilippantonio M.J. Redon C. Pilch D.R. Olaru A. Eckhaus M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Tessarollo L. Livak F. Manova K. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2002; 296: 922-927Google Scholar). Thus, H2AX is critical for facilitating the assembly of specific DNA repair complexes on damaged DNA. DNA damage activates a cascade of protein kinases that relay the signal to downstream effectors to halt the cell cycle and that facilitate repair of the damage (2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the serine/threonine kinase Mec1 is a master regulator of cellular responses to DNA damage. In response to DNA damage, Rad9 is phosphorylated in aMEC1-dependent manner (10Emili A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 183-189Google Scholar, 11Sanchez Y. Desany B.A. Jones W.J. Liu Q. Wang B. Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 271: 357-360Google Scholar, 12Sun Z. Fay D.S. Marini F. Foiani M. Stern D.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 395-406Google Scholar); and in turn, phosphorylated Rad9 apparently recruits another serine/threonine kinase, Rad53, to the Mec1 complex for activation (13Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Google Scholar, 14Vialard J.E. Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5679-5688Google Scholar). (Note that budding yeast Rad9 is unrelated to human RAD9.) Alternatively, phosphorylated Rad9 oligomers may act as a scaffold to bring Rad53 molecules into close proximity to each other, facilitating cross-phosphorylation between Rad53 molecules and subsequent release of activated Rad53 (15Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Google Scholar). Rad9 also regulates activation of Chk1, another important effector kinase of Mec1, in the G2/M checkpoint (16Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Google Scholar). Mec1 belongs to the family of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). In mammals, these kinases include ATM (ataxia-telangiectasiamutated) and ATR (ATM- andRad3-related). ATM, which is not essential for development, mediates the early response to DNA DSBs, and its inactivation in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia leads to checkpoint defects and genome instability (17Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar). Rad53 is an FHA (forkhead-associated) domain-containing kinase, and its human ortholog is CHK2.CHK2 mutations have been found in some Li-Fraumeni syndrome kindreds that do not have p53 mutations (18Bell D.W.

Blood. 2002; 99: 3075-3077Google Scholar). IR-dependent CHK2 activation requires that its FHA domain be functional (24Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar) and isATM-dependent (25Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar). The Rad9 checkpoint protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its ortholog Crb2/Rhp9 inSchizosaccharomyces pombe share sequence similarity primarily within their tandem repeat of C-terminal BRCT (BRCA1 C terminus) domains. The only human genes encoding proteins with tandem repeats of C-terminal BRCT domains are BRCA1, 53BP1, andNFBD1/KIAA0170. This has suggested that one or more of these proteins may serve budding yeast Rad9-like functions in coupling ATM and ATR to CHK2. Although BRCA1 interacts with and is a substrate of CHK2, BRCA1 is not required for CHK2 activation after IR (26Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar). However, BRCA1 regulates CHK1 activation in the G2/M checkpoint (27Yarden R.I. Pardo-Reoyo S. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Brody L.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 285-289Google Scholar). 53BP1 is phosphorylated in anATM-dependent manner in response to IR (28Anderson L. Henderson C. Adachi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1719-1729Google Scholar, 29Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Google Scholar). 53BP1 forms discrete nuclear foci after IR, UV radiation, and replication block (28Anderson L. Henderson C. Adachi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1719-1729Google Scholar, 29Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Google Scholar, 30Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Google Scholar). 53BP1 foci colocalize with γ-H2AX foci (29Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Google Scholar, 30Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Google Scholar). Thus, 53BP1 may bind to DNA DSBs (29Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Google Scholar, 30Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Google Scholar). Recently, 53BP1 was shown to interact with CHK2 and to be required for CHK2 activation (31Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Google Scholar). Thus, Rad9-like checkpoint functions in mammals may be carried out by multiple BRCT domain-containing proteins. NFBD1/KIAA0170 was first described as an expressed sequence tag clone in the HUGE (human unidentifiedgene-encoded large proteins) Database (32Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tanaka A. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 17-24Google Scholar). 2Available at www.kazusa.or.jp/huge/gfpage/KIAA0170/.2Available at www.kazusa.or.jp/huge/gfpage/KIAA0170/. The NFBD1gene was mapped to 6pter-6p21.31, within the major histocompatibility complex class I locus. It is one of the genes located within 1.7 megabases flanked by chromosomal markers D6S265 and D6S273. Loss of heterozygosity at these markers occurs in >50% of cervical carcinomas (33Chatterjee A. Pulido H.A. Koul S. Beleno N. Perilla A. Posso H. Manusukhani M. Murty V.V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2119-2123Google Scholar). NFBD1 encodes a nuclearfactor with an N-terminal FHA domain and a tandem repeat ofBRCT domains, both of which are present in a number of proteins involved in the DNA repair and/or DNA damage signaling pathways (34Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar, 35Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Google Scholar, 36Tsai M.D. Structure. 2002; 10: 887-888Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether NFBD1 is involved in DNA damage signaling pathways. We found that NFBD1 quickly localized to DSB sites along with other DNA damage signaling and repair factors. A clone in the HUGE Database (GenBankTM/EBI accession number D79992) containing the entire coding sequence of NFBD1/KIAA0170 was obtained from Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). For expression in mammalian cells, NFBD1-coding sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3xHA-Neo, resulting in pcDNA-HANFBD1. Internal deletion mutants were generated from pcDNA-HANFBD1 by subcloning using appropriate restriction enzymes. Plasmid constructs were verified by sequence analysis. 3Primer sequences and detailed cloning strategies are available upon request. A SmaI-XbaI fragment encoding a polypeptide from residues 142 to 568 was released from pcDNA-HANFBD1 and subcloned into the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) vector pGEX4T-3. The resulting construct was used to produce GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The GST fusion protein, purified as described (26Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar), was used to immunize rabbits for antibody production (Yale Animal Resources Center). Antibodies were purified from crude sera on a protein G/protein A-agarose column (Calbiochem) and then an affinity column conjugated to the antigenic GST fusion protein. The final concentration of the purified antibodies was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Mouse anti-53BP1 monoclonal antibody was a kind gift of Thanos D. Halazonetis (Wistar Institute) (30Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Google Scholar). Also used were rabbit and mouse IgG (Sigma), mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal (16B12, Covance), anti-BRCA1 (Ab-1,Calbiochem), anti-ORC2 (clone 920-4-41, Pharmingen), anti-GRB2 (clone 81, Transduction Laboratories), anti-β-actin (clone AC15, Sigma), anti-MRE11 (clone 12D7, GeneTex), anti-phospho-Ser139 H2AX (clone JBW301, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and rabbit anti-phospho-Ser345 CHK1 (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies. For immunoprecipitations, antigen-antibody complexes were recovered with protein G/protein A-agarose. Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce), and fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Human tissue mRNA blots (Clontech and OriGene) were probed using aSmaI-XbaI fragment from pcDNA- HANFBD1 labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A probe for mouse Nfbd1was derived from a mouse expressed sequence tag clone (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AW106340) encoding putative mouse NFBD1. The sequence of this expressed sequence tag clone and similarity to a portion of human NFBD1 were verified by end-to-end sequencing. A mouse tissue mRNA blot (Clontech) was probed with an EcoRI-SacI fragment encoding the first 490 amino acids derived from this cDNA. ATM-deficient SV40-transformed human GM5849C fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ). Other cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. Transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a ratio of 1 μg of plasmid to 2 μl of FuGENE 6. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting NFBD1 was prepared by annealing two 21-ribonucleotide oligonucleotides, 5′-UCC UGA GAC CUC CUA AGG UTT-3′ and 5′-ACC UUA GGA GGU CUC AGG ATT-3′ (Dharmacon Research). The scrambled siRNA duplex sequences were 5′-GUU CAC UCA UGA UCG AGC CTT-3′ and 5′-GGC UCG AUC AUG AGU GAA CTT-3′. HeLa cells were transfected with the siRNA duplex using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and analyzed 60 h after transfection. 48–60 h after transfection, cells were irradiated in a Shepherd Mark I137Cs irradiator at a dose rate of 1.75 gray (Gy)/min. Cells were UV-irradiated at a dose of 50 J/m2with a Stratagene cross-linker 48–60 h after transfection. 48–60 h after transfection, cells were treated with 1 mmhydroxyurea (Sigma) for 24 h. HeLa cells were grown in the presence of 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 18 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and grown in fresh medium without thymidine for 8 h. Thymidine was added again to 2 mmto block cells at G1/S. After another 18 h, cells were transferred to fresh medium, and samples were harvested every 2 h for a period of 16 h. To arrest cells in mitosis, cells were first treated with 2 mm thymidine, released into fresh medium for 3–4 h, and then blocked with medium containing 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h. Floating cells were collected, washed with PBS, and seeded into fresh medium. Synchronization and cell cycle state were examined by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Chromatin fractionation was performed essentially as described (37Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼3 × 106 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the cells were incubated for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were collected in the pellet (P1) by low speed centrifugation (1500 × g, 4 min, 4 °C). The supernatant (S1) was further clarified by high speed centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove cell debris and insoluble aggregates. The supernatant was designated S2. Nuclei were washed once with buffer A and then lysed in 200 μl of buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). After a 10-min incubation on ice, soluble nuclear proteins (S3) were separated from chromatin by centrifugation (2000 × g, 4 min). Isolated chromatin (P3) was washed once with buffer B and spun down at high speed (13,000 × g, 1 min). Cell lysate was harvested after treatment in high salt buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. 2 μg of antibodies was used for immunoprecipitation from 400 to 500 μg of total lysate plus an equal volume of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture at 4 °C overnight. Precipitates were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Immunoblots on nitrocellulose were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBST (PBS with 0.5% Tween 20) and washed with PBST. Primary antibodies were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBST. Secondary antibodies were incubated with 5% nonfat milk in PBST. Immunoprecipitates of endogenous NFBD1 from HEK293 and HeLa cells before and after exposure to γ-irradiation or from HeLa cells treated with 250 μg/ml nocodazole for 18 h were incubated with 1000 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs Inc.) in the presence of 2 mmMnCl2 for 1–2 h at 30 °C in a 50-μl reaction volume. Cells grown on poly-D-lysine-coated eight-chamber slides were either mock-treated or exposed to 50 J/m2 UV light or 1 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h or the specified dose of IR (0.1–5 Gy from a 137Cs source). In some experiments, 10 or 50 μm wortmannin was added to the cells 1 h before irradiation. At the indicated time points, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, followed by permeabilization for 15 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Slides were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBST for 30 min at 37 °C, incubated with primary antibody for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with PBST, and incubated with secondary antibody (rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200)) for 30 min at 37 °C. Dilutions of primary antibodies were 1:1000 for anti-NFBD1; 1:500 for anti-γ-H2AX, anti-MRE11, and anti-HA (16B12); 1:15 for anti-53BP1; and 1:50 for anti-BRCA1. After washing, the slides were mounted with coverslips with mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labs, Inc.). Images were acquired using a Nikon Microphot-FX microscope with a ×40 or ×60 objective and a SPOT digital camera. Human and mouse tissue mRNA blots were probed with NFBD1 cDNA sequences to determine the tissue-specific distribution ofNFBD1transcripts. Both human and mouse blots revealed an abundant transcript at a size of ∼7.5 kb in testis and low levels in placenta, kidney, brain, heart, liver, thymus, smooth muscle, lung, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes (data not shown). Although the high expression in testis could be connected with meiotic functions such as recombination, the significance is not clear because of the strong transcriptional induction of many genes during spermatogenesis. The human NFBD1clone includes an open reading frame of 6270 nucleotides that would encode a polypeptide of 2089 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 226 kDa. This polypeptide has a C-terminal tandem repeat of BRCT domains and an N-terminal FHA domain (Fig. 1 A). In the middle of the polypeptide is a tandem array of nine serine- and threonine-rich 24-amino acid repeats interspersed with other sequences (Fig.1 B). Data mining did not reveal other proteins with significant homology to these repeats. We produced and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the N terminus of the putative polypeptide. This antibody preparation recognized three bands with a slower electrophoretic mobility than that of the 250-kDa protein marker in immunoblots of a variety of cell lines, including HEK293, U2OS osteosarcoma cells, normal human WI38 fibroblasts, ATM-deficient human GM05849C fibroblasts, and HeLa cells (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). These three bands detected in HeLa cells were dramatically diminished after transfection with a pair of siRNA oligonucleotides specific for the NFBD1-coding region, but not after transfection with scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 D). These three bands were probably derived from translation of alternatively spliced transcripts or alternative transcriptional initiation sites because expression of HA-tagged NFBD1 cDNA yielded only a single band (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2, 5, and9). HA-NFBD1 comigrated with the largest endogenous polypeptide recognized by anti-NFBD1 antibody and was recognized as well by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1 C). This also indicates that the cDNA clone contains, at a minimum, most of the coding sequence for NFBD1. Indirect immunofluorescence of cells transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-NFBD1 with anti-NFBD1 antibody revealed diffuse nuclear staining (Fig. 1 E). The staining intensity was increased in the subset of cells expressing HA-NFBD1 (Fig. 1 E, compareHA and NFBD1 panels). The staining was blocked if the antibody was preincubated with the antigenic GST fusion protein, but not with GST fusion proteins derived from other NFBD1 fragments (data not shown). The exclusively nuclear staining indicates thatNFBD1 encodes a nuclear protein, which is also supported by a previous report using green fluorescent protein-tagged NFBD1 (38Ozaki T. Nagase T. Ichimiya S. Seki N. Ohiri M. Nomura N. Takada N. Sakiyama S. Weber B.L. Nakagawara A. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 475-485Google Scholar). To further verify the antibody specificity and to identify domains required for nuclear localization, we generated a series of overlapping deletion mutants with three copies of the HA epitope tag at their N termini (Fig. 1 A). Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were co-immunostained with anti-NFBD1 and anti-HA antibodies. In cells transfected with expression constructs with sequences encoding the antigenic polypeptide used to produce anti-NFBD1 antibody (Fig.1 F, N2 and N3 panels), but not with other deletion mutants (panels N1, C1, andC2), the subset of cells that reacted with anti-HA antibody also showed increased intensity with anti-NFBD1 antibody. All of the deletion mutants except the N1 fragment showed an exclusively nuclear staining pattern with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1 F). The N1 fragment contains the FHA core sequence homology domain, which apparently is not sufficient for nuclear localization. The N2 fragment is an extension of the N1 fragment and was sufficient for nuclear localization. Thus, a nuclear localization signal may be present between residues 145 and 568, consistent with previous observations (38Ozaki T. Nagase T. Ichimiya S. Seki N. Ohiri M. Nomura N. Takada N. Sakiyama S. Weber B.L. Nakagawara A. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 475-485Google Scholar). The C1 fragment was also sufficient for nuclear localization (Fig. 1 F). The earlier report (38Ozaki T. Nagase T. Ichimiya S. Seki N. Ohiri M. Nomura N. Takada N. Sakiyama S. Weber B.L. Nakagawara A. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 475-485Google Scholar) did not identify any nuclear localization signal within this fragment because only progressive deletions from the C terminus were analyzed. Canonical nuclear localization signals are characterized by short, single, or bipartite stretches of basic amino acids separated by a flexible spacer with the relative consensus sequence K(K/R)X(K/R) (39Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Google Scholar). This fragment contains at least two stretches of basic residues within a highly basic region (1860KPGKRKRDQAEEEPNRIPSRSLRRTK1885). Thus, NFBD1 may have a second nuclear targeting signal near its C terminus. We performed nuclear fractionation to determine whether NFBD1 is associated with chromatin. NFBD1, like chromatin-bound ORC2, but not the cytoplasmic protein GRB2, was present exclusively in the chromatin-enriched P3 fraction (Fig. 1 G). This association did not change dramatically after γ-irradiation, UV radiation, or hydroxyurea treatment (data not shown). Thus, NFBD1 may constitutively bind to chromatin. NFBD1 contains FHA and BRCT domains, both of which are present in a variety of genes involved in cell cycle controls. NFBD1/KIAA0170has been flagged as a G2/M-regulated transcript in the genome-wide microarray analysis of cell cycle-regulated transcription in HeLa S3 cells (40Whitfield M.L. Sherlock G. Saldanha A.J. Murray J.I. Ball C.A. Alexander K.E. Matese J.C. Perou C.M. Hurt M.M. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1977-2000Google Scholar). Using cells synchronized by double thymidine block, we found that NFBD1 protein levels were low in S phase and higher in cell populations enriched for G2/M and G1 (Fig. 2 A), consistent with the transcriptional profile. A number of DNA damage-response proteins undergo regulated phosphorylation. Therefore, we sought to determine whether NFBD1 is phosphorylated during the cell cycle. HeLa cells were synchronized at the beginning of S phase by using a double thymidine block, and cell synchrony was monitored by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells. Mobility shift of NFBD1, consistent with phosphorylation, occurred 8 h after release from the thymidine block, coincident with a large subpopulation of G2/M cells, and was maintained until a shift to more rapid mobility 12 h after release, at which time G1 cells predominated, and continued in this form through S phase (Fig. 2 A). Thus, NFBD1 is enriched and modified in G2/M cells. Nocodazole is an antimitotic agent that disrupts mitotic spindle function and arrests the cell cycle at G2/M (41Jordan M.A. Thrower D. Wilson L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 401-416Google Scholar). HeLa cells were arrested in mitosis by consecutive incubation with thymidine and nocodazole. Nocodazole blockade resulted in a supershift of NFBD1 to a form that migrated significantly more slowly than the G2/M form detected with double thymidine block/release (Fig. 2 A). NFBD1 returned to normal mobility 8 h after release from the nocodazole block (data not shown). N"

Phosphorylation at the CHK2 site (Ser20) in the N-terminal activation domain of p53 stabilized p300 binding. The phosphopeptide binding activity of p300 was mapped in vitroto two domains: the C-terminal IBiD domain and the N-terminal IHD domain (IBiD homology domain). The IHD or IBiD minidomains can bind to the p53 activation domain in vivo as determined using the mammalian two-hybrid VP16-GAL4 luciferase reporter assay. The IHD and IBiD minidomains of p300 also functioned as dominant negative inhibitors of p53-dependent transcription in vivo. Upon examining the affects of p300 binding on substrate acetylation, we found that the p53 consensus site DNA promotes a striking increase in p53 acetylation in vitro. Co-transfection into cells of the p53gene and plasmid DNA containing the consensus DNA binding site of p53 activated DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 in vivo. The phosphopeptide binding activity of p300 is critical for DNA-dependent acetylation, as p53 acetylation was inhibited by phospho-Ser20 peptides. Consensus site DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 stabilized the p300·p53 protein complex, whereas basal acetylation of p53 by p300 in the presence of nonspecific DNA resulted in p300 dissociation. These data identify at least three distinct stages in the assembly of a p300·p53 complex: 1) p300 docking to the activation domain of p53 via the IBiD and/or IHD domains; 2) DNA-dependent acetylation of p53; and 3) stabilization of the p300·p53AC complex after acetylation. The ability of DNA to act as an allosteric ligand to activate substrate acetylation identifies a conformational constraint that can be placed on the p300-acetylation reaction that is likely to be an amplification signal and influence protein-protein contacts at a promoter. Reconstitution of the stages in the assembly of the p300·p53 transcription complex has identified a novel type of DNA-dependent regulation of p300-catalyzed acetylation. Phosphorylation at the CHK2 site (Ser20) in the N-terminal activation domain of p53 stabilized p300 binding.

Characterizing the protein-protein interactions that assemble transcription complexes will provide a molecular basis for combinatorial specificity at the promoter level and provide an understanding of how transcriptosomes affect disease progression. One of the most studied regulators of eukaryotic gene transcriptional activation is the stress-activated tumor suppressor protein p53 (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5745) Google Scholar). The vast array of genes that p53 induces and represses in response to cell injury provides an excellent model system with which to identify the complex and transient associations with co-activators/repressors and the core promoter transcriptional apparatus that drive promoter activation.The tumor suppressor activity of p53 is linked to its activity as a stress-activated transcription factor. p53 is subject to multiple post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination that modulate the function of p53 as a transcription factor. p53 protein is tetrameric (2Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and the oligomeric nature of p53 provides the basis for complex intra/interdomain control mechanisms that modulate its activity (3Hupp T.R.

J. 2000; 352: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The most widely studied post-translational modification of p53 is phosphorylation via protein kinases that target specific domains on the assembled tetramer that can activate its function by a two-step process (5Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The first identified involves phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 by CK2/FACT at Ser392 and cyclin-dependent protein kinases at Ser315, which play a role in activating its latent sequence-specific DNA binding activity in vitro (6Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar,7Wang Y. Prives C.

The second step involves phosphorylation of specific N-terminal residues of p53 that reside within the activation domain by an ATM-dependent signal transduction cascade at Ser15 (10Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), which stimulates p300 binding to p53 in vitro (11Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F. Shiekhattar R. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33048-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and in vivo (12Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 2000; 18: 7002-7010Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Additionally, an adjacent Ser20 phosphorylation event by a CHK2-dependent pathway activates p53 (13Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by stabilizing the transcription coactivator p300·p53 complex formation (14Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The specific interaction of p300 in the p53-dependent transactivation pathway became apparent when it was demonstrated that ectopically expressed p300 stimulated p53-dependent gene expression and that adenoviral E1A protein inhibited p53-dependent transcription by virtue of binding to p300 (15Avantaggiati M.L.

Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Although this initial p300-p53 interaction was mapped to the N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53, an additional role for p300 in the control of p53 activity came from the observation that acetylation of p53 by p300 in the C-terminal negative regulatory domain adjacent to the CK2/FACT phosphorylation site activated the specific DNA binding function of p53 to short oligonucleotides containing the consensus binding site for p53 (18Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest the existence of a phosphorylation-acetylation cascade that targets p53 in response to genotoxic stress (19Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar).The acetyltransferase activity of p300 and its homolog CBP on histone and nonhistone substrates has been well documented and is important for co-activator function (20Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The role for acetylation on the N-terminal tails of histones is somewhat more widely appreciated, with the acetylation of lysine residues potentially weakening the nucleosome-DNA interaction, thereby allowing promoter access for the core transcriptional machinery such as TFIID and RNA polymerase II. Acetylation of transcription factors is now a widely observed phenomenon (22Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 23Ott M. Schnolzer M. Garnica J. Fischle W. Emiliani S. Rackwitz H.R. Verdin E. Curr.

Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 815-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies have also suggested that acetylation may function to stabilize coactivator complexes at a promoter (27Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 28Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol.

Naguibneva I. Duquet A. Bengal E. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5312-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism underlying how p53 tetramers interact with p300 and how this modulates acetylation has not been defined biochemically. Such analysis will likely give novel insights into how p300 protein interacts with an oligomeric substrate as well as information into how p300 links transcription to cell cycle control. We have started to reconstitute the p300·p53 protein complex in vitro by first examining how full-length p300 interacts with various phosphorylated regions in the N-terminal BOX-I activation domain of p53 (14Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This study has indicated that of three N-terminal phosphorylation sites in the BOX-I activation domain, phosphorylation by CHK2 at Ser20 has the most stabilizing affect on p300·p53 complex formation. In this report, we have used biochemical assays to develop a consensus phosphopeptide-binding site for p300 and to map the phosphopeptide-binding domain of p300 to two distinct domains. One of the domains maps to a previously undefined N-terminal region on p300 we name IBiD homologydomain (IHD), which has homology to the established p53-binding domain in the C terminus of p300 previously called IBiD or SRC-1 (30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Livengood J.A. Scoggin K.E. Van Orden K.

Further characterization of how p300 docking to the activation domain of p53 influences acetylation has revealed that p300 docking is essential for sequence-specific DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 that in turn stabilizes the p300·p53ACcomplex. These data reveal three distinct stages in the assembly of the p300·p53 complex: (i) p300 docking, (ii) p300 catalyzed DNA-dependent acetylation, and (iii) acetyl-CoA-dependent stabilization of the p300·p53 complex. These data further suggest that p53 protein conformation when DNA bound at promoters may play a role in modulating the rate of its acetylation and recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors.DISCUSSIONThe acetylation of histone and nonhistone chromosomal proteins is critical for the fine-control of gene expression and the characterization of how p300 recognizes and acetylates these classes of proteins will help to further define how gene expression is controlled. Histone acetylation reduces the extent of nucleosome assembly presumably by minimizing electrostatic DNA-protein interactions thus assisting in stabilizing the RNA polymerase preinitiation and transcription complex. By contrast, acetylation of sequence-specific transcription factors including E2F, p53, and MyoD have been shown to enhance their affinity for specific sequences in promoter regions (44Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of p300 binding to and acetylation of sequence-specific transcription factors has not been defined. The relatively large size of p300 suggests that an intrinsically complex intradomain and/or interdomain communication exists between itself and the variety of target proteins at a promoter. The interferon-responsive enhanceosome is one such example of multiprotein nucleation at a promoter (45Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Given that molecular reactions in vivo likely involve large protein complexes, or protein machines (46Alberts B. Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), it is likely that p300 will be regulated and function in a complex fashion. Furthermore, because acetylation may prove to be a covalent modification as important as phosphorylation mechanistic insight into acetylation function and regulation is of fundamental importance. In this report, we have assembled in vitro the p300·p53 complex, defined co-factors that modulate the acetylation of p53, and reconstituted a docking-dependent and DNA-dependent acetylation reaction required to clamp the p300·p53 complex.The oligomeric nature of p53 provides a unique model with which to define conformational elements that modulate the binding and acetylation of a target protein by the transcriptional co-activator p300. The N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53 was originally shown to contain a p300-binding site, as mutation of this region produces a transcriptionally inert protein. The first evidence for a multidomain component for the interaction between p53 and p300 came from data showing that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 by DNA-PK stimulates acetylation in the C terminus (11Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F. Shiekhattar R. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33048-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that phosphorylation of p53 in the BOX-Idomain at the CHK2 Thr18 and Ser20phosphorylation sites can stabilize the p300·p53 protein complex (14Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As different class of p53-activating kinases target the Ser15, Thr18, or Ser20 residues (ATM, CK1, and CHK2, respectively), these phosphorylation events provide a method for kinase signaling networks to regulate gene expression by altering the stability of the p300·p53 complex (14Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Developing a consensus phosphate-binding motif for p300 that is distinct from the contact sites involved in the MDM2·p53 complex (Fig. 1) explains why kinase phosphorylation can differentially affect p300·p53 and MDM2·p53 complex stability and led to the identification of phosphorylated-UBF as a p300-binding sites (Fig. 1,C and D).Our mapping of one of the p53-binding domains of p300 to IBiD is consistent with recent studies (30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas our identification of a second domain with homology to IBiD (IHD) was previously undefined. The original studies on mapping the p53-p300 interactions have focused on the use of glutathione S-transferase fused N- and C-terminal fragments of p53 in pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments. For example, the C-terminal region of p300 (amino acids 1990–2414) containing the Gln-rich domain and IBiD/SRC-1 binds p53 (amino acids 1–72) in vitro; consistent with our findings that p300-GAL4-C2 binds p53 (amino acids 1945–2414). Other groups have shown interactions between p53 and the KIX domain and C/H1 or C/H3 domain exclusively (47Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which are not observed in vitrousing our p300-phospho-ligand binding assays. However, weak binding of the C/H3δ domain of p300 to the N-terminal activation domain of p53 was observed in cells (Fig. 3A), but not in vitro(Fig. 2). Additionally, a more recent study has shown that the minimal IBiD domain (or SRC-1) is another peptide-binding domain within p300 that can also interact with p53 (31Livengood J.A. Scoggin K.E. Van Orden K. McBryant S.J. Edayathumangalam R.S. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9054-9061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Such differences may be explained by the fact that previous p300-p53 interactions were mapped by protein binding assays, or nonphosphorylated p53 protein domains, whereas our assays utilize a combination of phosphopeptide binding assays and full-length p300 protein to measure p53·p300 complex stability. The use of truncations of p300 protein may also complicate studies, as we have previously shown that the C-terminal acetyltransferase domain of p300 displays significant binding activity toward the Ser15-BOX-I activation domain but little activity toward Ser20-BOX-I domain fragments (14Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The observation that DNA promotes p53 acetylation brings to mind a recent discussion of allosteric regulation of transcription regulators through specific DNA binding (48Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In the latter report, it was proposed that DNA response elements contain information that is interpreted by bound transcription factors. In particular, DNA could act as an “allosteric ligand whose binding alters the regulator's affinity for other ligands, such as co-activators or co-repressors.” Presumably, this allosteric control of p53 acetylation is brought about by a conformational change in p53 after DNA binding. The conformational changes in p53 that occur upon specific DNA binding remain to be determined. Additionally, after acetylation of p53, p300 binding is further stabilized by consensus site DNA (Fig. 9) identifying a role for acetylation as a stabilizer of protein-protein interactions. The docking dependence in p300 acetylation of a substrate further addresses the poorly understood nature of modularity in a native transcription regulator. Transactivation domains are defined, in part, as minimal motifs that can drive transcription when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding protein, like GAL4, and such domain swap experiments are usually used as arguments for a modular or scaffold nature of a transcription factor. However, such domain swap experiments underestimate the complexity of a transcription factor DNA-binding domain and transactivation domain and do not rule out intramolecular or allosteric associations on the native protein. For example, the USF2 transactivation domain activates transcription when fused to its native DNA-binding domain, but when the USF2 transactivation domain is fused to GAL4 it is inactive or even repressive (49Luo X. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). ATF-2 and OCT-4 transactivation domains are thought to function through an interaction with their DNA-binding domains, as defined using the OCT-4 transactivation domain and the chimera of the DNA-binding domain (50Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,51Li X.Y. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The N terminus of p53 has an activation motif that drives transcription when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the yeast transactivation system (52Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). However, when the p53 transactivation domain is fused to a p53 DNA-binding domain mutant, this blocks transcription (58), further indicating that the p53 activation domain is allosterically regulated by its DNA-binding domain. Although such widespread evidence that the allosteric control of transactivation by DNA-binding domains is lacking, there is growing data showing that transcription factors change their conformation when DNA-bound, based on proteolytic fingerprints, CD, and NMR studies. The observation that DNA binding by p53 affects its acetylation by p300 indicates that the DNA-binding domain is pivotal in linking the activation domain to acetylation and coactivator recruitment. A recent study has confirmed using NMR that the conformation of p53 changes upon DNA binding; presumably this conformational change in the core domain and surface of p53 also creates a conformationally stable binding site for p300 or releases the acetylation motif into the acetyltransferase active site.In summary, the use of biochemical techniques to reconstitute the p300·p53 complex using active forms of full-length p300 has identified specific stages in the assembly reaction that include a docking-dependent and consensus site DNA-dependent acetylation of p53. The docking dependence in the DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 identifies a conformational constraint imposed on the p300-acetylation reaction at a promoter. Identification of the mechanism of conformational regulation of p53 acetylation may reveal novel factors that modulate acetylation of the DNA-bound transcription factor. Regulation of eukaryotic gene expression is a complex process regulating growth control in normal cells and dysregulation of gene expression contributes to diseases including cancer. Characterizing the protein-protein interactions that assemble transcription complexes will provide a molecular basis for combinatorial specificity at the promoter level and provide an understanding of how transcriptosomes affect disease progression. One of the most studied regulators of eukaryotic gene transcriptional activation is the stress-activated tumor suppressor protein p53 (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5745) Google Scholar). The vast array of genes that p53 induces and represses in response to cell injury provides an excellent model system with which to identify the complex and transient associations with co-activators/repressors and the core promoter transcriptional apparatus that drive promoter activation. The tumor suppressor activity of p53 is linked to its activity as a stress-activated transcription factor. p53 is subject to multiple post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination that modulate the function of p53 as a transcription factor. p53 protein is tetrameric (2Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and the oligomeric nature of p53 provides the basis for complex intra/interdomain control mechanisms that modulate its activity (3Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The most widely studied post-translational modification of p53 is phosphorylation via protein kinases that target specific domains on the assembled tetramer that can activate its function by a two-step process (5Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The first identified involves phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 by CK2/FACT at Ser392 and cyclin-dependent protein kinases at Ser315, which play a role in activating its latent sequence-specific DNA binding activity in vitro (6Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar,7Wang Y. Prives C.

Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The second step involves phosphorylation of specific N-terminal residues of p53 that reside within the activation domain by an ATM-dependent signal transduction cascade at Ser15 (10Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), which stimulates p300 binding to p53 in vitro (11Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F. Shiekhattar R. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33048-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and in vivo (12Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 2000; 18: 7002-7010Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Additionally, an adjacent Ser20 phosphorylation event by a CHK2-dependent pathway activates p53 (13Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by stabilizing the transcription coactivator p300·p53 complex formation (14Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The specific interaction of p300 in the p53-dependent transactivation pathway became apparent when it was demonstrated that ectopically expressed p300 stimulated p53-dependent gene expression and that adenoviral E1A protein inhibited p53-dependent transcription by virtue of binding to p300 (15Avantaggiati M.L.

Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Although this initial p300-p53 interaction was mapped to the N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53, an additional role for p300 in the control of p53 activity came from the observation that acetylation of p53 by p300 in the C-terminal negative regulatory domain adjacent to the CK2/FACT phosphorylation site activated the specific DNA binding function of p53 to short oligonucleotides containing the consensus binding site for p53 (18Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest the existence of a phosphorylation-acetylation cascade that targets p53 in response to genotoxic stress (19Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar).

Neurotransmitters, amphetamines, and neurotoxins bind before being transported, whereas cocaine and antidepressants bind to block transport. Although binding is crucial to transport, few assays separate binding from transport, nor do they provide adequate temporal or spatial resolution to describe real-time kinetics or localize sites of active uptake. Here, we report a new method that distinguishes substrate binding from substrate transport using single-cell, space-resolved, real-time fluorescence microscopy. For these studies we use a fluorescent analogue of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, a neurotoxic metabolite and known substrate of monoamine transporters, to assess binding and transport with 50-ms, sub-micron resolution. We show that ASP+(4-(4-(dimethylamino)styrl)-N-methylpyridinium) has micromolar potency for the human norepinephrine transporter, that ASP+ accumulation is Na+-, Cl−-, cocaine-, and desipramine-sensitive and temperature-dependent, and that ASP+ competes with norepinephrine uptake. Using this method we demonstrate that norepinephrine transporters are efficient buffers for substrate, with binding rates exceeding transport rates by 100-fold. Furthermore, substrates bind deep within the transporter, isolated from both the bath and the lipid bilayer. Although transport per sedepends on Na+ and Cl−, binding is independent of Na+ and actually increases in low Cl−. We further demonstrate that ASP+ interacts with transporters not only in transfected cells but in cultured neurons.

Consequently, new methods for the analysis of NET function are needed to understand fundamental mechanisms supporting substrate translocation. In addition, protocols that are amenable to high throughput drug screens may prove valuable in the development of therapeutic agents for depression, hypertension, and drug abuse. NET is a member of a large family of Na+ and Cl−-dependent transporters (20Masson J. Sagne C. Hamon M. El Mestikawy S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 439-464Google Scholar) with sub-micromolar potency for substrates. NET concentrates NE by coupling its transport to co-transported ions in a proposed stoichiometry of 1 NE:1 Na+:1 Cl− (21Gu H.H. Wall S. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1986; 334: 403-411Google Scholar) with a turnover rate of one transport cycle per second (24Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Google Scholar). Synaptic transmission, however, occurs at significantly faster time scales; e.g.dopaminergic midbrain neurons fire one action potential every 10 ms (25Prasad B.M. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7561-7567Google Scholar). Thus transport rates are incongruous with synaptic transmission, and it has been proposed that transporters may serve the additional function of buffering neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft prior to transport. Indeed, glutamate binding occurs on a much faster time scale than a complete transport cycle (26Diamond J.S. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4672-4687Google Scholar, 27Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. J Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2749-2757Google Scholar). Although the buffering hypothesis is current in the literature, there has been no direct test for the monoamine transporters, and until now there is no method that compares binding and transport in the same assay. Radiolabeled high affinity antagonist displacement and rotating disk voltammetry have been used to measure serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) binding to their respective transporters, SERT and DAT (28Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Google Scholar, 29Earles C. Schenk J.O. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 191-198Google Scholar, 30Earles C. Wayment H. Green M. Schenk J.O.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Google Scholar). DAT high affinity antagonist displacement via DA is dependent on Na+ from 0 to 20 mm but is Na+-independent from 20 to 120 mm (31Li L.B. Reith M.E.

The requirement of Na+ for substrate binding to NET has not previously been studied. Finally, although the Cl−dependence of monoamine transport is well known, the Cl−dependence of binding has received limited evaluation (21Gu H.H. Wall S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6911-6916Google Scholar, 28Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Google Scholar, 31Li L.B. Reith M.E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1538-1552Google Scholar). Here we describe a novel method based on fluorescence microscopy to assess the ionic dependence of substrate binding. The fluorescence approach relies on the availability of fluorescent substrates, which have not been readily available. Hardrich and colleagues (33Hadrich D. Berthold F. Steckhan E. Bonisch H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3101-3108Google Scholar) generated fluorescent NE and nisoxetine analogues; however, these compounds do not separate substrate binding from actual transport. We conjectured that NET might transport 4-(4-dimethylaminostyrl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+), a fluorescent analogue of the neurotoxin MPP+. MPP+ is a substrate for the organic cation ion transporter, OCT (34Hohage H. Stachon A. Feidt C. Hirsch J.R. Schlatter E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 305-310Google Scholar, 35Stachon A. Schlatter E. Hohage H. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 6: 72-91Google Scholar), and, importantly, DAT, where it induces neurotoxic degeneration of the substantial nigra (36Gainetdinov R.R. Fumagalli F. Jones S.R. Caron M.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1322-1325Google Scholar). MPP+ is also a substrate for NET (37Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Google Scholar, 38Sitte H.H. Hiptmair B. Zwach J. Pifl C. Singer E.A. Scholze P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1129-1137Google Scholar, 39Sitte H.H. Scholze P. Schloss P. Pifl C.

Kattinger A. Pifl C. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 870-878Google Scholar) and SERT (42Wall S.C. Gu H. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 544-550Google Scholar), making ASP+ an attractive candidate as a fluorescent substrate for monoamine transporters. This report investigates ASP+ as a substrate, particularly for NET, and evaluates fluorescence microscopy as an investigative tool for studying neurotransmitter transporters. We show that binding and transport are distinguishable in this assay with a high degree of spatial and temporal resolution. Here we report the effects of co-transported ions, cocaine, antidepressants, and temperature on binding and transport. We find that transporters have binding rates 100-fold greater than transport rates, supporting the hypothesis that transporters serve as buffers for transmitters. The accessibility of quenchers to ASP+ demonstrates that substrates bind deep within the transporter and are isolated from the bath and lipid membrane. We further show that in hNET, substrate binding is independent of Na+, and, surprisingly, binding is stronger in Cl−-free conditions. Finally, this assay reveals that ASP+ accumulation occurs non-uniformly along the membrane of neurites in cultured neurons, supporting the idea that NET proteins may localize to specific plasma membrane sub-domains. ASP+is also a substrate for DATs and SERTs, which, taken together with the above data, argues that ASP+ fluorescence microscopy may benefit the study of monoamine transporters and provide a useful platform for automated, non-isotopic drug discovery assays. HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The stable cells lines that we used for the human norepinephrine transporter (HEK-hNET) and the human serotonin transporter (HEK-hSERT) were previously described (43Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Duke B.J. Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 2197-2212Google Scholar, 44Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Google Scholar). The stable cell lines that we used for the human dopamine transporter (HEK-hDAT) cells are a gift from Michelle Mazei. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C) unless otherwise indicated. HEK-hNET cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well tissue culture plates at 105 cells per well 3 days prior to performing transport assays (90% confluence on the third day). The medium was removed by aspiration. Cells were then preincubated for 10 min in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH (in mm): 130 NaCl, 1.3 KCl, 2.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 10 Hepes, and 1.8 g/liter glucose, pH 7.4) medium with or without 10 μm desipramine. Desipramine, a specific NET blocker, was used to establish nonspecific activity in hNET cells. Pargyline (10 μm) and ascorbic acid (10 μm) were added to prevent metabolism and oxidation of NE, respectively. The assay mixture was aspirated after 10 min, and cells were washed three times with 4 °C KRH buffer. Accumulated [3H]NE was determined by liquid scintillation of 1% (w/v) SDS-solubilized cells. SCG neurons were dissociated by trituration followed by digestion with 0.25% trypsin and 0.3% collagenase. Non-neuronal cells were removed by pre-plating on uncoated, Falcon 60-mm plates. Neurons were cultured on poly-l-ornithine/laminin/poly-d-lysine-coated MatTek dishes at a density of 3000–4000 cells/well in F-14+ media containing 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 60 ng/ml progesterone, 16 mg/ml putrescine, 400 ng/ml l-thyroxine, 38 ng/ml sodium selenite, 340 ng/ml tri-iodothyroxine, 5 mg/ml insulin/penicillin/streptomycin, 10 μm fluorodeoxyuridine, and 20 ng/ml nerve growth factor. The neurons were maintained for 3–5 days in the presence of nerve growth factor before use. HEK-hNET cells were plated on 35-mm glass bottom Petri dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) coated with poly-l-lysine 3 days prior to experimentation. The culture medium was aspirated, cells were immediately mounted on a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope, and the microscope was focused on the center of the monolayer of cells. During the confocal measurement, cells remain without buffer for approximately 30 s. Background autofluorescence was established by collecting images for 10 s prior to the addition of KRH (see “Radiolabeled Transport”), 1.8 mg/liter glucose, 10 μm ascorbic acid, 10 μmpargyline, 10 μm tropolone (Sigma), and ASP+. The argon laser was tuned to 488 nm; the emitted light was filtered with a 580- to 630-nm band pass filter (λmax = 610 nm). The gain (contrast) and offset (brightness) for the photomultiplier tube was set to avoid detector saturation at the highest ASP+ concentration used in these experiments (10 μm). The effects of photobleaching on ASP+ accumulation were determined by examining the rate of ASP+ accumulation and decay at various acquisition rates. Acquisition rates greater than 0.3 Hz degraded sequestered ASP+ (3.33 s/image). The fluorescent images were processed using MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). Fluorescent accumulation was established by measuring the average pixel intensity of time-resolved fluorescent images within a specified region identified by the differential interference contrast image. Average pixel intensity is used to normalize among cells. HEK-293 cells and SCG neurons possess endogenous mechanisms for ASP+ accumulation (35Stachon A. Schlatter E. Hohage H. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 6: 72-91Google Scholar). NET-mediated ASP+accumulation is defined as the fluorescence of HEK-hNET cells or neurons minus background fluorescence. To evaluate ASP+ binding to the surface membranes, HEK-hNET cells were exposed to 2 μm ASP+ with horizontal polarizer (Fig. 5 C), with the polarizer rapidly switching to the vertical position. Cells were imaged with alternating polarizations for 3 min to measure light intensity in the horizontal (I h) and vertical (I v) positions to calculate the anisotropy ratio, r = (I v −gI h)/(I v + 2gI h). The factor g was determined by using a half-wave plate as described by Blackman et al.(45Blackman S.M. Cobb C.E. Beth A.H. Piston D.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 194-208Google Scholar). In this formulation, r = 0.4 implies an immobile light source (45Blackman S.M. Cobb C.E. Beth A.H. Piston D.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 194-208Google Scholar). Surface anisotropy was measured at the cell circumference over 1 pixel width (0.625 μm). Cytosolic anisotropy was measured near the center of the cell, ∼5 pixel widths from the membrane. To test whether ASP+ interacts with hNET, we initially exposed HEK-hNET cells to increasing concentrations of ASP+ in the presence of a fixed concentration of radiolabeled NE. MPP+ was used as a control, because MPP+ is a known substrate for NET (37Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Google Scholar, 46Smith N.C. Levi R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 456-463Google Scholar) and has similar structure to ASP+ (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows that increasing MPP+ or ASP+inhibits the DS-defined accumulation of radiolabeled NE. The inhibition constants (K i) for MPP+ and ASP+ are 600 ± 67 and 780 ± 77 nm(n = 5), respectively; thus MPP+ and ASP+ interact with HEK-hNET cells in the sub-micromolar range. Confocal slices through the monolayer (lower panels in Fig.2) indicate that ASP+accumulation in HEK-hNET divides into two phases: a rapid phase I that ensues immediately after ASP+ addition and appears localized to the cell surface (S), followed by a slower phase II localized to the cell interior (I). Line scans of similar images (see below) will amplify this segregation. Concomitant differential interference contrast (DIC) images (upper panels in Fig. 2) help to register the confocal images. In the first 3 s after adding ASP+ (Fig.2 B), the surface of some cells becomes noticeably bright, whereas the internal compartment shows less accumulation. Subsequently the cell interior becomes brighter and begins to fill in, but surface brightness remains constant. This pattern is the same whether we employ brief or long exposures of ASP+. These qualitative features are also observed in hDAT- and hSERT-transfected cells, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The weakest responder to ASP+ is hSERT (panels G–I in Fig. 3); however, the accumulation pattern in HEK-hSERT cells is significantly above parental cells (J–K). The remainder of this report focuses on hNET-transfected cells.Figure 3Monoamine transporters interact with ASP+. Like HEK-hNET cells hDAT- and hSERT-transfected cells accumulate ASP+. hNET (A–C), hDAT (D–F), hSERT (G–I), and parental HEK-293 (J–L) were exposed to 2 μm ASP+for the times indicated in panels J–L. The color gradient represented in panel J denotes the corresponding ASP+ intensity values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In Fig. 4 we quantify the initial rapid rise (phase I) and the slower phase II by plotting the average pixel intensity integrated over the entire cell against time after adding ASP+. Line scans (see below) will identify phases I and II with the cell surface and cell interior, respectively. Fig.4 A shows that, if we acquire fluorescence data at 0.3 Hz (or lower), the rate of rise of phase II accumulation is arrested immediately after removing ASP+. Because ASP+binds mitochondria (35Stachon A. Schlatter E. Hohage H. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 6: 72-91Google Scholar); thus we expect flux to be largely unidirectional and cells to retain ASP+ after it enters the cell. Acquiring data at 12 Hz (or higher) results in a decline in brightness after removing ASP+. The decay time constant is linearly proportional to the acquisition rate and represents ASP+ photobleaching, which we can also observe in the absence of HEK-hNET cells. Photobleaching thus sets a limit on the frequency of image acquisition. In the presence of a constant pool of ASP+, however, the rate of accumulation in phase I is independent of sampling rate at 12 Hz. By this method we are able to acquire data up to 20 Hz, permitting analysis of phase I at 50-ms resolution. HEK-293 cells also demonstrate phase I and II ASP+ accumulation; however, both the rapid and slow phases are negligible in parental cells compared with hNET-transfected cells. Fig. 4 B data are collected at 100-ms time resolution. From similar data on 400 cells (4 independent dishes with 100 cells per dish), the average slope of phase I was 18 ± 3.46 arbitrary fluorescent units (AFUs)/s, and the average slope of phase II was 0.28 ± 0.0057 AFUs/s. Fig. 5 shows a series of line scans taken across individual cells at different times after adding ASP+. Notice that initial rapid accumulation peaks at the cell edges, as identified in the DIC images (arrows), remains constant between 3 and 180 s, whereas the brightness at the cell center (between arrows) gradually increases. Furthermore, accumulation at the center occurs at the same rate as phase II (compare phase II slope in Fig. 4 A with center elevation in Fig. 5 A). HEK-293 cells subjected to similar line scans do not display sharply localized fluorescence pattern (Fig.5 B). These data support the interpretation that phase I represents a surface interaction with hNET, and phase II represents ASP+ transport. To further test this interpretation we compared the anisotropy of polarized light from the edges and centers of cells, which assesses the mobility of ASP+ molecules in these regions. Light from the edge demonstrates significant divergence between horizontal (0°) and vertical (90°) polarization, whereas light from the center is less divergent (Fig. 5 C). From these data we calculate the fluorescence anisotropy (see “Experimental Procedures”) across the line scan. The anisotropy measurements summarized in Fig. 5 D demonstrate that light from regions near the membrane arises from an immobile source (0.30 < r < 0.32) compared with light from the cytosol (0.21 < r < 0.24). Solution ASP+ shows even lower anisotropy (0.14 <r < 0.15). Thus ASP+ at the cell surface is effectively bound. Finally, preincubation with 1 mmcitalopram, a weak blocker of hNET transport, significantly reduces the slope of phase I, as expected if ASP+ has fewer available binding sites. These data indicate two distinct populations of the fluorescent compound in HEK-hNET cells exposed to ASP+: a pool of rapidly immobilized ASP+ molecules located at or near the cell surface, which we interpret as bound substrate, and a second more slowly accumulating, mobile pool of ASP+located in the cell interior, which we propose are transported molecules. To further investigate the possibility that our assay indeed detects bound and transported populations of ASP+molecules in HEK-hNET cells, we administered a potent blocker of transport, desipramine (DS), at various times during phase II. Because mitochondria sequester ASP+, the substrate does not efflux from the cell. By quantifying the sample data shown in Fig.6 (A, without DS, andB, with DS), we observe that the DS reduces the total light intensity by exactly the amplitude of phase I (arrows in Fig. 6 C). Thus the rate of phase II transport (top slope) equals the rate of ASP+ accumulation inside cells (bottom slope), because DS rapidly replaces ASP+ on the cell surface and halts further uptake. As a final test, we note that substrate binding is less sensitive to temperature than transport (47De Oliveira A.M. Schoemaker H. Segonzac A. Langer S.Z. Neuropharmacology. 1989; 28: 823-828Google Scholar); thus, if our interpretation is correct, reduced temperature should affect phase I less than it affects phase II. This phenomenon is observed in Fig. 6 D. Together these data provide strong evidence that phase I represents ASP+ binding and phase II represents transport. To test whether ASP+ has pharmacological properties similar to hNET HEK-hNET, cells were preincubated for 10 min with 10 μmdesipramine, 10 μm cocaine, or 30 μm NE. After preincubation with inhibitor alone, we added 2 μmASP+ to the inhibitor solution. In Fig.7 A, data are separated into phase I and II slopes as previously described. Compared with HEK-hNET cells, phase I is small in HEK-293 cells and insignificant in the presence of antagonists cocaine or DS, or in the presence of competing NE. Phase II is small in HEK-293 cells and in the presence of competing NE and is insignificant in the presence of cocaine. Finally, phase I and phase II saturate at similar ASP+ bath concentrations, and they have similar Michaelis-Menten constants, although ASP+ is slightly more potent for phase I (Fig. 7,B and C). Phase I: V max = 10.5 ± 0.94 AFUs/s, K m = 850 ± 186 nm, and n = 1.15 ± 0.30; phase II:V max = 0.32 ± 0.014 AFUs/s,K m = 480 ± 60 nm, andn = 1.51 ± 0.35). The above parameters from ASP+ accumulation are comparable to those obtained with NE, the endogenous substrate (43Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Duke B.J. Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 2197-2212Google Scholar), underscoring the utility of ASP+ as a measure of NET activity. To determine the ionic dependence of binding, we exposed HEK-hNET cells to bath solutions in which Na+ or Cl− were replaced with NMDG (N-methyl-d-glucamine) or acetate, respectively. Fig. 8 shows, whereas Na+ replacement does not significantly alter binding, Cl− replacement enhances binding. Na+replacement dramatically reduces transport to background levels, defined by DS, although Cl− replacement is less effective in blocking transport, in agreement with previous results from radiometric assays (12Corey J.L. Quick M.W. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Guastella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1188-1192Google Scholar). To determine the accessibility of bound substrate to the bath or the lipid bilayer, HEK-hNET cells were exposed to ASP+ (2 μm) premixed with various concentrations of trypan blue (hydrophilic) or 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPOL, hydrophobic). Trypan blue and TEMPOL are collision (dynamic) quenchers, which transiently interact with excited states in fluorescent molecules and directly transfer their energy without radiation (48Rasmussen S.G. Carroll F.I. Maresch M.J. Jensen A.D. Tate C.G. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4717-4723Google Scholar, 49Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Google Scholar, 50Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 706-709Google Scholar). Energy normally released as a photon from ASP+ is transferred to the quenching agent, thus reducing ASP+ fluorescence. To be effective, the distance between the quenching agent and the fluorescent molecule must be less than Δx2¯=2Dτ,D=kT/6πνR, where D is the diffusion coefficient, τ is the lifetime of ASP+, k is the Boltzmann constant,T is temperature (Kelvin), η is viscosity of solution, andR is the atomic radius of the molecule (51Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Google Scholar). Accordingly, trypan blue and TEMPOL must be separated from ASP+ by ∼30–50 Å (determined from the above equation). Fig.9 shows a Stern-Volmer analysis (51Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Google Scholar) in which the y axis is the degree of quenching of ASP+ by trypan blue or TEMPOL. The presence of trypan blue does not affect phase I, implying that the bound substrate is inaccessible to the bath. Trypan blue does not affect phase II, because it is membrane-impermeable (data not shown). The presence of TEMPOL does not affect phase I, implying that the bound substrates are also inaccessible to the lipid bilayer. Although membrane permeable TEMPOL reduces phase II, the intracellular concentration was not determined (data not shown). Lastly we investigated ASP+ interactions with NET in primary tissue culture neurons. Superior cervical ganglia (SCG) neurons endogenously express NET (52Schroeter S. Apparsundaram S. Wiley R.G. Miner L.H. Sesack S.R. Blakely R.D. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 420: 211-232Google Scholar). To test for ASP+accumulation in SCG neurons, we exposed dissociated cells to 2 μm ASP+ after preincubation for 10 min in the absence and presence of 10 μm desipramine. SCG neurons also contain OCTs, which could contribute to total ASP+accumulation and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio in SCGs compared with HEK-hNET cells. However, 10 μm DS inhibits NET without affecting OCT activity (53Wu X. George R.L. Huang W. Wang H. Conway S.J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1466: 315-327Google Scholar), thus a difference between ASP+accumulation in the absence and presence of DS would support the identification of NET-mediated ASP+ accumulation in neurons. Fig. 10 D quantifies primary data illustrated in Fig. 10 (A and C) and reveals a separation of the integrated light signal after adding DS to the preparation. ASP+ accumulation in the cell body of neurons is qualitatively similar to hNET-HEK cells, and accumulation in neurites appears markedly punctate (Fig. 10 C). The interrupted ASP+ pattern in the neurites is similar to the pattern of NET protein expression on noradrenergic fibers previously defined by immunohistochemical techniques (52Schroeter S. Apparsundaram S. Wiley R.G. Miner L.H. Sesack S.R. Blakely R.D. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 420: 211-232Google Scholar), indicating that ASP+ accumulation likely functionally marks regions of NET surface expression. Thus ASP+ appears amenable to the investigation of NET not only in heterologous expression cultures where monoamine transporters are overexpressed but also at naturally occurring expression levels, thus affording the opportunity to study the location and activity of transporters in authentic neurons. In the present study we demonstrate that the fluorescent molecule, ASP+, is a substrate for monoamine transporters. Visualization of ASP+ accumulation can report temporal and spatial information about transporters in both heterologous and native expression systems. Although ASP+ is structurally dissimilar to the endogenous substrate, it is similar to MPP+, a neurotoxic metabolite of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and well-studied substrate for monoamine transporters (38Sitte H.H. Hiptmair B. Zwach J. Pifl C. Singer E.A. Scholze P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1129-1137Google Scholar, 39Sitte H.H. Scholze P. Schloss P. Pifl C. Singer E.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1317-1324Google Scholar, 41Scholze P. Zwach J. Kattinger A. Pifl C. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 870-878Google Scholar, 54Javitch J.A. D'Amato R.J. Strittmatter S.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2173-2177Google Scholar, 55Javitch J.A. Snyder S.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 106: 455-456Google Scholar). Monoamine oxidase makes MPP+ from MPTP, the agent responsible for producing Parkinson-like paralysis in drug addicts who had used impure batches of synthetic heroin. MPP+ enters neurons via monoamine transporters and inhibits respiratory mitochondria. Similar to MPP+ in structure and function, the fluorescent analogue ASP+ competes effectively for specific NET-mediated NE transport, and ASP+ accumulation kinetics are similar to radiolabeled NE uptake kinetics. Fluorescence anisotropy indicates the presence of two populations of ASP+ with distinct rotational movements: rapid phase I, which is localized to the cell surface and relatively immobile, and slow phase II, which represents mobile ASP+. These two populations are readily distinguished by sequential administration of desipramine, which shows a parallel increase of phase II accumulation with sequestered ASP+, strongly supporting the interpretation that phase I measures binding and phase II measures transport. Spatial patterning and temperature dependence strengthen this view, as does the pharmacological dissection of phase I and II. The biphasic phase I and phase II patterns do not represent transporter endocytosis, because NET-mediated ASP+ accumulation is unaffected by a 30-min preincubation with concanavalin A or 0.45 mm sucrose (data not shown). We have shown that agents that inhibit substrate transport, such as desipramine or cocaine, also inhibit substrate binding. Although, cocaine is reported to inhibit transporters through a uncompetitive mechanism (56Earles C. Schenk J.O. Synapse. 1999; 33: 230-238Google Scholar, 57McElvain J.S. Schenk J.O. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2189-2199Google Scholar). From the literature, Na+ removal has no effect on 5HT and DA displacement of high affinity SERT and DAT antagonists (28Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Google Scholar, 31Li L.B. Reith M.E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1538-1552Google Scholar, 32Li L.B. Cui X.N. Reith M.A. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 365: 303-311Google Scholar). Our assay reveals that ASP+binding is independent of Na+ and actually increases in zero Cl−. Thus, although Na+ and Cl− are both significant to co-transport, only Cl− is significant to substrate binding in NETs. We recognize that native amine substrates may display characteristics distinct to ASP+, and our assay provides a means to explore these differences. Moreover, our data show that bound substrate is segregated from the bath and membrane, i.e. unavailable to quenchers localized to these compartments. Therefore, the transporter protein isolates bound substrate from bath and membrane, revealing for the first time that a monoamine transporter substrate binds deep within the transporter. In summary, binding and transport in single mammalian cells and neurons, impossible to study with radiometric techniques, is readily measured with ASP+ fluorescence microscopy. The method also permits analysis of many cells while retaining spatial and kinetic information derived from single cells and is thus amenable to automated, multiwell protocols. Cells expressing hSERT and hDAT also accumulate ASP+ significantly above background, suggesting ASP+ as a general tool for the investigation of monoamine transporters. Single cell assays are important for mechanistic studies. For example, Prasad and Amara (25Prasad B.M. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7561-7567Google Scholar) conclude that dopamine accumulation in midbrain dopaminergic neurons does not depend on voltage. However, the uptake data and the voltage clamp data leading to their conclusion are from different cell populations, and the authors describe their inability to measure uptake in single mammalian cells under voltage clamp as a major hindrance. The opportunity to assess the spatial segregation of monoamine transport activity along the processes of living neurons should also permit the examination of regulatory mechanisms affecting transporter trafficking and catalytic function.

https://openalex.org/W2000797432,"TBX5 is a T-box transcription factor that plays a critical role in organogenesis. Seven missense mutations in TBX5 have been identified in patients with Holt-Oram syndrome characterized by congenital heart defects and upper limb abnormalities. However, the functional significance and molecular pathogenic mechanisms of these mutations are not clear. In this study we describe functional defects in DNA binding, transcriptional activity, protein-protein interaction, and cellular localization of mutant TBX5 with these missense mutations (Q49K, I54T, G80R, G169R, R237Q, R237W, and S252I). Mutations G80R, R237Q, and R237W represent a group of mutations that dramatically reduce DNA-binding activity of TBX5, leading to reduced transcription activation by TBX5 and the loss of synergy in transcriptional activation between TBX5 and NKX2.5. The second group of mutations includes Q49K, I54T, G169R, and S252I, which have no or moderate effect on DNA-binding activity and the function of transcription activation of TBX5 but cause the complete loss of synergistic transcription activity between TBX5 and NKX2.5. All seven missense mutations greatly reduced the interaction of TBX5 with NKX2.5in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescent staining showed that wild type TBX5 was localized completely into the nucleus, but mutants were localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that all seven missense mutations studied here are functional mutations with a spectrum of defects ranging from decreases in DNA-binding activity and transcriptional activation to the dramatic reduction of interaction between TBX5 and NKX2.5, and loss of synergy in transcriptional activation between these two proteins, as well as impairment in the nuclear localization of TBX5. These defects are likely central to the pathogenesis of Holt-Oram syndrome. TBX5 is a T-box transcription factor that plays a critical role in organogenesis. Seven missense mutations in TBX5 have been identified in patients with Holt-Oram syndrome characterized by congenital heart defects and upper limb abnormalities. However, the functional significance and molecular pathogenic mechanisms of these mutations are not clear. In this study we describe functional defects in DNA binding, transcriptional activity, protein-protein interaction, and cellular localization of mutant TBX5 with these missense mutations (Q49K, I54T, G80R, G169R, R237Q, R237W, and S252I). Mutations G80R, R237Q, and R237W represent a group of mutations that dramatically reduce DNA-binding activity of TBX5, leading to reduced transcription activation by TBX5 and the loss of synergy in transcriptional activation between TBX5 and NKX2.5. The second group of mutations includes Q49K, I54T, G169R, and S252I, which have no or moderate effect on DNA-binding activity and the function of transcription activation of TBX5 but cause the complete loss of synergistic transcription activity between TBX5 and NKX2.5. All seven missense mutations greatly reduced the interaction of TBX5 with NKX2.5in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescent staining showed that wild type TBX5 was localized completely into the nucleus, but mutants were localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that all seven missense mutations studied here are functional mutations with a spectrum of defects ranging from decreases in DNA-binding activity and transcriptional activation to the dramatic reduction of interaction between TBX5 and NKX2.5, and loss of synergy in transcriptional activation between these two proteins, as well as impairment in the nuclear localization of TBX5. These defects are likely central to the pathogenesis of Holt-Oram syndrome. the atrial natriuretic factor gene wild type luciferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole T-box transcription factors belong to a conserved family of proteins that contribute to early cell fate determination, differentiation, and organogenesis (1Papaioannou V.E.

T-box genes have been identified in animals from ctenophores (comb jellies) and nematodes to mammals, and may account for ∼0.1% of animal genomes. The Tbx5 gene is located on chromosome 12q24 and encodes a protein of 518 amino acids (2Basson C.T. Bachinsky D.R. Lin R.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 30-35Google Scholar, 3Li Q.Y. Newbury-Ecob R.A. Terrett J.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 21-29Google Scholar). TBX5 contains a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, T-box domain. Tbx5 is expressed in embryonic heart and limb tissues (9Sepulveda J.L.

During embryogenesis,Tbx5 expression starts at the earliest stages of heart formation and is co-localized with genes encoding other important cardiac transcription factors, Nkx2.5 and Gata4(10Liberatore C.M. Searcy-Schrick R.D. Yutzey K.E. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 169-180Google Scholar). Over-expression of Tbx5 under the control of the β-myosin heavy chain promoter in mice inhibits ventricular chamber development and loss of ventricular-specific gene expression (10Liberatore C.M. Searcy-Schrick R.D. Yutzey K.E. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 169-180Google Scholar). Homozygous knockout mice deficient in Tbx5 die early in embryogenesis at D9.5, and heterozygous mice showed the forelimb and congenital heart defects (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F.

These results indicate thatTbx5 is critical to development of the heart and skeletal structures. Mutations in Tbx5 have been found to cause Holt-Oram syndrome, an autosomal-dominant disease characterized by upper limb malformations and congenital heart defects including atrial and ventricular septal defects or cardiac conduction disease (2Basson C.T. Bachinsky D.R. Lin R.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 30-35Google Scholar, 3Li Q.Y. Newbury-Ecob R.A. Terrett J.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 21-29Google Scholar, 14Holt M. Oram S. Br.

ManyTbx5 mutations are nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, or large chromosomal rearrangements (translocations, deletions) that are expected to produce truncated TBX5 proteins or no TBX5 at all (e.g. nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, translocation in intron 1). Based on these findings, Tbx5haploinsufficiency has been proposed as a mechanism underlying pathogenesis of Holt-Oram syndrome. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that heterozygousTbx5del/+ mice modeled Holt-Oram syndrome (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 709-721Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that increased Tbx5 dosage, such as a chromosome 12q2 duplication, also results in Holt-Oram syndrome (19Vaughan C.J. Basson C.T. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 97: 304-309Google Scholar), suggesting that Tbx5 dosage is critical to the development of the heart and limbs. However, seven missense mutations in the Tbx5 gene, which would not be expected to alter the dosage of Tbx5, have been reported in patients with Holt-Oram syndrome. It remains to be determined whether theseTbx5 missense mutations are functional mutations, and if they are, what are the molecular pathogenic mechanisms by which these mutations act? Biochemical studies have demonstrated that TBX5 protein interacts with the homeobox transcription factor NKX2.5 to synergistically transactivate expression of target genes (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 709-721Google Scholar, 20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar). The homeodomain of NKX2.5 was shown to be necessary and sufficient for its interaction with TBX5, although the NK domain (a17 amino acid domain specific to NK-class proteins) located C-terminal to the homeodomain can significantly enhance the interaction (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 709-721Google Scholar, 20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar). For TBX5, the region including the N-terminal domain and the N-terminal portion of the T-domain (amino acids 1–90) is sufficient for its association with NKX2.5 (20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar). The target genes identified for Tbx5 include the genes for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)1 (20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar) and connexin 40 (Cx40) (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 709-721Google Scholar, 20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar). Synergistic activation of bothANF and Cx40 promoters by TBX5 and NKX2.5 were demonstrated (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 709-721Google Scholar, 20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar). The promoters of ANF andCx40 harbor binding sites for both TBX5 and NKX2.5, and these sites were shown to be capable of binding to both transcriptional factors (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 709-721Google Scholar, 20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar). Using an in vitro selection procedure with double-stranded random 26-mer oligonucleotides, a consensus sequence for TBX5 binding ((A/G)GGTGT(C/T/G)(A/G)) was identified (21Ghosh T.K. Packham E.A. Bonser A.J. Robinson T.E. Cross S.J. Brook J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1983-1994Google Scholar). This consensus sequence is part of a half-site from the Brachyury T-box target sequence (21Ghosh T.K. Packham E.A. Bonser A.J. Robinson T.E. Cross S.J. Brook J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1983-1994Google Scholar). TBX5 can bind to either a single site or paired non-palindromic sites in vitro (21Ghosh T.K. Packham E.A. Bonser A.J. Robinson T.E. Cross S.J. Brook J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1983-1994Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used a biochemical system comprising of TBX5, NKX2.5, and the ANF promoter to characterize the TBX5 missense mutations identified in Holt-Oram syndrome patients. We demonstrate that the TBX5 missense mutations are functional mutations that cause a spectrum of defects in DNA binding, transcription activation, interaction with NKX2.5, synergistic transactivation with NKX2.5, and nuclear localization. These results also provide insights into structure-function relationship of TBX5. The region from −270 to +1 bp upstream from the transcription start site of the ANF promoter was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector, resulting in theANF-Luc reporter gene. The full-length Tbx5cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector, resulting in the over-expression constructs (20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar). Three forms of Tbx5expression constructs were used: one with and the other without the FLAG-epitope tag as well as one construct for expressing His6-tagged TBX5. The expression constructs for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged-NKX2.5 and GST-NKX2.5 fusion protein were as described previously (a gift from Dr. Issei Komuro) (20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar). The missense mutations in Tbx5 were introduced into the wild type construct by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing. The full-length Tbx5 cDNA was also cloned into the pET-28b vector, resulting in the bacterial expression construct for TBX5. COS-7, HeLa, or NIH-3T3 cells were grown to 90% confluence in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 and 50 ng of DNA for the expression construct, 1 μg of DNA for the reporter gene, and 50 ng of internal control plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase. Cells were harvested and lysed 48 h after transfection. The efficiency of transfection was examined by Western blot analysis. Forty μg of total cellular lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antiserum (Sigma) as the primary antibody and the rabbit anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to visualize the protein signal. Luciferase assay was performed using a Dual-Luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). β-galactosidase activity expressed from pSV-β-galactosidase was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. The experiments were repeated three times in triplicate. Data are expressed as mean ±S.E. The synthetic TBX5-binding site was generated by annealing double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-aataTCACACCTgtac-3′; 5′-gtacAGGTGTGAtatt-3′), labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow enzyme, and used in EMSA. The labeled TBX5-binding site was incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 4 μl of TBX5 protein synthesized using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Transcription system in 20 μl of binding buffer. The TBX5-DNA complex was then separated from free DNA using 6% native polyacrylamide gels. The gels were run at 200 volts for 40 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray films. For in vivo protein-protein interactions, HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids for His-tagged TBX5 and HA-tagged NKX2.5 for 48 h. The transfected cells were harvested, washed with PBS, incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, a mini-protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and digested with DNase I. Total cell lysate was dialyzed with dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The cell lysate was then mixed with 20 μl of Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen) and incubated for 4–12 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with the lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with an anti-HA antibody (Sigma), and protein signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro protein-protein interactions, GST or GST-NKX2.5 fusion proteins were over-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), purified using standard protocols, and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Aliquots (20 μl) of GST and GST-NKX2.5 beads were incubated with in vitro-translated TBX5 (described earlier) for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS buffer, bound proteins were eluted from beads with PBS containing 0.1m glutathione and analyzed by Western blot with a monoclonal anti-His antibody (Sigma). Transfected cells (NIH-3T3, COS-7, and HEK-293) were seeded on chamber slides at a density of 1 × 105 cells and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2for 24–48 h. Cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and incubated with the primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) in PBS/3% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. The mouse anti-FLAG M2 primary antibody recognizes the FLAG-tagged TBX5 protein. The secondary antibody, a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution), was then added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were mounted using anti-fading vectashield with DAPI and cells were viewed under a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope equipped with Photometrics SmartCapture. The images were analyzed with the Melanie software (Geneva Bioinformatics) for the relative distribution of the protein in the nucleus versus cytoplasm. Direct binding of TBX5 transcriptional factor to DNA is required for activation of its target genes including ANFencoding the atrial natriuretic factor. To identify the mechanism by which TBX5 missense mutations cause Holt-Oram syndrome, we assessed the ability of mutant TBX5 proteins to bind to its target DNA-binding site using EMSA. Seven missense mutations in TBX5 were analyzed, and they include Q49K and I54T at the N terminus, G80R, G169R, R237Q, and Q237W in the T-domain responsible for DNA binding, and S252I in the C terminus (Fig. 1). The promoter region ofANF (−252 upstream from the transcription start site) contains a TBX5-binding site, and this site was chemically synthesized as pairs of complementary single strand oligonucleotides (5′-aataTCACACCTgtac-3′; 5′-gtacAGGTGTGAtatt-3′). The synthetic site was labeled and used in EMSA with in vitro-translated TBX5 proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, the wild type TBX5 protein can bind to DNA and forms a specific DNA-protein complex. Competition experiments with unlabeled synthetic TBX5-binding site dramatically reduced the TBX5-DNA complex signal, and a synthetic DNA fragment having a sequence unrelated to the TBX5-binding site failed to form TBX5-DNA complex (data not shown). These data suggest that the observed binding of TBX5 to the synthetic binding site is specific.Figure 2The effect of missense mutations of TBX5 on DNA-binding activity. The wild type and mutant TBX5 proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TNT-coupled transcription/translation system. The TBX5-binding site is a synthetic double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to the region from −257 to −242 bp upstream from the ANF transcriptional start site (5′-aataTCACACCTgtac-3′). A, EMSA.

The fitted slope for specific binding of wild type TBX5 (WT) and mutants G80R and R237Q is 79.5, 19.5, and 11.7, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Three mutations in the T-domain, including G80R, R237Q, and R237W, dramatically reduced the binding ability of TBX5 to DNA (Fig.2 A). The relative DNA-binding abilities of wild type and mutant G80R and R237Q TBX5 were determined using various concentrations of proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, both mutant proteins have much lower affinity to DNA than wild type TBX5. Mutations I54T and S252I had moderate effect on DNA binding of TBX5. In contrast, there was no significant difference in DNA binding between the wild type TBX5 and mutants Q49K and G169R (Fig. 2 A). A silver-stained protein gel showed that both wild type and mutant TBX5 proteins were successfully synthesized at approximately equal amounts (Fig. 2 B). Our results suggest that a functional defect in DNA binding is the molecular mechanism for some TBX5 mutations (G80R, R237Q, and R237W), but not a universal mechanism for all mutations. TBX5 alone can activate transcription of its target genes, but in the presence of NKX2.5, synergy in transcriptional activation by these two proteins was observed (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 709-721Google Scholar, 20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar). We assessed the functional effect of TBX5 mutations on transcriptional activation using a reporter gene (ANF-Luc, Fig.3 A) in which theANF promoter (region from −270 to + 1 bp) was fused to the luciferase gene. The ANF-Luc reporter gene was co-transfected with wild type or various mutant TBX5 expression constructs into COS-7 cells. Transcriptional activity was examined and expressed as relative luciferase units. As shown in Fig. 3 B, expression of wild type TBX5 activated transcription of theANF promoter. Three mutations, including G80R, R237Q, and R237W, reduced transcription activation by TBX5, consistent with our data that these three mutations reduced DNA binding of TBX5. In contrast, TBX5 mutations Q49K, I54T, G169R, and S252I had little effect on transcriptional activation by TBX5 (Fig. 3 B). Western blot analysis showed that both wild type and all mutant TBX5 proteins were successfully expressed in transfected cells (Fig.3 C). We then investigated whether the missense mutations in TBX5 could disrupt the synergistic transactivation between TBX5 and NKX2.5. As shown in Fig. 3 B, either wild type TBX5 or NKX2.5 alone activated expression of the ANF promoter, but co-transfection of TBX5 and NKX2.5 into COS-7 cells showed synergistic activation of the ANF promoter as reported previously (12Bruneau B.G. Logan M. Davis N. Levi T. Tabin C.J. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 100-108Google Scholar,16Basson C.T. Huang T. Lin R.C. Bachinsky D.R. Weremowicz S. Vaglio A. Bruzzone R. Quadrelli R. Lerone M. Romeo G. Silengo M. Pereira A. Krieger J. Mesquita S.F. Kamisago M. Morton C.C. Pierpont M.E. Muller C.W. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2919-2924Google Scholar). However, all seven missense mutations of TBX5 did not produce such synergistic effect with NKX2.5 (Fig. 3 B). Because all seven TBX5 missense mutations caused loss of synergistic activation of transcription by TBX5 and NKX2.5, we determined whether these mutations affect the physical interaction between these two transcriptional factors. We used both in vivo and in vitro protein-protein interaction assays. For the in vivo assay, His-tagged TBX5 and NKX2.5 tagged with HA epitope at the C terminus were co-expressed in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis showed that both TBX5 and NKX2.5 were successfully expressed in the same cells (Fig.4 A). The protein mixture was then incubated with Ni-NTA beads (which bind His-tagged TBX5 or His-TBX5-NKX2.5-HA complex). The protein or protein-complex bound to Ni-NTA beads was eluted and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-HA antibody to detect the presence of NKX2.5. As expected, interaction between wild type TBX5 and NKX2.5 was observed (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). Faint signal (very weak interaction) was observed for TBX5 proteins with mutation Q49K or G169R. No interactions were found for mutants I54T, G80R, R237Q, R237W, or S252I. These results suggest that seven missense mutations studies here dramatically reduce the interaction between TBX5 and NKX2.5. We also used GST pull-down assay to determine the interaction of various TBX5 mutants with NKX2.5. GST-NKX2.5 fusion protein was purified, immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and mixed within vitro-translated TBX5. We separated TBX5 bound to GST-NKX2.5 and analyzed it using Western blot. Wild type TBX5, but none of the mutant TBX5, showed direct physical interaction with NKX2.5 (Fig. 4 B). These results further confirm the in vivo data that missense mutations severely disrupt the direct interaction between TBX5 and NKX2.5. TBX5 is a transcription factor, and it is expected to be localized in the nucleus. We hypothesized that missense mutations in TBX5 may cause conformational changes of the protein and result in protein trafficking defects. Such defects will prevent TBX5 from exerting its function as a transcription factor. To test this hypothesis, we expressed wild type and mutant TBX5 proteins tagged with a FLAG-epitope into NIH-3T3 cells and studied cellular localization of TBX5 by immunofluorescence staining. The relative amount of the nuclear and cytoplasmic protein was quantified and shown in Fig.5 B. As expected, wild type TBX5 was localized completely into the nucleus (Fig. 5, WT,green signal). Mutant Q49K TBX5 exhibited a minor defect in trafficking with most of the protein molecules in the nucleus and few molecules in the cytoplasm (the protruded bud) (Fig. 5 A). Mutation R237Q caused the most severe defect in TBX5 trafficking with most of the signals in the cytoplasm and few in the nucleus (Fig.5 A). The rest of mutations (I54T, G80R, G169R, R237W, and S252I) had moderate effect on nuclear localization of TBX5 with immunofluorescence signals found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 5 A). Similar results were obtained with HEK-293 or COS-7 cells (data not show). This study provides evidence that the seven TBX5 missense mutations identified in Holt-Oram syndrome patients are functional mutations with a spectrum of defects. We evaluated the functional effect of these missense mutations on DNA binding and transcriptional activation by TBX5 as well as synergistic activation by the interaction between TBX5 and NKX2.5. Based on our results, TBX5 missense mutations can be divided into two different functional groups. The first group consists of mutations G80R, R237W, and R237Q, which exert their effect mainly by disrupting the DNA-binding function of TBX5. Reduced DNA binding could lead to observed reduction in transcription activation and loss of synergy between TBX5 and NKX2.5 in transactivation of target genes. The second group consists of mutations Q49K, I54T, G169R, and S252I, which had no or moderate effect on DNA binding. This group of mutations did not affect the transcriptional activation by TBX5, but they caused dramatic reduction in the interaction between TBX5 and NKX2.5 and the complete loss of synergy between TBX5 and NKX2.5 in transcriptional activation. Our study represents the most comprehensive analysis of all missense mutations identified in TBX5 to date. Two previous studies reported partial characterization of a few missense mutations in TBX5. Ghoshet al. (21Ghosh T.K. Packham E.A. Bonser A.J. Robinson T.E. Cross S.J. Brook J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1983-1994Google Scholar) reported analysis of the effect of four point mutations, G80R, G169R, R237Q and S252I, on DNA binding to an in vitro selected fragment with two half TBX5-binding sites oriented tail-tail using a truncated form of TBX5 (amino acids 1–279). These authors, however, did not assay the effect of these mutations on transcription activation. Mutations G80R and R237Q were found to eliminate DNA binding of TBX5, whereas mutations G169R and S252I retained DNA-binding activity (21Ghosh T.K. Packham E.A. Bonser A.J. Robinson T.E. Cross S.J. Brook J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1983-1994Google Scholar). Our DNA binding analysis with the full-length TBX5 and a native TBX5-binding site in the ANFpromoter (Fig. 2) yielded similar results on mutations G80R, G169R, R237Q, and S252I. Hiroi et al. (20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar) analyzed the effect of mutations G80R and R237Q on transcription activity of theANF promoter but did not examine their effect on DNA binding. Mutation G80R caused significant reduction of transcriptional activation activity of TBX5 and loss of synergistic activation with NKX2.5. Surprisingly, mutation R237Q, which eliminated DNA binding, had minor effects on transcriptional activation by TBX5 or synergistic activation by TBX5 and NKX2.5 (20Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Google Scholar) In our study, similar results were obtained for mutation G80R; however, we found much more dramatic effect by mutation R237Q, which is consistent the DNA binding data on this mutation. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of seven missense mutations on the direct interaction and synergy in transactivation between TBX5 and NKX2.5. Our study provides further definition of molecular mechanisms of TBX5 mutant protein dysfunctions. Among seven missense mutations studied, only the three mutations in the T-domain, G80R, R237W, and R237Q, dramatically reduced binding of TBX5 to the DNA target, further confirming that the T-domain is the DNA-binding domain. It is surprising that TBX5 with mutation G169R, also at a highly conserved position in the T-domain, retained nearly full binding activity, suggesting that not all amino acid residues in the T-domain are responsible for DNA binding. Based on the x-ray crystallographic data from the T-domain of Xenopus laevis T protein (22Muller C.W. Hermann B.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 884-888Google Scholar), both Gly-80 and Arg-237 are located immediately next to the critical amino acid residues for DNA binding, whereas Gly-169 is five residues to the left and four residues to the right of the critical DNA-binding residues. The different spatial positioning in relation to critical DNA-binding residues may explain the difference of binding activity to DNA for mutations at Gly-80 and Arg-237 from that for mutation G169R. Deletion studies implicated the N terminus of TBX5 and the N-terminal part of the T-domain (amino acids 1–90) as the binding site for NKX2.5 (21Ghosh T.K. Packham E.A. Bonser A.J. Robinson T.E. Cross S.J. Brook J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1983-1994Google Scholar). Our results that mutations Q49K, I54T, and G80R disrupt the physical interaction and synergistic transcriptional activity between TBX5 and NKX2.5 further support that the N terminus of TBX5 is involved in its interaction with NKX2.5. Our data also implicate other regions, including residues Gly-169, Arg-237, and Ser-252, as critical residues involved in the interaction and synergistic transcription activation between TBX5 and NKX2.5. Future structure-function relationship studies and x-ray crystallographic studies with the full TBX5 and NKX2.5 will define all critical residues involved in their interaction. Immunostaining of cells transfected with FLAG-tagged TBX5 showed that TBX5 proteins with the missense mutations were localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The molecular mechanism for such trafficking defects is unknown. We speculate that TBX5 missense mutations cause improper folding of TBX5, which will prolong the time required for TBX5 to be transported into the nucleus. This slow trafficking of mutant TBX5 proteins leads to the observation of mutant TBX5 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Delayed entry of TBX5 molecules into the nuclei will prevent these molecules from executing their transcriptional activation function. These results demonstrate impaired nuclear localization of mutant TBX5 as a molecular mechanism for TBX5 missense mutations. Similar protein trafficking defects have been reported for other cardiovascular diseases including long QT syndrome (23Bianchi L. Shen Z. Dennis A.T. Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Ronchetti E. Bryskin R. Schwartz P.J. Brown A.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1499-1507Google Scholar) and Brugada syndrome (24Baroudi G. Acharfi S. Larouche C. Chahine M. Circ. Res. 2000; 90: e11-e16Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that the missense mutations in TBX5 investigated in this study are functional mutations that cause a spectrum of biochemical and cellular defects. Our results indicate three distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Holt-Oram syndrome. First, some TBX5 mutations cause a dramatic decrease in its DNA-binding activity, which leads to reduced transcription activation by TBX5 and the loss of synergy between TBX5 and NKX2.5. Second, some TBX5 mutations do not affect the DNA binding and transcriptional activation functions of TBX5 but cause the complete loss of synergy between TBX5 and NKX2.5 in transcription activation due to dramatically reduced interaction between TBX5 and NKX2.5. Third, impaired nuclear localization is a common defect shared by all missense mutations studied here. All these mechanisms are likely central to the pathogenesis of Holt-Oram syndrome. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the missense mutations in TBX5 act by a loss-of-function mechanism.

H. pyloriproduces ammonia through urease-mediated degradation of urea, but it is also able to convert a range of amide substrates into ammonia via its AmiE amidase and AmiF formamidase enzymes. Here data are provided that demonstrate that the iron-responsive regulatory protein Fur directly and indirectly regulates the activity of the two H. pyloriamidases. In contrast to other amidase-positive bacteria, amidase and formamidase enzyme activities were not induced by medium supplementation with their respective substrates, acrylamide and formamide. AmiE protein expression and amidase enzyme activity were iron-repressed in H. pylori 26695 but constitutive in the isogenic fur mutant. This regulation was mediated at the transcriptional level via the binding of Fur to the amiEpromoter region. In contrast, formamidase enzyme activity was not iron-repressed but was significantly higher in the furmutant. This effect was not mediated at the transcriptional level, and Fur did not bind to the amiF promoter region. These roles of Fur in regulation of the H. pylori amidases suggest that the H. pylori Fur regulator may have acquired extra functions to compensate for the absence of other regulatory systems.

The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori colonizes the mucus layer overlaying the gastric epithelium, thereby causing persistent gastritis, which can develop into peptic ulcer disease and gastric carcinomas (1Dunn B.E. Cohen H. Blaser M.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 720-741Google Scholar). H. pylori is able to survive and colonize this hostile acidic niche, aided by the expression of its acid resistance mechanisms (2Stingl K. Altendorf K. Bakker E.P. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 70-74Google Scholar, 3Scott D.R. Marcus E.A. Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 187-195Google Scholar). One of the major factors contributing to acid resistance of H. pylori is the production of ammonia by its urease enzyme, which is essential for gastric colonization in different animal models (4Eaton K.A. Krakowka S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3604-3607Google Scholar, 5Tsuda M. Karita M. Morshed M.G. Okita K. Nakazawa T. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3586-3589Google Scholar, 6Wirth H.P. Beins M.H. Yang M.

Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 685-691Google Scholar). However, the role of urease in gastric colonization extends beyond protection against gastric acid, becauseH. pylori urease mutants are still unable to colonize the gastric mucosa when gastric acid production is abolished with proton pump inhibitors (4Eaton K.A. Krakowka S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3604-3607Google Scholar). Ammonia is a key component of bacterial nitrogen metabolism, because it is the preferred source of nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids, pyrimidines, and purines. Ammonia plays a central role in pathogenesis and metabolism of the important human pathogen H. pylori, because it not only serves as nitrogen source (8Williams C.L. Preston T. Hossack M. Slater C. McColl K.E. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 13: 87-94Google Scholar) but also contributes to epithelial cell damage and apoptosis (9Igarashi M. Kitada Y. Yoshiyama H. Takagi A. Miwa T. Koga Y. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 816-821Google Scholar, 10Nagahashi S. Suzuki H. Miyazawa M. Nagata H. Suzuki M. Miura S. Ishii H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1073-1081Google Scholar), is involved in chemotactic motility (11Nakamura H. Yoshiyama H. Takeuchi H. Mizote T. Okita K. Nakazawa T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4832-4837Google Scholar), and is required for acid resistance (2Stingl K. Altendorf K. Bakker E.P. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 70-74Google Scholar, 3Scott D.R. Marcus E.A. Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 187-195Google Scholar). Urea is thought to be the main source of ammonia in the gastric environment, but H. pylori does have alternative pathways for the production of ammonia via amino acid catabolism (12McGee D.J. Radcliff F.J. Mendz G.L. Ferrero R.L. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7314-7322Google Scholar) and via the activity of its two paralogous amidases, AmiE 1The abbreviations used are: AmiE, aliphatic amidase; AmiF, formamidase; Fur, ferric uptake regulator; BBN, Brucella Broth supplemented with 3% newborn calf serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DIG, digoxigenin 1The abbreviations used are: AmiE, aliphatic amidase; AmiF, formamidase; Fur, ferric uptake regulator; BBN, Brucella Broth supplemented with 3% newborn calf serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DIG, digoxigenin and AmiF (13Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 989-998Google Scholar, 14Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 596-609Google Scholar). Aliphatic amidase (AmiE, EC 3.5.1.4) and formamidase (AmiF, EC3.5.1.49) catalyze the conversion of amide substrates to the corresponding carboxylic acid and ammonia (13Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 989-998Google Scholar, 14Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 596-609Google Scholar). The control of the intracellular nitrogen status is important for living organisms, and this can be mediated by several different nitrogen regulatory systems. These include the PII(GlnB) signal transduction protein and NtrBC two-component regulatory system, which are widespread throughout the bacterial kingdom (15Arcondeguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Google Scholar), but alternative nitrogen regulatory systems exist (16Jakoby M. Nolden L. Meier-Wagner J. Kramer R. Burkovski A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 964-977Google Scholar, 17Fisher S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 223-232Google Scholar, 18Zimmer D.P. Soupene E. Lee H.L. Wendisch V.F. Khodursky A.B. Peter B.J. Bender R.A. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14674-14679Google Scholar). An analysis of the H. pylori genome sequence did not reveal the presence of any of the aforementioned nitrogen regulatory proteins (19Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P. Gill S. Dougherty B.A. Nelson K. Quackenbush J. Zhou L. Kirkness E.F. Peterson S. Loftus B. Richardson D. Dodson R. Khalak H.G. Glodek A. McKenney K.

Borodovsky M. Karpk P.D. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Google Scholar). The presence of nitrogen regulatory systems is likely though, because the activity of the different ammonia-producing enzymes seems to be balanced. The absence of urease activity leads to higher amidase activity (13Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 989-998Google Scholar), whereas the combined absence of urease and arginase led to higher formamidase activity (14Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 596-609Google Scholar). Conversely, the absence of arginase also led to alterations in the activity of the amino acid deaminases (12McGee D.J. Radcliff F.J. Mendz G.L. Ferrero R.L. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7314-7322Google Scholar), and thus, it is thought that the intracellular nitrogen status of H. pylori is controlled through yet unidentified regulatory systems. An analysis of the genome sequence indicated that H. pylorihas a relatively limited capacity for gene regulation, and thus, it is possible that the few regulatory proteins present regulate multiple responses and metabolic processes (19Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P. Gill S. Dougherty B.A. Nelson K. Quackenbush J. Zhou L. Kirkness E.F. Peterson S. Loftus B. Richardson D.

Watthey L. Wallin E. Hayes W.S. Borodovsky M. Karpk P.D. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Google Scholar). One well characterized regulatory protein of H. pylori is the ferric uptake regulator (Fur), which controls intracellular iron homeostasis via concerted expression of iron-uptake and iron-storage genes (20van Vliet A.H.M. Stoof J. Vlasblom R. Wainwright S.A. Hughes N.J. Kelly D.J. Bereswill S. Bijlsma J.J.E. Hoogenboezem T. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.J.E. Kist M. Kuipers E.J. Kusters J.G.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5948-5953Google Scholar). Because Fur has also been implicated in acid resistance of H. pylori (24Bijlsma J.J.E. Waidner B. van Vliet A.H.M. Hughes N.J. Hag S. Bereswill S. Kelly D.J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.J.E. Kist M. Kusters J.G. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 606-611Google Scholar) as well as in regulation of urease expression (25van Vliet A.H.M. Kuipers E.J. Waidner B. Davies B.J. de Vries N. Penn C.W. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.J.E. Kist M. Bereswill S. Kusters J.G. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4891-4897Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Fur may also regulate the expression of alternative ammonia-producing enzymes. Here we report that Fur regulates transcription, expression, and activity of the AmiE amidase and indirectly affects enzyme activity of the AmiF formamidase. The regulation of ammonia production via the iron-regulatory protein Fur may be an example of how H. pylori may compensate for its relatively small regulatory capacity. H. pylori strain 26695 (19Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P. Gill S. Dougherty B.A. Nelson K. Quackenbush J. Zhou L. Kirkness E.F.

Broth cultures were grown in Brucella Broth (Difco, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 3% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen) (BBN). Ferric chloride and desferal (deferoxamine mesylate) were purchased from Sigma, filter-sterilized, and used at the indicated concentrations. To determine the effect of amide substrate on H. pylori, BBN media were supplemented with acrylamide (Sigma) or formamide (Sigma) to final concentrations of 5 and 100 mm, respectively. Iron restriction was achieved by supplementing BBN with desferal to a final concentration of 20 μm, whereas iron-repleted conditions were achieved by supplementing desferal-treated BBN with ferric chloride to a final concentration of 100 μm (20van Vliet A.H.M.

For antibiotic selection, growth media were supplemented with ampicillin, kanamycin, or chloramphenicol to final concentrations of 100, 20, and 10 μg/ml, respectively. H. pylori wild-type andfur mutant cells were grown in iron-restricted or iron-repleted medium, centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and concentrated in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to a final A 600 of 10. H. pylori cells were lysed by sonication for 15 s on ice with an MSE Soniprep 150 set at amplitude 10. Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Samples containing ∼30 μg of protein were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis using a Multiphor II electrophoresis unit (Amersham Biosciences). Isoelectric focusing was performed on 11-cm Immobilin DryStrips (Amersham Biosciences) with a pH range of 3–10 and subsequently separated according to molecular weight on a ExcelGel SDS (Amersham Biosciences) with an acrylamide concentration gradient of 12–14%. Proteins were subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), trypsin-digested, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Bruker Biflex III (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Protein identification was performed using the Mascot program (28Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Google Scholar) and the OWL non-redundant composite protein sequence data base (www.matrix-science.com). The enzymatic activity of urease, amidase, and formamidase were determined in fresh H. pylori lysates by measuring ammonia production from hydrolysis of urea, acrylamide, or formamide, respectively, by using the Berthelot reaction as described previously (13Skouloubris S.

The concentration of ammonia present in the samples was inferred from a standard NH4Cl concentration curve. Enzyme activity was expressed as micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed per minute per milligram of protein. Differences in enzyme activities were tested for their statistical significance with the Mann-Whitney Utest. RNA was isolated from bacteria grown in iron-restricted or iron-repleted conditions using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was separated on 2% formaldehyde, 1.5% agarose gels in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer and subsequently transferred to nylon membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using standard protocols (25van Vliet A.H.M.

Internal fragments of the amiE and amiF genes were PCR-amplified with primers listed in TableI. The resulting PCR fragments contained a T7 promoter sequence on the non-coding strand and were used for the production of antisense RNA probes labeled with DIG by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).

Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.J.E. Phadnis S.H. Kusters J.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2433-2440Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiaprep spin columns (Qiagen). PCR was carried out using Taq polymerase (Promega). Recombinant H. pylori Fur protein was purified from E. coli with the pASK-IBA Streptag system (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) as described previously (29Waidner B. Greiner S. Odenbreit S. Kavermann H. Velayudhan J. Stähler F. Bisse E. van Vliet A.H.M. Andrews S.C. Kusters J.G. Kelly D.J. Haas R. Kist M. Bereswill S. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3923-3929Google Scholar). DIG-labeled amiE and amiF promoter fragments were amplified with primer combinations Amid-PrF/Amid-PrR-DIG and Form-PrF/Form-PrR-DIG, respectively, and incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant Fur for 30 min at 37 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 75 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm MnCl2, 12% glycerol). Samples were subsequently separated on a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1) gel in running buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine) for 30 min at 200 V. The gel was then blotted onto a nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and DIG-labeled DNA was visualized using the DIG detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the chemiluminescent substrate CDP-Star. In the amidase-positive bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa andMycobacterium smegmatis, amidase activity is controlled by substrate availability via the AmiR-AmiC and AmiA proteins, respectively (30Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Norman R.A. Pearl L.H. Drew R.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5907-5916Google Scholar, 31Parish T. Turner J. Stoker N.G. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 19Google Scholar). These proteins mediate the induction of amidase expression upon supplementation of growth medium with the amide substrate (30Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Norman R.A. Pearl L.H. Drew R.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5907-5916Google Scholar, 31Parish T. Turner J. Stoker N.G. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 19Google Scholar). Although orthologs of the corresponding amidase regulatory proteins are absent in H. pylori, the inspection of the H. pylori amiE and amiF promoters indicated the presence of sequences resembling Furboxes, suggesting iron-responsive regulation of these genes (22Delany I. Pacheco A.B.F. Spohn G. Rappuoli R. Scarlato V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4932-4937Google Scholar, 32Escolar L. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6223-6229Google Scholar). To determine whether amidase and formamidase activity were substrate-inducible or iron-regulated, we determined the effect of substrate supplementation and varying iron-availability on amidase and formamidase activity of H. pylori strain 26695. The highest concentrations of amidase substrates that still allowed growth ofH. pylori 26695 were 5 mm acrylamide and 100 mm formamide (data not shown). Unlike other bacterial amidases, supplementation with these concentrations of amide substrates did not result in the induction of amidase or formamidase enzyme activity (Fig. 1). However, changing iron availability had a pronounced effect on amidase activity, which was high in iron-restricted conditions but was almost absent in iron-repleted conditions (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, formamidase activity was not changed in iron-restricted conditions when compared with iron-repleted conditions (Fig. 1 B). Thus, we conclude that amidase and formamidase activity in H. pylori 26695 is not substrate-inducible but that amidase activity is regulated by iron availability, whereas formamidase activity seems constitutive. The AmiE (HP0294) protein was previously identified as a protein of approximately 45 kDa with a pI of 6.4 (33Jungblut P.R. Bumann D. Haas G. Zimny-Arndt U. Holland P. Lamer S. Siejak F. Aebischer A. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 710-725Google Scholar). A protein of similar molecular mass and pI was identified when comparing two-dimensional protein profiles for the identification of Fur- and iron-regulated proteins of H. pylori 26695 (Fig.2). Wild-type cells expressed this protein when grown in iron-restricted conditions but not in iron-repleted conditions. This iron-repression was absent in thefur mutant strain (Fig. 2), suggesting that iron regulation was mediated by Fur. Subsequent identification of the protein by mass spectometry confirmed that this iron- and Fur-repressed protein was indeed AmiE (13Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 989-998Google Scholar, 14Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 596-609Google Scholar). Because the AmiF protein has not been identified on two-dimensional gels yet (33Jungblut P.R. Bumann D. Haas G. Zimny-Arndt U. Holland P. Lamer S. Siejak F. Aebischer A. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 710-725Google Scholar), we were unable to compare AmiF protein expression levels. To assess whether the effect of Fur and iron on AmiE at the protein expression level was also present at the enzyme activity level, we determined amidase activity in lysates of H. pylori 26695 and its isogenic fur mutant grown in iron-restricted and iron-repleted conditions (Fig. 3). As control, we also determined formamidase activity in both strains and medium conditions. Amidase activity displayed identical regulation as observed at the protein expression level. In wild-type cells, amidase activity was high at iron-restricted conditions and absent in iron-repleted conditions (p < 0.01), whereas in thefur mutant, activity was always high, independent of iron availability (Fig. 3 A, p = 0.56). Surprisingly, formamidase activity was also affected by thefur mutation. Formamidase activity did not differ between cells grown in iron-restricted and iron-repleted conditions but differed significantly between the wild-type and fur mutant cells (Fig. 3 B, p < 0.01). In wild-type cells, formamidase activity was low but present, whereas formamidase activity was increased almost 3-fold in the fur mutant (Fig.3 B). These results were reproduced with a second independently constructed H. pylori 26695 furmutant (data not shown), indicating that the increase in formamidase activity is not caused by a secondary mutation. Regulation via iron and Fur is usually mediated at the transcriptional level (32Escolar L. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6223-6229Google Scholar). The observed iron- and Fur-responsive regulation of AmiE expression was indeed reflected at the mRNA level as demonstrated by Northern hybridization (Fig.4). There was no amiE mRNA detected in the wild-type strain under iron-repleted conditions, but the transcription of a 1-kilobase mRNA was clearly apparent in iron-restricted conditions. In contrast, in the fur mutant,amiE mRNA was present irrespective of the iron availability of the medium (Fig. 4). However, the effect of thefur mutation on formamidase activity is not mediated at the transcriptional level, because the small changes in the levels ofamiF mRNA observed on Northern hybridizations (Fig. 4) did not correlate with the changes in the enzyme activity observed (Fig. 4). The Fur protein normally functions by metal-dependent binding to a binding sequence (Furbox) located in the promoter region of the regulated gene (32Escolar L. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6223-6229Google Scholar). An analysis of the sequence directly upstream of the amiE andamiF genes had already indicated the presence of putative Furboxes (Fig. 5 A). To confirm that amiE and amiF transcription was indeed differentially regulated by Fur, we performed gel retardation assays using recombinant H. pylori Fur (29Waidner B. Greiner S. Odenbreit S. Kavermann H. Velayudhan J. Stähler F. Bisse E. van Vliet A.H.M. Andrews S.C. Kusters J.G. Kelly D.J. Haas R. Kist M. Bereswill S. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3923-3929Google Scholar) and DIG-labeledamiE and amiF promoter regions. The addition of recombinant H. pylori Fur with the metal cofactor Mn2+ to the amiE promoter region shifted the mobility of the amiE promoter, consistent with binding of Fur to this promoter (Fig. 5 B). Gel retardation was dependent on the presence of the Mn2+ metal cofactor (data not shown). To check sequence specificity, we also used an internal fragment of the amiE gene whose mobility was not affected by Fur (data not shown). Finally, as predicted from the Northern hybridization experiments but despite the presence of Furbox-like sequence, the mobility of the amiF promoter was not affected by Fur (Fig. 5 B). Many species of the genus Helicobacter colonize the acidic gastric mucosa of humans and animals, and in this respect, they represent unique pathogens (1Dunn B.E. Cohen H. Blaser M.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 720-741Google Scholar). Colonization is dependent on acid resistance, and although this process is multifactorial, the production of high levels of ammonia is essential to allow initial infection as well as subsequent colonization. Acid resistance of H. pylori has long been considered to be solely based on unregulated production of large amounts of urease, but recent studies have shown that acid resistance of H. pylori is based on multifactorial, interactive, and probably well regulated processes (3Scott D.R. Marcus E.A. Weeks D.L. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 187-195Google Scholar,25van Vliet A.H.M. Kuipers E.J. Waidner B. Davies B.J. de Vries N. Penn C.W. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.J.E. Kist M.

Science. 2000; 287: 482-485Google Scholar). In these processes, metal-responsive regulatory proteins play an important role with the NikR protein regulating urease expression (25van Vliet A.H.M.

Under physiological conditions, the optimal pH for H. pylorigrowth lies between 4 and 6 (1Dunn B.E. Cohen H. Blaser M.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 720-741Google Scholar). As a result, the colonization pattern of H. pylori varies with the level of acid production within the host stomach, and these different colonization patterns are associated with different long term outcomes of infection (37Kuipers E.J. Uyterlinde A.M. Pena A.S. Hazenberg H.J. Bloemena E. Lindeman J. Klinkenberg-Knol E.C. Meuwissen S.G.M. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1995; 90: 1401-1406Google Scholar, 38Kuipers E.J. Lundell L. Klinkenberg-Knol E.C. Havu N. Festen H.P. Liedman B. Lamers C.B. Jansen J.B. Dalenback J. Snel P. Nelis G.F. Meuwissen S.G.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1018-1022Google Scholar). As such, H. pylori acid resistance is very relevant for the clinical outcome of disease and may also offer clues for therapy.H. pylori produces large amounts of ammonia through urea degradation and actually requires an acidic environment to survive in the presence of urea because of alkalinization of the medium to toxic levels at a neutral pH (39Clyne M. Labigne A. Drumm B. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1669-1673Google Scholar). The presence of alternative pathways for the production of ammonia is likely to have evolved for situations where either urea is not available where ammonia production is required at neutral pH conditions or when toxic concentrations of amides are encountered in the natural niche of H. pylori. Amidase enzymes are often present in environmental bacteria where they function in the degradation of toxic amides in the environment and are of interest for waste disposal. The function or natural substrate(s) of the H. pylori amidases are not yet known, and thus, it is difficult to predict their exact function in H. pylorimetabolism. Although it is difficult to envisage high levels of amides being produced intracellularly in H. pylori, recent reports of possibly toxic or carcinogenic concentrations of acrylamide in food have raised concerns for public health (40Tareke E. Rydberg P. Karlsson P. Eriksson S. Tornqvist M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 4998-5006Google Scholar). The acrylamide can be produced after Strecker degradation of asparagine or methionine in the presence of dicarbonyl compounds via the Maillard reaction (41Stadler R.H. Blank I. Varga N. Robert F. Hau J. Guy P.A. Robert M.C. Riediker S. Nature. 2002; 419: 449-450Google Scholar, 42Mottram D.S. Wedzicha B.L. Dodson A.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 448-449Google Scholar). Of special interest in the gastric environment may be the route via methionine, because this reaction has a requirement for ammonia as produced by H. pylori (41Stadler R.H. Blank I. Varga N. Robert F. Hau J. Guy P.A. Robert M.C. Riediker S. Nature. 2002; 419: 449-450Google Scholar, 42Mottram D.S. Wedzicha B.L. Dodson A.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 448-449Google Scholar). Furthermore, although it is possible that the amidases function in protection against toxic amides, our preliminary data indicate that the production of the AmiE amidase does not increase protection against toxic concentrations of acrylamide in a disc assay (data not shown). Regulation of amidase expression was so far only studied in P. aeruginosa and in M. smegmatis where amidase expression is induced upon supplementation with amide substrate (30Wilson S.A. Wachira S.J. Norman R.A. Pearl L.H. Drew R.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5907-5916Google Scholar, 31Parish T. Turner J. Stoker N.G. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 19Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that amidase and formamidase activity is not substrate-induced in H. pylori but that amidase activity is Fur- and iron-repressed. This unexpected type of regulation may be explained by either a role for amidase in siderophore synthesis or by a link between amide availability and iron availability. Amidases like AmiE and AmiF can form hydroxamates via an acyl transferase reaction using hydroxylamide as acceptor molecule (14Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 596-609Google Scholar). Hydroxamates are an important class of siderophores, and in siderophore-producing bacteria, the biosynthesis of siderophores is usually iron-regulated (43Crosa J.H. Walsh C.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 223-249Google Scholar).H. pylori lacks orthologs of bacterial siderophore biosynthesis genes (19Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P. Gill S. Dougherty B.A. Nelson K. Quackenbush J. Zhou L. Kirkness E.F. Peterson S. Loftus B. Richardson D. Dodson R. Khalak H.G. Glodek A. McKenney K. Fitzegerald L.M. Lee N. Adams M.D. Hickey E.K. Berg D.E. Gocayne J.D. Utterback T.R. Peterson J.D. Kelley J.M. Cotton M.D. Weidman J.M. Fujii C. Bowman C. Watthey L. Wallin E. Hayes W.S. Borodovsky M. Karpk P.D. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Google Scholar) but may use amidase-mediated formation of hydroxamates as an alternative route to produce siderophores. However, the toxicity of hydroxylamine makes it unlikely that H. pylori is able to safely produce the quantities of hydroxylamine necessary to scavenge sufficient iron from the gastric environment. An alternative possibility is that there may be a link between the availability of iron and amide substrates. Both the urease- and amidase-enzymatic reactions lead to the production of ammonia, but although the urease reaction results in alkalinization of the environment (39Clyne M. Labigne A. Drumm B. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1669-1673Google Scholar), the amidase reaction is pH-neutral (13Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 989-998Google Scholar, 14Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 596-609Google Scholar). Amidase-generated ammonia is probably not sufficient for acid resistance of H. pylori (44Bury-Mone S. Skouloubris S. Labigne A. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1021-1034Google Scholar) but may still be used to form urea through the previously suggested urea cycle of H. pylori (12McGee D.J. Radcliff F.J. Mendz G.L. Ferrero R.L. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7314-7322Google Scholar, 45Mendz G.L. Hazell S.L. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2959-2967Google Scholar), and thus, amidase activity may be important when urea availability is low. Alternatively, because ammonia also plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism, the pH-neutral production of ammonia by both amidases may allow the production of sufficient intracellular concentrations of ammonia without alkalinization of the cellular environment. Finally, a coupling between iron availability and substrate availability is supported by studies on the function and secretion of the H. pylori vacuolating cytotoxin VacA (46Tombola F. Morbiato L. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Zoratti M. Papini E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 929-937Google Scholar, 47Keenan J.I. Allardyce R.A. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2000; 12: 1267-1273Google Scholar). Firstly, the VacA protein has been suggested to function as a urea permease, promoting urea diffusion from epithelial cells (46Tombola F. Morbiato L. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Zoratti M. Papini E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 929-937Google Scholar). Secondly, VacA is present in outer membrane vesicles that are thought to deliver pro-inflammatory proteins to the epithelial cells but only in iron-repleted conditions (47Keenan J.I. Allardyce R.A. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2000; 12: 1267-1273Google Scholar). Combined, this would result in high urea release in iron-repleted conditions but low urea release in iron-restricted conditions. It is under these conditions where urea availability is low that amidase activity may be an alternative source of ammonia and, as such, make iron-repression of amidase physiologically relevant. Surprisingly, the amiE and amiF genes were differentially regulated by Fur. The amiE gene is regulated at the transcriptional level by Fur, whereas the furmutation only affects enzyme activity of AmiF but not amiFtranscription (Figs. 4 and 5). The mechanism behind the increased formamidase activity in the fur mutant is currently unknown. We hypothesize that this increase may be the result of the altered intracellular environment caused by the pleiotropic effects of thefur mutation, by changes in availability of a yet unknown enzyme cofactor, or by altered stability or conformation of the formamidase enzyme. We have also tested a second independentfur mutant in H. pylori strain 26695, which contains a promoterless chloramphenicol cassette in fur(23Bereswill S. Greiner S. van Vliet A.H.M. Waidner B. Fassbinder F. Schiltz E. Kusters J.G. Kist M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5948-5953Google Scholar). This independent fur mutant also displayed derepressed amidase activity and increased formamidase activity (data not shown), thus the observed effect on formamidase activity is unlikely to result from a secondary mutation or polar effects of the antibiotic cassette inserted in the fur gene. The Fur protein showed specific binding to the amiE promoter but not to the amiFpromoter, despite both promoters having sequences resembling Furboxes (Fig. 5 A). This again demonstrates the limitations of Furbox predictions that are based solely on sequence similarity (48Baichoo N. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5826-5832Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified a novel type of gene regulation for bacterial amidases, which is mediated by Fur at the transcriptional and enzyme activity level (for AmiE) and at the enzyme activity level (for AmiF). The diverse roles of the Fur regulatory protein in metabolic and pathogenic processes of H. pylori indicate that this bacterium is able to use several intricately linked mechanisms to survive and thrive in the gastric mucosa and is able to sense and cope with the variable conditions and multiple stresses occurring there despite its relatively limited range of regulatory proteins.

An aromatic hydrophobic residue is essential for optimal peptide recognition and is conserved throughout the protein kinase family. protein kinase catalytic regulatory yeast-tryptone 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid The predominant regulatory mechanism used by eukaryotic cells to convey a message from external stimuli is phosphorylation, mediated by protein kinases. These messages control regulation of diverse pathways in response to stress, antigen presentation, and development to name a few. Members of the protein kinase family are related through a structurally conserved catalytic core comprised of two lobes. The smaller N-terminal lobe dominated by β-sheets is responsible for nucleotide binding, while the larger C-terminal lobe made up primarily of α-helices, relays substrate specificity (2Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 is one of the simplest and best understood members of the protein kinase superfamily. It exists as an inactive holoenzyme complex consisting of a regulatory (R) subunit homodimer and two catalytic (C) subunits. Upon increased levels of intracellular cAMP, each regulatory subunit cooperatively binds two molecules of cAMP inducing a conformational change resulting in the unleashing of the active catalytic subunits (3Doskeland S.O. Ogreid D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2291-2301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-subunit is a 350-amino acid (4Shoji S. Parmelee D.C. Wade R.D. Kumar S. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Long G.L. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), 41-kD protein with the conserved kinase core represented by residues 40–300. The core is flanked at the N terminus by a 39-amino acid helical region and a 50-amino acid C-terminal tail, with each flanking region undergoing co- or posttranslational modifications. The simplicity of this molecule and its ability to define the conserved and active kinase core allow it to serve as a model for other enzymes in the family.Several specific determinants contribute to recognition of substrates and physiological inhibitors by the active C-subunit. Most prominent is the positioning of Arg at the P-6, P-3, and P-2 positions in the substrate. Most substrates have either a P-6 and P-3 Arg or a P-3 and P-2 Arg combination (5Kemp B.E. Bylund D.B.

Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 171-187Google Scholar). Additionally, there is a preference for a large hydrophobic residue at the P+1 position, with little constraint placed at the P-1 position. Residues in the C-subunit that contribute to peptide recognition are located primarily in the large lobe with many of the residues located specifically within the activation segment of the enzyme.The activation segment, broadly defined as residues 184–208, lies on the surface of the large lobe and is essential for organizing the entire enzyme's active site. The activation segment contains little secondary structure, yet includes several distinct functional regions. First is the magnesium-positioning loop, residues 184–187, which positions the magnesium essential for coordinating the γ phosphate of ATP. Residues 188–192 comprise β-sheet 9, the only element of regular secondary structure. This segment interacts with the A-helix outside the core as well as the essential phosphate on Thr-197 in the activation loop. The activation loop follows with residues 194–197. The activation loop is also a site of regulation for most members of the protein kinase family, where phosphorylation on one or two key Tyr, Thr, or Ser residues is required for optimal activity (7Johnson L.N.

In the C-subunit of PKA the k cat is reduced and the K m for ATP is increased when Thr-197 is not phosphorylated (1Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This leads to a 50-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (Kcat/K m). The activation loop of the kinase resides in the large lobe, and the phosphorylated residue in the activation loop of the C-subunit, Thr-197, makes several contacts within the large lobe (Arg-165 and Arg-189), as well as one of the few interactions between the large lobe and the small lobe in the closed conformation (His-87). The next region is the P+1 loop, 198–205. The properly positioned P+1 loop contains regions that interact with the P+1 hydrophobic residue, as well as the P-2 and P-6 arginines of peptide substrates. Examination of a crystallographic molecular model consisting of the C-subunit bound to MgATP and the inhibitor peptide IP20, residues 5–24 of the protein kinase inhibitor, lends insight into the molecular nature of these interactions (16Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The model demonstrates that a hydrophobic pocket is formed, where the side chains of Leu-198, Pro-202, and Leu-205 make the largest contribution to the pocket (Fig. 1 A). Also in the P+1 loop Glu-203 forms a hydrogen bond with the P-6 Arg, and Try-204 forms a hydrogen bond with Glu-230, which directly interacts with the P-2 Arg. These residues contribute to recognition nodules where distal parts of the molecule come together. The residues that facilitate recognition of the P-3 Arg, Glu-127, and Try-330 lie outside the activation loop. Finally there are the conserved APE residues, 206–208. These residues serve as an anchor to the large lobe via interaction with Arg-280, another conserved residue in the large lobe.To further define the role of the P+1 loop in the overall organization of peptide binding, in particular at sites other than the P+1 site, Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the entire loop was carried out (17Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We focus here on Glu-203 and Tyr-204 for further kinetic analysis. Our goals were to determine whether these residues contribute to localized recognition of the P-2 and P-6 Arg, respectively, or whether they contribute more globally to peptide recognition. An additional mutant, Y204F, was engineered to assess the contributions of the aromatic ring without the hydrogen bonding to Glu-230. The steady-state kinetic parameters of the mutants were measured using several synthetic peptide substrates. The traditional heptapeptide substrate, Kemptide (LRRASLG), was assayed in addition to a longer 9-residue peptide (GRTGRRNSI). The longer peptide was modified by substituting an Ala for Arg at the P-2 position or P-6 position. The results indicate that there is a greater communication among the sites of substrate recognition than was previously appreciated by simple examination of the crystal structure and lead us to define this segment more globally as the peptide-positioning loop.RESULTSPrior Ala scanning mutagenesis studies were performed to assess how the residues in the activation segment contribute to phosphorylation on Thr-197 (17Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A particularly interesting mutation, highlighted in these experiments (Y204A), yielded an enzyme that did not phosphorylate Kemptide, but was able to autophosphorylate when expressed in E. coli. Since autophosphorylation requires similar local recognition factors as those for exogenous peptide substrates, further exploration of this phenomenon was warranted. Mutation of the adjacent residue, Glu-203, generated a mutant enzyme active toward Kemptide and capable of autophosphorylation. Surprisingly, Kemptide does not possess a P-6 residue capable of interacting with this charged side chain. The question of whether Glu-203 would discriminate among substrates as Y204A if there were a P-6 Arg could be determined by using a longer peptide substrate. Based on these properties, E203A and Y204 were selected for a more rigorous kinetic analysis using various peptide substrates.Steady-state Kinetic Parameters for the Activation Loop MutantsSince the two mutant enzymes, E203A and Y204A, were both able to autophosphorylate in E. coli but showed differences in activity using a qualitative assay, the kinetic parameters of both were analyzed more quantitatively. Direct phosphorylation of the peptide substrate LRRASLG, Kemptide (25Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), measured by the incorporation of 32P, was used to determine the kinetic properties. Alanine substitution at Glu-203 and Tyr-204 increased theK m for Kemptide by ∼10-fold (TableI). Although both mutations equally affected K m, k cat was decreased only for the Y204A mutant. This decrease ink cat from 33 s−1 to 0.9 s−1 results in a decrease in catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of over 400-fold for the Y204A mutant as compared with a 15-fold reduction for the E203A mutant enzyme. The K m for ATP was similar for all of the enzymes assayed, indicating that these mutations are not influencing the nucleotide pocket. Since the K m for peptide binding does not reflect a true K d for binding peptide (26Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7747-7752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the K i for each protein was also determined using Ala-Kemptide (LRRAALG), an active site-directed inhibitor (27Yoon M.Y. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4118-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These values were increased ∼40-fold for both mutant enzymes relative to the wild type enzyme.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for P + 1 mutant proteins using kemptide as substrateParameterWild typeY204AY204FE230QaE230Q results are from Grant et al.

Open table in a new tab Steady-state Kinetic Parameters for a Longer Peptide SubstrateWhile much kinetic data are available for Kemptide phosphorylation, this short peptide does not exploit all the subsites in the binding pocket. Since the crystallographic molecular model shows that Glu-203 interacts with the P-6 Arg of the substrate (Fig.1 A), but there is no P-6 position in the Kemptide substrate, it was necessary to utilize longer peptides to more fully appreciate the role of Glu-203. A 9-residue peptide with a P-6 Arg, as well as altered peptides with alanines replacing the two arginines involved in substrate recognition at the P-2 and P-6 position, were thus used as comparative substrates. As expected, the added contacts offered by the larger substrate results in a 30-fold lower K m compared with Kemptide (Table II). Alanine substitution at positions 203 and 204 results in 30-fold increases inK m compared with wild type C. These effects are similar to those observed for Kemptide and the alanine mutants. Finally, both alanine mutants have nominal effects onk cat using GRTGRRNSI as a substrate.Table IIKinetic values for P + 1 loop mutant proteins using variations of a longer peptide substrateParameterWild typeG203AY204AY204FGRTGRRNSIK m(μm)1.0 ± 0.333.2 ± 432.6 ± 63.4 ± 0.9k cat(s−1)18.0 ± 222.7 ± 211.4 ± 326.7 ± 0.9k cat/K m18.00.70.37.9GRTGRANSIK m(μm)66.9 ± 5145.9 ± 301978 ± 90407 ± 30k cat(S−1)22.2 ± 227.6 ± 228.4 ± 619.9 ± 0.7k cat/K m0.30.20.010.05GATGRRNSIK m(μm)8.9 ± 159.5 ± 7283 ± 40NDk cat(S−1)31.7 ± 325.5 ± 35.2 ± 3NDk cat/K m3.60.40.02NDND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The P-2-substituted peptide, GRTGRANSI, displays the highestK m with the wild type enzyme compared with the other peptides (Table II). The K m values are also elevated for both mutant proteins using this peptide, although the largest effect occurs with Y204A. The K m value for GRTGRANSI is 2- and 30-fold larger for E203A and Y204A, respectively, than for wild type (Table II). Although the K m values for the P-2-substituted peptide to wild type and the mutants are higher than those for GRTGRRNSI, the k cat values are similar. The P-6-substituted peptide, GATGRRNSI, shows a similar trend with E203A displaying higher affinity than Y204A. TheK m for GATGRRNSI is 6- and 30-fold larger for E203A and Y204A, respectively, than for wild type (Table II). Thek cat values for the P-6-substituted peptide are close in value to those for GRTGRRNSI. Overall, for all peptides studied, substitution at Tyr-204 has the most profound effects on apparent substrate affinity. This is surprising in light of the crystal structure, which demonstrates that this residue makes no direct contact with the peptide.Kinetic Parameters for Y204FThe results from the above kinetic experiments suggest that Tyr-204 may be contributing more to peptide recognition than the electrostatic interaction between the P-2 Arg and Glu-230. The Y204F mutant was engineered to assess the contributions of the aromatic ring to this phenomenon. Any differences between this mutant and the wild type would be a result of the loss of the Tyr-204 hydroxyl group. Consistent with the other mutant proteins, Y204F did not display a change in the K m for ATP (Table I). The K i value for Ala-Kemptide was similar to the other mutant proteins. Using the Kemptide substrate thek cat was found to be similar to that for wild type. While the K m is ∼2-fold higher than that for wild type, this change is much smaller than those for the alanine mutants. These data suggest that the aromatic ring is, indeed, making a significant contribution to peptide recognition. The GRTGRRNSI kinetics display similar trends in K m values as those for the Kemptide substrate. While the K m for GRTGRRNSI is 30-fold higher for Y204A than that for wild type, thisK m is only 3-fold higher for Y204F compared with wild type. The P-2-substituted peptide, GRTGRANSI, did have aK m larger than the Glu-203 mutant protein, but it is still about 5-fold less than the Ala mutant at 204.Activity of Phosphorylated G200A and T201AThe P+1 loop contains other residues necessary for function but not for direct recognition of substrate side chains. These include Gly-200 and Thr-201, both conserved in Ser/Thr kinases. When alanine mutations are engineered at these sites and expressed in Escherichia coli, the resulting proteins are unphosphorylated on Thr-197 and inactive (17Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins analyzed thus far, E203A, Y204A, and Y204F, have all been phosphorylated on Thr-197, and perhaps the inactivity of G200A and T201A is the result of under phosphorylation. To test this, G200A and T201A, were expressed in E. coli along with a wild type control. Since unphosphorylated C-subunit is the best control, the wild type protein was induced in the presence of H-89, a potent PKA inhibitor that disrupts autophosphorylation. The soluble fraction of these bacterial cell lysates was used as substrate material for phosphorylation by the Thr-197 kinase, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1). The success of the phosphorylation reaction was tested using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of Thr-197. Fig.2 A depicts immunoblots of the material in the PDK-1 reaction. The C-subunit antibody shows that each reaction contained the same amount of C-subunit, and the phospho-Thr-197 antibody indicated that each is phosphorylated with similar efficiency. Any lack of activity relative to wild type will not be due to low expression or poor phosphorylation by PDK-1. Aliquots from the phosphorylation reactions were tested for activity toward Kemptide using a qualitative assay. Fig. 2 B indicates that even when phosphorylated on Thr-197, the perturbation of Gly-200 and Thr-201 abolishes activity.Figure 2Activity of phosphorylated G200A and T201A. The Thr-197 kinase, PDK-1, was used to phosphorylate the indicated proteins in an in vitro reaction. The success of the reactions was assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the phosphorylated Thr-197 and for total protein with a C-subunit antibody (A). The blots indicate that there are similar amounts of protein in each reaction and that they are all are phosphorylated with similar efficiency. B indicates the results of the PepTag activity assay. When the fluorescent-tagged Kemptide substrate gets phosphorylated, it undergoes a change in net charge of +1 to −1, altering its direction of migration on an agarose gel. Here phosphorylated peptide migrates toward the top of the page, indicating activity. Only the wild type protein demonstrates activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONAfter carrying out a qualitative screen of alanine mutants made in the activation loop residues (17Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), two C-subunit mutants were selected for kinetic analysis based on their unusual kinetic parameters. The Y204A mutant showed reduced Kemptide activity in the qualitative PepTag assay, but was able to autophosphorylate when expressed in E. coli. This apparent contradiction led to a closer examination of its kinetic parameters. Replacement of Glu-203 with Ala led to a protein that was active and able to autophosphorylate. The structure suggests that the latter residue is involved in recognition of the P-6 arginine (16Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), a residue not found in the Kemptide substrate. Kinetic analysis of these two mutants revealed that the P+1 loop, as well as these two specific residues, plays a global role in organizing the binding of peptide substrates. Each residue not only contributes to a local site, but also shows more long range effects. This work redefines the P+1 loop and suggests that it should more appropriately be described as the peptide-positioning loop, as its contributions go well beyond recognition of only the P+1 residue. In addition, the loop contributes either directly or indirectly to recognition of the P-site, the P-2 site, and the P-6 site.The steady-state kinetic parameters presented in this study explain why Y204A displays lower activity compared with wild type and E203A using the Pep-Tag assay. Although both mutants bind Kemptide with equivalent, poor affinity compared with wild type, the larger decrease ink cat/K m, the catalytic efficiency term, for Y204A compared with E203A is due to a lower turnover number, k cat (Table I). Indeed, theK i values for Ala-Kemptide are much higher than theK m values for Kemptide confirming this point.By studying the longer peptide substrate, GRTGRRNSI, and its derivatives we were able to better evaluate substrate recognition determinants. This peptide contains P-2 and P-6 arginines that can be used to assess the roles of Tyr-204 and Glu-203. While the latter interaction is direct, the former is mediated indirectly via Glu-230 (Fig. 1 A). In general, the K m values for GRTGRRNSI are lower for all the enzymes studied, consistent with improved affinities of the longer peptides. Furthermore, the relative changes in K m values for the mutants follow those for the Kemptide K m values. Alanine substitution at positions 203 and 204 lead to K m increases of 10-fold for Kemptide (Table I), whereas these substitutions lead inK m increases of between 2- and 30-fold for GRTGRRNSI and its derivatives (Table II). When either mutant protein was assayed with the substrate peptides lacking the corresponding arginine residue (i.e. P-2 Ala substitution, Y204A; P-6 Ala substitution, E203A), elevations in K m are obtained. For example, the K m value for GATGRRNSI is 7-fold larger than that for GRTGRRNSI with wild type (Table II). Furthermore, theK m for GRTGRANSI with Y204A is ∼30-fold larger than that for GRTGRRNSI and wild type (Table II). These results demonstrate that both Glu-203 and Tyr-204 contribute to peptide binding to an extent not predicted by the x-ray structure. For instance, the crystal structure clearly illustrates that the hydroxyl group of Tyr-204 interacts with Glu-230, which in turn is in hydrogen bonding distance from the substrate P-2 arginine. In light of the kinetic parameters for the Y204A mutant, it seemed likely that the aromatic ring of the tyrosine might also be contributing to peptide recognition perhaps through an interaction between the P-2 Arg and the π electrons of the aromatic ring. The Y204F mutant protein does indeed demonstrate that the aromatic ring contributes to substrate recognition. The consequence of losing this side chain is seen in the crystal structure of the Y204A mutant protein. 2J. Yang, C. Juliano, X. Nguyen-hu, L. F. Ten Eyck, and S. S. Taylor, manuscript submitted. Glu-203 and Tyr-204 are involved in peptide recognition of a specific substrate residue but also contribute to overall substrate recognition indirectly. The direct interactions are clearly shown in the crystal structure by the proximity of Glu-203 to the P-6 Arg and the network of interactions involving P-2 Arg recognition, termed the P-2 nodule (Fig.1 B, Table III). In the P-2 nodule Tyr-204 with Arg-133 is aiding the positioning of Glu-230, which interacts with the P-2 Arg. Additionally, Glu-170 in the catalytic loop helps coordinate the P-2 arginine. When the Glu-203 mutant is assayed with Kemptide the results show an increase in the K mvalue that is quite larger than expected for a mutant whose substrate determinant was not present. This observation suggests that Glu-203 influences peptide binding beyond the P-6 interaction, perhaps through the P+1 loop. The same holds true for Y204A. This mutation disrupts P-2 Arg binding on the substrate, but a peptide with an alanine substituted at this position increased the K m value even more. Perhaps the P-2 residue itself is contributing to the stability of the enzyme by coordinating those residues that are involved in its binding. Certainly the absence of the P-2 Arg would disrupt the network of the P-2 nodule.Table IIIP-2 nodule residues and interactionsResidueLocationInteractionArg-133D-helixIP20 P-2 ArgGlu-170Catalytic loopIP20 P-2 ArgTyr-204P + 1 loopH-Bond to Glu-230Glu-230F-helixIP20 P-2 Arg Open table in a new tab Both Glu-203 and Tyr-204 lie within a sequence that forms a hydrophobic pocket that binds the substrate's P+1 hydrophobic residue. The positioning of this loop appears to be of critical importance. Hydrophobic residues are contributing to the pocket, and the other non-hydrophobic residues contribute to the proper positioning of the loop and of the substrate. Table IV lists the residues that make up the P+1 loop as well as the interactions in which they are involved. The Glu-203 and the Tyr-204 residues on this loop do not contribute to its hydrophobicity with their side chains; instead they are directed away from the hydrophobic pocket. The increased K m value for mutant proteins with peptide substrates lacking their corresponding arginine may be due to disruption of the P+1 loop and other interactions it makes. Sequence alignments for members of the kinase family highlight the importance of this P+1 loop in substrate recognition (18Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). There are distinct sequence differences between Ser/Thr kinases and Tyr kinases in this loop. These changes reflect the need to accommodate the larger substrate tyrosine. The Thr-201 position is conserved as either a Ser or Thr in Ser/Thr kinases but is almost exclusively Pro in the Tyr kinases. The Glu-203 position is conserved in the AGC superfamily of kinases, but not in other Ser/Thr kinases, whereas this position is basic in the Tyr kinases. The Tyr at 204 is somewhat conserved in the Ser/Thr kinases with some substitutions of Phe or Trp but is always aromatic in the Tyr kinases. The inactivity of G200A and T201A, even when phosphorylated, further demonstrates the importance of these individual residues as well as the global nature the contributions this loop makes.Table IVInteractions made by P + 1 loop residuesResidueInteractionLeu-198P + 1 pocketCys-199Water molecule, CH3 of Thr-197 and δC of His-87Gly-200Hydrogen bond to P + 1 backbone amideThr-201Hydrogen bond to"
https://openalex.org/W2062365107,"Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I, which catalyzes the conversion of palmitoyl-CoA to palmitoylcarnitine facilitating its transport through the mitochondrial membranes, is inhibited by malonyl-CoA. By using the SequenceSpace algorithm program to identify amino acids that participate in malonyl-CoA inhibition in all carnitine acyltransferases, we found 5 conserved amino acids (Thr314, Asn464, Ala478, Met593, and Cys608, rat liver CPT I coordinates) common to inhibitable malonyl-CoA acyltransferases (carnitine octanoyltransferase and CPT I), and absent in noninhibitable malonyl-CoA acyltransferases (CPT II, carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)). To determine the role of these amino acid residues in malonyl-CoA inhibition, we prepared the quintuple mutant CPT I T314S/N464D/A478G/M593S/C608A as well as five single mutants CPT I T314S, N464D, A478G, M593S, and C608A. In each case the CPT I amino acid selected was mutated to that present in the same homologous position in CPT II, CAT, and ChAT. Because mutant M593S nearly abolished the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, two other Met593mutants were prepared: M593A and M593E. The catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) of CPT I in mutants A478G and C608A and all Met593 mutants toward carnitine as substrate was clearly increased. In those CPT I proteins in which Met593 had been mutated, the malonyl-CoA sensitivity was nearly abolished. Mutations in Ala478, Cys608, and Thr314 to their homologous amino acid residues in CPT II, CAT, and ChAT caused various decreases in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Ala478 is located in the structural model of CPT I near the catalytic site and participates in the binding of malonyl-CoA in the low affinity site (Morillas, M., Gómez-Puertas, P., Rubı́, B., Clotet, J., Ariño, J., Valencia, A., Hegardt, F. G., Serra, D., and Asins, G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 11473–11480). Met593 may participate in the interaction of malonyl-CoA in the second affinity site, whose location has not been reported. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I, which catalyzes the conversion of palmitoyl-CoA to palmitoylcarnitine facilitating its transport through the mitochondrial membranes, is inhibited by malonyl-CoA. By using the SequenceSpace algorithm program to identify amino acids that participate in malonyl-CoA inhibition in all carnitine acyltransferases, we found 5 conserved amino acids (Thr314, Asn464, Ala478, Met593, and Cys608, rat liver CPT I coordinates) common to inhibitable malonyl-CoA acyltransferases (carnitine octanoyltransferase and CPT I), and absent in noninhibitable malonyl-CoA acyltransferases (CPT II, carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)). To determine the role of these amino acid residues in malonyl-CoA inhibition, we prepared the quintuple mutant CPT I T314S/N464D/A478G/M593S/C608A as well as five single mutants CPT I T314S, N464D, A478G, M593S, and C608A. In each case the CPT I amino acid selected was mutated to that present in the same homologous position in CPT II, CAT, and ChAT. Because mutant M593S nearly abolished the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, two other Met593mutants were prepared: M593A and M593E. The catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) of CPT I in mutants A478G and C608A and all Met593 mutants toward carnitine as substrate was clearly increased. In those CPT I proteins in which Met593 had been mutated, the malonyl-CoA sensitivity was nearly abolished. Mutations in Ala478, Cys608, and Thr314 to their homologous amino acid residues in CPT II, CAT, and ChAT caused various decreases in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Ala478 is located in the structural model of CPT I near the catalytic site and participates in the binding of malonyl-CoA in the low affinity site (Morillas, M., Gómez-Puertas, P., Rubı́, B., Clotet, J., Ariño, J., Valencia, A., Hegardt, F. G., Serra, D., and Asins, G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 11473–11480). Met593 may participate in the interaction of malonyl-CoA in the second affinity site, whose location has not been reported. The enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1The abbreviations used are: CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase; L-CPT I, liver isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; M-CPT I, muscle isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; CAT, carnitine acetyltransferase; COT, carnitine octanoyltransferase; ChAT, choline acetyltransferase 1The abbreviations used are: CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase; L-CPT I, liver isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; M-CPT I, muscle isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; CAT, carnitine acetyltransferase; COT, carnitine octanoyltransferase; ChAT, choline acetyltransferase I catalyzes the conversion of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines, which is the first step in the transport of fatty acyl-CoA groups from the cytosol to mitochondria where they undergo β-oxidation. This reaction is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, and so this enzyme could be the most physiologically important regulatory step in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar). This process allows the cell to signal the relative availability of lipid and carbohydrate fuels in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic β-cell (2Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 505-515Google Scholar). The mechanism of malonyl-CoA inhibition can be potentially mimicked by pharmacological malonyl-CoA-related agents for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, insulin resistance, and coronary heart disease (3Anderson R.C. Curr. Pharmaceut. Design. 1998; 4: 1-16Google Scholar). Mammals express two isoforms of CPT I, a liver isoform (L-CPT I) and a heart/skeletal muscle isoform (M-CPT I), which are the products of two different genes (4Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Google Scholar, 5Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 41-45Google Scholar). The identity in amino acids residues is high (62%) but they are differentially regulated by malonyl-CoA. The L-CPT I isoform is inhibited by malonyl-CoA to a much lesser extent than the M-CPT I isoform (the IC50 value for M-CPT I is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than for L-CPT I) (6Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Google Scholar). This property is probably involved in the finer regulation of fatty acid oxidation in heart and skeletal muscle in comparison to liver. From studies on the pH dependence of the affinity of CPT I for its substrate and from the ability of palmitoyl-CoA to displace [14C]malonyl-CoA bound to skeletal muscle mitochondria it was hypothesized (7Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 601-608Google Scholar) that the palmitoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA bind at different sites. A number of studies have shown that in rat liver CPT I there are two malonyl-CoA binding sites: one with greater capacity for binding and regulation of the inhibitor and not susceptible to competition from acyl-CoA, which behaves as an allosteric component (8Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 639-647Google Scholar, 9Nic a'Bhaird N. Ramsay R.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 637-640Google Scholar, 10Saggerson E.D. Carpenter C.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 132: 166-168Google Scholar, 11Cook G.A. Mynatt R.L. Kashfi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8803-8807Google Scholar, 12Kashfi K. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 245-252Google Scholar); and a second acyl-CoA binding site, which is located near the catalytic site (13Grantham B.D. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 589-593Google Scholar). Various groups have attempted to establish the basis of the L-CPT I/malonyl-CoA interactions. The probable binding sites of malonyl-CoA in L-CPT I were deduced to be at the C terminus after preparation of several L-CPT I chimeras whose IC50 values for malonyl-CoA corresponded to the C-terminal region (14Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Google Scholar) of the chimera. However, the N terminus of L-CPT I was also shown to influence the enzyme/inhibitor interaction. Mutation of Glu3, His5, or His140 produced a loss of malonyl-CoA sensitivity (15Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Google Scholar, 16Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar). In addition, the removal of the segment comprised between amino acids 1 and 18 in L-CPT I and 1–28 in M-CPT I produced a decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity, which emphasizes the importance of the N terminus before the first transmembrane region as a modulator of the malonyl-CoA inhibition (17Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Google Scholar, 18Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, it was proposed that the two malonyl-CoA inhibitable domains might be located at the C terminus as suggested by several kinetic studies. The development of a CPT I catalytic core model (19Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Google Scholar) allowed us to assign the low affinity binding site to a domain near the catalytic channel in which palmitoyl-CoA is bound containing the catalytic acyl-CoA binding domain (20Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Rubı́ B. Clotet J. Ariño J. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Serra D. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Google Scholar) Here we used the SequenceSpace algorithm program to identify five amino acid residues (Thr314, Asn464, Ala478, Met593, and Cys608), which may contribute to the sensitivity of CPT I to malonyl-CoA. The proposal is based on the finding that they are present in malonyl-CoA-inhibitable CPT I ((isoforms L- and M-) and COT from various organisms and absent in noninhibitable acyltransferases (CPT II, CAT, and ChAT). Mutation of these amino acids to their counterparts in CPT II showed that mutation of Met593 by itself, M593S, or the quintuple mutant containing the M593S mutation, T314S/N464D/A478G/M593S/C608A, or other Met593 point mutants such as M593A and M593E nearly abolished malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPT I. The remaining mutated amino acids showed slight, varied sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition. Sequences of proteins from the carnitine-choline acyltransferase family were obtained using BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Multiple alignment was performed using ClustalW (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). The analysis of conserved differences (tree-determinants) between malonyl-CoA-regulated (L-CPT I, M-CPT I, and COT) and nonregulated (CPT II, CAT, and ChAT) acyltransferases, using multivariate statistics for low-dimensional representation, was done using the SequenceSpace algorithm (23Casari G. Sander C. Valencia A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 171-178Google Scholar, 24Pazos F. Sanchez-Pulido L. Garcı́a-Ranea J.A. Andrade M.A. Atrian S. Valencia A. Lundh D. Olsson B. Narayanan A. Biocomputing and Emergent Computation. World Scientific, Singapore1997: 132-145Google Scholar). Graphics of vectors representing protein sequences and individual residues from the multiple alignment were performed using the Sequence Space Java-based viewer (www.industry.ebi.ac.uk/SeqSpace). Plasmids pYESLCPTIwt and pYESLCPTA478G were obtained as previously described (20Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Rubı́ B. Clotet J. Ariño J. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Serra D. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Google Scholar). Plasmids pYESLCPTT314S, pYESLCPTN464D, pYESLCPTM593S, pYESLCPTM593A, pYESLCPTM593E, and pYESLCPTC608A were constructed using the QuikChange polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene) with the pYESLCPTwt plasmid as template. The following primers were used: primer T314S.for 5′-GGGAGCGACTCTTCAATAGTTCCCGGATCCCTGGG-3′, primer T314A.rev 5′-CCCAGGGATCCGGGAACTATTGAAGAGTCGCTCCC-3′, primer N464D.for 5′-CACCTTTGTTGTCTTCAAAGACAGCAAGATAGGC-3′, primer N464D.rev 5′-GCCTATCTTGCTGTCTTTGAAGACACCAAAGGTG-3′, primer M593S.for 5′-CCTCACATATGAGGCCTCCAGTACCCGGCTCTTCCG AGAAGG-3′, primer M593S.rev 5′-CCTTCTCGGAAGAGCCGGGTACTGGAGGCCTCATATGTGAGG-3′, primer M593A.for 5′-CCTCACATATGAGGCCTCCGCGACCCGGCTCTTCCGAGAAGG-3′, primer M593A.rev 5′-CCTTCTCGGAAGAGCCGGGTCGCGGAGGCCTCATA TGTGAGG-3′, primer M593E.for 5′-CCTCACATATGAGGCCTCCGAGACCCGGCTCTTCCGAGAAGG-3′, primer M593E.rev 5′-CCTTCTCGGAAGAGCCGGGTCTCGGAGGCCTCATATGTGAGG-3′, primer C608A.for 5′-GAGACTGTACGCTCCGCCACTATGGAGTCCTGC-3′, and C608A.rev 5′-GCAGGACTCCATAGTGGCGGAGCGTACAGTCTC-3′ (the mutated nucleotides are underlined). The plasmid pYESLCPTIT314S/N464D/A478G/M593S/C608A was obtained by the same method, but performing each new mutation stepwise starting on plasmid pYESLCPTT314S. The appropriate substitutions as well as the absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed by sequencing the inserts in both directions with an Applied Biosystems 373 automated DNA sequencer. The expression of the constructs containing L-CPT I wild type and mutants (see above) in yeast cells and the preparation of the cell extracts were performed as described in Ref. 19Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Google Scholar. S. cerevisiae was chosen as an expression system for L-CPT I wild type and the mutants because it does not have endogenous CPT I activity. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was determined by the radiometric method as described in Ref. 19Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Google Scholar with minor modifications. The substrates werel-[methyl-3H]carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA. Enzyme activity was assayed for 4 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. For determination of the K m for carnitine, palmitoyl-CoA was fixed at 135 μm (for L-CPT I). For determination of the K m for acyl-CoA, carnitine concentration was fixed at 400 μm. When malonyl-CoA inhibition was assayed, increasing concentrations of malonyl-CoA were included. The IC50, defined as the malonyl-CoA concentration that produces 50% inhibition of enzyme activity, was determined using 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA and 400 μm carnitine. K m was estimated by analyzing the data from three experiments using the program Enzifit (Biosoft), and IC50 was calculated by Excel software using linear regression analysis. Values reported in the text are the means and standard deviations of three to five determinations. Curve fitting was carried out using Excel software. All protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine albumin as standard. Western blot analysis was performed as described (19Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Google Scholar). The antibody for rat L-CPT I was kindly given by Dr. V. A. Zammit (Hannah Research Institute, Ayr, Scotland, United Kingdom) and was directed against peptide 428–441, in the cytosolic catalytic C-terminal domain. An exhaustive analysis of the presence of residues shared by all the malonyl-CoA-regulated enzymes of the carnitine-choline acyltransferase family versus the malonyl-CoA nonregulated members of the same family was performed using the algorithm SequenceSpace (23Casari G. Sander C. Valencia A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 171-178Google Scholar, 24Pazos F. Sanchez-Pulido L. Garcı́a-Ranea J.A. Andrade M.A. Atrian S. Valencia A. Lundh D. Olsson B. Narayanan A. Biocomputing and Emergent Computation. World Scientific, Singapore1997: 132-145Google Scholar). This method uses a vectorial representation of each protein sequence as a point in a multidimensional space (SequenceSpace) and multivariate statistics, principal component analysis, to allow reduction of the number of dimensions. This representation allows us not only to define clusters of proteins according to specific properties by choosing the appropriate axes defined by the highest corresponding eigenvalues (also known as proper values), but also to project the individual residues on the same axes, and thus trace the positions conserved in the subfamilies defined. The main advantage of this method is the possibility of predicting which residues may be responsible for the specific characteristics of each protein subfamily or group of subfamilies as has been reported previously for short- and medium-long substrate specificity for the carnitine-choline acyltransferases protein family (19Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Google Scholar, 20Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Rubı́ B. Clotet J. Ariño J. Valencia A.

Valencia A. Wittinghofer A. Camonis J.H. Cool R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17763-17770Google Scholar). The two-dimensional projection of sequence vectors on the plane defined by the axes corresponding to eigenvalues 2 and 4 showed clustering of the enzyme subfamilies according to their malonyl-CoA inhibition properties (Fig.1 A). Proteins whose activity is not regulated by malonyl-CoA (CPT II, CAT, and ChAT subfamilies) were grouped, whereas the sequences of the proteins regulated by malonyl-CoA (COT, L-CPT I, and M-CPT I) occupy separate, and opposite, zones. The projection of the individual amino acid residues on the same plane (Fig. 1 B) revealed the amino acids responsible for this segregation might be responsible for the susceptibility to malonyl-CoA of the corresponding enzymes. Five of these amino acids (Thr314, Asn464, Ala478, Met593, and Cys608) were present in all malonyl-CoA inhibitable carnitine acyltransferases and absent in the nonmalonyl-CoA inhibitable acyltransferases (CPT II, CAT, and ChAT from several species). Fig. 2 shows the sequence alignment of three fragments of the C-terminal region of various acyltransferases. We can also observe that those enzymes that are not inhibitable by malonyl-CoA (CPT II, CAT, and ChAT) show the same amino acids in these positions, which are different from those observed in inhibitable malonyl-CoA acylcarnitines. As an example the positions and amino acids of CPT II are given: Ser223, Asp363, Gly377, Ser490, and Ala505 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Alignment of representative sequences of mammalian carnitine-choline acyltransferases.

After we observed that mutant M593S nearly abolished the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA (see below), new point Met mutants were prepared: M593A and M593E. All transformed yeast cells expressed a protein with the same molecular mass (88 kDa) and the mutant enzymes were expressed in roughly the same proportion per milligram of protein as the wild type L-CPT I as deduced from immunoblot analysis (data not shown). L-CPT I activities of the wild type, quintuple mutant variant T314S/N464D/A478G/M593S/C608S, and point mutants were similar (values ranged between 14 and 20 nmol min−1 mg protein−1) when the protein was overexpressed 20 h after galactose induction, showing that the various mutations assayed produce small changes in L-CPT I activity (TableI).Table IEnzyme activity, malonyl-CoA sensitivity and kinetic parameters of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I in Saccharomyces cerevisiac cells expressing CPI I wild type and point mutants, T314S, N464D, A478G, C608A, M593S, M593A, M593E and quintuple mutant T314S/N464D/A478G/M593S/C608A (QM)L-CPT IActivityIC50 malonyl-CoAK mV maxCatalytic efficiencyCarnitinePalmitoyl-CoACarnitinePalmitoyl-CoACarnitinePalmitoyl-CoAnmol min −1 mg protein −1μmnmol min−1 mg protein−1V max/K mWild-type17.7 ± 0.912.3127 ± 4.54.9 ± 0.36.6 ± 0.86.3 ± 0.40.05 (× 1)1.28 (× 1)T314S14.4 ± 2.115.088.2 ± 2.41.7 ± 0.512.8 ± 0.16.8 ± 0.10.15 (× 2.8)3.98 (× 3.1)N464D20.1 ± 3.18.769.5 ± 8.24.1 ± 0.419.4 ± 1.418.9 ± 3.60.28 (× 5.6)4.63 (× 3.6)A478G16.7 ± 0.739.5327 ± 4115.1 ± 4.069.8 ± 9.350.4 ± 170.21 (× 4.1)3.34 (× 2.6)C608A17.3 ± 1.727.551.6 ± 4.024.3 ± 2.023.7 ± 5.067.5 ± 9.00.46 (× 8.8)2.78 (× 2.2)M593S17.0 ± 0.8319124 ± 0.87.4 ± 1.2133 ± 1820.9 ± 1.61.07 (× 21)2.84 (× 2.2)M593A17.2 ± 0.915556.3 ± 2.16.1 ± 0.232.5 ± 4.630.3 ± 4.70.58 (× 12)4.81 (× 3.7)M593E14.1 ± 1.8220150 ± 3.46.3 ± 0.531.3 ± 2.627.5 ± 1.80.21 (× 4.2)4.37 (× 3.4)QM13.6 ± 1.625895.7 ± 2.84.6 ± 1.513.1 ± 4.713.0 ± 6.30.14 (× 2.6)2.84 (× 2.2)Extracts from yeast expressing wild type and several mutants of L-CPT I were assayed for activity, malonyl-CoA sensitivity, and kinetics as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments with different preparations.

Open table in a new tab Extracts from yeast expressing wild type and several mutants of L-CPT I were assayed for activity, malonyl-CoA sensitivity, and kinetics as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments with different preparations. In parentheses are shown the increase (in-fold number) of the catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) versus to that of the wild type. All mutants exhibited standard saturation kinetics when the carnitine concentration was varied relative to a constant concentration of the second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA, and when palmitoyl-CoA concentration was varied relative to a constant carnitine concentration, a property identical to that of the wild type L-CPT I (Fig.3). The quintuple mutant produced small changes in the kinetic constants for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates (Table I). Catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) was increased by a factor of 2.6 (carnitine) and 2.2 (palmitoyl-CoA). The catalytic efficiency for carnitine as substrate of those point mutants that altered the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA increased (see below). The catalytic efficiency of the methionine mutants increased between 4.2- and 21-fold, C608A increased 8.8-fold, and A478G increased 4.1-fold. T314S, which produced a small change in malonyl-CoA sensitivity (see below), increased the V max/K mvalue by only 2.8, whereas in N464D, in which the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA was unchanged (see below), the catalytic efficiency was modified by a factor of 5.6. An analogous tendency was also observed in K m for palmitoyl-CoA but the changes were smaller. K mvalues for palmitoyl-CoA were 24.3, 15.1, 7.4, 6.1, and 6.3 for mutants C608A, A478G, M593S, M593A, and M593E, respectively (K m value for the wild type was 4.9) (Table I). Catalytic efficiencies for palmitoyl-CoA as substrate increased in all mutants, the values ranging between 2.78 and 4.81 (Table I). When inhibitory kinetics versus increasing concentrations of malonyl-CoA was performed, the quintuple mutant practically abolished the sensitivity toward malonyl-CoA (IC50 of 258versus 12.3 μm of the wild type) (Fig.4 B and Table I). Even at concentrations as high as 100 μm malonyl-CoA the CPT I quintuple mutant maintained 80% of the activity of the control without malonyl-CoA. We then addressed the individual responsibility of the separate CPT I mutants for the malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Mutants T314S, N464D, M593S, and C608A expressed in S. cerevisiae were incubated with increasing amounts of malonyl-CoA, and CPT I activity was determined. Mutant A478G had been previously studied in Ref. 20Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Rubı́ B. Clotet J. Ariño J. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Serra D. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Google Scholar and showed decreased sensitivity to malonyl-CoA (IC50 of 39.5versus 12.3 μm of the wild type). The kinetics of inhibition by malonyl-CoA depended on the mutant considered. Whereas mutant M593S (Fig. 4 A) showed very low sensitivity at malonyl-CoA inhibition (IC50 of 319 μm), the other mutations produced varied changes in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. L-CPT I C608A slightly modified the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA (IC50 is 27.5 μm), the change in IC50 of mutant T314S was small, whereas N464D showed similar sensitivity to malonyl-CoA to the wild type (Fig.4 B and Table I). Because the highest changes in sensitivity to malonyl-CoA and K m values for carnitine were observed in the methionine mutants (point and quintuple mutants), we additionally prepared two new mutants: M593A and M593E to examine whether Met593 was essential to the malonyl-CoA interaction in L-CPT I. Results show that the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA was also nearly abolished in these mutants (Fig. 4 A) (IC50 values of 155 and 220 μm, respectively) as in the M593S mutant, confirming the essential role of Met593 in this interaction. We attempted to identify the amino acids in the C-terminal domain of L-CPT I that are responsible for the inhibition of the catalytic activity by malonyl-CoA. Over many years much work has been done to identify the domains in L-CPT I that may bind malonyl-CoA. Different groups have tested different empirical hypotheses and mutated amino acids, mostly in the amino-terminal region of L-CPT I. The results have shown that this domain plays a role in the regulation of CPT I by malonyl-CoA, because in some cases the sensitivity to the inhibitor is impaired. A different approach was employed by our group very recently. This was based on the conservation of two histidine residues, which are present in the inhibitable malonyl-CoA carnitine acyltransferases (CPT I and COT) and absent in noninhibitable enzymes (CPT II and CAT). Mutation of both histidines resulted in the abolition of malonyl-CoA sensitivity in COT (26Morillas M. Clotet J. Rubı́ B. Serra D. Asins G. Ariño J. Hegardt F.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 183-186Google Scholar). Analogous results were observed in CPT I when its concentration at the mitochondrial membranes was not high. Mutation of other amino acids in the domain proximal to the catalytic site (Ala478 and Pro479) indicated that a malonyl-CoA-inhibitable domain was probably the low-affinity malonyl-CoA binding site. Our previous studies showed that the location of malonyl-CoA in the structural model was compatible with competition of the inhibitor versus the substrate in the malonyl-CoA low affinity binding site (20Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Rubı́ B. Clotet J. Ariño J. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Serra D. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Google Scholar). The site-directed mutagenesis study used here to identify amino acids responsible for malonyl-CoA inhibition is based on the comparison of the sequences in a range of carnitine and choline acyltransferases, taking the positive or negative sensitivity to malonyl-CoA as a discriminatory criterion. The biocomputing study has shown that five amino acids are present in all CPT I (isoforms L- and M-) and in COT from various organisms and that they are absent not only in other nonmalonyl-CoA-inhibitable carnitine acyltransferases but also in ChAT. In rat L-CPT I these amino acids are Thr314, Asn464, Ala478, Met593, and Cys608. The corresponding positional amino acids in CPT II, CAT, and ChAT are Ser223, Asp363, Gly377, Ser490, and Ala505, respectively (coordinates of rat CPT II). Therefore, we considered it highly probable that these amino acids were involved in the interaction of malonyl-CoA. Results confirmed in part this supposition. The quintuple mutant reduced malonyl-CoA sensitivity almost completely (80% activity at 100 μm malonyl-CoA (which is outside the physiological range)), supporting the initial hypothesis. The results obtained using separate single mutants indicate that not all of these amino acids have the same role in malonyl-CoA inhibition. Whereas M593S nearly abolished the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA like the quintuple mutant, A478G increased the IC50 from 12 to 39.5 μm (20Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Rubı́ B. Clotet J. Ariño J. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Serra D. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Google Scholar). The other amino acids are less responsible for the inhibition. The relevance of Met593 as a critical amino acid for malonyl-CoA sensitivity was confirmed by the results of mutation to other two amino acids, Ala and Glu. The mutants equally showed diminished sensitivity to malonyl-CoA like mutant M593S. Met593, when mutated to Ser as it appears in CPT II and CAT, decreased the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA in a stronger fashion than when it was mutated to other amino acids like Ala and Glu, which were unrelated to this position in other carnitine acyltransferases. Therefore, we conclude that the occurrence of Ser in this position has probably been evolutionary conserved in nonmalonyl-CoA-sensitive carnitine acyltransferases because it prevents sensitivity to malonyl-CoA. In any case, it appears that Met593 is critical in the interaction of malonyl-CoA with L-CPT I. It was of interest to measure the kinetic constants of all CPT I mutants. Several authors reported the competition between malonyl-CoA and carnitine (27McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Google Scholar, 28Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 161-167Google Scholar). The tissues in which the sensitivity of CPT I to malonyl-CoA is highest are those that require the highest concentration of carnitine to drive the reaction and the requirement for carnitine and sensitivity to malonyl-CoA appears to be inversely related. The authors concluded that the sites to which the two metabolites bind are closely associated (27McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Google Scholar, 7Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 601-608Google Scholar). Studies by Bird and Saggerson (28Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 161-167Google Scholar) showed on the one hand that malonyl-CoA reduced the effectiveness of carnitine as substrate, and on the other hand, that carnitine might diminish the regulatory effect of malonyl-CoA (29Bremer J. Norum K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1744-1748Google Scholar). Although a clear mechanism for this competition could not be established, the data strongly supported this idea. In the present study the various CPT I mutants have altered K m orV max for carnitine. Whereas theK m for C608A was half of the wild type, itsV max was 3.6-fold higher. The mutant M593S had the same K m value for carnitine as the wild type but its V max increased 20-fold. The mutant A478G increased both the K m value and theV max with respect to the wild type values. The relationship between these values and catalysis is best revealed in the term catalytic efficiency. This term as calculated by theV max/K m ratio varies considerably among different mutants. Carnitine catalytic efficiencies for mutants M593S, M593A, M593E, C608A, and A478G increased 21-, 12-, 4.2-, 8.8-, and 4.1-fold with respect to the wild type. This means that mutations designed to decrease malonyl-CoA sensitivity strongly modified the catalytic efficiency of CPT I mutants measured in the absence of malonyl-CoA. Interestingly, the increase in catalytic efficiency appears to be roughly proportional to the extent of the alteration in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. The IC50 values for malonyl-CoA run in the same direction to the catalytic efficiency of the mutants. This indicates that those mutants that can locate carnitine better at the catalytic site might displace malonyl-CoA from its site, preventing the binding of the metabolite and thus the inhibition of CPT I. Because L-CPT I has not been crystallized, we do not know the proximity of Met593 to the site of carnitine binding to perform the catalytic event. However, Met593 is very near the tripeptide TET602–604, which has been reported to play an important role in the accommodation of carnitine in catalysis. Cronin (30Cronin C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24465-24469Google Scholar) showed that mutation of the homologous tripeptide VDN in choline acetyltransferases to TET greatly increased the catalytic efficiency of the reaction (137-fold) using carnitine as substrate. This proximity between Met593 and TET602–604 would explain the inverse correlation observed between the catalytic efficiency for carnitine and the IC50 for malonyl-CoA values of the mutants assayed. A new scenario appears in the mutual interaction between carnitine and malonyl-CoA in CPT I. The domain comprised, at least, between amino acid residues 593 and 604 is probably the site of interaction between carnitine and malonyl-CoA, which exclude each other. Higher catalytic efficiencies for carnitine in the mutants are followed by decreases in the inhibitory sensitivity to malonyl-CoA. It is equally interesting to note that all mutants tested show higher catalytic efficiency for palmitoyl-CoA as substrate than the wild type. The increase in V max /K mranges from 2- to 3-fold. Previous work with a partially purified preparation of CPT I had indicated that the kinetics of the reaction with respect to carnitine concentration could be highly dependent on the concentration of the second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA (29Bremer J. Norum K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1744-1748Google Scholar). Experiments carried out by Bird and Saggerson (28Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 161-167Google Scholar) showed that in fasted animals, in which carnitine concentration was decreased, the IC50 values for malonyl-CoA increased up to 17-fold and the binding of [2-14-C]malonyl-CoA was reduced by 35% at 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA and to even lower values at increasing palmitoyl-CoA concentrations. Only two of these mutated amino acids are located in the three-dimensional CPT I structural model. Ala478 is one of the amino acids present in the low affinity site of malonyl-CoA interaction. This amino acid together with Pro479 and His483 conform a domain to which malonyl-CoA appears to bind (20Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Rubı́ B. Clotet J. Ariño J. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Serra D. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Google Scholar). Mutation of this amino acid would explain a decrease in sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, and therefore it would also explain the increase in catalytic efficiency. On the other hand, Asn464is also present in the catalytic core of the structural model of CPT I (20Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Rubı́ B. Clotet J. Ariño J. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Serra D. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Google Scholar), but its location does not permit any conclusions about a participation in the malonyl-CoA inhibitory effect. In fact it is located on the opposite site to malonyl-CoA (data not shown). Therefore, it is not surprising that its mutation from Asn464 to Asp464 does not alter sensitivity to the inhibitor. As a corollary of this study, we conclude that the occurrence of the five other amino acids (Ser223, Asp363, Gly377, Ser490, and Ala505) at the positions, respectively, identical to those amino acids seen in CPT I may be sufficient to prevent the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA not only to carnitine acyltransferases such as CPT II and CAT but also to ChAT. The use of either the quintuple mutant or the methionine point mutants may allow studies on the influence of these negative dominant CPT Is, which are expected to be independent of malonyl-CoA concentration in a range of tissues such as liver, muscle, and the β-cell, in which the metabolism of fatty acids plays important roles in ketone body synthesis, resistance to insulin, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, respectively. Some of these topics are the subject of current investigations in our laboratory.

A number of studies have addressed the structural basis by which MHC class II molecules carry out its multiple functions.

It has been proposed that both transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions are involved in signaling via MHC class II molecules using different pathways. Nevertheless, the two pathways must be at least partially cooperative since disruption of either leads to a loss of MHC class II-induced B cell differentiation (13Harton J.A. Van Hagen A.E.

Indeed, the translocation of MHC class II molecules into lipid rafts seems to be a requirement for PTK activation. In this study, we show that small but significant amounts of HLA-DR molecules were constitutively present in the lipid rafts of normal human B cells, human EBV−, and EBV+ B cell lines, monocytes, transfected HeLa cells, and monocytic THP-1 cells treated with IFN-γ or transfected with the MHC class II transactivator CIITA. The localization of HLA-DR in the lipid rafts was unaffected by the deletion of the cytoplasmic domains of the α and β chains. We further show that initiation of signal transduction such as activation of PTK, in particular Lyn, and homotypic cell-cell adhesion required the dimerization of MHC class II molecules in the lipid rafts. In contrast, activation of ERK1/2 was critically dependent on MHC class II dimerization, but did not require the presence of MHC class II molecules in the rafts.

All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin (WISENT, Saint-Bruno, QC). Stimulated and unstimulated cells (107) were washed twice in cold serum-free RPMI 1640 and lysed in 400 μl of ice-cold TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmNa3VO4 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Montreal, QC) for 30 min on ice. Cells lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose in TNE and deposited in SW60Ti centrifuge tubes. The samples were overlaid with 2.4 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose in TNE and centrifuged for 16 h at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C. Eleven fractions (380 μl) were collected beginning at the top of the tube. Aliquots of each fraction were mixed with 6× Laemmli buffer containing 6% 2-mercaptoethanol and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, the membranes were incubated with DRα mAb DA6.147, washed extensively, and subjected to chemiluminescent detection with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab using an ECL kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The distribution of HLA-DR molecules was determined by densitometry using a Bio Image Densitometer and whole band analysis software (Millipore, MI). To ensure that the results fell into the linear range, scans of multiple exposures were obtained. Immunoblots with CD45 mAb were performed using the same conditions. For some experiments, the membranes were stripped and sequentially probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10, anti-phospho-ERK 1/2, anti-Erk1, anti-phospho-Lyn, and anti-Lyn Abs. To detect the GM1 raft marker, 10-μl aliquots of each fraction were dotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was then incubated with CTB-HRP and developed with chemiluminescent reagents as described above. THP-1 cells (106 cells/ml) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium before stimulation. Stimulations were carried out as indicated in the figure legends and stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× modified Laemmli sample buffer (29Gilbert C. Rollet-Labelle E. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 261: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) preheated to 95 °C. Total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 2% gelatin and 0.15% Tween 20 in TBS, membranes were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 and subjected to chemiluminescent detection with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab as described above. After stripping, the membranes were sequentially reprobed with anti-phospho-ERK 1/2, anti-Erk1, anti-phospho-Lyn, and anti-Lyn Abs. Cells were stimulated with FITC-labeled L243 mAb or FITC-labeled isotype control mAb (8C12) for 5 min. Washed cells were lysed and fractionated on a sucrose gradient as described above. Fractions 3, 4, and 5 (raft) and fractions 9, 10, and 11 (soluble) were pooled. FITC-labeled L243 and FITC-labeled 8C12 were quantified in the two pools using a microplate fluorescence reader (BIO-TEX, FL600). The results were normalized with respect to the isotype control and expressed as percentages. To alter the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane, cells were washed three times in serum-free RPMI 1640 and resuspended at a concentration of 107cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm MβCD for 30 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing at room temperature, the cells were stimulated with either isotype-matched control mAb 8C12 or mAb L243 at a concentration of 0.5 μg/106 cells for 5 min at 37 °C. To reverse the effect of cholesterol depletion, MβCD-treated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in RPMI 1640 containing 50 μg/ml of cholesterol water-soluble. CIITA-transfected THP-1 cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum and seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at 1 × 105cells/well. Cells were stimulated at 37 °C for 1 h with mAb W6/32, mAb L243, or the F(ab) fragment of L243 at 1 μg/ml. The cells were pretreated with erbstatin analog (5 μg/ml) or PP2 (10 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C or with 10 mmMβCD for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI 1640 when indicated. Cell-cell adhesion was monitored using a light microscope, and photographs were taken. To determine whether HLA-DR molecules were present in lipid rafts in APCs and to study the role of their presence in HLA-DR-induced responses, we first examined the baseline distribution of these molecules in normal human B cells using sucrose gradient fractions derived from 1% Triton X-100 cell lysates. While HLA-DR molecules were mainly detected in soluble fractions (Fig.1 A), ∼2% were found in the lipid rafts of resting human tonsillar B cells as determined by quantitative densitometry. GM1 ganglioside, a well-known constituent of lipid rafts, was recovered in fractions 2–4, whereas CD45 phosphatase was found exclusively in fractions 9–11, indicating that our conditions were appropriate for separating raft and non-raft membrane fractions. When Triton X-100 was titrated or other detergents were used such as CHAPS, Brij 58, and Nonidet P-40, we found that 1% Triton is the only condition that allow us to isolate GM1 without any detectable levels of CD45 molecules (data not shown). Based on these results, 1% Triton X-100 cell lysates were used in all the following experiments. Because it is well established that MHC class II molecules and BCR signaling share numerous similarities (30Lang P. Stolpa J.C. Freiberg B.A. Crawford F. Kappler J. Kupfer A. Cambier J.C. Science. 2001; 291: 1537-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the presence of LMP2A in the lipid rafts of EBV-immortalized human B cell lines has recently been shown to affect the distribution of BCR (31Dykstra M.L. Longnecker R. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 57-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the EBV transformation on the distribution of HLA-DR molecules. To this end, we used two B cell lines (BL28 and BJAB) and their EBV-transformed counterparts. Fig. 1, B andC shows that 4% (BJAB) to 5% (BL28) of HLA-DR molecules were found in the fractions corresponding to lipid rafts, and the presence of EBV gene products did not affect the partitioning of HLA-DR molecules. We next analyzed the localization of HLA-DR molecules in normal human monocytes and in a human THP-1 monocytic cell line. Monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cell by adherence to plastic Petri dishes precoated with heat-inactivated autologous plasma. The THP-1 cells, which are known to express very low levels of HLA-DR molecules, were treated with IFN-γ for 48 h to induce high levels of HLA-DR expression and to allow them to respond to HLA-DR ligation in a manner similar to that observed in human monocytes. Western blot analyses (Fig. 2,A and B) revealed the presence of HLA-DR molecules in the lipid raft fractions of human monocytes (3%) and IFN-γ-treated THP-1 cells (3.5%). Although the purity of the monocytes used exceeded 90% (OKM1-positive) and no CD20-positive cells were observed in the preparation (data not shown), a possible contribution to the response by contaminating B cells could not be ruled out. Indeed, it could be argued that the presence of HLA-DR molecules in lipid rafts might result from the priming effect of IFN-γ and/or cell activation that occurred during purification process. To overcome this problem, we generated stable THP-1 cells transfected with the human MHC class II transactivator geneCIITA and tested the distribution of HLA-DR molecules. Quantitative densitometry of the immunoblots (Fig. 2 C) revealed that significant amounts of HLA-DR molecules were constitutively associated with the lipid rafts of these CIITA-transfected cells (7.5%). Our results indicate that all the cell types tested constitutively express significant amounts of HLA-DR molecules in the lipid rafts, that the proportion of these molecules does not show gross variations among the cell types, and that the expression of EBV proteins in B cell lines failed to affect the constitutive localization of the HLA-DR molecules. We next looked at whether the distribution of HLA-DR molecules would change following ligation with specific Abs, with SEA, or with MAM. SEA and MAM are members of the SAg family that are known to bear two MHC class II binding sites, the first of which interacts with the α chain and the second, with the β chain of another MHC class II molecule (32Hudson K.R. Tiedemann R.E. Urban R.G. Lowe S.C. Strominger J.L. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,33Bernatchez C. Al Daccak R. Mayer P.E. Mehindate K. Rink L. Mecheri S. Mourad W. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2000-2005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CIITA-transfected cells were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with 8C12 isotype-matched control mAb, anti-HLA-DR mAb L243, SEA, or MAM. Cell lysates were prepared and fractionated as described above for the analysis of HLA-DR partitioning by immunoblot. Under these conditions, there was no additional recruitment of HLA-DR molecules into the raft compartment when CIITA-transfected THP-1 cells were stimulated with anti-HLA-DR (Fig. 3 A) (7.5% for isotype control versus 8% for L243). In contrast, stimulation with SEA or MAM (Fig. 3 B) led to a slight but reproducible increase in HLA-DR in the lipid rafts (10% for SEA and 11% for MAM). Similar results were obtained with IFN-γ-treated THP-1 and B cell lines (data not shown). Having determined that HLA-DR was constitutively present in the lipid rafts of CIITA-transfected THP-1 cells and that anti-HLA-DR mAb failed to induce further HLA-DR recruitment, we extended our analysis to confirm the specificity of this localization. Cells were left untreated or were treated with MβCD, a drug that disrupts rafts by extracting cholesterol (34Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Washed cells were then stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with isotype-matched control mAb 8C12 or anti-HLA-DR mAb L243. Cell lysates were fractionated, pooled as indicated in the figure legend, and analyzed for HLA-DR partitioning by immunoblotting. Treatment with MβCD did not affect the interaction of HLA-DR with the specific Abs as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, and cell viability was not compromised as measured by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Fig. 3 C shows that MβCD treatment led to the complete disappearance of HLA-DR molecules from these microdomains of both stimulated and unstimulated cells. As mentioned above, Huby et al. (23Huby R.D. Dearman R.J. Kimber I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22591-22596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported that oligomerization of HLA-DR molecules by cross-linking with primary and secondary Abs leads to HLA-DR recruitment into the lipid rafts of human IFN-γ-treated THP-1 monocytic cells, an event that seems to be required for PTK activation. On the other hand, Mehindate et al. (8Mehindate K. Thibodeau J. Dohlsten M. Kalland T. Sekaly R.P. Mourad W. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Mehindate K. al-Daccak R. Damdoumi F. Mourad W. Eur. J.

Immun. 1994; 62: 4716-4721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that dimerization of HLA-DR molecules by SAgs is sufficient for various HLA-DR-induced cellular events to occur, particularly PTK-dependent cytokine expression. We therefore hypothesized that while most HLA-DR-induced events require HLA-DR dimerization, some are raft-dependent while others are raft-independent, and none require an additional recruitment of HLA-DR molecules into lipid rafts. To investigate this possibility, we stimulated CIITA-transfected THP-1 cells with isotype-matched control mAb, mAb L243, and the F(ab) fragment of L243. Total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10. We detected tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins ranging in molecular mass from 50 to 150 kDa within 1 min in L243-stimulated samples (data not shown). Maximum phosphorylation occurred at 5 min and persisted at least for 15 min (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, stimulation with the F(ab) fragment of L243, the isotype-matched control mAb, or the PMA induced no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation. The detection of heavily phosphorylated proteins (∼53–55 kDa) migrating in samples stimulated with the anti-HLA-DR mAb suggested that they might be members of the Src family of kinases, in particular Lyn. To test this possibility, antibodies directed against the phosphorylated and total forms of Lyn were used. Fig.4 B shows that only the bivalent anti-HLA-DR mAb triggered the phosphorylation of Lyn, a response that was detected after 1 min (data not shown) and persisted for at least 15 min. Our findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is probably the first step in HLA-DR-induced signaling cascades and that the proximal pTyr events associated with ligation of HLA-DR molecules are critically dependent on their dimerization. We conducted additional experiments to identify other signaling pathways induced by the ligation of HLA-DR molecules. To that end, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of two members of the MAPK family (ERK1/2 and p38), each requiring phosphorylation at tyrosine and threonine residues for activation (36Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). CIITA-transfected THP-1 cells were stimulated as above, and cell lysates were sequentially immunoblotted with the phosphorylated ERK1/2 and ERK1 Abs. ERK1/2 activation was observed after 5 min of stimulation with mAb L243 and persisted up to 15 min (Fig. 4 C). Once again, dimerization of HLA-DR molecules was required to trigger the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. We detected no activation of the p38 MAPK under our conditions (data not shown"

Membranes resistant to 1% Triton X-100 contained virtually no CD3ε, part of the TCR complex, irrespective of cell stimulation. On the other hand, membranes resistant either to a lower Triton X-100 concentration (i.e. 0.2%) or to the less hydrophobic detergent Brij 58 (1%) contained (i) a low CD3ε amount (approximate 2.7% of total) in resting cells and (ii) a several times higher amount of the TCR component, after T cell stimulation with either antigen-presenting cells or with phytohemagglutinin. It appeared that CD3/TCR was constitutively associated with and recruited to a raft-derived membrane subset because (i) all three membrane preparations contained a similar amount of the raft marker tyrosine kinase Lck but no detectable amounts of the conventional membrane markers, CD45 phosphatase and transferrin receptor; (ii) a larger amount of particulate membranes were resistant to solubilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 and Brij 58 than to solubilization with 1% Triton X-100; and (iii) higher cholesterol levels were present in membranes resistant to either the lower Triton X-100 concentration or to Brij 58, as compared with those resistant to 1% Triton X-100. The recruitment of CD3 to the raft-derived membrane subset appeared (i) to occur independently of cell signaling events, such as protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+mobilization/influx, and (ii) to be associated with clustering of plasma membrane rafts induced by multiple cross-linking of either TCR or the raft component, ganglioside GM1. We suggest that during T cell stimulation a lateral reorganization of rafts into polarized larger domains can determine the recruitment of TCR into these domains, which favors a polarization of the signaling cascade.

Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7947) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). It is thought that rafts may form because of the segregation of their components from the bulk of the glycerol-based phospholipid PM because of the orientation and tight packing of the long, largely saturated acyl chains of the sphingolipids. This phase separation of the membrane results in patches of molecules, which form the rafts, existing in the liquid-ordered phase (l o) but surrounded by and co-existing with the phospholipids in the bulk PM that are in the liquid disordered phase (l d). In many cell types rafts are organized into structurally distinct invaginations of the PM called caveolae (3Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 4Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). However in other types, including lymphocytes, the rafts are thought to exist as islands of tightly packed sphingolipid and cholesterol-based structures that, like caveolae, can be isolated from the rest of the PM by purification methods based on their detergent insolubility at low temperatures (5Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 11-17Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar). These PM domains have been therefore called detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes, and Triton-insoluble floating fractions (reviewed in Refs. 2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar and 7Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). The comparative analysis of the detergent-insoluble domains, caveolae, and the bulk PM has provided an inventory of proteins apparently residing in each (6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar, 8Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). However, doubts have been raised as to whether the detergent treatment itself may modify the lipid rafts or destabilize certain proteins resident therein (7Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a recent report (9Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that use of different detergents can result in different DRMs, which contain different proteins and likely correspond to different cholesterol-based PM lipid rafts. In T lymphocytes, many proteins involved in signal transduction have been constitutively or inducibly recovered in DRMs (reviewed in Ref.10Cherukuri A. Dykstra M. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Among these are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn (10Cherukuri A. Dykstra M. Pierce S.K.

A large body of evidence supports a crucial role for rafts in the signaling events activated by the T cell receptor (TCR) engagement (see Ref. 17Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar for a recent review). Uncertainties, however, still exist concerning the constitutive or inducible association of TCR to rafts/DRMs, as well as to the mechanisms underlining the possible recruitment of the receptor complex to rafts upon T cell stimulation. Neither a constitutive nor an inducible (after treatment with antibodies to CD3) association of the TCR/CD3 complex to DRMs was found in Jurkat T cells (18Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 19Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). No constitutive association to DRMs of TCRζ has been also found both in Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, whereas TCRζ was recruited to DRMs only in Th1 cells challenged with antigen-presenting cells (20Balamuth F. Leitenberg D. Unternaehrer J. Mellman I. Bottomly K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In a murine T cell hybrydoma, it has been demonstrated that the TCR complex is excluded from DRM domain before and after TCR stimulation, although a portion of the TCRζ component appeared to be constitutively associated with DRMs (21Kosugi A. Saitoh S.I. Noda S. Yasuda K. Hayashi F. Ogata M. Hamaoka T. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another report (22Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) has shown the recruitment of TCR/CD3 to DRMs, which is dependent on both receptor engagement and the activity of Src family kinases. While this work was being completed, evidence was been provided for the constitutive presence of a minor portion of TCR/CD3 in a subset of DRMs prepared from splenic and thymic T lymphocytes (23Drevot P. Langlet C. Guo X.J. Bernard A.M. Colard O. Chauvin J.P. Lasserre R. He H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). On the other hand, microscopical evidence has been provided for the recruitment of TCR to PM rafts as a consequence of raft clustering (18Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Here we have preliminarily assessed a suitable experimental protocol to prepare cholesterol-based DRMs in Jurkat T lymphocytes. Taking advantage of this assessment, we have then investigated on the possible constitutive/inducible association of TCR/CD3 with DRMs. As a main result, we report that TCR/CD3 can be recruited to DRMs/rafts upon T cell stimulation. Moreover, we provide evidence that clustering of TCR/rafts can be a determinant of the recruitment, independently of cell signaling activation. Jurkat cells, Jurkat-derived JCaM 1.6 cells (purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and the Epstein-Barr virus transformed human B cells (EBV-B, kindly supplied by Chiron-Biocine, Siena, Italy) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). In the case of EBV-B cells, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol was also included in the culture medium. The cells were harvested 48–60 h after transplantation. To stimulate Jurkat cells with antigen-presenting cells, 12.5 × 106 Jurkat cells (in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 at 37 °C) were mixed with 12.5 × 106 EBV-B cells (in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 at 37 °C), the mixture was rapidly centrifuged at 400 × g, and pelletted cells (in the presence of supernatant) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Prior to adding to Jurkat T cell suspension, EBV-B cells were preincubated (5 × 106/ml, in RPMI 1640) with or without 1 μg/ml of staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE) for 1.5 h at 37 °C and then washed twice with RPMI 1640 to remove free SEE. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was performed by treating cells with 10 μg/ml of the lectin in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum for 30 min at 37 °C. Treatment with anti-CD3 antibodies was performed by incubating cells (10 × 106/ml, in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) in the presence of 5 μg/ml of the anti-CD3 antibody, TR66, for 5 min at 37 °C. To cross-link CD3-TR66 complexes (18Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), TR66-treated cells (washed and resuspended in fresh RPMI 1640) were subsequently treated (10 min at 37 °C) with an antibody to TR66 (anti-mouse IgG, 8 μg of protein/ml). To induce GM1cross-linking, cells (10 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) were treated with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB; 0.1 μg/ml) for 1 min at 37 °C, washed twice with RPMI 1640, and subsequently treated with an anti-CTB antibody for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells (25 × 106) were washed twice with ice-cold RPMI 1640 and homogenized in 1.5 ml of ice-cold MBS (0.15m NaCl, 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5) containing the detergent (i.e. 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Triton X-100, or 1% Brij 58) and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenates were incubated for 1 h on ice under gentle shacking and then centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g to remove nuclei and debris. The supernatants were then adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of an equal volume of 90% sucrose/MBS, placed in the bottom of ultracentrifuge tubes, and overlaid with 5 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose (24Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The gradients were centrifuged at 187,000 × g in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) for 20 h at 4 °C. Ten fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the top of the gradients (fractions 1–10), and the residual volume of the centrifuge tube (1.5–1.7 ml) was recovered as fraction 11. The protein content of fractions was determined by a modified Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). Aliquots (50–100 μl) of the sucrose gradient fractions were withdrawn to measure light scattering and cholesterol content (see below). Because fractions 9–11 contained the bulk of solubilized cell materials, they were subsequently pooled for futher analysis. The proteins contained in fractions 1–8, as well as in the pooled fractions 9–11, were recovered by trichloroacetic acid/deoxycholic acid precipitation as reported in Ref. 25Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar. The proteins were then dissolved in SDS-PAGE buffer, and half (fractions 1–8) or 1/12 (pooled fractions 9–11) of the solutions were loaded onto 5–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The immunoblots were probed with the different antibodies and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Scanning densitometry was performed within the linear range of preflashed x-ray film with a Bio-Rad VERSADOC mod.1000 imaging densitometer. The cells were lysed for 30 min at 4°C in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, and 1 mm NaVO4). The samples were centrifuged (at 13,000 × g for 10 min) and postnuclear supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Aliquots (0.1 ml) of the sucrose gradient fractions (see above) were diluted with 1.9 ml of 10 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EGTA. Light scattering intensity of each fraction was measured at 400 nm at right angles to the incoming light beam (whose intensity was 80% reduced with the aid of a grid) using a fluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer model 650-10S) equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder (22 °C) (26Meissner G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Fulceri R. Bellomo G. Gamberucci A. Scott H.M. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cholesterol content of sucrose gradient fractions was measured enzymatically, essentially as reported in Ref. 28Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, 50–100 μl of the fractions were reacted (for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark) in 1.5 ml of KPi buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing 2 mm sodium cholate, 0.66 mg/ml of p-hydroxyphenilacetic acid, 0.1 UI/ml of cholesterol oxidase, and 1 UI/ml of horseradish peroxidase. Parallel samples without cholesterol oxidase were also run as blanks. The final product of the coupled reactions, oxidizedp-hydroxyphenilacetic acid derivative, was measured fluorimetrically (excitation and emission wavelengths, 325 and 415 nm, respectively). The cells were loaded with fura-2 (acetoxymethyl ester), and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured as described in Ref. 29Gamberucci A. Innocenti B. Fulceri R. Bànhegyi G. Giunti R. Pozzan T. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23597-23602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. To minimize the leakage of intracellular fura-2, the assay temperature was 30 °C, and 200 μm sulfinpyrazone was included in the medium (29Gamberucci A. Innocenti B. Fulceri R. Bànhegyi G. Giunti R. Pozzan T. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23597-23602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells suspensions (2 × 106 cell/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640) were treated with 0.15 μm BODIPY FL-labeled C5-ganglioside for 2 min at 22 °C. The cells were rapidly harvested by centrifuging at 1000 × g for 15 s, resuspended in 0.1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640, placed on a coverslip, and immediately observed with a real time confocal microscope (Bio-Rad DCV 250 mounted on a Nikon Eclipse 300 inverted microscope). The images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Inst.) and a Metamorph® imaging system. Triton X-100, PHA, polyclonal antibodies to cholera toxin B subunit and horseradish peroxidase (type 4A) were obtained from Sigma. Brij 58 was obtained from Fluka. 4-Amino-5-(4-cholrophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pirazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) and cholesterol oxidase were from Calbiochem. Fura-2 (acetoxymethyl ester) and BODIPY FL-labeled C5-ganglioside GM1 were from Molecular Probes. Polyclonal antibodies to CD3ε and monoclonal antibodies to Lck and CD45 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies to transferrin receptor and the anti-phosphotyrosine fragment, directly conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (RC20:HRP), were from BD Transduction Laboratories. SEE was obtained from Toxin Technology. Anti-CD3 (clone TR66) and CTB were a gift from Chiron-Biocine (Siena, Italy). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. A classic method to prepare DRMs is based on the disruption of cells with 1% Triton X-100 at 0–4 °C. However, alternative detergents/conditions have been also used to prepare DRMs, particularly in lymphocytes (13Zubiaur M. Fernández O. Ferrero E. Salmerón J. Malissen B. Malavasi F. Sancho J. J.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 6933-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As a prelude to examining the constitutive or inducible association of CD3/TCR to DRMs, we have characterized DRMs prepared from (unstimulated) Jurkat cells treated with 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Triton X-100, or 1% Brij 58 at 0–4 °C and separated by sucrose gradient ultra centrifugation. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of particulate membranes (evaluated by light scattering), total proteins, and cholesterol content across the density gradient in the three experimental conditions of membrane solubilization. Particulate membranes were largely recovered in fractions 4 and 5 (Fig.1 A) in all cases, indicating that these fractions contain DRMs. Actually fractions 4 and 5 contained an opaque band, which equilibrated by flotation at 10–25% sucrose (data not shown), independently of the detergent treatment employed. A relatively high protein (Fig. 1 B) and cholesterol (Fig. 1 C) content was also found in fractions 4 and 5. Notably, in the cases of both 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% Brij 58, the amount of protein and cholesterol in the DRM-containing fractions was significantly higher than in the case of cell solubilization with 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 1,B and C). Also the content in particulate membranes was apparently higher in DRMs prepared from cells treated with the lower concentration of Triton X-100 or Brij 58. However, light-scattering intensity may be influenced by factors other than the concentration of membranes, such as, for example, the size of the membrane particles (26Meissner G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Fulceri R. Bellomo G. Gamberucci A. Scott H.M. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fact that not only the protein but also the cholesterol content is higher in DRMs prepared with 0.2% Triton X-100 or Brij 58, indicates that these DRMs can be considered cholesterol-based and can be regarded as raft-derived. Consistently, either the transferrin receptor or CD45 proteins, which are assumed to be located in the conventional lipid environment of the PM (22Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J.

A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), were found to be virtually undetectable in the DRM-containing fractions (Fig. 1 D). On the other hand, the Lck protein that is known to be largely localized in DRMs from Jurkat cells (10Cherukuri A. Dykstra M. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) was found to be associated with the DRM-containing fractions at a very similar extent in all of the solubilization protocols employed (Fig.1 D). In the case of cell membrane solubilization with 1% Triton X-100, virtually no CD3ε protein was detected in DRMs (Fig.2 A), which is in agreement with previous observations (19Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, a minor portion of total CD3ε protein was immunorevealed in DRMs prepared from Jurkat cells upon solubilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 and Brij 58 (Fig. 2). The percentages of the CD3ε protein in DRM-containing fractions (fractions 4 and 5) were 2.8 ± 0.4 and 2.7 ± 0.4 (mean ± S.E.), in the case of cell solubilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% Brij 58, respectively. It was previously observed that cell membrane solubilization with 1% Brij 58 at 0–4 °C (22Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.A. Chauvin J.P. Pierres M. He H.T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) or with 1% Brij 98 at 37 °C (23Drevot P. Langlet C. Guo X.J. Bernard A.M. Colard O. Chauvin J.P. Lasserre R. He H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) resulted in the recovery of a portion of cell CD3/TCR in DRMs. To investigate whether or not TCR/CD3 can be dynamically recruited to DRMs as a consequence of T cell stimulation, Jurkat cells have been treated with the mitogenic lectin PHA or EBV-B cells prepulsed with SEE as a model for antigen-presenting cells. Both treatments did result in a marked increase in the amount of CD3ε protein associated with DRMs prepared with 0.2% Triton X-100 (compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 2). The percentages of the CD3ε protein present in DRMs of cells stimulated with PHA or SEE-pulsed EBV-B cells (fractions 4 and 5) were 18.7 ± 2.2 and 12.6 ± 0.9 (means ± S.E.). The amount of CD3ε protein recovered in DRMs of Jurkat cells treated with control EBV-B cells (without SEE treatment) was very similar to that of resting Jurkat cells (compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 2). Experiments with Brij 58, which were performed in the case of PHA stimulation (not shown), gave analogous results; the percentage of CD3ε protein associated with DRMs (fraction 4 + fraction 5) was 19.7 ± 1.7 (mean ± S.E.,n = 4). In both above stimulatory conditions, virtually no immunodetectable CD3ε protein was found in DRMs prepared by cell membrane solubilization with 1% Triton X-100 (data not shown). Challenging T cells with antigen-presenting cells or PHA results in the ligation of TCR and of a variety of co-stimulatory proteins as well. A downstream key event is the activation of the Src kinase Lck, which in turn causes tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ signaling. To investigate on the role of cell signaling in the recruitment of TCR/CD3 to DRMs, we employed the Jurkat-derived cell line JCaM 1.6, which lacks the activity of the Lck tyrosine kinase (39Van Oers N.S. Semin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, PHA treatment of JCaM 1.6 cells resulted in a recruitment of the CD3ε protein to DRMs (prepared with 0.2% Triton X-100), at an extent that was comparable with that observed in PHA-treated Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 A). As expected, PHA stimulation caused virtually no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ signaling in JCaM 1.6 cells (Fig.4, B and C), whereas it resulted in a robust increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ signaling in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Ca2+signaling was presumably due to both mobilization of cell Ca2+ stores and influx of extracellular Ca2+, because it was evaluated in the presence of (1 mm) extracellular Ca2+ (29Gamberucci A.

Src kinases other than Lck, such as Fyn, may also be involved in T cell signaling (40Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 41Samelson L.E. Philips A.F. Luong E.T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In further experiments, we therefore investigated whether or not the CD3ε protein is recruited to DRMs obtained from Jurkat cells pretreated with the selective inhibitor of Src kinases, PP2 (43Hanke J.H.

We primarily analyzed the ganglioside pattern and composition of GEM after triggering through CD95/Fas and observed that GM3 is the main ganglioside constituent of GEM. Stimulation with anti-CD95/Fas did not cause translocation of gangliosides within or from the GEM fraction. Scanning confocal microscopy showed that triggering through CD95/Fas induced a significant GM3-caspase-8 association, as revealed by nearly complete colocalization areas. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that GM3 and GM1 were immunoprecipitated by anti-caspase-8 only after triggering through CD95/Fas. This association was supported by the recruitment of caspase-8, as well as of CD95/Fas, to GEM upon CD95/Fas engagement, as revealed by the analysis of linear sucrose gradient fractions. It indicates that the DISC associates with GEM; no changes were observed in the distribution of caspase-9. The disruption of GEM by methyl-β-cyclodextrin prevented DNA fragmentation, as well as CD95/Fas clustering on the cell surface, demonstrating a role for GEM in initiating of Fas signaling.These findings strongly suggest a role for gangliosides as structural components of the membrane multimolecular signaling complex involved in CD95/Fas receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway.

Minor components are sialosyl paragloboside (NeuAc-nLac4Cer), migrating between GM3 and GM1, sialosyl lactohexaosyl ceramide, and disialoganglioside GD3 (2Kiguchi K. Henning-Chubb B.C. Huberman E. J.

Triggering of cell apoptosis is strictly regulated by ligand-receptor systems, including Fas ligand-CD95/Fas (15Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Google Scholar, 16Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Google Scholar). The binding of CD95/Fas by its ligand results in trimerization of the receptor, recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein to the death domain of CD95, and binding of caspase-8 to the death-effector domain of FADD (17Muzio M. Chinnaiyan F.C. Kischkel K. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Carsten-Scaffidi J.N. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar). This process induces the formation of the DISC. Binding and activation of caspase-8 results in transmission of the activation signal to other caspases, in particular caspase-3, involvement of mitochondria with release of cytochrome c and membrane depolarization, and release of apoptosis-inducing factor (18Scaffidi C. Kirchhoff S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 277-285Google Scholar). Two types of cells have been classified on the basis of the CD95/Fas signaling (19Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Google Scholar). Type-1 cells show a rapid recruitment of the DISC to the receptor resulting in the activation of caspase-8, whereas type-2 cells, including lymphoblastoid T cells (i.e. CEM) (20Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Google Scholar), have slow apoptotic kinetics depeding on mitochondrial activation. Evidence suggests that many receptors aggregate in distinct plasma membrane microdomains or rafts (21Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Drevot P. He H.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 250-255Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the finding that disruption of microdomains prevents clustering of many receptors, including TNF-R (22Ko Y.G. Lee J.S. Kang Y.S. Ahn J.H. Seo J.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7217-7223Google Scholar) and CD95/Fas (23Grassmé H. Jekle A. Riehle A. Schwarz H. Berger J. Sandhoff K. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20589-20596Google Scholar). On the basis of these considerations and following the observation that the main gangliosides present in GEM associate with ezrin-CD95 complex after the receptor triggering (13Giammarioli A.M. Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. Gambardella L. Gradini R. Fais S. Pavan A. Malorni W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 45-50Google Scholar), we decided to analyze whether GEM were involved in the initiation of Fas/CD95 signaling. Thus, in this investigation we analyzed the ganglioside pattern of GEM after CD95/Fas engagement and then we focused on the interaction of the death-inducing signaling complex with these domains. Human lymphoblastoid CEM cells (24Foley G.E. Lazarus H. Farber S. Uzman B.G. Boone B.A. McCarthy R.E. Cancer. 1965; 18: 522-529Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen Italia srl, Milan, Italy), containing 10% fetal calf serum plus 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomicin, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD95/Fas (Cl CH11, 250 ng/ml, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) antibodies for the indicated incubation times at 37 °C. Ganglioside extraction was performed according to the method of Svennerholm and Fredman (25Svennerholm L. Fredman P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 97-109Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, glycosphingolipids were extracted twice in chloroform:methanol:water (4:8:3) (v:v:v) and subjected to Folch partition by the addition of water resulting in a final chloroform:methanol:water ratio of 1:2:1.4. The upper phase, containing polar glycosphingolipids, was purified of salts and low molecular weight contaminants using Bond Elut-C18 columns, 3 ml (Superchrom, Harbor City, CA), according to the method of Williams and McCluer (26Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Google Scholar). The eluted glycosphingolipids were dried down and separated by HPTLC, using silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Chromatography was performed in chloroform:methanol:0.25% aqueous KCl (5:4:1) (v:v:v). Plates were then air-dried and gangliosides visualized with resorcinol (27Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Google Scholar). Alternatively, the ganglioside extract was run on HPTLC aluminum-backed silica gel 60 (20 × 20) plates (Merck). Plates were soaked in a 0.2% solution of polyisobutylmethacrylate in hexane for 90 s, air-dried, and incubated in blocking solution consisting of 3% albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature. The blocking solution was removed and replaced by washing buffer (PBS). The plates were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated cholera toxin, B subunit (CTxB, Sigma). Immunoreactivity was assessed by chemiluminescence reaction using the ECL Western blocking detection system (AmershamBiosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). GEM fraction from lymphoblastoid CEM cells, either untreated or treated with anti-CD95/Fas (250 ng/ml for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C), was isolated as described previously (28Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 108 cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton-X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNaVO4, and 75 units of aprotinin and allowed to stand for 20 min. The cell suspension was mechanically disrupted by Dounce homogenization (10 strokes). The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1300 × g to remove nuclei and large cellular debris. The supernatant fraction (postnuclear fraction) was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation, i.e. the fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose (w/v) in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). The resulting diluent was placed at the bottom of a linear sucrose gradient (5–30%) in the same buffer and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 16–18 h at 4 °C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). After centrifugation, the gradient was fractionated, and 11 fractions were collected starting from the top of the tube. All steps were done at 0–4 °C. The amount of protein in each fraction was first quantified by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad GmbH, Munchen, Germany). Finally, the GEM fraction from untreated and CD95/Fas-stimulated cells was subjected to ganglioside extraction, as reported above. CEM cells, either untreated or treated with anti-CD95/Fas (250 ng/ml for 1 h at 37 °C), were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and labeled with anti-caspase-8 MoAb (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by addition (30 min at 4 °C) of Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem). After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with GMR6 anti-GM3 MoAb (Seikagaku Corp., Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan) (29Kotani M. Ozawa H. Kawashima I. Ando S. Tai T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 97-103Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes in PBS and addition (30 min at 4 °C) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Sigma). In parallel experiments, cells were stained with anti-GM3 MoAb before fixing the cells. Cells were finally washed three times in PBS and resuspended in glycerol/Tris-HCl (pH 9.2). The images were acquired through a confocal laser scanning microscope Leica, equipped with an argon ion laser. Simultaneously, the green (FITC) and the red (Texas Red) fluorophores were excited at 488 and 518 nm. Acquisition of single FITC-stained samples in dual fluorescence scanning configuration did not show contribution of green signal in red. Images were collected at 512 × 512 pixels. Briefly, CEM cells, either untreated or treated with anti-CD95/Fas (250 ng/ml for 1 h at 37 °C) were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml). Cell-free lysates were mixed with protein G-acrylic beads and stirred by a rotary shaker for 2h at 4 °C to preclear nonspecific binding. After centrifugation (500 × g for 1 min), the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-caspase-8 MoAb (Medical & Biological Laboratory, Naka-ku Nagoya, Japan) plus protein G-acrylic beads. A mouse IgG isotypic control (Sigma) was employed. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to ganglioside extraction as reported above. The ganglioside extract was split into two aliquots. A portion was separated by HPTLC, using silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck) and stained with resorcinol (27Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Google Scholar). Another portion was run on HPTLC aluminum-backed silica gel 60 (20 × 20) plates (Merck), as reported above. The plates were immunostained for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated CTxB (Sigma) or, alternatively, with GMR6 anti-GM3 MoAb (Seikagaku Corp.) and then HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (Sigma). Immunoreactivity was assessed by chemiluminescence reaction using the ECL Western blocking detection system (AmershamBiosciences). Lymphoblastoid CEM cells, either untreated or treated with anti-CD95/Fas (250 ng/ml for 5 min, 30 min or 1 h at 37 °C), were detergent solubilized according to Skibbenset al. (30Skibbens J.E. Roth M.G. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 821-832Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed on ice with 1 ml of extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.15 NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 100 kallikrein units/ml aprotinin) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were collected and centrifuged for 2 min in a Brinkmann microfuge at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. Sovranatants, containing Triton X-100-soluble material, were collected; pellets were undertaken to a second centrifugation (30 s) to remove the remaining soluble material. The pellets were then solubilized in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 5 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. DNA was sheared by passage through a 22-gauge needle. Both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble material were analyzed by Western blot as described above. All the fractions obtained as reported above were subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and then, after blocking with PBS, containing 1% albumin, probed with anti-caspase-8 MoAb (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-caspase-9 polyclonal Ab (Upstate Biotechnology), or anti-CD95/Fas MoAb (Medical & Biological Laboratory). Bound antibodies were visualized with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and immunoreactivity assessed by chemiluminescence reaction using the ECL Western blocking detection system (Amersham Biosciences). As a control for nonspecific reactivity, parallel blots were performed as above, using an anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Densitometric scanning analysis was performed by Mac OS 9.0 (Apple Computer International) using NIH Image 1.62 software. The density of each band in the same gel was analyzed, values were totaled, and then the percent distribution across the gel was detected. CD95/Fas distribution was analyzed by immunofluorescence in cells treated with anti-CD95/Fas (250 ng/ml for 2 h at 37 °C) or in cells preincubated with 5 mmmethyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (20 min at 37 °C) in 10 mm HEPES, either treated or untreated with anti-CD95/Fas. Control and treated cells were collected by centrifugation, attached to glass coverslips precoated with polylysine, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing in the same buffer, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with polyclonal antibodies to CD95 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). After washing, all samples were mounted with glycerol/PBS (2:1) and observed with a Nikon Microphot fluorescence microscope. Images were captured by a color chilled 3CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Normalization and background subtraction were performed for each image. Figures were obtained by the OPTILAB (Graftek) software for image analysis. DNA fragmentation was studied by propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric analysis (EPICS Profile, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) (31Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Google Scholar). It was evaluated in control cells, in cells treated with anti-CD95/Fas (250 ng/ml for 2 h at 37 °C), or in cells preincubated with 5 mm MβCD (Sigma) in 10 mm HEPES, either treated or untreated with anti-CD95/Fas. Cells were fixed with cold 70% ethanol in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, cells were washed once in PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS, 50 μl of RNase (Type I-A, Sigma, 10 mg/ml in PBS) was added, followed by 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS. The cells were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 min and kept at 4 °C until measured. In parallel samples the amount of cholesterol was evaluated as described previously (32Huber L.A. Xu Q. Jurgens G. Bock G. Buhler E. Gey K.F. Schonitzer D. Trall K.N. Wick G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2761-2765Google Scholar). Free cholesterol was quantitated from TLC plates by densitometric scanning and comparison with standard. The density of the bands used to quantitate cholesterol concentration fell within the linear range of compound concentration versus absorbance. A trypan blue exclusion test was performed to evaluate the viability of the cultures. We primarily analyzed the ganglioside pattern of lymphoblastoid CEM cells. Gangliosides were extracted in chloroform:methanol:water and separated in HPTLC as reported above. Five main resorcinol-positive bands were detected: a main GM3 comigrating double band, a band migrating between GM3 and GM1, a GM1 comigrating band, one comigrating with GD3, and one with GD1a (Fig. 1 a). The GM3 double band is due to the heterogeneity of fatty acid composition, as described previously (7Garofalo T. Lenti L. Longo A. Misasi R. Mattei V. Pontieri G.M. Pavan A. Sorice M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11233-11238Google Scholar, 33Sekine M. Ariga T. Miyatake T. Kuroda Y. Suzuki A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 155-160Google Scholar). The identity of the band comigrating with GM1 was verified by HPTLC immunostaining using the CTxB. The analysis revealed that in these cells the band was immunostained by the CTxB (Fig. 1 b), indicating that it is GM1. We investigated the ganglioside composition of sucrose gradient fractions obtained from lymphoblastoid CEM cells in the absence or in the presence of triggering through CD95/Fas. The resorcinol-positive bands were present mainly in the fraction 5 that, under our experimental condition, corresponds to GEM and, to a less extent, in the fractions 4, 6, and 7. About 90% of ganglioside content present in the total cell extract was recovered in the fractions 4–7. No bands were detectable in the Triton X-100-soluble fractions 10 and 11. The comparative analysis of the ganglioside pattern of sucrose gradient fractions revealed that triggering through CD95/Fas did not modify the distribution pattern of gangliosides (Fig.2 B). To study the possible association of caspase-8 with GEM after triggering through CD95/Fas, we analyzed, by scanning confocal microscopy, the distribution of caspase-8 and GM3 (Fig. 3). As expected, in untreated cells caspase-8 staining was mostly diffuse in the cytoplasm (A,panel 1), whereas after stimulation, it appeared uneven and punctate near the plasma membrane (A, panel 2), indicating that the protein translocates mostly in correspondence of specific membrane domains. This change of localization pattern is generally associated with protein activation (17Muzio M. Chinnaiyan F.C. Kischkel K. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Carsten-Scaffidi J.N. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar). The results revealed that most of the cells showed an uneven signal distribution of ganglioside molecules over the cell surface, either costitutively (B, panel 1) or after treatment with anti-CD95/Fas (250 ng/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C (B,panel 2). To determine the possible association between caspase-8 and GM3, we superimposed the double immunostaining of anti-caspase 8 and anti-GM3 in the absence or in the presence of triggering through CD95/Fas. In the absence of cell stimulation, GM3 and caspase-8 showed weak colocalization (C, panel 1). This finding suggests that GM3 and caspase-8 are not associated in untreated CEM. After cell stimulation through CD95/Fas, the merged image of anti-CD95/Fas and anti-GM3 staining revealed brown yellow areas, resulting from overlap of green and red fluorescence, which correspond to nearly complete colocalization areas (C, panel 2). Therefore, cell triggering through CD95/Fas preferentially promotes translocation of caspase-8 in selective membrane microdomains in which GM3 is highly enriched. To verify whether caspase-8 may interact with gangliosides, cell-free lysates from anti-CD95/Fas-treated and untreated cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-caspase-8 MoAb, followed by protein G-acrylic beads. Acidic glycosphingolipids were extracted from the caspase-8 immunoprecipitates and analyzed by HPTLC analysis followed by either resorcinol staining or immunostaining. The analysis revealed a main GM3 comigrating double band and a GM1 comigrating band after triggering through CD95/Fas (Fig.4, lane A). No resorcinol-positive bands were detected in the immunoprecipitates from untreated cells (Fig. 4, lane B). TLC immunostaining revealed that the extract from the immunoprecipitates from anti-CD95/Fas-treated cells were immunostained by both anti-GM3 MoAb (Fig. 4, lane D) and B subunit cholera toxin (Fig. 4,lane F). On the contrary, no bands were detected in the immunoprecipitates from untreated cells (Fig. 4, lanes E andG), as well as in control samples immunoprecipitated with a mouse IgG with irrelevant specificity, under the same condition (Fig.4, lane H). To analyze the distribution of caspase-8, we investigated the presence of this protein in both Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble fractions after different incubation times with anti-CD95/Fas. As shown in Fig.5 A, caspase-8 was almost enterely soluble in Triton X-100. However, the protein became progressively less soluble in the detergent after triggering through CD95/Fas. By 1 h, about 90% was insoluble. To better clarify the distribution of the protein, GEM fractions of CEM cells, obtained by a 5–30% linear sucrose gradient, in the absence or in the presence of anti-CD95/Fas (250 ng/ml for 1 h at 37 °C), were analyzed. The results revealed that in nonstimulated cells caspase-8 was present in fractions 6–10, but was almost completely absent in the fraction 5, corresponding to GEM (Fig.5 B). After triggering through CD95/Fas, caspase-8 was detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction 5 and in fractions 4, 6, 7, and 8, but not in fractions 9 and 10 (Fig. 5 C), indicating that caspase-8 recruited to GEM upon CD95/Fas cross-linking. On the contrary, caspase-9 was detected in fractions 6–11 in both anti-CD95/Fas-treated (Fig. 5 E) and untreated (Fig.5 D) cells. To analyze the distribution of CD95/Fas, we primarily investigated the presence of this protein in both Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble fractions after different incubation times with anti-CD95/Fas. As shown in Fig.6 A, the receptor was mainly soluble in Triton X-100 and became progressively less soluble in the detergent after triggering through CD95/Fas. To better clarify the distribution of the protein, we also investigated the presence of CD95/Fas in the GEM fractions of CEM cells in the absence or in the presence of cross-linking with the antibody (250 ng/ml for 1 h at 37 °C). The results revealed that in control cells only a small amount of CD95/Fas was detectable in the fraction 5, corresponding to GEM (5% of the total content, as revealed by densitometric analysis) (Fig. 6 B). In cells treated with the antibody, CD95/Fas content in fraction 5 increased to 12% of the total content (Fig.6 C). It indicated that the antibody triggering induced CD95/Fas enrichment in GEM fraction, suggesting that GEM represent the plasma membrane sites from which CD95/Fas initiates signaling cascade upon binding to its ligand. To analyze the contribution of GEM in CD95/Fas-induced apoptosis, we analyzed Fas distribution and DNA fragmentation after triggering through CD95/Fas of cells pretreated with 5 mm MβCD (20 min at 37 °C), which is known to induce cholesterol efflux from plasma membrane and, consequently, GEM desruption (9Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar). The total cellular cholesterol concentration was about 60% that found in normal cells. Consistent with previous papers (13Giammarioli A.M. Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. Gambardella L. Gradini R. Fais S. Pavan A. Malorni W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 45-50Google Scholar,34Parlato S. Giammarioli A.M. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Matarrese P. Luciani F. Falchi M. Malorni W. Fais S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5123-5134Google Scholar), immunoflorescence analysis showed that CD95/Fas might be detected at one pole of control CEM cells (Fig.7 a), and it was markedly polarized in anti-CD95 MoAb-treated cells (Fig. 7 c). The disruption of lipid rafts by MβCD led to the loss of cell polarity with redistribution of CD95/Fas molecule all over the CEM cells (Fig.7 b) and prevented the receptor polarization observed in anti-CD95 MoAb-treated cells (Fig. 7 d). As expected, DNA staining with propidium iodide of anti-Fas treated cells followed by cytofluorimetric analysis showed a subdiploid peak of fluorescence, consistent with apoptosis. Fig. 7 e shows that MβCD greatly prevented the CD95/Fas-triggered apoptosis, suggesting that GEM play a key role in CD95/Fas signaling cascade, leading to programmed cell death. In all samples the percentage of necrotic cells was less than 2%, as a result of trypan blue exclusion test. In this investigation we provide evidence that in CEM lymphoblastoid T cells the death-inducing signaling complex associates with GEM upon CD95/Fas engagement. This finding extends our preliminary observation that in the same cells gangliosides GM3 and GD3 coimmunoprecipitated with the cytoskeletal protein ezrin (13Giammarioli A.M. Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. Gambardella L. Gradini R. Fais S. Pavan A. Malorni W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 45-50Google Scholar), which, in turn, was complexed with CD95/Fas (34Parlato S. Giammarioli A.M. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Matarrese P. Luciani F. Falchi M. Malorni W. Fais S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5123-5134Google Scholar) after triggering through anti-Fas Ab, but not after treatment with staurosporine (13Giammarioli A.M. Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. Gambardella L. Gradini R. Fais S. Pavan A. Malorni W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 45-50Google Scholar). Here, we primarily analyzed whether triggering through CD95/Fas modified the ganglioside pattern and composition of GEM. In agreement with our previous reports on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (3Sorice M. Parolini I. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Dolo V. Sargiacomo M. Tai T. Peschle C. Torrisi M.R. Pavan A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 969-980Google Scholar, 7Garofalo T. Lenti L. Longo A. Misasi R. Mattei V. Pontieri G.M. Pavan A. Sorice M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11233-11238Google Scholar), we observed that GM3 is the main ganglioside constituent of GEM and can be considered a marker of these specialized portions of plasma membrane in CEM lymphoblastoid T cells. Interestingly, we revealed by CTxB staining that also GM1 is present in these cells, although as a minor constituent. Moreover, stimulation with anti-CD95/Fas did not cause translocation of gangliosides within or from the GEM fraction. Following our observation that T cell activation induced Zap-70-GM3 interaction within GEM (7Garofalo T. Lenti L. Longo A. Misasi R. Mattei V. Pontieri G.M. Pavan A. Sorice M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11233-11238Google Scholar) and the recent studies that pointed out the role of GEM in initiating of CD95/Fas triggered cell death in mouse thymocytes (35Hueber A.O. Bernard A.M. Hérincs Z. Couzinet A. He H.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 190-196Google Scholar) or in lymphoblastoid T cells (13Giammarioli A.M. Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. Gambardella L. Gradini R. Fais S. Pavan A. Malorni W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 45-50Google Scholar, 23Grassmé H. Jekle A. Riehle A. Schwarz H. Berger J. Sandhoff K. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20589-20596Google Scholar), we analyzed the possible association of DISC components with GM3 during CD95/Fas-triggered apoptosis. Scanning confocal microscopic observations showed the presence of GM3 clusters, revealing the existence on the cell surface of GEM with GM3 molecule concentration either in the absence or in the presence of triggering through CD95/Fas. These observations are consistent with previously reported thermodynamic results (36Sharom F.J. Grant C.W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 507: 280-293Google Scholar) and with our immunoelectron microscopic (3Sorice M. Parolini I. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Dolo V. Sargiacomo M. Tai T. Peschle C. Torrisi M.R. Pavan A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 969-980Google Scholar) and immunofluorescence (7Garofalo T. Lenti L. Longo A. Misasi R. Mattei V. Pontieri G.M. Pavan A. Sorice M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11233-11238Google Scholar) data in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. We now demonstrate by scanning confocal microscopy the association of caspase-8 with GEM, as revealed by nearly complete colocalization areas between caspase-8 and GM3 after triggering through CD95/Fas. Interestingly, T cell stimulation does not modify the ganglioside distribution, revealing that CD95/Fas engagement does not promote a redistribution of GEM, but induces a preferential translocation of DISC to discrete microdomains of cell plasma membrane in which it associates with GM3. This association was supported by coimmunoprecipitation experiments which demonstrated that not only GM3 but also GM1 were immunoprecipitated by anti-caspase 8 after triggering through CD95/Fas. In addition, the analysis of linear sucrose gradient fractions further clarified the recruitment of caspase-8, as well as of Fas, to GEM upon CD95/Fas engagement. Thus, we provide evidence that CD95/Fas triggering induces the lateral organization of rafts, bringing the CD95/Fas receptor together with GEM and demonstrating that the DISC associates with GEM. This finding strongly suggests a role for GEM in triggering of T cell apoptosis, since binding and activation of caspase-8 results in transmission of the activation signal to other caspases and involvement of mitochondria. Indeed, the binding of CD95/Fas by its ligand results in trimerization of the receptor, recruitment of FADD to the death domain of CD95 and binding of procaspase-8 to the death-effector domain of FADD (17Muzio M. Chinnaiyan F.C. Kischkel K. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Carsten-Scaffidi J.N. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar). As a control, we show that caspase-9 did not modify its distribution pattern after triggering through CD95/Fas, which is consistent with the cytoplasmic localization of this caspase. The key role of GEM in initiating of Fas signaling gained further support from the demonstration that disruption of GEM prevents DNA fragmentation as well as CD95/Fas clustering on the cell surface. These conclusions are fully in agreement with the observations in mouse thymocytes (35Hueber A.O. Bernard A.M. Hérincs Z. Couzinet A. He H.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 190-196Google Scholar), or in human CD4+ cells (37Scheel-Toellner D. Wang K. Singh R. Majeed S. Raza K. Curnow S.J. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 876-879Google Scholar), and are supported by the demonstration that CD95/Fas clustering and signaling were mediated by ceramide-rich membrane rafts (23Grassmé H. Jekle A. Riehle A. Schwarz H. Berger J. Sandhoff K. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20589-20596Google Scholar, 38Grassmé H. Schwarz H. Gulbins E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1016-1030Google Scholar). Here, we show that apoptosis was prevented not only by neutralization of surface ceramide or inhibition of ceramide release (38Grassmé H. Schwarz H. Gulbins E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1016-1030Google Scholar), but also by cholesterol depletion on cell plasma membrane. These observations reveal an additional difference in the apoptotic pathways of type-1 and type-2 cells, since CD95/Fas signaling is GEM-independent in type-1 cells (20Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest a role for gangliosides as structural components of the membrane multimolecular signaling complex involved in cell apoptosis pathways. In our previous work (7Garofalo T. Lenti L. Longo A. Misasi R. Mattei V. Pontieri G.M. Pavan A. Sorice M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11233-11238Google Scholar) we demonstrated their involvement in T cell activation; the present one deals with cell death proneness. Hence, to understand the regulation pathways supervising both cell activation (and proliferation) and, on the opposite side, cell death by apoptosis could provide useful information on the subcellular mechanisms influencing T cell fate. The present work, according to literature (39Ayllon V. Fleischer A. Cayla X. Garcia A. Rebollo A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3387-3393Google Scholar), allows us to hypothesize that microdomains might represent a sort of “closed chamber,” where specific key reactions can take place, including the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases (8Hakomori S. Handa K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xixGoogle Scholar, 9Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

This could also be of relevance in the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms underlying cell death process in terms of both resistance and susceptibility."

A key aspect of this defense is the complement system; this consists of classical, alternative, and lectin pathways that converge, via a well characterized cascade of protein intermediates, to target cells for destruction. Regulators of complement activation (RCA1proteins), acting at key points in the cascade, have evolved to prevent the pathological consequences of inappropriate activation. Decay-accelerating factor (CD55) is a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored member of the RCA protein family that protects autologous cells from complement damage (1Lublin D.M. Lemons R.S. Le Beau M.M.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6740-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). CD55 regulates all three pathways by binding and consequently accelerating the decay of the C3 convertases (2Medof M.E. Kinoshita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1558-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the enzymes that link the three activation pathways and the downstream effectors. This central role in regulating complement has led to the development of transgenic animals that express human CD55 as a potential source of organs for xeno-transplantation. A number of additional activities have been associated with CD55, which is the location of the Cra and Tca blood group antigens (4Telen M.J. Rao N. Udani M. Thompson E.S. Kaufman R.M. Lublin D.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3205-3211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that it is involved in coordinating the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens by enhancing natural killer cell activity (5Tieng V. Le Bouguenec C. du Merle L. Bertheau P. Desreumaux P. Janin A. Charron D. Toubert A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2977-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Additionally, CD55 binds CD97, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-TM7 protein family, the expression of which is rapidly up-regulated upon activation of T and B cells (6Hamann J. Vogel B. van Schijndel G.M. van Lier R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Perhaps as a consequence of its ubiquitous expression, CD55 has been exploited as an attachment molecule by bacterial and viral pathogens (7Lindahl G. Sjobring U. Johnsson E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The fimbriae of uropathogenic strains of E. coli bind CD55, as do many echoviruses (EV) and other members of the enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae, a family of small, non-enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses associated with a range of human diseases including meningitis, pleurodynia, exanthema, respiratory disease, and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. CD55, like the related complement control proteins CD46 and CR1, is composed of a series of short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, each of ∼60 residues folded into a characteristic β-strand structure held together by two disulfide bridges (8Barlow P.N. Baron M. Norman D.G. Day A.J. Willis A.C. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CD55 has four SCR domains, attached to the cell membrane by a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor and separated from it by a heavily O-glycosylated serine/threonine-rich “stalk” (3Medof M.E. Walter E.I. Roberts W.L. Haas R. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6740-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 9Medof M.E. Lublin D.M. Holers V.M. Ayers D.J. Getty R.R. Leykam J.F. Atkinson J.P. Tykocinski M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Deletion of individual SCRs and exchange with homologous domains from related proteins has broadly defined the regions of CD55 necessary for the various biological functions. Complement control requires SCR2–4 (10Brodbeck W.G. Kuttner-Kondo L. Mold C. Medof M.E. Immunology. 2000; 101: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas CD97 binding only involves SCR1 (6Hamann J. Vogel B. van Schijndel G.M. van Lier R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Among the CD55-binding enteroviruses, there are clear differences in the SCR domains bound (a few exclusively need SCR1 (11Karnauchow T.M. Dawe S. Lublin D.M. Dimock K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9380-9383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shafren D.R. Dorahy D.J. Ingham R.A. Burns G.F. Barry R.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4736-4743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), whereas all the echoviruses require at least paired SCR domains, consisting of SCR3 linked to either SCR2 and/or SCR4 (13Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Understanding the functional biology of CD55 requires a more detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional structure. Since the majority of CD55 interactions involve multiple domains, the relative spatial orientation of each SCR must be critical. This cannot be accurately modeled from the existing structural data base. For this reason, we have determined the structure of the two membrane-proximal SCR domains of CD55 (SCRs 3 and 4; designated CD5534) in a range of different crystal environments to a maximal resolution of 1.7 Å. A panel of CD55 mutants were produced based upon this structure, and the ability of the variant proteins to function in complement assays and pathogen interactions was determined. This structure and the functional analysis of variant CD55 proteins provide detailed insights at high resolution into the domain architecture of CD55, the natural interactions of the protein in the complement system, and the range of pathogen interactions. C-terminally histidine-tagged CD5534 was expressed in yeast, and crystals were grown from sitting drops equilibrated against a mother liquor containing polyethylene glycol 4000 and NaCl at low pH as described previously (13Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Lea S. Powell R. Evans D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1198-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mutants were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as soluble, dimeric, glycosylated, Fc-linked proteins containing CD551234 and purified to high homogeneity using affinity chromatography (>95%). All proteins displayed a wild-type phenotype in at least one biological assay (convertase decay, virus binding (see “Results”), or interaction with domain-specific monoclonal antibodies (data not shown)), demonstrating that the mutations were localized in influence and did not grossly disturb SCR folding. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion x-ray diffraction data to 2.0 Å were collected on European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, BM14 from a two-site platinum (K2PtCl4) derivatized P1 crystal frozen at 100 K. 360 degrees of data were collected at three wavelengths chosen with respect to the platinum edge. A three-site gold derivative data set (NaAuCl4) was collected at Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK, beamline 9.6. A highly redundant 1.7-Å native data set was collected from a single crystal at 100 K at SRS beamline 14.1. Data were processed using the CCP4 suite of programs (15Collaborative Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Phases were calculated using SHARP (16de LaFortelle E. Bricogne G. Carter Jr., C.J. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 472-494Google Scholar). Multiple cycles of rebuilding in Xfit (17McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) and refinement in CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) led to the model (consisting of two copies of CD5534: P and Q and 177 water molecules placed in 2ς difference density peaks) described below. The two SCR domains from molecule P were used independently for sequential molecular replacement into the other crystal forms using program EPMR (19Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). For the two crystal forms at lower resolution (C2b and P212121), SCR3 was rotated and translated into position followed by a search for SCR4. In both cases, the top solutions were seen to position the two SCRs so that the C terminus of SCR3 and N terminus of SCR4 could be trivially joined. Rigid body refinement where the two SCRs were allowed to move independently was followed by least squares minimization and either grouped B-factor refinement (two Bs per residue for crystal form C2b) or setting of all atom Bs to the Wilson B value (for crystal form P212121). Limited rebuilding in Xfit and further refinement led to the models described below. For crystal form C2a, the higher resolution of the data (2.0 Å) allowed a full rebuild and refinement using Xfit and CNS. The final model statistics for the different crystal forms are as shown in TableI.

Open table in a new tab Classical and alternative pathway complement assays were conducted essentially according to Harris et al. (20Harris C.L. Spiller O.B. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 2000; 100: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Classical pathway activity is given as the mean percentage of wild-type (WT) activity ± S.D. if it differs from WT by at least three standard deviations, otherwise shown as WT. Activities were determined from a minimum of three experiments. Alternative pathway activity was determined in duplicate and is shown as WT (activity did not differ from WT by more than a factor of 2) or factor difference from WT activity. Echovirus binding was quantified by a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay as described previously (13Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Input virus was normalized to 4 HA units (where 1 HA unit is the amount of virus required to hemagglutinate 50 μl of 0.5% human erythrocytes) and incubated with serial dilutions of purified dimeric Fc-linked CD55. HA endpoints were scored visually and were repeated at least three times and are presented in the same manner as the alternative pathway data. CD5534 was crystallized in a number of different spaces (14Lea S. Powell R. Evans D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1198-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) from identical crystallization conditions. The overall structure of CD5534 (Fig.1 A) contains two copies of the SCR fold observed in other RCA proteins (8Barlow P.N. Baron M. Norman D.G. Day A.J. Willis A.C. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), each consisting of five antiparallel β strands with strands 1 and 4b and strands 3 and 5b being “pulled together” by a conserved disulfide at opposing ends of the domains. Strand 1 does not meet the strict criteria for definition as a β-strand in these structures. The crystals yielded five independent, differently packed copies of CD5534, with only one crystal contact being conserved between two of the crystal forms (see the supplemental data available online). Little structural variation is seen at the interface between SCR3 and -4, implying that this junction is relatively rigid. This conclusion is supported by numerical calculation of tilt and twist angles, which define the orientation of SCR3 with respect to SCR4 (21Bork P. Downing K. Kieffer B. Campbell I. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 119-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Barlow P.N. Steinkasserer A. Norman D.G. Kieffer B. Wiles A.P. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 268-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The tilt for all molecules is 8 ± 8o (Table I). The packing of the SCR3 strand 3–4 loop against the SCR3-SCR4 linker appears fundamental to maintaining the relative orientation of the SCR domains. Additional stability is probably provided by the packing of the SCR4 strand 4–5 loop (Fig.2), although precise definition of the determinants of the interdomain rigidity is not trivial. Although hydrogen bonds are important for internal stabilization of the loops (Fig. 2 C), only the SCR3 strand 3–4 loop is tied to the linker via a hydrogen-bonding network since the linker forms a continuation of strand 5b. A panel of SCR3 and -4 mutations was generated to functionally probe the various faces of the molecule revealed by the structure. These mutants were tested in complement control and virus binding assays and provide further evidence supporting the importance of the observed SCR3–4 organization to the function of CD55. Prior to analysis, all mutants were screened with domain-specific monoclonal antibodies to confirm that there was no gross disruption of structure. The mutant proteins were found to have a range of abilities to regulate the alternative and classical pathways of complement (Table II and Fig. 3). Our data confirm the role for residues 125KKK127and 147LF148 reported earlier (22Kuttner-Kondo L.A. Mitchell L. Hourcade D.E. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2164-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In light of our structure (see “Discussion”), we interpret these mutations as acting by altering the packing of domains 2 and 3 rather than directly mapping the site of convertase interaction. Our data also demonstrate that changes to several other residues on the “back” face of CD55 (as defined in Fig. 3) are able to alter the ability of the molecule to regulate both pathways of complement activation.Table IIFunctional analysis of CD55MutationClassical pathway decay acceleratingAlternative pathway decay accelerationEchovirus bindingEV11EV12EV7WT100%100%WTaWT, activity is wild-type within standard errors.WTWTE134A65 ± 5WTWTdown 4-foldWTF169AWTNo activity detectableWTWTup 4-foldA193PWTWTWTWTWTK161A G3DWTWTWTWTWTL147F/L148F0 ± 0down 8-foldWTWTWTL147F/L148F P78S0 ± 0down 8-foldWTWTWTT216M N220H155 ± 10WTWTWTWTS165VWTNDbND, not detectable.WTWTWTS165A125 ± 5WTWTWTWTT166A165 ± 10WTWTWTWTK125A/K126A/K127A80 ± 5down 8-folddown 4-foldWTWTAGMWTNDNo binding detectabledown 8-foldWTa WT, activity is wild-type within standard errors.b ND, not detectable.

Virol. 1998; 79: 1707-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays provide a means to readily quantify the interaction of virus and receptor. Earlier work (13Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) has grouped CD55-binding echoviruses into three broad categories based on specific SCRs required for virus binding. A virus from each of these groups was assayed for its ability to bind to the panel of CD55 mutant proteins by HAI. Substitutions at the SCR2–3 interface (125KKK127 or 147LF148) had little or no influence on virus binding (with the exception of EV11, which was somewhat sensitive to the125KKK127 change), implying that either the SCR2–3 interdomain angle or SCR2 makes only minor contributions to virus interactions. SPR analysis of CD55 binding by EV11 also supports the latter conclusion (24Lea S.M. Powell R.M. McKee T. Evans D.J. Brown D. Stuart D.I. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30443-30447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, despite the close genetic relationship between decay-accelerating factor-binding enteroviruses (13Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), EV12 and EV7 were independently influenced by substitutions on opposite faces of CD55 (Fig. 3 C and Table II). Further differences were apparent in the interaction of EV with African green monkey (AGM) CD55, which differs by 42 residues within SCR1–4. EV7 binds to human and AGM CD55 indistinguishably, whereas EV11 cannot bind AGM CD55, and EV12 binding to AGM CD55 is significantly reduced (TableII). These results are in agreement with our earlier SPR and HAI analysis using SCR-deleted forms of CD55 to broadly map the domains of CD55 that interact with these viruses (13Powell R.M. Ward T.

They also demonstrate that viruses that share the same SCR specificity for binding may actually interact with distinctly different faces of the molecule. Using the extended linear structure of CD5534 to predict the topology of the four SCR domains in the full molecule produces a model that projects ∼300 Å above the cell membrane (including an estimated ∼100 Å for the serine/threonine-rich stalk). This is significantly extended, by almost 50%, when compared with previous models (22Kuttner-Kondo L.A. Mitchell L. Hourcade D.E. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2164-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Kuttner-Kondo L. Medof M.E. Brodbeck W. Shoham M. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Alternative topologies are possible if the observed linearity of the SCR34 interface is not repeated at the junctions of the other SCR domains. A recent low resolution structure of CD55 complexed with EV7 (26He Y. Lin F. Chipman P.R. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Shoham M. Kuhn R.J. Medof M.E. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; Google Scholar) is essentially linear along the SCR2–3 junction but exhibits a distinct angle at the interface between SCR1 and -2. Until a high resolution structure of a four SCR domain CD55 molecule is determined, it is important that the functional data concerning SCRs 1 and 2 are interpreted in the light of a variety of architectural models, of which our structure-based model and earlier homology models of Kuttner-Kondoet al. (25Kuttner-Kondo L. Medof M.E. Brodbeck W. Shoham M. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) represent the extremes available. Alignment of mammalian CD55 sequences has identified two highly conserved regions in SCR3, a positively charged block (consisting of125KKK127) and a hydrophobic patch (147LF148). Previous studies have shown that modification of these residues grossly perturbs complement control, and based on structural modeling, may form the primary sites of convertase interaction (22Kuttner-Kondo L.A. Mitchell L. Hourcade D.E. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2164-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our data confirm the importance of these residues in influencing both classical and alternative pathway decay acceleration (Table II) and show that these regions are juxtaposed at the membrane-distal end of SCR3. Based on the observed linearity of the SCR3–4 interface (Fig. 1), the structure of the SCR3 interstrand loops located in this region, and the apparent linearity of the SCR2–3 junction (see above and Ref. 26He Y. Lin F. Chipman P.R. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Shoham M. Kuhn R.J. Medof M.E. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; Google Scholar), we predict that these mutations are buried at the SCR2–3 interface and exert their effect by altering the relative positions of the two domains (Fig. 3 B). Based on the functional analysis of our mutants, we propose that the back face of CD5534 (as defined in Fig. 3) is the most likely site of direct contact with the convertases. Our mutational data suggest that the convertase interactions of both the classical and alternative pathway are broadly similar with the exception of E134A and F169A, which respectively solely affect the classical or alternative pathways. The E134A mutation does not significantly disrupt CD55 structure as the protein has native activity in alternative complement pathway assays, in virus binding (see below), and in binding domain-specific antibodies (data not shown). Our mapping of Glu134 to the “front” of the molecule suggests that CD55 may interact via an extended interface with the classical pathway convertase (which at 230 kD is much larger than CD55), the convertase wrapping around CD55 to contact both faces of the regulator. Many echoviruses use CD55 as a receptor, and earlier work (13Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) has grouped these viruses into families on the basis of which the CD55 domain(s) is critical for binding. Our results demonstrate that specific echovirus types bind to different sites on CD55 (even when the viruses are dependent on the same SCR for recognition); it is therefore likely that the binding determinants on the virus capsid will also differ (either in sequence or location). The cryo-electron microscopy-determined structure of EV7 complexed with CD55 shows the receptor binding across the 2-fold axes of symmetry (26He Y. Lin F. Chipman P.R. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Shoham M. Kuhn R.J. Medof M.E. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; Google Scholar), whereas previous mapping of EV11 mutations associated with the loss of CD55 binding has implicated a platform surrounding the 5-fold axes (27Stuart A.D. McKee T.A. Williams P.A. Harley C. Shen S. Stuart D.I. Brown T.D.K. Lea S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7694-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations further support the hypothesis that CD55 receptor usage may have evolved independently in these enteroviruses rather than being an ancestral trait (13Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The use of CD55 as a receptor has been coupled with symptomatic infections by a variety of uropathogenic E. coli (28Pham T. Kaul A. Hart A. Goluszko P. Moulds J. Nowicki S. Lublin D.M. Nowicki B.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1663-1668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nowicki B. Selvarangan R. Nowicki S. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183 Suppl. 1: S24-S27Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with recent evidence showing a link between the use of CD55 and stimulation of the host immune response via induction of MICA expression (5Tieng V. Le Bouguenec C. du Merle L. Bertheau P. Desreumaux P. Janin A. Charron D. Toubert A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2977-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The influence on E. coli binding of the two known single amino acid polymorphisms within the SCR domains has been examined previously (28Pham T. Kaul A. Hart A. Goluszko P. Moulds J. Nowicki S. Lublin D.M. Nowicki B.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1663-1668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nowicki B. Hart A. Coyne K.E. Lublin D.M. Nowicki S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2115-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and suggests that those bacteria sensitive to a change in SCR3 are insensitive to changes in SCR4 (and vice versa). This strongly implies multiple, independent binding sites on CD55 for different bacterial strains. Our structure shows that these two polymorphisms lie on opposite faces of the molecule (Fig.3 D). Our structure-based mapping of CD55 biology provides strong support for the hypothesis that convergent evolution is responsible for the range of pathogens that bind CD55, implying a distinct selective advantage for those that bind this molecule. The precise nature of the evolutionary pressure for both viral and bacterial pathogens to bind CD55 remains to be determined. The high level expression of CD55 on serum-exposed cells means it could provide an important initial attachment for the pathogen before interaction with additional cell entry determinants (12Shafren D.R. Dorahy D.J. Ingham R.A. Burns G.F. Barry R.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4736-4743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J.

However, there are many other widely expressed cell surface proteins, and an attractive alternative hypothesis is that pathogens have evolved to exploit the cellular role(s) of the molecule, perhaps to gain immunological advantage. Our structure provides the basis for a better understanding of the functional domains of CD55 and the interactions with complement control proteins, bacterial fimbriae, and enteroviruses. We are, however, aware that hypotheses proposed on the basis of mapping mutational data will require validation by determination of the structures of complexes of CD55 with its many ligands.

It is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum, from which it is targeted via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway to intravacuolar MVB vesicles. Proteinase protection experiments now demonstrate that the Aut5 amino terminus is located in the cytosol, and the carboxyl terminus is located inside the ER lumen. In contrast to procarboxypeptidase S, targeting of Cvt17/Aut5p to MVB vesicles is not blocked in cells lacking the ubiquitin ligase Tul1p or the deubiquitinating enzyme Doa4p. Also, truncation of the amino-terminal cytosolic Cvt17/Aut5p domain does not inhibit its targeting to MVB vesicles. These findings suggest that similar to Sna3p sorting of Cvt17/Aut5p to MVB vesicles is independent of ubiquitination. By fusing the ER retention/retrieval signal HDEL to the carboxyl terminus of Cvt17/Aut5p, we generated a construct that is held back at the ER.

Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Google Scholar and 2Thumm M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 563-572Google Scholar). Three independent approaches in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae identify numerous autophagic proteins termed Apg (3Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Google Scholar), Aut (4Thumm M. Egner R. Koch B. Schlumpberger M. Straub M. Veenhuis M. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 275-280Google Scholar), and Cvt proteins (5Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Google Scholar). In starving cells proaminopeptidase I is specifically targeted to the vacuole via otherwise unspecific autophagy. Proaminopeptidase I is proteolytically matured in the vacuole; this opens a convenient way to monitor autophagy. In non-starved cells proaminopeptidase I transport is taken over by the Cvt pathway. The Cvt pathway and autophagy are morphologically very similar and use many common components (5Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Google Scholar, 6Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Google Scholar); however, the Cvt pathway does not transport cytosolic material (7Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Google Scholar). Autophagy starts at the preautophagosomal (perivacuolar) structure (8Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Google Scholar, 9Kim J. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 763-773Google Scholar, 10Noda T. Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Google Scholar) with the formation of transport vesicles (autophagosomes), which nonspecifically enclose parts of the cytosol. Autophagy differs from other protein transport pathways by using transport intermediates (autophagosomes) surrounded by two membrane layers. Consequently, after fusion with the vacuolar membrane, their cytosolic content is not released into the vacuole lumen but is instead released as membrane-enclosed autophagic bodies. Therefore, before vacuolar breakdown of the autophagocytosed material the membrane of autophagic bodies has to be lysed. Clearly, this lysis of membranes must be strictly limited to the membranes of autophagic bodies and must not affect the integrity of the vacuolar limiting membrane. Specific intracellular membrane lysis is a fascinating feature of eukaryotic cells, which is also of medical interest, since it is involved in the pathogenesis of some microorganisms (11Goebel W. Kuhn M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 49-53Google Scholar). In yeast, vacuolar proteinases A (encoded by the PEP4 gene) and B (PRB1 gene) are required for lysis of autophagic bodies (12Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Google Scholar), but their molecular function in disintegrating lipid membranes remains enigmatic. Further components of the lysis machinery, Aut4p (13Suriapranata I. Epple U.D. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Sovarasteanu K. Thumm M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4025-4033Google Scholar) and Cvt17/Aut5p (14Teter S.A. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Fischer A.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2083-2087Google Scholar, 15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar), were recently uncovered. Importantly, Cvt17/Aut5p contains a lipase (or esterase) active site motif, which by site-directed mutagenesis of the active site serine was shown to be essential for its activity (14Teter S.A. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Fischer A.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2083-2087Google Scholar, 15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar). Our previous work demonstrated that the integral membrane protein Cvt17/Aut5p is targeted from the ER,1 where a significant steady state pool is detectable via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway to ∼50-nm intravacuolar MVB vesicles, which in wild-type cells are degraded dependent on vacuolar proteinase A (15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar). The MVB pathway starts at the prevacuolar compartment (late endosome) (16Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Google Scholar, 17Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Google Scholar). Here, dependent on several Vps class E proteins, some membrane proteins are sorted to membrane regions of the prevacuolar compartment, which afterward invaginate and bud off as ∼50-nm MVB vesicles into the interior of the prevacuolar compartment. This process results in formation of a prevacuolar compartment filled with vesicles, a structure termed the multivesicular body. After its fusion with the vacuole the MVB vesicles are released into the vacuolar lumen and degraded. Two different modes have been described for sorting of membrane proteins to MVB vesicles. Procarboxypeptidase S sorting requires ubiquitin conjugation at its lysine residue at position 8 by the ubiquitin ligase Tul1p and the presence of Doa4p, which releases ubiquitin from ubiquitin-protein conjugates (16Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Google Scholar, 18Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 117-123Google Scholar). In contrast, sorting of Sna3p to MVB vesicles is independent of ubiquitination (19Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5176-5186Google Scholar). We here show that Cvt17/Aut5p has a membrane topology similar to procarboxypeptidase S, with its amino terminus located in the cytosol and the carboxyl terminus in the ER lumen. However, in contrast to procarboxypeptidase S, the sorting of Cvt17/Aut5p to MVB vesicles takes place in tul1Δ and in doa4Δ cells, and no obvious sorting signal is found in its amino-terminal cytosolic domain. These findings suggest that Cvt17/Aut5p is sorted to MVB vesicles independent of ubiquitination, similar to Sna3p. Furthermore a Aut5-HA-HDEL protein carrying the ER retention/retrieval signal HDEL at its carboxyl terminus proposes an essential function of the vacuolar targeting of Aut5p for lysis of autophagic bodies. This points to a function of Aut5p at or after the prevacuolar compartment. After this finding, we further tested Aut5p for a function in lysing other intravacuolar vesicles. Indeed, aut5Δ cells during starvation target peroxisomes to their vacuoles but are impaired in their disintegration. We additionally demonstrate the involvement of Aut5p in the lysis of intravacuolar MVB vesicles. Media were prepared according to Ausubel et al. (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar). If not otherwise mentioned cells were grown in synthetic complete (SC) medium containing 2% glucose. For induction of the GAL1 promotor cells were grown overnight in SC medium containing 2% galactose. Starvation was done in 1% potassium acetate. Strains are listed in Table I. A PCR fragment consisting of the kanamycin resistance gene flanked by up- and downstream sequences of PRB1 was generated using oligonucleotides Prbkan1 (GGAGTTCTTCCCATACAAACTTAAGAGTCCAATTAGCTTCCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC) and Prbkan2 (ATTAAATAATATTCAATT TATCAAGAATATCTCTCACTTGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG) and plasmid pUG6 (21Güldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Google Scholar). Chromosomal replacement of PRB1 in WCG4a with this fragment yielded YUE59. Strains YUE92 and YUE94 were generated analogously. Correct gene replacement was confirmed by Southern blotting. Crossing of YMS30 (22Straub M. Bredschneider M. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3875-3883Google Scholar) and YIS4 followed by tetrad dissection yielded YUE37. YUE40 is an ascospore from a cross of YMS30 and YUE14 (15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar). YUE74 and YUE77 were generated by crossing YMS30 with YUE59 and Y05789 with Y12763, respectively, and subsequent tetrad dissection. YUE87 is an ascospore from a cross of YUE37 and YMTA. YUE90 was generated using strain Y04883 and the pep4- knockout plasmid KS-PRA1Δ-HIS3 (4Thumm M. Egner R. Koch B. Schlumpberger M. Straub M.

For the construction of pUE41 a PCR fragment was generated using primers AUT5-R3 (GATGCAAAGGAGAAGCAAATCTCTTTCTTGAAGGGCTTTTATGCAAGCACTGAGCGCGTAATCTG) and MCS-F4 (TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGAGCTCCACCGCGGTGGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC) and plasmid pFA6a-His3MX6-PGAL1–3HA (23Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar) as template. This PCR product was inserted by homologous recombination within YIS4 cells into plasmid pUE5 and cut with NotI, AatII, andHpaI. For this the PCR fragment together with the cut vector were transformed into YIS4, and transformants were selected on SC medium lacking uracil and then replica-plated on SC medium lacking histidine (SC-his). The recombinant plasmid was rescued from transformants able to grow on SC-his, and the correct recombination was confirmed.

All other chemicals of analytical grade were from Sigma or Merck. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal antibodies to HA, clone 16B12 (Berkeley Antibody Co.), 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and carboxypeptidase Y (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) and rabbit polyclonal antibody to green fluorescent protein (GFP; Molecular Probes) and aminopeptidase I (24Barth H. Thumm M. Gene. 2001; 274: 151-156Google Scholar). Antiserum against Kar2p, α-1,6-mannose linkages, and Fox3p were generously supplied from R. Schekman (University of California, Berkeley, CA) and R. Erdmann (University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany), respectively. As horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies we used goat anti-rabbit antiserum from Medac (Hamburg, Germany) and goat anti-mouse antiserum from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Cells were grown as indicated, and 3A 600 units of cells were harvested, lysed, and prepared for Western blotting. The samples were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with vigorous agitation. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on each lane of standard 7.5 or 10% acrylamide gels, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins on immunoblots were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty A 600 units of stationary phase cells were harvested and treated as described (15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was done with anti-HA antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by 1 h of incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Deglycosylation was achieved by treating samples with endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 1 h. FiftyA 600 units of cells were spheroplasted in SB buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mmK2HPO4, 10 mm NaN3, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) containing 0.3 mg of zymolyase-100T for 1 h at 30 °C. The spheroplasted cells were gently lysed in lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) using a tissue grinder. The lysate was cleared of the remaining cells and debris by repeated centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 × g. The cleared lysate was split into aliquots corresponding to 12.5A 600. From the time of lysis, all material was kept on ice. Membranes were separated by 30 min of centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. For protease treatment of the pellet, trypsin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml after resuspension of the pellet in lysis buffer, and the samples were incubated for 30 min on ice. If noted, Triton X-100 was present at 1%. Digestions were stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid to a concentration of 10%. The trichloroacetic acid pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence was performed as described (15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with mouse anti-HA antibody; as secondary antibody Cy3-conjugated goat-anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Dianova) was used. For visualization of GFP fusions cells were grown to log phase, if not otherwise mentioned, stained with FM4–64 (Molecular Probes) (25Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Google Scholar), and viewed with a Zeiss Axioscope 2 Plus microscope equipped with an Axiocam digital image system. The induction of peroxisomes was done according to Hutchins et al. (26Hutchins M.U. Veenhuis M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Google Scholar). Briefly, logarithmically growing cells were shifted to synthetic glycerol medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 50 mm MES, 50 mm MOPS, 3% glycerol, 0.1% glucose, pH 5.5) for 12 h at 30 °C. After the addition of a 10× yeast extract/peptone solution to a final concentration of 1% yeast extract and 2% peptone, the cells were incubated for additional 4 h. For peroxisome induction cells were then washed and transferred to YTO (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.1% Tween 40, 0.1% oleic acid) for 19 h. To induce peroxisome degradation cells were shifted to SD-N (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose). Aliquots were taken at the indicated times and either prepared for immunoblot analysis using antibodies against Fox3p or directly analyzed in fluorescence microscopy with GFP-SKL. Electron microscopy after permanganate fixation and Epon embedding was done as described (27Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Google Scholar). Aut5p is targeted from the ER via the Golgi and the prevacuolar compartment (late endosome) to the vacuolar lumen at 50-nm MVB vesicles (15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar). In wild-type vacuoles the MVB vesicles carrying Aut5p are broken down, resulting in a half-life of Aut5p of 50–70 min (14Teter S.A. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Fischer A.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2083-2087Google Scholar, 15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar). Our previous indirect immunofluorescence microscopy indicated a significant steady state level of Aut5p at the ER (15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that Aut5p might act at the ER probably by modifying specific lipids, which after transport to autophagosomes render them competent for intravacuolar lysis. If this is true, vacuolar transport would only reflect the turnover of the protein and would be dispensable for its function. Alternatively, Aut5p might function at the prevacuolar compartment or inside the vacuole; in this scenario its vacuolar targeting would be essential. To distinguish between these possibilities, we wanted here to block the vacuolar targeting of Aut5p. One idea was to look for vacuolar-targeting sequences within Aut5p. Site-directed mutagenesis of such targeting sequences should then prevent its vacuolar entry. We started our search for vacuolar-targeting sequences with an evaluation of the Aut5p membrane topology. The molecular function of vacuolar proteinase A and B in lysing the lipidous membranes of autophagic bodies is enigmatic. It is tempting to speculate that they might proteolytically activate Aut5p. Our previous analysis of biologically active carboxyl- terminally HA-tagged Aut5p (Aut5-HAp) did not suggest an amino-terminal processing of Aut5p (15Epple U.D. Suriapranata I. Eskelinen E.L. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5942-5955Google Scholar). We generated here an amino-terminally HA-tagged Aut5p (HA-Aut5p) and expressed this under control of the inducible GAL1 promotor to check for carboxyl- terminal processing. Complementation of the proaminopeptidase I maturation defect of aut5Δ cells indicated biological activity of HA-Aut5p (Fig.1 A, lane 3). Interestingly, in immunoblots HA antibodies detected bands with lower molecular mass than Aut5-HAp (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3,4, and 6), which were absent in glucose-grown cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 7). Identical bands were detected with a polyclonal antibody against Aut5p (not shown), confirming their identity with Aut5p species. After immunoprecipitation with HA antibodies and subsequent deglycosylation with endoglycosidase H in aut5Δ cells and in cells either deficient in vacuolar proteinase A (pep4Δ) or B (prb1Δ), HA-Aut5p did not show unambiguously different mobilities in Western blots (Fig.1 B, lanes 2–5). In pep4Δ cells the HA-Aut5p band appeared broader, however, suggesting the presence of higher molecular mass species (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). If this might indicate proteolytic processing at the carboxyl terminus is unclear at the moment and must be the subject of further detailed studies. HA-Aut5p was pelletable in lysed spheroplasts (Fig. 1 C), indicating it was membrane-associated. We further confirmed in indirect immunofluorescence the localization of HA-Aut5p to the ER inaut5Δ cells (Fig. 1 D). As expected the typical ring-like staining around the nucleus and staining near the plasma membrane was seen. Accordingly, in cells lacking vacuolar proteinase A (pep4Δ) HA-Aut5p was detectable inside the vacuole (Fig.1 E, left), whose position is easily visible in Nomarski optics (Fig. 1 E, middle). To determine the topology of Aut5p we made proteinase protection experiments using the amino- and carboxyl- terminally HA-tagged Aut5p. Inaut5Δ cells, where Aut5p is located at the ER, HA-Aut5p was proteinase-accessible even in the absence of the detergent Triton X-100 (Fig. 1 F, lanes 8–10), whereas Aut5-HAp was proteinase-protected (Fig. 1 F, lanes 3–5). This suggests that the Aut5 amino terminus is located in the cytosol, and the carboxyl terminus is located in the ER lumen. Sorting of procarboxypeptidase S (proCPS) via the MVB pathway requires the ubiquitin ligase Tul1p. Tul1p ubiquitinates the lysine residue 8 of proCPS, which is located in a 19-amino acid amino-terminal domain in the cytosol just preceding the proCPS transmembrane domain (16Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Google Scholar, 18Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 117-123Google Scholar). A lack of ubiquitination intul1Δ cells leads to missorting of proCPS to the vacuolar-limiting membrane (18Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 117-123Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B). Our proteinase protection experiments now demonstrate a similar topology for Aut5p, which exposes a 14-amino acid amino-terminal stretch to the cytosol followed by a transmembrane domain (Fig.3 A). As in the case of proCPS the amino-terminal cytosolic domain of Aut5p contains two lysine residues at positions 4 and 9 (Fig. 3 A). We therefore checked in indirect immunofluorescence whether sorting of Aut5-HAp to the vacuolar lumen via the MVB pathway depends on Tul1p. Because Aut5-HAp is rapidly degraded in the vacuole, we used tul1Δpep4Δ cells lacking vacuolar proteinase A for this experiment. Interestingly, in TUL1-deficient cells a significant vacuolar pool of Aut5-HAp was detectable (Fig.2 A). As a control we confirmed mislocalization of GFP-CPS to the vacuolar-limiting membrane in tul1Δ pep4Δ cells (Fig. 2 B). Sna3p is another cargo of the MVB pathway, but its sorting does not require ubiquitin conjugation (18Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 117-123Google Scholar, 19Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5176-5186Google Scholar). As a further control, we checked the localization of Sna3-GFP intul1Δ pep4Δ cells in direct fluorescence microscopy. As expected, Sna3-GFP was correctly localized in the vacuole lumen (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these results suggest that the targeting of Aut5-HAp to the vacuole lumen does not require Tul1p.Figure 3The amino-terminal cytosolic domain of Aut5p does not obviously affect its sorting and function.

Here we report that O-glycosylation of the mucin-like domain of neutral ceramidases was required for localization to the surface of plasma membranes. The deduced amino acid sequences of the mammalian enzymes contain a serine-threonine-rich domain (mucin box), which follows the signal/anchor sequence, whereas those of bacterial and invertebrate enzymes completely lack a mucin box, suggesting that the specific domain has been acquired during evolution. In HEK293 cells overexpressing ceramidase, the enzyme was not only secreted into the medium after cleavage of the NH2-terminal signal/anchor sequence but also localized at the plasma membrane as a type II integral membrane protein. Lectin blot analysis using peanut agglutinin revealed that the mucin box of the enzyme is highly glycosylated withO-glycans. Interestingly, a mutant lacking the mucin box or possible O-glycosylation sites in the mucin box was secreted into the medium but not localized at the surface of the cells. Furthermore, a mucin box-fused chimera green fluorescent protein (GFP), but not GFP itself, with the signal/anchor sequence was distributed on the surface of the cells. These results suggest thatO-glycosylation of the mucin box retains proteins on the plasma membranes. We also found that the 112-kDa membrane-bound enzyme from mouse kidney is O-glycosylated, whereas the 94-kDa soluble enzyme from liver is not. These results clearly indicate that post-translational modification of the enzyme withO-glycans is tissue-specific and helps the enzyme to localize at the surface of plasma membranes as a type II membrane protein.

Notably, Sph can be phosphorylated to yield Sph 1-phosphate (S1P), which regulates cell proliferation (10Olivera A. Spiegel S.

Furthermore, both neutral and acid CDases were found to be released by murine endothelial cells (23Romiti E. Meacci E. Tani M. Nuti F. Farnararo M. Ito M. Bruni P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which neutral CDases are localized to different organelles is not well understood.This report clearly shows that O-glycosylation of the mucin-like domain (mucin box) is required to retain neutral CDases on the plasma membranes as a type II integral membrane protein. It was found that the domain was occasionally lost by post-translational processing, resulting in a different localization of the enzyme. These findings facilitate the understanding of the mechanism for cell/tissue-specific localization of neutral CDases and provide some insight into sphingolipid metabolism at the cell surface or in the extracellular milieu.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrated that the neutral CDase is sorted by a classic pathway via ER/Golgi compartments to the plasma membranes where it is expressed as a type II integral membrane protein or alternatively secreted out of cells after proteolytic processing of the NH2-terminal signal/anchor sequence. This report also clearly indicates that the fate of the protein (as a membrane protein or secretion protein) depends on the presence of a mucin box located in the NH2-terminal region of the enzyme. Because, in contrast to the wild-type CDase, the mucin box-deleted mutant CDase does not localize at the surface of cells and is almost entirely secreted. Furthermore, the fact that bacterial and invertebrate neutral CDases, which lack the mucin box, are secreted without cell surface expression may support this conclusion. In conclusion, the mucin box acquired by the process of evolution enables the mammalian CDase to localize on the cell surface as a type II integral membrane protein. It should be emphasized that the mucin box-mediated cell surface localization is not limited to the neutral CDase but occurs in general, because the mucin box-fused chimeric GFP, but not GFP itself, with signal/anchor sequence was found to be exclusively localized at the surfaces of HEK293 cells.The mechanism by which the mucin box retains CDase on the cell surface is unclear at present. However, the finding made here that replacement of possible O-glycosylation sites (Ser/Thr residues) with Ala greatly increased the secretion and reduced the expression of the CDase on plasma membranes may indicate specific functions ofO-glycans, although the structures of O-glycans remain to be elucidated.A diverse range of membrane proteins of type I or type II topology are occasionally released from the lipid bilayer by proteolysis catalyzed by a group of enzymes referred to as secretases (30Hooper N.H. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The proteolytic processing of membrane-bound proteins by secretases is well characterized in amyloid precursor protein (31De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar), a type I integral membrane protein, and a Golgi-resident sialyltransferase (32Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a type II integral membrane protein. The latter is cleaved in its membrane-anchoring region by β-secretase and secreted out of the cell (32Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the neutral CDase is detached from cells after processing of the NH2-terminal signal/anchor sequence by secretases. We indicate the possibility that the mucin box interferes with the action of secretases resulting in the generation of the type II membrane-bound CDase, because the mucin box exists very close to the possible cleavage site of the signal/anchor sequence. However, the molecular mechanism for proteolytic processing of the CDase, including the participation of secretases, remains to be clarified. Another possibility is that the mucin box is a potential signal for the sorting of proteins to plasma membranes without processing of the signal/anchor sequence, although the counterparts for the recognition of O-glycans have yet been characterized.There have been few reports on the role of theO-glycosylation of secretory proteins. It has been reported that O-glycosylation of the COOH-terminal tandem-repeated sequences regulates the secretion of rat pancreatic bile salt-dependent lipase. The O-glycosylation of the enzyme concealed the Pro-, Glu-, Ser-, and Thr-rich domain (PEST region), which is commonly present in rapidly degraded proteins, resulting in delivery to a secretion instead of a degradation pathway (33Bruneau N. Nganga A. Fisher E.A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27353-27361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In polarized cells, the O-glycosylation was also found to be required for apical sorting of sucrase isomaltase (34Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the neurotrophin receptor (35Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It was also reported that a mucin-like domain of enteropeptidase directs apical targeting in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (36Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6858-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The neutral CDase was localized at the apical membranes of proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts in rat kidney (17Mitsutake S. Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Ichinose S. Omori A. Iida H. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26249-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and thus the possible functions of O-glycans in apical sorting should be examined in this CDase.In contrast to our observation, human neutral CDase has been reported to be expressed in mitochondria when overexpressed in HEK293 and MCF7 cells (18El Bawab S.

We found that the deduced NH2-terminal sequence of the human CDase lacks 19 amino acid residues in comparison with those of mouse and rat CDases (16Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This may result in the generation of an incomplete signal/anchor sequence for ER targeting, allowing the human CDase to target mitochondria instead of the lumen side of the ER.Recently, evidence has emerged that the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is a site of SM metabolism; SM is abundant here particularly in lipid microdomain rafts (37Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and sphingomyelinase as well as CDase is actively secreted from endothelial cells (23Romiti E. Meacci E. Tani M. Nuti F. Farnararo M. Ito M. Bruni P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Marathe S. Schissel S.L. Yellin M.J. Beatini N. Mintzer R. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4081-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, acid sphingomyelinase was reported to be secreted and helped to metabolize SM in oxidized lipoproteins (39Schissel S.L. Jiang X. Tweedie-Hardman J. Jeong T. Camejo E.H. Najib J. Rapp J.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2738-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and CD95 induces the translocation of acid sphingomyelinase onto the cell surface, resulting in the generation of extracellularly orientated Cer (40Grassme H. Jekle A. Riehle A. Schwarz H. Berger J. Sandhoff K. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20589-20596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The neutral CDase is expressed at the plasma membrane as a type II membrane protein, the catalytic domain of which is located on the extracellular side, or is secreted out of the cell. Importantly, the generation of S1P in the extracellular milieu, which occurs due to the export of the Sph kinase, was reported (41Ancellin N. Colmont C. Su J. Li Q. Mittereder N. Chae S. Stefansson S. Liau G. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6667-6675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Very recently, it was found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced the protein kinase C-dependent translocation of Sph kinase to the plasma membrane, resulting in the extracellular release of S1P (42Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Taken together, all metabolic enzymes required for hydrolysis of SM to generate S1P could be present at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or in extra milieu, allowing for the formation of an alternative pathway from SM to S1P. In this context, it is important to note that the neutral CDase was actually detected in mouse serum, which may indicate an important role in vascular biology, i.e.regulating the extracellular content of Cer, Sph, and possibly S1P, all of which may function in autocrine/paracrine signaling. Sphingolipids have emerged as a multifunctional lipid biomodulator within or among cells. Ceramide (N-acylsphingosine, Cer),1 a common lipid backbone of sphingomyelin (SM) and glycosphingoslipids, has been shown to mediate many cellular events, including cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 2Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), possibly regulating various cytoplasmic proteins such as protein kinases C-ζ (3Bourbon N.A. Yun J. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35617-35623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), C-α, and C-δ (4Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14556-14562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (5Chalfant C.E. Kishikawa K. Mumby M.C. Kamibayashi C. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20313-20317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Sphingosine (Sph), the N-deacylated product of Cer, exerts mitogenic and apoptosis-inducing activities, depending on the cell type and cell cycle (6Zhang H. Buckley N.E. Gibson K. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ohta H. Sweeney E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar). Sph is known to be a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (8Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and an activator of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, which is thought to be occasionally localized at the inner plasma membrane (9King C.C. Zenke F.T. Dawson P.E. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Hemmings B.A. Bokoch G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18108-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Notably, Sph can be phosphorylated to yield Sph 1-phosphate (S1P), which regulates cell proliferation (10Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), motility (11Kupperman E. An S. Osborne N. Waldron S. Stainier D.Y.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and morphology (12Van Brocklyn J.R. Tu Z. Edsall L.C. Schmidt R.R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4626-4632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast to Cer and Sph, S1P appears to act extracellularly by interacting with cell surface G protein-coupled receptors, the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family (13Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Ceramidase (CDase, EC 3.5.1.23), an enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of the N-acyl linkage of Cer to produce Sph, has been classified into three types mainly based on catalytic pH optima,i.e. acidic, neutral, and alkaline. Neutral CDases, which have an optimum pH of 6.5–8.5, have been cloned from bacteria (14Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Imayama S. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36616-36622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), Drosophila (15Yoshimura Y. Okino N. Tani M. Ito M. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), mouse (16Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three CDase isoforms having different pH optima may be derived from different ancestral genes (16Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11229-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mammalian neutral CDase seems to regulate the balance of Cer/Sph/S1P in response to various stimuli, including cytokines (19Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and thus could modulate sphingolipid-mediated signaling. Furthermore, the fact that Sph is not produced by de novo synthesis (22Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implies a significant role for CDase in the generation of Sph and possibly S1P. We found that neutral CDases of bacteria (14Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Imayama S. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36616-36622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Drosophila(15Yoshimura Y. Okino N. Tani M. Ito M. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were released from cells as a soluble form, whereas those of mammalian origins were mainly recovered in membrane fractions (21Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that the intracellular distribution of the mammalian enzyme was cell/tissue-specific. In rat kidney, neutral CDase was mainly localized at the apical membrane of proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting dusts, whereas in liver the enzyme was distributed among endosome-like organelles in hepatocytes (17Mitsutake S.

The neutral CDase is expressed at the plasma membrane as a type II membrane protein, the catalytic domain of which is located on the extracellular side, or is secreted out of the cell. Importantly, the generation of S1P in the extracellular milieu, which occurs due to the export of the Sph kinase, was reported (41Ancellin N. Colmont C. Su J. Li Q. Mittereder N. Chae S. Stefansson S. Liau G. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6667-6675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Very recently, it was found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced the protein kinase C-dependent translocation of Sph kinase to the plasma membrane, resulting in the extracellular release of S1P (42Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Taken together, all metabolic enzymes required for hydrolysis of SM to generate S1P could be present at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or in extra milieu, allowing for the formation of an alternative pathway from SM to S1P. In this context, it is important to note that the neutral CDase was actually detected in mouse serum, which may indicate an important role in vascular biology, i.e.regulating the extracellular content of Cer, Sph, and possibly S1P, all of which may function in autocrine/paracrine signaling. This study demonstrated that the neutral CDase is sorted by a classic pathway via ER/Golgi compartments to the plasma membranes where it is expressed as a type II integral membrane protein or alternatively secreted out of cells after proteolytic processing of the NH2-terminal signal/anchor sequence. This report also clearly indicates that the fate of the protein (as a membrane protein or secretion protein) depends on the presence of a mucin box located in the NH2-terminal region of the enzyme. Because, in contrast to the wild-type CDase, the mucin box-deleted mutant CDase does not localize at the surface of cells and is almost entirely secreted. Furthermore, the fact that bacterial and invertebrate neutral CDases, which lack the mucin box, are secreted without cell surface expression may support this conclusion. In conclusion, the mucin box acquired by the process of evolution enables the mammalian CDase to localize on the cell surface as a type II integral membrane protein. It should be emphasized that the mucin box-mediated cell surface localization is not limited to the neutral CDase but occurs in general, because the mucin box-fused chimeric GFP, but not GFP itself, with signal/anchor sequence was found to be exclusively localized at the surfaces of HEK293 cells. The mechanism by which the mucin box retains CDase on the cell surface is unclear at present. However, the finding made here that replacement of possible O-glycosylation sites (Ser/Thr residues) with Ala greatly increased the secretion and reduced the expression of the CDase on plasma membranes may indicate specific functions ofO-glycans, although the structures of O-glycans remain to be elucidated. A diverse range of membrane proteins of type I or type II topology are occasionally released from the lipid bilayer by proteolysis catalyzed by a group of enzymes referred to as secretases (30Hooper N.H. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The proteolytic processing of membrane-bound proteins by secretases is well characterized in amyloid precursor protein (31De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar), a type I integral membrane protein, and a Golgi-resident sialyltransferase (32Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a type II integral membrane protein. The latter is cleaved in its membrane-anchoring region by β-secretase and secreted out of the cell (32Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the neutral CDase is detached from cells after processing of the NH2-terminal signal/anchor sequence by secretases. We indicate the possibility that the mucin box interferes with the action of secretases resulting in the generation of the type II membrane-bound CDase, because the mucin box exists very close to the possible cleavage site of the signal/anchor sequence. However, the molecular mechanism for proteolytic processing of the CDase, including the participation of secretases, remains to be clarified. Another possibility is that the mucin box is a potential signal for the sorting of proteins to plasma membranes without processing of the signal/anchor sequence, although the counterparts for the recognition of O-glycans have yet been characterized. There have been few reports on the role of theO-glycosylation of secretory proteins. It has been reported that O-glycosylation of the COOH-terminal tandem-repeated sequences regulates the secretion of rat pancreatic bile salt-dependent lipase. The O-glycosylation of the enzyme concealed the Pro-, Glu-, Ser-, and Thr-rich domain (PEST region), which is commonly present in rapidly degraded proteins, resulting in delivery to a secretion instead of a degradation pathway (33Bruneau N. Nganga A. Fisher E.A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27353-27361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In polarized cells, the O-glycosylation was also found to be required for apical sorting of sucrase isomaltase (34Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the neurotrophin receptor (35Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It was also reported that a mucin-like domain of enteropeptidase directs apical targeting in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (36Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6858-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The neutral CDase was localized at the apical membranes of proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts in rat kidney (17Mitsutake S. Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Ichinose S. Omori A. Iida H. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26249-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and thus the possible functions of O-glycans in apical sorting should be examined in this CDase. In contrast to our observation, human neutral CDase has been reported to be expressed in mitochondria when overexpressed in HEK293 and MCF7 cells (18El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We found that the deduced NH2-terminal sequence of the human CDase lacks 19 amino acid residues in comparison with those of mouse and rat CDases (16Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M.

This may result in the generation of an incomplete signal/anchor sequence for ER targeting, allowing the human CDase to target mitochondria instead of the lumen side of the ER. Recently, evidence has emerged that the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is a site of SM metabolism; SM is abundant here particularly in lipid microdomain rafts (37Prinetti A. Chigorno V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and sphingomyelinase as well as CDase is actively secreted from endothelial cells (23Romiti E.

Furthermore, acid sphingomyelinase was reported to be secreted and helped to metabolize SM in oxidized lipoproteins (39Schissel S.L. Jiang X. Tweedie-Hardman J. Jeong T. Camejo E.H. Najib J.

Using a calcium imaging system we investigated the effect of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) on intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) of human bronchial epithelial cell. Exposure of the cells to LXA4 produced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a recovery to basal values in primary culture and in 16HBE14o− cells. The LXA4-induced [Ca2+]i increase was completely abolished after pre-treatment of the 16HBE14o− cells with pertussis toxin (G-protein inhibitor). The [Ca2+]i response was not affected by the removal of external [Ca2+] but completely inhibited by thapsigargin (Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor) treatment. Pre-treatment of the bronchial epithelial cells with either MDL hydrochloride (adenylate cyclase inhibitor) or (R p)-cAMP (cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor) inhibited the Ca2+ response to LXA4.

Lipoxins are biologically active eicosanoids, originally described to be produced by leukocytes possessing a 5-lipoxygenase activity, in the presence of 15-HETE (or 15-HPETE) (1Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Google Scholar, 2Serhan C. Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5335-5339Google Scholar). Lipoxins also result from the conversion of LTA4 by 12-lipoxygenase activity in platelets and the 15-lipoxygenase activity in macrophages and epithelial cells (3Serhan C.N. Sheppard K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 772-780Google Scholar, 4Levy B.D. Bertram S. Tai H.H. Israel E. Fischer A. Drazen J.M. Serhan C.N. Lipids. 1993; 28: 1047-1053Google Scholar, 5Edenius C. Kumlin M. Bjork T. Anggard A. Lindgren J.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 25-28Google Scholar). The natural isomer lipoxin A4(5S,6R,15S-trihydroxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid), which is synthesized at the inflammation site, have been shown to act as a potent anti-inflammatory mediator in different cellular systems, affecting leukocyte trafficking by modulating chemotaxis, adhesion, transmigration, and phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (6Colgan S.P. Serhan C.N. Parkos C.A. Delp-Archer C. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 75-82Google Scholar, 7Papayianni A. Serhan C.N. Brady H.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2264-2272Google Scholar, 8Fierro I.M.

LXA4 has been measured in the bronchoalveolar and nasal lavage fluids of patients with respiratory diseases including asthma (4Levy B.D. Bertram S. Tai H.H. Israel E. Fischer A. Drazen J.M. Serhan C.N. Lipids. 1993; 28: 1047-1053Google Scholar, 10Lee T.H. Crea A.E. Gant V. Spur B.W. Marron B.E. Nicolaou K.C. Reardon E. Brezinski M. Serhan C.N. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 1453-1458Google Scholar). Levels of LXA4 are significantly higher in sputum of mild asthmatic patients compared with the levels measured in normal subjects or asthmatics with a severe form of the disease. Because LXA4 inhibited interleukin 8 release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the reduced levels of LXA4 in severe asthma might be associated with the persistence of airway inflammation (11Bonnans C. Vachier I. Chavis C. Godard P. Bousquet J. Chanez P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 1531-1535Google Scholar). In addition, PMN cells from mild asthmatic patients are able to generate in vitro larger amounts of LXA4 as compared with PMN cells obtained from normal individuals (12Chavis C. Vachier I. Chanez P. Bousquet J. Godard P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1633-1643Google Scholar). LXA4 causes contraction of pulmonary smooth muscle (13Dahlen S.E. Raud J. Serhan C.N. Bjork J. Samuelsson B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1987; 130: 643-647Google Scholar) although, in asthmatics, LXA4 antagonizes the broncho-constriction induced by leukotriene C4 (14Christie P.E. Spur B.W. Lee T.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 145: 1281-1284Google Scholar). LXA4 stable analogues blocked both airway hyper-responsiveness and pulmonary inflammation in a murine model of asthma (15Levy B.D. De Sanctis G.T. Devchand P.R. Kim E. Ackerman K. Schmidt B.A. Szczeklik W. Drazen J.M. Serhan C.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1018-1023Google Scholar). The airway epithelial barrier, besides its role in electrolyte and water balance of the body, also participates in inflammation as a target cell for inflammatory mediators and by secreting inflammatory cytokines. Intracellular processes such as Ca2+ or pHi signaling, protein kinase activities, and the airway neuro-humoral environment finely control the airway epithelial secretory function altered in respiratory diseases such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. However, the effect of LXA4 has not been investigated on the cellular process regulating the human airway epithelium secretory function, and its potential role in airway epithelium is not clear. Lipoxins, but particularly LXB4rather than LXA4, inhibit the proliferation of the human bronchial epithelial cell line, A549 (16Claria J. Lee M.H. Serhan C.N. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 583-596Google Scholar). In addition, the same cell line did not show appreciable levels of the LXA4 receptor (17Gronert K. Gewirtz A. Madara J.L. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1285-1294Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ plays a central role in cellular functions including inflammatory processes, and interestingly LXA4 stimulates a [Ca2+]iincrease in rainbow trout leukocytes (18Knight J. Lloyd-Evans P. Rowley A.F. Barrow S.E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1993; 54: 518-522Google Scholar), in human monocytes (19Romano M. Maddox J.F. Serhan C.N. J.

However, the direct effect of LXA4 on [Ca2+]i has not been investigated in epithelial cells. Because [Ca2+]i is a main regulator of the secretory functions of the epithelium, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of LXA4 on [Ca2+]i and Cl− secretion through airway epithelium. The present study is the first report of a rapid and transient [Ca2+]i increase induced by LXA4in airway epithelial cells, the description of the cellular mechanisms generating the response, and its consequence on ionic secretion. The human bronchial epithelial 16HBE14o− cell line is derived from surface epithelium of mainstream, second-generation bronchi (22Cozens A.L. Yezzi M.J. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K.

Cells were grown on a collagen/fibronectin coating, in Eagle's minimal essential medium (BioWhittaker), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 1%l-glutamine, and incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. For primary culture of human bronchus epithelium, cells were obtained from surgical biopsies. The bronchial samples were taken from a normal area of bronchi removed from patients suffering from lung cancer with a normal lung function (after approval by the ethics committee). After excision, the bronchial tubes were washed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.38 mg/ml hyaluronidase, 0.75 mg/ml collagenase, 1 mg/ml protease, and 0.3 mg/ml DNase in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) and then filtered through a 70-mm mesh nylon strainer. Pieces of epithelium retained on the strainer were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, epithelial cells were re-suspended in small airway epithelium basal medium (Clonetics, BioWhittaker, San Diego, CA) supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factors, 7.5 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 mg/ml epinephrine, 10 mg/ml transferin, 5 mg/ml insulin, 0.1 μg/ml retinoic acid, 6.5 μg/ml triiodothyronine, 50 mg/ml gentamicin, 50 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin- fatty acid-free. Total RNA was obtained by lysing airway epithelial cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. After DNase treatment (Invitrogen), 1 μg of total RNA was reversed transcripted using a Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MTV RT) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). A first round of PCR was performed using the sense primer 5′-CAC CAG GTG CTG CTG GCA AG-3′ and the anti-sense primer 5′-AAT ATC CCT GAC CCC ATC CTC A-3′ (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), which were designed to amplify the human peripheral blood mononuclear cell LXA4 receptor coding region (1,095 bp) (17Gronert K. Gewirtz A. Madara J.L. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1285-1294Google Scholar). In parallel, the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (213 bp) was used as a housekeeping gene and amplified using the sense primer 5′-TGT AAT GAC CAG TCA ACA GGG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGG CTT ATA TCC AAC ACT TCG-3′ (23Jolly D.J. Okayama H. Berg P. Esty A.C. Filpula D. Bohlen P. Johnson G.G. Shively J.E. Hunkapillar T. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 477-481Google Scholar). PCRs were carried out with 2 μl of cDNA (28 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 64 °C, and 80 s at 72 °C for LXA4 receptor amplification and 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 50 s at 52 °C, and 80 s at 72 °C for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase amplification) on a DNA Thermo Cycler (Thermojet; Eurogentec, Angers, France). A nested PCR was then initiated with 0.5 μl of the first-round PCR products. The primers used were as follows: 5′-TGC TTG GGG TCA CCT TTG TC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGA AGC AGA ATT GGC AGC CG-3′ (reverse), corresponding to LXA4 receptor primers generating a 928-bp fragment (24Sodin-Semrl S. Taddeo B. Tseng D. Varga J. Fiore S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2660-2666Google Scholar). As described by Sodin-Semrl et al. (24Sodin-Semrl S. Taddeo B. Tseng D. Varga J. Fiore S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2660-2666Google Scholar), the second set of LXA4 receptor primers was chosen with minimal homology with other members of the formyl peptide receptor family and exclude random crossing with known genomic sequences. Samples were subjected to 28 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 58 °C, and 80 s at 72 °C, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were analyzed using electrophoresis in Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer with ethidium bromide-stained (0.5 mm) 1% agarose gel. Bands were captured using an ultrasensitive photon counting imaging camera (Argus 100; Hamamatsu Photonics, Tokyo, Japan). Intracellular [Ca2+] was determined in 16HBE14o− cells, in primary culture of human bronchial epithelial cells, or in A549 cells according to a method previously described (25Urbach V. Harvey B.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 267-275Google Scholar). Because A549 cells do not form tight junctions, the calcium experiments were performed on isolated A549 cells. The 16HBE14o− cells and primary culture of human bronchial epithelial cells grown on permeable support reached confluency and their highest electrical resistance, on average, 4 days after plating. Therefore, we arbitrarily distinguished three types of cell preparations on glass: isolated cells, non-confluent monolayers (2 days after plating), and confluent monolayers (4 days after plating). For isolated cells the glass was treated with polyl-lysine and for monolayers with a fibronectin collagen solution. The cells were loaded with 5 μm the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe fura-2 acetoxy-methyl ester for 30 min, in the dark, at room temperature (22 °C) and were then washed twice in HEPES-buffered Krebs-Hensleit solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 280–290 mOsmol). The coverslip covered with cell monolayer or isolated bronchial cells was mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped for epi-fluorescence (TE-300, Nikon, Badhoeve Dorp, Netherlands). Calcium cellular imaging was performed using the Metafluor Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corporation). The cell preparation was excited alternatively at 340 and 380 nm using the Optoscan monochromator (Cairn Research Ltd, Kent, UK). The emission fluorescence produced after fura-2 excitation was filtered at 510 nm. The transmitted light image was detected using a Photometrics CoolSNAP-fx video camera (Roper Scientific, Evry, France) coupled to the microscope. The fluorescence obtained at each excitation wavelength (F 340 andF 380) depends upon the level of Ca2+binding to fura-2, according to an in vivo calibration performed using a range of EGTA-buffered Ca2+ solutions of the fura-2-free acid. The [Ca2+]i was calculated automatically by a computer program using the Grynkiewicz equation (26Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). For transepithelial transport study, the 16HBE14o− cells were grown on permeable filters (Costar Snapwell-Clear 3801, 12-mm diameter, 0.4 mm pore size). Monolayers of 1.2 cm2 exposed surface area were mounted in a horizontal Ussing chamber between 0 and 3 days after the electrical resistance reached a maximum value (800–1200 ohms) as previously described (27Urbach V. Walsh D.E. Mainprice B. Bousquet J. Harvey B.J. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 869-878Google Scholar). To create a favorable electrochemical gradient for Cl− secretion, the basolateral side of the monolayer was bathed in HEPES-buffered Krebs-Hensleit solution, and the apical was bathed in a low Cl− solution (125 mm sodium gluconate, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 280–290 mOsmol). The spontaneous trans-membrane potential was measured and clamped to 0 mV by application of a short-circuit current (Isc) using a voltage clamp model amplifier (EVC 4000, World Precision Instrument). Frequency of acquisition was every 10 s. Under these conditions the Isc is a measure of electrogenic transepithelial ion transfer. The output from the amplifier was digitized using a PowerLab system (Chart for Windows v4.0, ADInstrument). The LXA4 used in this study was provided by Calbiochem. The absence of transformation into all-trans lipoxin isomers was verified using reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography analysis according to the methods previously described (12Chavis C. Vachier I. Chanez P. Bousquet J. Godard P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1633-1643Google Scholar). Aliquots of LXA4solution in ethanol were stored at −80 °C to avoid any damage of the molecule. The mean [Ca2+]ivariations correspond to the [Ca2+]ivariations between the mean [Ca2+]i measured during the 2 min prior to exposure to LXA4 and the [Ca2+]i measured at the peak. In each experiment, the mean [Ca2+]i was obtained from all cells in the microscope field. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Measures of statistical significance were obtained using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test or the Student's t test for paired data. Ap value <0.05 was deemed to be significant. All statistical operations were performed using Excel software (Microsoft). Exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to LXA4 produced a large and transient increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.1, A and B). In primary culture of human bronchial (PCHB) epithelial non-confluent cell monolayer (2 days after plating), apical LXA4(10−8m) produced an increase in [Ca2+]i of 526 ± 59 nm(n = 3, p < 0.001) from a basal value of 129 ± 35 nm (n = 3). In 16HBE14o− non-confluent cell monolayers or isolated cells exposure to LXA4 produced a [Ca2+]i increase of 407 ± 57 nm (n = 6, p < 0.001) from a basal value of 135 ± 30 nm (n = 6) and an increase of 510 ± 50 nm (n = 7, p < 0.001) from a basal value of 135 ± 50 nm (n = 7), respectively. In 16HBE14o− monolayers having reached confluency for more than 4 days, apical exposure to LXA4 did not affect [Ca2+]i. In A549-isolated cells, LXA4 did not affect the [Ca2+]i. However, as a positive control we verified that a further exposure of A549 cells to apical ATP (10−4m), known to stimulate a [Ca2+]i increase, produced the expected response (Fig. 1 C). The dose dependence of the Ca2+ response to LXA4 in 16HBE14o−cells is shown in Fig. 1 D. The larger increase in [Ca2+]i was obtained using LXA4at 0.1 μm. One nm of LXA4 did not produce any detectable change in [Ca2+]i. Ethanol used as a LXA4 solvent did not affect [Ca2+]i. To identify the source of the [Ca2+]i increase induced by LXA4 we investigated the effect of thapsigargin, a Ca2+-ATPase pump inhibitor, and removal of external Ca2+ on 16HBE14o− non-confluent cell monolayers. As shown in Fig.2 A, thapsigargin (1 μm) produced a slow [Ca2+]iincrease by 165 ± 47 (n = 5) followed by a return to a plateau value. After 15 min of thapsigargin treatment, the effect of LXA4 (10−8m) on [Ca2+]i was completely abolished. After thapsigargin, exposure of the 16HBE14o− cells to LXA4 (10−8m) did not produce any significant change in [Ca2+]i(Δ[Ca2+]i = 2.5 ± 5 nm,n = 5, p > 0.1) (Fig. 2, Aand C). Exposure of 16HBE14o− cells to external Ca2+–free medium did not affect the response to LXA4. In Ca2+-free solution (0 mmCaCl2 and 5 mm EGTA), LXA4(10−8m) produced a [Ca2+]i increase by 348 ± 105 nm (n = 5, p < 0.001), which was not significantly different from the LXA4-induced Ca2+ increase produced in control conditions (p > 0.05, Fig. 2, B and C). Taken together, these results indicate that the response of human bronchial epithelial cells to LXA4 mainly involvs the Ca2+ release from thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores rather than Ca2+ entry from the extracellular compartment. The role of either protein kinase A or protein kinase C signaling pathways in the mediation of the response have been investigated using (R p)-cAMP (inhibitor of protein kinase A activity), MDL hydrochloride (inhibitor of adenylate cyclase), and chelerytrine chloride (inhibitor of protein kinase C activity) on 16HBE14o− non-confluent cell monolayers. Neither (R p)-cAMP (200 μm), MDL hydrochloride (50 μm), nor chelerythrine chloride (10−7m) significantly affected the basal level of [Ca2+]i (Δ[Ca2+]i= 6 ± 8 nm, n = 4; Δ[Ca2+]i = −5.6 ± 6.1 nm, n = 3; Δ[Ca2+]i = −1.4 ± 4 nm,n = 3, respectively). As shown in Fig.3, A, B, andD, (R p)-cAMP (200 μm) and MDL (50 μm), largely antagonized the response to 10−8m of LXA4(Δ[Ca2+]i = 26 ± 26 nm,n = 4; Δ[Ca2+]i = −142 ± 13 nm, n = 3, respectively). After chelerythrine chloride (10−7m), the Ca2+i response to LXA4(10−8m) was not significantly different from control conditions (Δ[Ca2+]i = 495 ± 21 nm, n = 3, p > 0.05) (Fig. 3, C and D). Because A549 cells do not express detectable levels of LXA4 receptor, the absence of the effect of LXA4 on [Ca2+]i in A549 cells suggested that in 16HBE14o− cells the Ca2+ response to LXA4 is mediated by the LXA4 receptor. Because the LXA4 receptor have been identified to be coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein, we tested the effect of the toxin on the Ca2+ response induced by LXA4 in 16HBE14o−-isolated cells. As shown in Fig.4, A and C, in 16HBE14o− cells pertussis toxin treatment completely abolished the response to LXA4 at either 10−8or 10−7m. LXA4 produced a non-significant [Ca2+]i variation of −11 ± 15 nm (n = 5,p > 0.1) at 10−8m and of −2.5 ± 3 nm (n = 5,p > 0.1) at 10−7m. We also investigated the eventual role of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, which can be recognized by LXA4 and is also sensitive to pertussis toxin in the [Ca2+]i response to LXA4. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, montelukast (10−6m) used as a specific leukotriene receptor antagonist did not affect the Ca2+response to LXA4 (10−8m). The LXA4receptor mRNA expression was investigated in three different human bronchial epithelial cells (the PCHB, the 16HBE14o−, and the A549 cells) by RT-PCR using specific primers for LXA4receptor cDNA. Expression of the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was determined to provide an internal control for RT and PCR efficiencies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, from which the LXA4 receptor has been cloned, were used as positive control (20Maddox J.F. Hachicha M. Takano T. Petasis N.A. Fokin V.V. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6972-6978Google Scholar). Representative electrophoretic analysis of the PCR products obtained is shown in Fig.5. LXA4 receptor mRNA expression was not detected after a first round of RT-PCR amplification of any of the A549, 16HBE14o−, and PCHB cell mRNAs. Detection of LXA4 receptor transcripts in human bronchial epithelial cells required the use of nested PCR, as shown in the representative electrophoretic analysis in Fig. 5. We demonstrated that 16HBE14o− and PCHB expressed LXA4 receptor mRNA, whereas A549 cells did not. Because intracellular [Ca2+]iis a major regulator of epithelial secretory function we investigated a possible role for LXA4 on a Ca2+-dependent Cl− secretion. LXA4 (10−8m) applied on the basolateral side of the monolayer produced a sustained increase by 6 ± 1 μA/cm2, (p < 0.01,n = 6) of the transepithelial short-circuit current (Isc). The Isc increase started between 0 and 5 min after the beginning of LXA4 exposure and reached a plateau value within 10 min (Fig.6 A). In absence of external Cl− ions on both side of the epithelium, the response to LXA4 was completely abolished, indicating that the LXA4 effect on the Isc was mainly due to Cl− secretion (Fig. 6 B). The role of intracellular [Ca2+]i on the Iscincrease was investigated using the intracellular calcium chelator, the BAPTA-AM. As shown in Fig. 6 C, BAPTA-AM (10 μm) produced a low decrease (−0.9 ± 0.2 μA/cm2, n = 3) of the initialIsc, indicating a weak contribution of intracellular [Ca2+] to the basal trans-epithelial ion transport. However, after 60 min of treatment with BAPTA-AM, the LXA4effect on short-circuit current was completely inhibited. These results indicated that the LXA4-induced short-circuit current increase is due to the stimulation of a Ca2+-dependent secretory pathway. The present study is the first description of the rapid [Ca2+]i increase induced by LXA4in human airway epithelial cells including the description of the cellular mechanism involved in the response. The stimulation of a [Ca2+]i increase by LXA4 has been reported in rainbow trout leukocytes (18Knight J. Lloyd-Evans P. Rowley A.F. Barrow S.E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1993; 54: 518-522Google Scholar), in human monocytes (19Romano M. Maddox J.F. Serhan C.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2149-2154Google Scholar,20Maddox J.F. Hachicha M. Takano T. Petasis N.A. Fokin V.V. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6972-6978Google Scholar), and in human neutrophils (21Moores K.E. Merritt J.E. Eicosanoids. 1991; 4: 89-94Google Scholar). In airway epithelial cell, identification of the intracellular calcium stores as the main source of the LXA4-induced [Ca2+]iincrease is consistent with the previous report of an intracellular calcium mobilization induced by LXA4 in other cell types (19Romano M. Maddox J.F. Serhan C.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2149-2154Google Scholar, 20Maddox J.F. Hachicha M. Takano T. Petasis N.A. Fokin V.V. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6972-6978Google Scholar). In addition, the murine LXA4 receptor recently identified and cloned was also shown to induce the production of inositol triphosphate, a cellular event related to Ca2+ mobilization (28Vaughn M.W. Proske R.J. Haviland D.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3363-3369Google Scholar). There is no previous report of a [Ca2+]i increase induced by LXA4 in epithelial cells. In T84 cells, an intestinal epithelial cell line, LXA4 inhibited the transmigration of PMN by decreasing the Ca2+ response to the pathogen-elicited epithelial chemo-attractant, but the direct effect of LXA4 on [Ca2+]i was not reported (29Gewirtz A.T. McCormick B. Neish A.S. Petasis N.A. Gronert K. Serhan C.N. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1860-1869Google Scholar). The [Ca2+]i response to LXA4 was dose-dependent with a maximal response measured at 10−7m, which is consistent with the [Ca2+]i response to LXA4 in other cell types. A maximal effect was obtained at 10−6m in human neutrophils and human monocytes and at 10−8m in rainbow leukocytes (18Knight J. Lloyd-Evans P. Rowley A.F. Barrow S.E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1993; 54: 518-522Google Scholar, 19Romano M. Maddox J.F. Serhan C.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2149-2154Google Scholar, 20Maddox J.F. Hachicha M. Takano T. Petasis N.A. Fokin V.V. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6972-6978Google Scholar, 21Moores K.E. Merritt J.E. Eicosanoids. 1991; 4: 89-94Google Scholar). In human monocytes the [Ca2+]i response was mediated by stimulation of the LXA4 receptor (20Maddox J.F. Hachicha M. Takano T. Petasis N.A. Fokin V.V. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6972-6978Google Scholar). The LXA4 receptor has been cloned in human leukocytes (30Fiore S. Serhan C.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16678-16686Google Scholar) and in intestinal epithelial cell lines (17Gronert K. Gewirtz A. Madara J.L. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1285-1294Google Scholar). We found mRNA expression of the LXA4 receptor in the 16HBE14o− cell line and in human bronchial epithelial cells in culture, but not in A549 cells. The detection of the LXA4 receptor mRNA in human airway epithelial cells is consistent with the detection of LXA4 receptor cDNA in murine lung (28Vaughn M.W. Proske R.J. Haviland D.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3363-3369Google Scholar). Our results are in accordance with the previous publication (31Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Serhan C.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 252-261Google Scholar) reporting that the human bronchial epithelial cell line A549 did not show appreciable levels of LXA4 receptor cDNA, which we interpreted as a cell line characteristic rather than a tissue specificity of the LXA4 receptor expression. Because there is not detectable LXA4receptor expression in A549 cells, we considered this cell line as a negative control. Therefore, the relation between the LXA4receptor mRNA detection and the [Ca2+]iresponse strongly suggests that the LXA4 receptor was involved in the Ca2+ response. Moreover, because the LXA4 receptor activation has been shown to be associated to pertusssis toxin-sensitive G-protein, the sensitivity of the LXA4-induced [Ca2+]i response to pertussis toxin is also consistent with a role for LXA4receptor in the response. It has been reported that in rat glomerular mesengial cells, LXA4 binds the LTD4 receptor, which is also coupled to a G-protein (32Badr K.F. DeBoer D.K. Schwartzberg M. Serhan C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3438-3442Google Scholar, 33.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). However, we have shown that the LTD4 antagonist montelukast did not affect the [Ca2+]i response to LXA4 in airway epithelium, which indicates that the [Ca2+]i response to LXA4 is not mediated by the LTD4 receptor (34Wenzel S.E. Can. Respir. J. 1999; 6: 189-193Google Scholar). This last result constitutes further evidence for the involvement of the LXA4 receptor in the Ca2+ response to LXA4 in airway epithelial cell. Because LXA4 is a lipophylic molecule, the side of epithelium exposure to LXA4 should not affect the response. However, the absence of Ca2+ response to apical exposure to LXA4 of highly confluent 165HBE14o− monolayers compared with the response obtained in isolated cells or non-confluent cell monolayers could be explained by the lack of accessibility of the extracellular side of the receptor. This would suggest a basolateral location of the LXA4 receptor. In addition this observation is consistent with the recent report (35Kucharzik T. Gewirtz A.T. Merlin D. Madara J.L. Williams I.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 27: 27Google Scholar) of a preferential lateral location of the LXA4 receptor in intestinal epithelial cells. Therefore, we tested the modulation of the Isc by LXA4 applied on the basolateral side. Because the role of LXA4 in protein kinase C activation have been largely reported, we investigated the involvement of protein kinase C activity in the generation of the Ca2+ response (36Hansson A. Serhan C.N. Haeggstrom J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Samuelsson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 1215-1222Google Scholar, 37Shearman M.S. Naor Z. Sekiguchi K. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 177-182Google Scholar, 38Leszczynski D. Ustinov J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 117-120Google Scholar, 39Chung-a-on K.O. Soyombo O. Spur B.W. Lee T.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1334-1340Google Scholar). The ineffectiveness of chelerythrine chloride, a protein kinase C inhibitor, in the Ca2+ response to LXA4 suggests that protein kinase C activity is not involved in the generation of the [Ca2+]iincrease. However, the stimulation of protein kinase C activity by LXA4 might involve an initial Ca2+ increase, as described in the present study. The role of protein kinase A activity has also been investigated. The inhibitory effect of (R p)-cAMP and MDL hydrochloride suggested that, in airway epithelium, the Ca2+ response to LXA4involved stimulation of adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A activities. In contrast, the LXA4 effect on actin rearrangement in monocytes and macrophages is mimicked by the protein kinase A inhibitor and inhibited by the cell permeant cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP (40Maderna P. Cottell D.C. Berlasconi G. Petasis N.A. Brady H.R. Godson C. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2275-2283Google Scholar). Intracellular [Ca2+] plays a central role in epithelial cellular function such as ion or protein secretion. The LXA4-induced [Ca2+]i response might be involved in eicosanoid production by epithelium, which is known to depend on [Ca2+]i (41Noah T.L. Paradiso A.M. Madden M.C. McKinnon K.P. Devlin R.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 484-492Google Scholar, 42Lloyd-Evans P. Barrow S.E. Hill D.J. Bowden L.A. Rainger G.E. Knight J. Rowley A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 291-299Google Scholar, 43Pettitt T.R. Rowley A.F. Barrow S.E. Mallet A.I. Secombes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8720-8726Google Scholar). More specifically, a [Ca2+]i increase is necessary for lipoxygenase activity in the production LXA4 from its substrate (12Chavis C. Vachier I. Chanez P. Bousquet J. Godard P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1633-1643Google Scholar, 42Lloyd-Evans P. Barrow S.E. Hill D.J. Bowden L.A. Rainger G.E. Knight J. Rowley A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 291-299Google Scholar, 43Pettitt T.R. Rowley A.F. Barrow S.E. Mallet A.I. Secombes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8720-8726Google Scholar). Therefore, the LXA4-induced [Ca2+]i increase might play a central role in an autocrine production of LXA4 and constitute an amplificatory mechanism for the biosynthesis of LXA4itself. In addition, our results suggested that the Cl− secretion induced by LXA4 is one of the functional consequences of the LXA4-induced [Ca2+]iincrease. This would indicate that, in airway epithelial cells, beside its anti-inflammatory role LXA4 is involved in ionic transport regulation. This might have important clinical implications, in particular in the treatment of respiratory diseases associated with ion transport dysfunction, and necessitating anti-inflammatory treatment such as cystic fibrosis and asthma.

Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding studies reveal the ankyrin-repeat protein ANK1, which specifically interacts with a part of the BZI-1 protein (amino acids 73–222) encoding the D1 domain. ANK1 does not bind DNA or act as a co-activator of BZI-1-mediated transcription. Moreover, green fluorescence protein localization studies propose that ANK1 is acting mainly inside the cytosol. Transcription analysis reveals thatANK1 is ubiquitously expressed, but after pathogen attack transcription is transiently down-regulated. Along these lines, ANK1 homologous proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana have been reported to function in pathogen defense. We therefore propose that the D1 domain serves as an interaction surface for ANK1, which appears to regulate BZI-1 function in auxin signaling as well as pathogen response.

However, using various transgenic approaches that modulate the amount or the activation potential of BZI-1, we were not able to show any influence on transcription of phenylpropanoid pathway genes, such as chalcone synthase or phenylalanine ammonia lyase in vivo (1Heinekamp T.

Functional analysis has been performed in transgenic plants expressing a dominant-negative BZI-1 derivative lacking the N-terminal activation domain (BZI-1-ΔN). These plants display reduced internodes, small curly leaves, enhanced lateral shoot formation, and flowers that are reduced in size. In particular auxin responses appeared to be reduced with respect to auxin-induced rooting and regulation of aGH3 target gene. Moreover, BZI-1transcription is up-regulated in response to pathogen attack and pathogen-induced phosphorylation of BZI-1-related proteins has been described (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1777-1786Google Scholar), OHP1/2 (5Pysh L.D. Aukerman M.J. Schmidt R.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 227-236Google Scholar), BLZ1 (6Vicente-Carbajosa J. Onate L. Lara P. Diaz I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Google Scholar), or bZIP63 (7Jakoby M. Weisshaar B. Dröge-Laser W. Tiedemann J. Kroij T. Parcy F. Trends in Plant Science. 2002; 7: 106-111Google Scholar). Apart from the N-terminal activation domain, BZI-1-related transcription factors share several highly conserved domains (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar). Since transcription factors show a modular architecture, it seems likely that these conserved domains mediate specific functions. The D1 domain displays a α-helical structure, frequently localized in protein-protein interaction surfaces. The D2 domain harbors many acidic residues, as it has been described for activation domains (8Theill L.E. Castrillo J.L. Wu D. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 342: 945-948Google Scholar). Analyzing the parsley bZIP factor CPRF2, a phytochrome-mediated nuclear import was described. Making use of a CPRF2-GFP fusion, sequences related to the D1 and D2 domains have been postulated to act as cytosolic retention domains (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schafer E. Harter K. J. Ccell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Google Scholar). The basic domain (BD) of other bZIP factors was shown to mediate DNA binding and nuclear localization (10Varagona M.J. Raikhel N.V. Plant J. 1994; 5: 207-214Google Scholar). The ZIP domain of BZI-1 facilitates specific homo- or heterodimerization (3Strathmann A. Kuhlmann M. Heinekamp T. Droge-Laser W. Plant J. 2001; 28: 397-408Google Scholar). Finally, a phosphorylation site has been mapped in the C terminus of the BZI-1-related transcription factor CPRF2 (11Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rugner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schafer E. Harter K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29476-29482Google Scholar). In this work, transgenic plants expressing deletion derivatives of BZI-1 have been used to define protein domains essential for BZI-1 function in planta. The basic BD domain establishes DNA binding and is involved in nuclear translocation of BZI-1. The D1 domain appears to be crucial for BZI-1 function in the context of auxin signaling or pathogen defense response. Frequently, protein-protein interactions play an important role in signaling processes (12Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar). To isolate proteins specifically interacting with the α-helical D1 domain, a yeast two-hybrid screen has been performed. The interaction partner, an ankyrin-repeat protein referred to as ANK1, is unable to bind DNA or to modulate transcription as a co-factor. Moreover, the GFP-ANK1 fusion protein is localized inside the cytosol.ANK1 transcription is transiently down-regulated after pathogen attack, and TMV-induced HR formation is affected in BZI-1-ΔN plants. We therefore propose that protein interaction between ANK1 and BZI-1, mediated by the D1 domain, is involved in auxin and/or pathogen defense signaling. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi NN) were grown in a growth chamber under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 22 °C and 85% humidity. For TMV infection, fully expanded leaves of 6- to 8-week-old tobacco plants, which were grown in soil, were inoculated with TMV strain U1 (1 μg per leaf) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, or “mock” inoculated with buffer by gently rubbing the leaves with carborundum using a method which has been described previously (15Yalpani N. Altier D.J. Barbour E. Cigan A.L. Scelonge C.J. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1401-1410Google Scholar, 16Malamy J. Hennig J. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1992; : 359-365Google Scholar). Organogenesis was carried out by cultivating tobacco explants on solid Murashige and Skoog medium (17Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2 mg liter−1 naphthalene acetic acid and 1 mg liter−1 6-BAP. Standard DNA techniques have been described in Ref. 18.Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989)Molecular cloning: A Labatory Manual 2nd. Cold Spring Harbour, NY.Google Scholar. DNA sequence analysis was performed using an ABI310 sequencer, utilizing an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction Kit. A HA-tagged BZI-1 fusion gene (HA-BZI-1-ΔN) was obtained by inserting synthetic oligonucleotides (pHA1, CCGGGTACAATGACGTACCCTTACGACGTACCTGACTACGCGACG; pHA2, CCGTCGCGTAGTCAGGTACGTCGTAAGGGACCGTCATTGTCCCCGGGTAC) into theKpnI and AspI restriction sites at the 5′ end of the BZI-1-ΔN coding sequence. The plasmid obtained was named pUCA7Tx-HA-BZI-1-ΔN. The deletion BZI-1-ΔNΔD2 was generated by digesting pUCA7Tx-HA-BZI-1-ΔN with XbaI and BamHI. Insertion of the oligonucleotides Ol35 (CTAGCAAGCTTCAAGGCATG) and Ol36 (GATCCATGCCTTGAAGCTTG) rebuilt the BZI-1 reading frame (BZI-1-ΔNΔD2). The BZI-1-ΔNΔD1 derivative was obtained from the plasmid pET28-BZI-1-ΔN (3Strathmann A. Kuhlmann M. Heinekamp T. Droge-Laser W. Plant J. 2001; 28: 397-408Google Scholar). Deletion of an internal DraI fragment followed by religation resulted in pET28-BZI-1-ΔNΔD1. TheBZI-1-ΔNΔD1 andBZI-1-ΔNΔD2 fusion genes have been used to construct yeast and plant transformation vectors. To obtain a plasmid for in vitro transcription/translation, pGEM-ANK1 was constructed. The ANK1 gene was PCR-amplified using the primer mk2 (CCATGGACCTGCAGAACAACACATCTTTCTC) and mk3 (AGATCTGAATTCATGTCTGAGGGAGAGAAA). The PCR fragment was inserted into the vector pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) The plant transformation vectors pBIN-BZI-1-Oex and pBIN-BZI-1-ΔN have been described previously (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar). Binary vectors encoding the HA-tagged BZI-1 derivatives have been constructed. pBIN-HA-BZI-1-ΔN, pBIN-HA-BZI-1-ΔNΔD1, and pBIN-HA-BZI-1-ΔNΔD2 were obtained by inserting theKpnI/SalI fragment from pET28a-HA-BZI-1-ΔNΔD1, pUCA7Tx-HA-BZI-1-ΔN, or pUCA7Tx-HA-BZI-1-ΔNΔD2 into the plant transformation vector pBINHygTx (19Rieping M. Fritz M. Prat S. Gatz C. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1087-1098Google Scholar). Tobacco transformation was described in Ref. 1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar. The commercial “MATCHMAKER” yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used. Handling of yeast cultures and library screening, construction of a tobacco SR1 cDNA library and quantitative β-galactosidase assays were performed in accordance to Ref.3. β-Galactosidase units were given as a mean value of three independent measurements. As a positive control, the interaction between BD-p53 and AD-SV40 large T-antigen was used (Clontech MATCHMAKER system). Yeast two-hybrid vectors are based on pGBT9 and pGAD424 coding for GAL4 DNA BD or activation domain (AD), respectively. The construction of the plasmid pGBT-HA-BZI-1-ΔN, encoding a BD-HA-BZI-1-ΔN fusion protein, has been described recently (3Strathmann A. Kuhlmann M. Heinekamp T. Droge-Laser W. Plant J. 2001; 28: 397-408Google Scholar). To obtain pGBT-HA-BZI-1-ΔNΔD1 and pGBT-HA-BZI-1-ΔNΔD2, anAspI/SalI fragment from pE28-BZI-1-ΔNΔD1 or aSmaI/SalI fragment from pUCA7Tx-HA-BZI-1-ΔNΔD2 was inserted into the vector pGBT9. The plasmid pGBT-ANK1 was obtained by insertion of anEcoRI/PstI ANK1 fragment from pGBT-ANK1 into GBT9. AfterHindIII/PstI digestion of pGBT-BZI-1 and pGBT-BZI-1-ΔN, the GALBD-BZI-1 and theGALBD-BZI-1-ΔN fusion genes were inserted into pKS-Bluescript. To obtain pGALBD-BZI-1 and pGALBD-BZI-1-ΔN,Acc65I fragments encoding GALBD-BZI-1 or GALBD-BZI-1-ΔN were inserted in the Acc65I-digested pHBT-BZI-1 or pHBT-BZI-1-ΔN (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar), respectively. As controls the vectors pHBTL, 2I. Lenk, unpublished data. coding for a GFP, and pRanBP1a-GFP, encoding a RanBP1a-GFP fusion protein, (20Haasen D. Kohler C. Neuhaus G. Merkle T. Plant J. 1999; 20: 695-705Google Scholar) have been used. The ANK1 gene was obtained as a NcoI fragment and inserted into pHBTL to result in an pHBTL-ANK1-GFP, encoding an ANK1-GFP fusion gene driven by a modified 35S promoter. To obtain the BZI-1 deletion derivatives, pHBTL-BZI-1-ΔNΔD1-GFP, pHBTL-BZI-1-ΔNΔD2-GFP, and pHBTL-BZI-1-ΔNΔBD-GFP the KpnI-NheI fragments encoding the corresponding deletion derivatives were introduced into pHBTL-BZI-1-ΔN-GFP. Tobacco leaf mesophyll protoplasts were isolated and transformed by electroporation (21Crofts A.J. Leborgne-Castel N. Hillmer S. Robinson D.G. Phillipson B. Carlsson L.E. Ashford D.A. Denecke J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2233-2248Google Scholar). After 20 h of incubation in the dark, GUS assays were carried out according to Ref. 1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar). GFP localization studies have been performed using a confocal microscope (LSM-510, Zeiss). Preparation of recombinant HIS-BZI-1-ΔN protein has been previously described (3Strathmann A. Kuhlmann M. Heinekamp T. Droge-Laser W. Plant J. 2001; 28: 397-408Google Scholar) using pET28-BZI-1-ΔN. The pET28-BZI-1-ΔNΔD1 derivative was obtained from the plasmid pET28-BZI-1-ΔN by deleting an internalDraI fragment, followed by religation. pET28-BZI-1-ΔNΔBD was obtained by insertion of a KpnI-SalI fragment encoding BZI-1-ΔNΔBD into pET28-BZI-1-ΔN. ANK1 protein was obtained by in vitro transcription/translation applying pGEM-ANK1 in a reticulocyte system (Promega). EMSA has been performed as described previously (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used for the binding reactions: AATTCGA- GAACTTTTGCTGACGTGGCCACACATCTGGACCCA. Yeast protein was isolated (3Strathmann A. Kuhlmann M. Heinekamp T. Droge-Laser W. Plant J. 2001; 28: 397-408Google Scholar), run on an SDS-PAGE (18.Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989)Molecular cloning: A Labatory Manual 2nd. Cold Spring Harbour, NY.Google Scholar), and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Braunschweig, Germany) following the procedure described previously (22Kyhse-Anderson J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Meth. 1984; 10: 203-209Google Scholar). For immunodetection, a HA-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences) were applied. Preparation of plant protein extracts used for Western analysis and isolation of BZI-1-specific antibodies (α-BZI-1) were performed according to Ref. 1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar. Northern blot method was performed using a BZI-1-specificXhoI/PstI restriction fragment (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar). Conserved protein domains have been defined in BZI-1-related proteins by means of amino acid (aa) homology (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar). To analyze a putative role of these domains in BZI-1 function, BZI-1 deletion derivates were expressed in transgenic plants (Fig. 1, A and B). Whereas BZI-1-overexpressing tobacco plants (BZI-1-Oex) do not display any visible alterations, expression of a dominant-negative BZI-1-ΔN derivative, which lacks the N-terminal activation domain, resulted in plants showing a complex phenotype characterized by reduced internodes, increased development of lateral shoots, and size-reduced curly leaves (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the N-terminal domain is crucial for BZI-1 function in planta (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar). Phenotypic alterations imply that these plants might be affected in hormone signaling. Using leaf explants derived from BZI-1-ΔN plant in an organogenesis assay, cytokinin-induced shooting was unchanged (data not shown), but auxin-induced rooting appeared to be significantly reduced (Fig. 1 E). Furthermore, BZI-1 has been implicated to function in the context of pathogen defense (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar, 4Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. The EMBO J. l. 1997; 16: 726-738Google Scholar). Hence, the transgenic plants were infected with TMV (Fig. 1 F). Whereas viral spread was limited in wild type plants as monitored by reference to localized HR lesion formation, BZI-1-ΔN plants showed a spreading of the HR lesions, which resulted in a breakdown of the whole leaf tissue. These phenotypic alterations have been used to map BZI-1 protein domains. BZI-1-ΔN derivatives were expressed in transgenic tobacco, displaying additional deletions of the conserved domains. In all assay systems described above, deletion of the D2 domain did not alter the BZI-1-ΔN phenotype, implying that this domain might be not important for BZI-1-ΔN function. In contrast, deletion of D1 resulted in wild type plants, abolishing the function of the overexpressed BZI-1- ΔN protein. Deletion of protein domains might alter expression, protein stability, nuclear localization, or DNA binding properties of BZI-1. We therefore performed a number of controls to molecularly characterize the transgenic plants. Expression of the constructs was examined by Northern (Fig. 1 C) and Western analysis (Fig.1 D). All transgenic plants used for further studies showed significant protein levels of the BZI-1 derivatives. Using recombinant proteins, BZI-1-ΔN and BZI-1-ΔNΔD1 were found to bind ACEs in EMSA (Fig. 2). Hence, these factors still can function as DNA-binding proteins. In contrast, the deletion of the DNA binding domain in BZI-1-ΔNΔBD abolishes DNA binding (Fig. 2), implying that this protein is inactive in controlling specific promoter targets. Using transiently transformed protoplasts, BZI-1-GFP fusion protein was detected predominantly in the nucleus (1Heinekamp T. Kuhlmann M. Lenk A. Strathmann A. Dröge-Laser W. Mol. Gen. Genom. 2002; 267: 16-26Google Scholar). Like BZI-1-GFP, the BZI-1-ΔN-GFP, BZI-1-ΔNΔD1-GFP, or BZI-1-ΔNΔD2-GFP fusion proteins were found in the nucleus. Compared with BZI-1-GFP, the nuclear localization of these proteins appeared to be slightly enhanced (Fig. 3, d–f), whereas BZI-1-ΔNΔBD-GFP was enriched in the cytosol (Fig. 3 g) Nevertheless, complete nuclear exclusion, as it was found for a cytosolic protein (RanBP1a-GFP) (19Rieping M. Fritz M. Prat S. Gatz C. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1087-1098Google Scholar), could not be observed for BZI-1-ΔNΔBD-GFP.Figure 3Cytosolic localization studies of BZI-1-GFP fusion proteins. C-terminal GFP fusions of the BZI-1 derivatives described in Fig. 1 A were transiently expressed tobacco leaf protoplasts. White field images (left) and detection of GFP fluorescence (505–550 nm) (right) are shown 20 h after transfection. As a control, GFP localized in the cytosol and the nucleus (a) and cytosolic RanBP1a-GFP (19Rieping M. Fritz M. Prat S. Gatz C. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1087-1098Google Scholar) (b) are shown. The BZI-derivatives are: BZI-1-GFP (c), BZI-1-ΔN-GFP (d), BZI-1-ΔNΔD1-GFP (e), BZI-1-ΔNΔD2-GFP (f), and BZI-1-ΔNΔBD-GFP (g). The nucleus is marked by an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Like BZI-1-ΔN, BZI-1-ΔNΔD1 protein is stable in planta, binds DNA, and is localized in the nucleus. However, since BZI-1-ΔNΔD1 plants appeared like wild type, the presence of the D1 domain seems important for establishing the BZI-1-ΔN phenotype. The BD domain is important for DNA-binding and is involved in nuclear localization. However, its deletion does not completely abolish function of the overexpressed BZI-1 derivative. Although the vegetative part of BZI-1-ΔNΔBD transgenic plants appears like wild type (Fig.1 B), it has to be noted that slight alterations,e.g. in flower size (data not shown), occur. Auxin-induced rooting shows an intermediate phenotype that varies during repetitions of assay. However, TMV infection results in wild type lesion formation (data not shown). In conclusion, the influence of BZI-1ΔNΔBD on BZI-1 related transcription appears to be complex. Since the D1 domain shows an α-helical structure frequently found in protein interaction domains, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify BZI-1 interaction partners. As a bait, an internal fragment encoding the domains D1 and D2 (aa 73–244) was fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GALBD) (3Strathmann A. Kuhlmann M. Heinekamp T. Droge-Laser W. Plant J. 2001; 28: 397-408Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). Expression of the bait construct in yeast was monitored by means of Western analysis (Fig.4 B). Screening of 107 clones resulted in the isolation of a cDNA encoding a 37-kDa protein, referred to as N. tabacum ANK1 (Fig.5 A). In silicoanalysis revealed that the C-terminal part of ANK1 harbors four ankyrin repeats, protein domains typically involved in protein-protein interaction (for a review see Ref. 25Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Google Scholar). Compared with the ankyrin repeat consensus sequence, the repeats 2 and 3 were well conserved, whereas repeats 1 and 4 displayed some alterations. An almost identical gene sequence has been isolated from N. tabacumcv. SNN (HBP1, GenBankTM accession number AAL25088), but functional data have not yet been published. The homologous proteins AKR2 (MIPS At4g35450) (13Yan J. Wang J. Zhang H. Plant J. 2002; 29: 193-202Google Scholar) and AtPhos43 (MIPS At2g17390) (14Peck S.C. Nuhse T.S. Hess D. Iglesias A. Meins F. Boller T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1467-1475Google Scholar) have been described in Arabidopsis thaliana (Fig. 5 A). Apart from the N-terminal 50 aa, which are less conserved, these proteins share a high aa identity of 66%. The N-terminal 50 aa are rich in proline, aspartic acid, serine, and threonine, as has been described for the PEST domains (23Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Google Scholar).Figure 5The ANK1 protein from N. tabacum. A, alignment of N. tabacum ANK1 with A. thaliana AKR2 (13Yan J. Wang J. Zhang H.

Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ANK1 has been found reproducibly in the yeast two-hybrid screen (19 independent clones). The interactions have been monitored by adenine prototrophic growth of the yeast strains (data not shown) and quantitative β-galactosidase enzyme activity assay (oNPG-Assay) (Fig.4 C). To map the ANK1 interaction domain, BZI derivatives were constructed, deleting parts of the domains D1 or D2, respectively (for details see Fig. 4 A). Since the N-terminal 73 aa lead to auto-activation, the deletions were constructed based on the BZI-1-ΔN bait. However, the deletion in D1 only results in a 50% decrease in ANK1-BZI-1 interaction. Hence, D1 is involved in the interaction with BZI-1, but the deleted aa 101–152 are not sufficient. Therefore, we assume that the neighboring aa participate in ANK1 binding. In contrast, deleting the central part of D2 shows that this domain is not participating in ANK1-BZI-1 interactions. Furthermore, the C-terminal part of the BZI-1 protein did not show any interaction with ANK1. In summary, we conclude that the region between aa 73 and 222 acts as an interaction surface, which is sufficient for BZI-1-ANK1 interaction. In EMSA, BZI-1-ΔN homodimers were found to bind ACEs, but ANK1 does not bind ACE-related DNA sequences (Fig. 6). Interaction between BZI-1 and ANK1 in yeast was confirmed in the in vitro assay. ANK1 inhibits binding of recombinant BZI-1-ΔN protein, whereas BZI-1-ΔNΔD1 protein co-incubated with ANK1 binds DNA. As has been found in yeast, deletion of the D1 domain does not completely abolish BZI-1-ANK1 interaction. In agreement with thein vivo data obtained for yeast and in planta,in vitro protein interaction shows that the α-helical surface (aa 101–152) deleted in BZI-1-ΔNΔD1 participates in ANK1 interaction but is itself not sufficient. Since ANK1 interacts with a transcription factor it might regulate transcription indirectly by acting as a co-factor. In yeast, expression of a GALBD fusion with ANK1 leads to significant activation of the GAL-UAS-lacZ reporter (Fig. 7 A). Hence, by interacting with BZI-1, ANK1 might function as a co-factor modulating BZI-1-mediated transcriptional control. Expression of a GALBD-BZI-1 protein in tobacco protoplasts resulted in a significant activation of a 4xGAL-UAS-GUSreporter (Fig. 7 B). The level of activation was comparable to that of the strong activator GALBD-VP16. However, co-expression of GALBD-BZI-1 and ANK1 did not enhance transcription of the reporter, as it can be assumed from a co-activator. In contrast, a slight reduction of transcription has been observed, which is not significant. To verify that ANK1 expression has no indirect effects on cell viability, co-transfection with a functional unrelated GALBD-VP16 protein has been performed. In this control, ANK expression did not interfere with normal cell activities. In silico analysis of BZI-1 did not show any well defined nuclear localization sequences. An ANK1-GFP fusion gene was transiently expressed in tobacco protoplasts, and cellular localization was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Whereas non-fused GFP was found in the nucleus and in the cytosol (Fig. 3 a), ANK1-GFP was mainly localized in the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 8). As a control, exclusion outside the nucleus can be seen for RanBP1a-GFP fusion protein as has been described previously (19Rieping M. Fritz M. Prat S. Gatz C. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1087-1098Google Scholar) (Fig.3 b). However, this clear exclusion of the nucleus cannot be seen with ANK1-GFP protein. Hence, ANK1 is mainly localized in the cytosol, but we cannot rule out that small amounts might be present in the nucleus. According to the model proposed in Ref. 9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schafer E. Harter K. J. Ccell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Google Scholar, nuclear translocation of the BZI-1-related transcription factor CPRF2 is regulated by a cytosolic retention protein. If ANK1 were to act as a cytosolic-retention factor, co-expression should result in alterations in BZI-1 localization. However, after co-expression of ANK1, we could not detect any significant changes in cellular localization of the BZI-1-ΔN-GFP fusion protein (data not shown). ANK1has been found to be constitutively expressed in all plant tissues tested (Fig.9 A). Since BZI-1 is involved in mediating auxin and pathogen defense responses, we tested whetherANK1 expression is regulated by these stimuli. Infection with Pseudomonas syringae (Fig. 9 B) results in a transient decrease in the ANK1 transcript level. Comparable results were obtained with other elicitors, e.g. cryptogein (data not shown). The efficiency of infection was controlled by activation EAS4, a pathogen-inducible gene (24Facchini P.J. Chappell J. Proc. Nal. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 11088-11092Google Scholar). No effect on ANK1 transcription was observed after treatment with auxin in response to light/dark rhythms or wounding (data not"

Dpr, a recently discovered member of the Dps protein family, provides a means for catalase-negative bacteria to tolerate H2O2. Potentially, Dpr could bind free intracellular iron and thus inhibit the Fenton chemistry-catalyzed formation of toxic hydroxyl radicals (H2O2 + Fe2+ → ⋅OH +–OH + Fe3+). We explored the in vivo function of Dpr in the catalase- and NADH peroxidase-negative pig and human pathogen Streptococcus suis. We show that: (i) a Dpr allelic exchange knockout mutant was hypersensitive (∼106-fold) to H2O2, (ii) Dpr incorporated iron in vivo, (iii) a putative ferroxidase center was present in Dpr, (iv) single amino acid substitutions D74A or E78A to the putative ferroxidase center abolished the in vivo iron incorporation, and (v) the H2O2 hypersensitive phenotype was complemented by wild-type Dpr or by a membrane-permeating iron chelator, but not by the site-mutated forms of Dpr. These results demonstrate that the putative ferroxidase center of Dpr is functionally active in iron incorporation and that the H2O2 resistance is mediated by Dpr in vivo by its iron binding activity.

We explored the in vivo function of Dpr in the catalase- and NADH peroxidase-negative pig and human pathogen Streptococcus suis. We show that: (i) a Dpr allelic exchange knockout mutant was hypersensitive (∼106-fold) to H2O2, (ii) Dpr incorporated iron in vivo, (iii) a putative ferroxidase center was present in Dpr, (iv) single amino acid substitutions D74A or E78A to the putative ferroxidase center abolished the in vivo iron incorporation, and (v) the H2O2 hypersensitive phenotype was complemented by wild-type Dpr or by a membrane-permeating iron chelator, but not by the site-mutated forms of Dpr. These results demonstrate that the putative ferroxidase center of Dpr is functionally active in iron incorporation and that the H2O2 resistance is mediated by Dpr in vivo by its iron binding activity.

However, partially reduced forms of oxygen superoxide anion radical (O2⨪), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) are formed and able to cause serious damage to cellular macromolecules (1Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 59-66Google Scholar, 2Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Google Scholar, 3Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Google Scholar). Despite the lack of oxidative phosphorylation, H2O2 is produced by streptococci (4Hirst R.A. Sikand K.S. Rutman A. Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. O'Callaghan C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1557-1562Google Scholar, 5Thomas E.L. Pera K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1236-1244Google Scholar, 6Thomas E.L. Milligan T.W. Joyner R.E. Jefferson M.M. Infect.

In addition, H2O2 is encountered as a part of host defenses (8Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Google Scholar), and under certain conditions streptococci seem to utilize it as their own virulence factor (4Hirst R.A. Sikand K.S. Rutman A. Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. O'Callaghan C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1557-1562Google Scholar, 9Jansen W.T. Bolm M. Balling R. Chhatwal G.S. Schnabel R. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5202-5207Google Scholar, 10Spellerberg B. Cundell D.R. Sandros J. Pearce B.J. Idanpaan-Heikkila I. Rosenow C. Masure H.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 803-813Google Scholar). However, streptococci lack the H2O2-degrading enzyme catalase, which in many organisms is responsible for the elimination of H2O2. Identification and characterization of the components mediating H2O2 resistance in streptococci may eventually contribute to the development of means to prevent and treat streptococcal diseases. Dpr (Dps-like peroxide resistance protein) is a recently discovered aerotolerance and H2O2 resistance factor of Streptococcus mutans (11Yamamoto Y. Higuchi M. Poole L.B. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3740-3747Google Scholar). Although Dpr is widely conserved in other Gram-positive bacteria, including the important human pathogensStreptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11Yamamoto Y. Higuchi M. Poole L.B. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3740-3747Google Scholar), relatively little is known of the molecular mechanisms of its action. The primary amino acid sequence shares similarity with Escherichia coli Dps (DNA-bindingprotein from starved cells) (12Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Google Scholar, 13Lomovskaya O.L. Kidwell J.P. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3928-3935Google Scholar), a prototype for a large group of similar oligomeric proteins (14Pena M.M. Bullerjahn G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22478-22482Google Scholar), which is abundantly expressed in starved cells and involved in DNA protection by DNA-Dps biocrystal formation (15Martinez A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5188-5194Google Scholar, 16Frenkiel-Krispin D. Levin-Zaidman S. Shimoni E. Wolf S.G. Wachtel E.J. Arad T. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Minsky A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1184-1191Google Scholar). Studies on Dps family members also indicate that the protective function of Dpr against H2O2 might be mediated by H2O2 degradation due to a catalase-like activity (14Pena M.M. Bullerjahn G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22478-22482Google Scholar) or by chelation of free intracellular iron (17Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Google Scholar). It is known that toxicity of H2O2is relatively weak (3Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Google Scholar), although it easily diffuses across biological membranes (18Gonzalez-Flecha B. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13681-13687Google Scholar, 19Costa Seaver L. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7182-7189Google Scholar) and oxidize thiols (3Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Google Scholar). However, if reduced transition metal ions, especially iron, are present, H2O2 is nonenzymatically cleaved into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals by Fenton chemistry (H2O2 + Fe2+ → ⋅OH +–OH + Fe3+) (20Fenton H.J.H. J. Chem. Soc. 1894; 65: 899-910Google Scholar, 21Goldstein S. Meyerstein D. Czapski G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 435-445Google Scholar). Dps family members share a conserved amino acid motif, similar to mammalian ferritinl-subunit iron nucleation center, in the N-terminal halves of the proteins (14Pena M.M. Bullerjahn G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22478-22482Google Scholar, 22Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Google Scholar, 23Harrison P.M. Arosio P.

Because several members, including the streptococcal Dpr (11Yamamoto Y. Higuchi M. Poole L.B. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3740-3747Google Scholar, 25Yamamoto Y. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2931-2939Google Scholar), are known to bind iron (17Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Google Scholar, 22Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Google Scholar, 26Tonello F. Dundon W.G.

Zanotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15093-15098Google Scholar), the conserved motif is believed to serve a functional role. It has been suggested that the motif catalyzes iron oxidation by its putative ferroxidase activity and also directs the formation of an iron core into the inner cavity of the oligomer (17Zhao G.

Rossi G. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37619-37623Google Scholar). However, there is no direct experimental evidence for any of the Dps family members to support the functionality of the putative ferroxidase center in iron incorporation in vivo. Furthermore, the biological significance of iron incorporation is not well established. Streptococcus suis is an important pig pathogen that causes severe infections such as sepsis and meningitis, and it occasionally causes life-threatening disease also in humans (30Staats J.J. Feder I. Okwumabua O. Chengappa M.M. Vet. Res. Commun. 1997; 21: 381-407Google Scholar). We have previously identified in S. suis a galactose-specific adhesion activity (31Kurl D.N. Haataja S. Finne J. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 384-389Google Scholar, 32Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Liukkonen J. Francois-Gerard C. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4311-4317Google Scholar, 33Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Nilsson U. Magnusson G. Karlsson K.A. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27466-27472Google Scholar). One of the proteins identified as a candidate adhesin displaying binding activity to glycoproteins had a 64% primary amino acid sequence identity withS. mutans Dpr. 1K. Tikkanen, A. T. Pulliainen, V.-P. Korhonen, R. Segers, S. Haataja, J. Wahlfors, and J. Finne, submitted for publication. S. suis seemed an ideal model organism to study the in vivo function of Dpr in H2O2 resistance because it not only lacks catalase but also lacks NADH peroxidase (34Niven D.F. Ekins A. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 412-416Google Scholar). The results of the present study demonstrate that the putative ferroxidase center of Dpr is involved in iron incorporation and that the H2O2 resistance mediated by Dpr depends on its iron incorporation activity in vivo. The bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in Tables I andII. S. suis was cultured aerobically or under 6% CO2 at 37 °C with or without agitation in Todd Hewitt Broth medium (DIFCO) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (Biokar Diagnostics) (THY).2 E. coliwas grown aerobically at 37 °C with agitation in Luria-Bertani medium. When needed, media were solidified by 1.5% agar. All bacteria were stored at −70 °C in growth media containing 15% (v/v) glycerol. Antibiotics (Sigma) were used at the following concentrations unless otherwise indicated: (i) E. coli, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol; and (ii) S. suis, 20 μg/ml ampicillin, 500 μg/ml kanamycin, 1000 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol.Table IStrains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidDescription, antibiotic resistanceakan, kanamycin; amp, ampicillin; spc, spectinomycin; cat, chloramphenicol; tet, tetracycline.(reference or source; otherwise this study)S. suis628Wild-type strain of serotype 2, isolated from human brain (31Kurl D.N.

Kenter T. de Haan L.A. Jacobs A.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 255-261Google Scholar). Standard protocols were used for PCR, DNA modification, cloning, E. coli transformation, and Southern and colony hybridization as described by Sambrook and Russel (39Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laborartory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega and Fermentas, and Vent DNA polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs. DNA molecular mass markers were from Promega. Plasmids amplified inE. coli DH5α were isolated using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit or from PCR and other enzymatic reactions using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). DNA sequences were determined by ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase FS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sequencing primers were purchased from Interactiva Biotechnologie GmbH. For Southern, Northern, and colony hybridization, radioactive DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]CTP (Amersham Biosciences) using Prime-a-Gene Labeling System (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Templates for labeling were generated by PCR using primers DPR-5′-IN and DPR-3′-IN specific for dpr and 16S-5′ and 16S-3′ specific for 16S rRNA genes and gel-isolated before labeling. The hybridized membranes were analyzed with Fujifilm BA-2500 Phosphor Imaging Plate System (Fuji Photo Film Co.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Southern hybridization was used to identify a 6.5-kbClaI-EcoRI genomic fragment that seemed to contain the entire dpr from S. suis serotype 2 strain 628 (data not shown). To clone the 6.5-kb fragment, we ligated gel-isolated, ClaI- and EcoRI-digested DNA fragments ranging from 6 to 7 kb intoEcoRI-NarI-digested pBR322, electrotransformed the ligation mixture into E. coli DH5α cells, and screened the transformants by colony hybridization. One hybridizing clone, designated pDPR6500, was isolated and sequenced. Sequencing data were assembled, and the consensus sequence was edited using the MAC DNAsis software (Hitachi). The web-based program ORF Finder (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html) was used to predict the coding regions. The BLAST software package at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was used to search for protein sequences homologous to the deduced amino acid sequences. Promoter sequence features were searched using WWW Signal Scan (bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/signal). Overnight S. suis cultures were diluted 100-fold into 50 ml of fresh THY supplemented with 30 mm glycin. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with slight agitation toA 600 of ∼0.2. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m sucrose (2000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C) and once with 10 ml of ice-cold 0.5m sucrose supplemented with 15% (v/v) glycerol (2000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The cells were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m sucrose supplemented with 15% glycerol (v/v) and were either used directly or stored at −70 °C. Electrotransformations were done using the Gene Pulser II Electroporation System (Bio-Rad). 1 μg of suicide vector or 100 ng of shuttle vector was mixed with 50 μl of the electrocompetent cells on ice. The mixtures were transferred into prechilled sterile Gene Pulser cuvettes (interelectrode distance, 0.1 cm; Bio-Rad) and pulsed with a setting of 15 microfarads, 1.8 kV, and 200 ohms. After the electric pulse, the cells were diluted in 1 ml of THY supplemented with 0.3m sucrose and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C under 6% CO2. The cells were then plated on THY agar containing the appropriate antibiotics. The cells routinely yielded ∼106transformants/μg shuttle vector. For extraction of total RNA, overnight S. suiscultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh THY and grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. At various levels of turbidity, 1-ml aliquots were taken from the cultures. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 2 min, 4 °C), immediately snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C. The cells were later thawed, and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer. 20 μg of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The RNA Ladder (New England Biolabs) served as a molecular mass marker. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization and washing conditions were performed as described by Sambrook and Russel (39Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laborartory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Overnight S. suis cultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh THY and grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. At various levels of turbidity, cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), washed with Pi/NaCl (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4)) (2000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and resuspended in 750 μl of Pi/NaCl. The cells were disrupted by sonication five times (20 s each time), with a chilling interval of 1 min between the sonications. EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to the sonicates according to instructions of the manufacturer. After unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), the cleared lysate was collected and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined at least in triplicate using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay, based on the Bradford dye binding procedure (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) as a standard. Expression and purification of recombinant Dpr have been described previously (41Haataja S. Penttinen A. Pulliainen A.T. Tikkanen K. Finne J. Papageorgiou A.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1851-1853Google Scholar). Two rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with 1.0 ml of a mixture of the recombinant Dpr (100 μg/ml) and Freund's complete adjuvant (1:1, v/v). Booster injections with the same protein mixture in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were given at 28 and 56 days, and sera were collected 14 days after each immunization. The sera collected 14 days after the last booster had the highest activity against Dpr and were used for subsequent work. For Western blotting, the proteins were resolved under denaturing conditions in a 12% polyacrylamide gel or under nondenaturing conditions in a 4–15% gradient Tris-HCl Ready Gel (Bio-Rad) using SDS-PAGE Low Range (Bio-Rad) or equine spleen type I ferritin (Sigma) and BSA as the molecular mass markers, respectively. Proteins were subsequently transferred to a Protran Nitrocellulose Transfer Membrane (Schleicher & Schell) using the 2117 Multiphor II Electrophoresis Unit (LKB Bromma). The membranes were saturated with 3% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in Pi/NaCl at room temperature for 1 h. The anti-Dpr polyclonal antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 in 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in Pi/NaCl, and the membranes were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After washing with Pi/NaCl, the membranes were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 1% BSA (w/v) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in Pi/NaCl containing a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO). After washing with Pi/NaCl, the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect the binding according to instructions of the manufacturer. We generated a genetically stable deletion mutant (D282Δdpr) of the dpr by adopting the double cross-over method. A 2.8-kb fragment around the dpr was amplified by PCR using primers TOT-5′ and TOT-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with BclI andKpnI, and the resulting 2.6-kb fragment was cloned into theKpnI-BamHI site of pID700 to generate pDPR1. Thedpr was deleted from the pDPR1 by PCR with primers DEL-5′ and DEL-3′ and replaced by a spectinomycin resistance gene (spc) devoid of terminator generated by PCR with primers SPCS and SPCA using pKUN19-Spc as the template. The resulting plasmid, pDPR2, was analyzed by restriction enzyme digestions and PCR to contain the spc in the same direction of transcription as thedpr. Because strain 628 has been poorly transformable in our hands, we used D282 cells of same serotype and with identical dpr sequence as strain 628, and colonies with the single cross-over genotype (ChlR, SpcR) were selected. One ChlR and SpcR colony was chosen, and the double cross-over genotype (SpcR) was selected as follows. Single cross-over mutant was first grown overnight with spectinomycin (1000 μg/ml), allowing the vector to excise out of the genome, leaving the spc in the place of thedpr. Resulting double cross-over mutants were enriched by using the bacteriostatic activity of chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) and at the same time killing the dividing bacteria (still having the vector insertion) by using ampicillin (20 μg/ml). The enriched bacteria were plated on THY with spectinomycin, and the double cross-over genotype (SpcR) was verified by replica plating. The replacement ofdpr by spc was further verified by PCR with primers DPR-5′-OUT and DPR-3′-OUT annealing upstream and downstream ofdpr, respectively, and by Western analysis. The dpr mutation was complemented by introducing wild-type dpr into D282Δdpr in an E. coli/Streptococcus sp. shuttle vector pLZ12-Km/Spc. pLZ12-Km/Spc was generated by ligating the spc generated by PCR with primers SPCS and SPCB using pKUN19-Spc as the template toNcoI/EcoRI-digested pLZ12-Km. Twodpr-containing DNA fragments, L4A and P3, were amplified by PCR using primers 5′-DCOMP and 3′-COMP or 5′-UPCOMP and 3′-COMP, respectively. These DNA fragments were digested with KpnI and ligated into KpnI-digested and dephosphorylated pLZ12-Km/Spc to generate the plasmid constructs pLZ12-L4A and pLZ12-P3, respectively. In these constructs, dpr transcription is under the control of spc promoter or the possible promoter activity of dpr upstream sequence. The constructs were sequenced to ensure that no mistakes were introduced intodpr during the amplification and introduced into D282Δdpr, and complementation genotype (SpcR, KanR) was selected on agar plates. The expression of Dpr was verified by Western analysis. Codons encoding Asp-74 (GAT) and Glu-78 (GAG) were independently mutated into GCA (Ala) in the pLZ12-L4A, resulting in plasmids pLZ12-L4A-74 and pLZ12-L4A-78, respectively. Briefly, pLZ12-L4A was linearized by PCR using the mutagenic oligonucleotides (DPR-AspA and DPR-NAT-3′A for D74A and DPR-GluB and DPR-NAT-3′B for E78A) as follows: 40 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 6 min at 72 °C for 15 cycles. The products from tubes containing varying amounts of Mg2+ were pooled, purified, and digested withDpnI to reduce the number of parental molecules. The linearized PCR products were treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, gel-isolated, religated, and transformed to E. coli DH5α. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting constructs were introduced into D282Δdpr, and complementation genotype (SpcR, KanR) was selected on agar plates. Expression of Dpr was verified by Western analysis. Overnight S. suis cultures were diluted 100-fold into 25 ml of fresh THY containing 55FeCl3 (663.3 MBq/mg; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as 0.35 MBq/ml and grown to early-stationary phase at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), washed once with Pi/NaCl (2000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C), and resuspended in 750 μl of Pi/NaCl. Cellular protein extracts were prepared as described. For determination of iron content of Dpr, 50 μg of cellular protein extracts was resolved under nondenaturing conditions in a 4–15% gradient Tris-HCl Ready Gel (Bio-Rad). After the run, one gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to show the pattern of protein bands for equal loading in each lane, and another gel was placed between two plastic sheets and analyzed for 55Fe-containing proteins using Fujifilm BA-2500 Phosphor Imaging Plate System (Fuji Photo Film Co.) according to instructions of the manufacturer. Overnight S. suis cultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh THY and grown to early-stationary phase at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. At this point, 1-ml aliquots were taken from the cultures and exposed to H2O2 in concentrations of 0, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mm. Cells were left in contact with H2O2 for 2 h at 37 °C without agitation. Immediately after the incubation, cells were diluted in Pi/NaCl and plated for viability counts onto THY agar. Colonies were counted after overnight incubation under 6% CO2 at 37 °C. In the iron chelator complementation analysis of the H2O2 hypersensitivity of D282Δdpr, 1-ml aliquots of early-stationary phase cultures were first incubated with deferoxamine mesylate (DFOM) (Sigma) or diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) (Sigma) at concentrations of 0, 10, 50, and 100 μm for 30 min at 37 °C without agitation. The cells were then incubated with or without 5.0 mm H2O2 for 2 h at 37 °C without agitation. Immediately after the incubation, cells were diluted in Pi/NaCl and plated for viability counts onto THY agar. Colonies were counted after overnight incubation under 6% CO2 at 37 °C. We have previously identified in S. suis a galactose-specific adhesion activity (31Kurl D.N. Haataja S. Finne J. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 384-389Google Scholar, 32Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Liukkonen J.

Recently, the corresponding gene was cloned, based on peptide sequence data of the purified protein and by genome walking.1 The gene turned out to encode a protein with 64% identity and 82% similarity toS. mutans Dpr (NCBI Protein Database accession numberBAA96472) at the level of primary amino acid sequence. In the present study, we identified by Southern hybridization and subsequently cloned and sequenced a 6.5-kb ClaI-EcoRI fragment containing the entire dpr.

https://openalex.org/W1997740557,"MspA is the major porin of Mycobacterium smegmatis mediating the exchange of hydrophilic solutes across the cell wall and is the prototype of a new family of tetrameric porins with a single central pore of 10 nm in length. Infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that MspA consists mainly of antiparallel β-strands organized in a coherent domain. Heating to 92 and 112 °C was required to dissociate the MspA tetramer and to unfold the β-sheet domain in the monomer, respectively. The stability of the MspA tetramer exceeded the remarkable stability of the porins of Gram-negative bacteria for every condition tested and was not reduced in the presence of 2% SDS and at any pH from 2 to 14. These results indicated that the interactions between the MspA subunits are different from those in the porins of Gram-negative bacteria and are discussed in the light of a channel-forming β-barrel as a core structure of MspA. Surprisingly, the channel activity of MspA in 2% SDS and 7.6m urea at 50 °C was reduced 13- and 30-fold, respectively, although the MspA tetramer and the β-sheet domain were stable under those conditions. Channel closure by conformational changes of extracellular loops under those conditions is discussed to explain these observations. This study presents the first experimental evidence that outer membrane proteins not only from Gram-negative bacteria but also from mycobacteria are β-sheet proteins and demonstrates that MspA constitutes the most stable transmembrane channel protein known so far.

This is of particular medical importance in the case ofMycobacterium tuberculosis, because it strongly limits the number of drugs available for treatment of tuberculosis (1Kremer L.S. Besra G.S. Exp. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 11: 1033-1049Google Scholar). The central part of the mycobacterial cell wall is an asymmetrical bilayer (2Nikaido H. Kim S.H. Rosenberg E.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1025-1030Google Scholar), consisting of an inner leaflet of very long-chain fatty acids, the mycolic acids, and of many other unusual lipids, which form the outer leaflet (3Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Google Scholar). This outer membrane is of exceptionally low fluidity (4Liu J. Barry III, C.E. Besra G.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29545-29551Google Scholar) and is estimated to be about 10 nm thick (5Paul T.R. Beveridge T.J. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 1993; 279: 450-457Google Scholar, 6Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). Pore-forming proteins mediate the uptake of hydrophilic compounds across this outer membrane. The existence of such porins in mycobacteria was discovered 10 years ago (7Trias J. Jarlier V. Benz R. Science. 1992; 258: 1479-1481Google Scholar), but only two mycobacterial porins were identified so far. OmpATb of M. tuberculosis has low channel activity in vitro (8Senaratne R.H. Mobasheri H. Papavinasasundaram K.G. Jenner P. Lea E.J. Draper P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3541-3547Google Scholar) and is important for the adaptation of M. tuberculosis to low pH and for survival in macrophages and mice (9Raynaud C. Papavinasasundaram K.G. Speight R.A. Springer B. Sander P. Bottger E.C. Colston M.J. Draper P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 191-201Google Scholar). MspA was identified as a channel-forming protein in chloroform/methanol extracts of Mycobacterium smegmatis(10Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that MspA is the major porin of M. smegmatis. The permeability of the cell wall of M. smegmatis for glucose is reduced 4-fold in anmspA deletion mutant (11Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 451-464Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and cross-linking experiments revealed that MspA is a tetrameric protein forming a central pore of 10 nm length (12Engelhardt H. Heinz C. Niederweis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37567-37572Google Scholar). This is drastically different from the trimeric porins of Gram-negative bacteria, which have three pores per molecule and are 4 nm long (13Koebnik R. Locher K.P. van Gelder P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 239-253Google Scholar). These properties classify MspA as the prototype of a new family of pore proteins, since three other porins MspB, MspC, and MspD were identified in M. smegmatis, which differ only by a few amino acids from MspA (11Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 451-464Google Scholar). Crystal structures of outer membrane proteins from Gram-negative bacteria revealed a β-barrel as a common architectural principle (13Koebnik R. Locher K.P. van Gelder P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 239-253Google Scholar, 14Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Google Scholar, 15Vandeputte-Rutten L. Kramer R.A. Kroon J. Dekker N. Egmond M.R. Gros P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5033-5039Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the secondary structure of mycobacterial outer membrane proteins in general and of mycobacterial porins in particular. It was noted earlier that MspA, which was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis, did not dissociate in the presence of denaturing agents such as urea or after boiling in detergents (10Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Google Scholar). Selective extraction of functional MspA by extended heating of entire cells ofM. smegmatis in the presence of nonionic detergents to 100 °C indicated that MspA is indeed a very stable channel-forming protein (16Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Google Scholar). Since a stable pore protein would be of great value as a detection unit in biosensors (17Bayley H. Cremer P.S. Nature. 2001; 413: 226-230Google Scholar) and as a nanoreactor for synthesis of nanoparticles and nanowires (18Niederweis M. Heinz C. Janik K. Bossmann S.H. Nano Lett. 2002; 2: 1263-1268Google Scholar), a biochemical analysis of purified MspA is needed to correlate the oligomer stability with its functional activity. In this study, we investigated the secondary structure of MspA by circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy. Despite the drastically different architecture compared with porins of Gram-negative bacteria, antiparallel β-sheets were identified as the main secondary structure elements of MspA similar to those of other porins. We found that the β-sheet structure of purified MspA is extremely stable against denaturation. Furthermore, tetrameric MspA withstands proteases and very acidic and basic conditions. This biochemical analysis of a mycobacterial porin revealed exceptional properties of a new class of channel-forming proteins. Chemicals were obtained from Merck, Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), or Sigma (München, Germany) at the highest purity available. The detergents SDS andn-octylpolyoxyethylene (octyl-POE)1 were from SERVA (Heidelberg, Germany) and Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. Trypsin was from Sigma. Proteinase K was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Native MspA was extracted from M. smegmatis mc2155 using a buffer containing 0.5% octyl-POE and purified as described (16Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Google Scholar). MspA eluted from the anion exchange column at 0.57 m NaCl and was separated from another porin in the extracts, MspC, which eluted at 1.3 m NaCl (19Heinz C. Roth E. Niederweis M. Selinsky B.S. Membrane Protein Protocols: Expression, Purification, and Crystallization. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003Google Scholar). Pure MspA was finally stored in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% octyl-POE (NaP-OPOE buffer). Porin preparations were analyzed for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and for channel-forming activity by lipid bilayer measurements. Recombinant MspA (rMspA) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 from the expression vector pMN501, and the monomeric form of rMspA was chromatographically purified (to be published elsewhere). Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid (20Smith P.K. Krohn I.R. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar) and bovine serum albumin as standards. CD spectra of MspA were measured at a protein concentration of 0.26 mg/ml in NaP-OPOE buffer using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd.) and a cuvette with an optical path length of 1 mm. The sample volume was 350 μl. Buffer base lines were measured under identical conditions and subtracted from the spectra. The raw data, obtained as ellipticity, Θ, were smoothed using the standard analysis program (Jasco). These data were transformed to mean residue molar ellipticity [Θ]MRW by the equation [Θ]MRW = Θ × M r/10,000 × n× c g × l, whereM r denotes the molecular mass of the protein,n is the number of residues, c g is the concentration of the protein in g/ml, and l is the cell path in cm (from technical report No. 44, European Chirality Services; available on the World Wide Web at digilander.libero.it/ecssrl. 100 μg of MspA in NaP-OPOE buffer was either dialyzed for 2 days against water or 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to remove the detergent. The protein remained soluble due to the formation of ordered supramolecular assemblies (12Engelhardt H. Heinz C. Niederweis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37567-37572Google Scholar). Samples were dried onto a germanium crystal, which was mounted in a self-constructed device allowing a subsequent proton-deuterium (H-D) exchange. Spectra were recorded with a Nicolet 740 FTIR spectrometer from 4000 to 600 cm−1 applying the ATR technique. H-D exchange was performed by flushing the sample with D2O-saturated nitrogen for 60 min. The kinetic of deuteration was monitored by taking spectra every 1–5 min and judged by shifts of the amide I and amide II bands. Final spectra were means of 512 scans at a resolution of better than 2 cm−1. For heat denaturation studies, MspA was suspended in 5 μl of D2O at a concentration of about 6 mg/ml. The incubation took place in a gas-tight chamber equipped with CaF2windows and Peltier elements, which allow the application of temperatures from 1 °C to beyond 100 °C without loss of liquid. Spectra were recorded every 10 °C in the range between 30 and 110 °C. The secondary structure composition was assessed using secondary derivatives and Fourier self-deconvolution for peak determination (21Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Google Scholar), and algorithms were implemented in the IGOR Pro 4.0 wave analysis software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) for constrained band fitting and quantitative analysis. Samples of 1 μg of MspA (concentration = 25 ng/μl) in NaP-OPOE buffer were incubated for 15 min at temperatures ranging from 20 to 100 °C, followed by rapid cooling to 4 °C. Temperatures were increased in 10 °C steps using a thermal cycler (Mastercycler gradient; Eppendorf), which maintained temperatures within a range of ±0.2 °C. The upper temperature limit was given as 99 °C by the manufacturer and approximated 100 °C in Figs. 1 and 2. Samples of 1 μg of MspA (concentration = 25 ng/μl) in NaP-OPOE buffer were supplemented to final concentrations of 2% SDS or 7.6 m urea and incubated as described above. Urea was removed by dialysis against 400 ml of NaP-OPOE buffer for 12 h at room temperature to avoid band broadening in polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoretic analysis of urea-containing MspA samples without prior dialysis in 6 m urea gels yielded the same result for the stability of MspA, indicating that dialysis did not lead to a detectable refolding of denatured MspA. Samples containing 800 ng of MspA were loaded on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and stained as indicated. The stability of purified MspA at different pH values was analyzed using samples of 500 ng of MspA in NaP-OPOE buffer, which were diluted 10-fold in the following solutions to a final concentration of 25 ng/μl and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C. The pH values were adjusted as described (22Schindler M. Rosenbusch J.P. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 85-89Google Scholar) by 1, 0.1, and 0.01m HCl to pH 0, 1, and 2, respectively; 20 mmglycine/HCl to pH 3; 20 mm sodium citrate/citric acid to pH 4, 5, and 6; 20 mm HEPES/NaOH to pH 7 and 8; 20 mm glycine/NaOH to pH 9–11; and 0.01, 0.1, and 1m NaOH to pH 12, 13, and 14, respectively. The stability of MspA in crude extracts at different pH values was analyzed using samples of 2 μl of crude extract of M. smegmatismc2155 in POP05 buffer (100 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) octyl-POE, pH 6.5), (16Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Google Scholar). The samples were mixed with 18 μl of the same buffers as for pure MspA and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C. The proteins in these samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and the channel activity was determined by lipid bilayer measurements as described below.Figure 2Thermal stability of the MspA tetramer.Samples of 1 μg of purified MspA (25 ng/μl) were incubated for 15 min at different temperatures, which are indicated above thelanes in degrees centigrade. 800 ng of MspA of each sample was analyzed using a silver-stained denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel.Lane M, molecular mass marker; lane C, untreated MspA as a control (800 ng). The gel was scanned and quantitatively analyzed using the program NIH Image 1.62. It should be noted that the MspA monomer was stained 1.5-fold more efficiently with silver than the tetramer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Protein samples were analyzed in denaturing polyacrylamide gels, which were stained with silver (16Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Google Scholar). All samples were mixed with loading buffer (140 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, pH 7.5) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before loading on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar) if not stated otherwise. For quantitative analysis of the stability experiments, the gels were scanned, and relative protein amounts were determined from the gel images using the densitometry plugin of the program NIH Image 1.62 (available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). The brightness and the global gradation curve of the images were adjusted to reduce the background of the figures. No parts of the gels were changed individually. The midpoint of thermal transition of MspA (T d50) was defined as the temperature at which the amount of tetrameric MspA was reduced by 50% as compared with that at 20 °C. The channel activity of selected samples was measured in lipid bilayer experiments as described (16Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Google Scholar). In all lipid bilayer experiments, the lipid bilayer was made from diphytanoyl-phosphatidylcholine, and the aqueous phase contained 1m KCl and 10 mm 2-MES buffer (pH 6.0). The temperature was kept at 20 °C using a thermostat. MspA extracts were incubated at different pH values and subsequently diluted 100-fold with the extraction buffer (16Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Google Scholar) for the pH stability experiments. The MspA concentration in the cuvette was estimated to 25 pg/ml. At least 60 MspA pores in four membranes were recorded in each single channel experiment. To determine the influence of heat, SDS, or urea on the pore forming activity of MspA, samples of 1 μg of MspA (concentration = 25 ng/μl) were incubated at different temperatures for 15 min in NaP-OPOE buffer without additional agents and in the presence of 2% SDS and 7.6 m urea. After incubation, the samples were diluted with NaP-OPOE buffer to a final concentration of 15.7 pg/μl MspA. Then 78.5 pg of MspA from each sample was added to the KCl solution bathing the black lipid membranes. The final concentration of MspA in the bilayer cuvette was 7.8 pg/ml. Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Fluorolog-1680 double spectrometer (SPEX Industries, Inc.) using an excitation and emission bandpass of 3.6 nm. An internal rhodamine B standard (Eastman Kodak Co.) was used to correct intensity fluctuations of the xenon arc lamp. MspA samples (13 μg, concentration = 10 μg/ml) were incubated in the presence of 7.6m urea for 15 min at temperatures increasing in 10 °C steps from 30 to 100 °C. The samples were cooled to 22 °C, and this temperature was maintained throughout the measurement. Fluorescence of MspA was excited at 280 nm, and emission was recorded from 282 to 492 nm. The midpoint of thermal transition of MspA (T d50) in the presence of urea was defined as the temperature where the maximal fluorescence intensity of MspA was 50% of that at 30 °C. Tetrameric MspA (15 μg, concentration = 0.6 μg/μl) was treated with trypsin and proteinase K in 25 mm NaP-OPOE buffer. Monomeric rMspA (15 μg, concentration = 0.6 μg/μl) was incubated with the same proteases in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), which did not contain any detergents. The enzyme/protein ratio was 1:25 and 1:5 (w/w). All protease reactions were performed at 37 °C for 1.5 or 12 h. As a control, MspA was incubated under the same conditions, but the proteases were omitted. Digests were stopped by adding 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Pefabloc SC; Roche Diagnostics) to a final concentration of 2 mm, which irreversibly blocks serine proteases such as trypsin and proteinase K. Samples were then mixed with loading buffer and loaded on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and MspA was detected using the polyclonal antiserum pAK#813 (10Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Google Scholar), a secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma), and the ECLplus kit (Amersham Biosciences). The major porin of M. smegmatis, MspA, was selectively extracted by boiling entire cells for 30 min in a buffer containing 0.5% octyl-POE, precipitated with acetone to remove lipids, and subsequently purified by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography to remove contaminating small compounds and proteins as described earlier (16Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Google Scholar). This approach is currently the only method that yields apparently pure MspA in milligram quantities. Since the tetrameric MspA pore has a projection structure drastically different from that of other porins (12Engelhardt H. Heinz C. Niederweis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37567-37572Google Scholar) and is the first outer membrane protein isolated from mycobacteria that is amenable to structural investigations, the secondary structure of purified MspA was analyzed. Circular dichroism spectra showed a large positive mean molar ellipticity below 205 nm, a crossover point at 206 nm, at which the ellipticity equaled zero, and a single minimum at 215 nm (Fig.1 A). These features are typical of β-sheet structures (24Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Google Scholar) and were similar to those obtained for β-barrel proteins such as the porins of Gram-negative bacteria (22Schindler M. Rosenbusch J.P. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 85-89Google Scholar). IR spectroscopy is known to yield a particularly reliable estimate of the β-sheet content of proteins (25Pribic R. van Stokkum I.H. Chapman D. Haris P.I. Bloemendal M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 366-378Google Scholar). Therefore, IR absorbance spectra of MspA were analyzed for the spectral components of the amide I band region (1700–1600 cm−1), which is indicative for the secondary structure of proteins (26Susi H. Byler D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 465-469Google Scholar), and compared with that of porin Omp32 from Delftia (Comamonas)acidovorans. The latter has a β-sheet content of 61% as derived from its atomic structure (27Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Google Scholar). IR spectral analysis of Omp32 yielded a β-sheet content of 59%, in excellent agreement with the structural data. IR spectra of MspA showed a peak around 1632 cm−1 (Fig. 1 B), which is typical for proteins with predominant β-structure. Fourier self-deconvolution for band positioning and subsequent fit of corresponding absorption bands to MspA spectra taken after hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange followed by quantitative analysis revealed a secondary structure composition of 48–52% β-sheet, 10–15% α-helix, and remaining structure composed of β-turns and random folds. The lower relative content of β-structure in MspA compared with that of porin Omp32 is consistent with a less prominent peak at 1632 cm−1 (Fig.1 B). The small peak at 1692 cm−1 in the IR spectrum is indicative of antiparallel β-sheets (26Susi H. Byler D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 465-469Google Scholar) and very similar to spectra of porins from Gram-negative bacteria. Secondary structure predictions based on the MspA sequence and calculated using seven different algorithms yielded a consensus assessment containing about 45% β-structure and 10% α-helix, in agreement with the IR spectra. Taken together, IR and CD spectroscopy consistently indicated β-sheets as the main secondary structure elements of MspA. Since earlier experiments indicated a very high thermal stability of MspA (10Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Google Scholar, 16Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Google Scholar), we wanted to examine whether the resistance of the MspA tetramer against dissociation correlated with the stability of its secondary structure and its channel activity. Our first aim was to precisely determine the thermal stability of MspA in the nonionic detergent octyl-POE, which was used for purification. MspA (25 ng/μl) was incubated for 15 min at different temperatures and electrophoretically analyzed. Fig. 2shows that MspA tetramers with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa were detected after incubation at 100 °C, illustrating that even boiling is not sufficient to completely denature MspA. Thus, the temperature required for complete conversion of MspA to monomers is at least 25 °C higher than that of trimer dissociation of the E. coli porin OmpF, which dissociated completely at about 75 °C and is considered to be an extremely stable protein (28Markovic-Housley Z. Garavito R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 158-170Google Scholar, 29Phale P.S. Philippsen A. Kiefhaber T. Koebnik R. Phale V.P. Schirmer T. Rosenbusch J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15663-15670Google Scholar). Quantitative image analysis of the gels revealed that about 50% of the MspA tetramers were dissociated at 92 °C (TableI). It should be noted that we did not detect the MspA monomer in octyl-POE extracts after heatingM. smegmatis cells to 100 °C for 30 min (16Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Google Scholar), indicating that a stabilizing factor was lost during the subsequent purification steps. The addition of SDS to a final concentration of 2% to the purified MspA tetramer did not significantly reduce its thermal stability (Table I) in contrast to OmpF, whose midpoint of thermal transition was reduced to 59 °C in the presence of SDS (28Markovic-Housley Z. Garavito R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 158-170Google Scholar).Table IThermal stability of MspA in the presence of denaturing agentsSDS-PAGETM/°CAgentTd1/°CTd50/°CTd100/°CFluorescenceIRNone∼8092>100ND1122% SDS∼8088>100ND1087.6 murea∼7089>9084NDT d1, T d50, andT d100 were defined as temperatures at which the band of monomeric MspA started to appear, the intensity of the band of tetrameric MspA was reduced to 50%, and no tetrameric MspA was detected anymore, respectively. These temperatures were determined by quantitative image analysis, using the software NIH Image 1.62, of silver-stained, denaturing polyacrylamide gels (see Figs. 2 and5 A). The temperature at which the β-sheet content (Fig. 3) and the intensity of the fluorescence maximum (Fig. 5 B) were decreased to 50% was defined as T M and is equivalent to the temperature T d50 derived from gel electrophoresis. Due to experimental limitations, IR (infrared) spectra could not be recorded at temperatures above 110 °C, and no IR spectra of fully denatured MspA were measured. Therefore, the formal β-sheet content of denatured MspA was estimated to 5%, similar to that of other proteins (H. Engelhardt, unpublished data). The denaturation curve of MspA without SDS was extrapolated to determineT M. ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab T d1, T d50, andT d100 were defined as temperatures at which the band of monomeric MspA started to appear, the intensity of the band of tetrameric MspA was reduced to 50%, and no tetrameric MspA was detected anymore, respectively. These temperatures were determined by quantitative image analysis, using the software NIH Image 1.62, of silver-stained, denaturing polyacrylamide gels (see Figs. 2 and5 A). The temperature at which the β-sheet content (Fig. 3) and the intensity of the fluorescence maximum (Fig. 5 B) were decreased to 50% was defined as T M and is equivalent to the temperature T d50 derived from gel electrophoresis. Due to experimental limitations, IR (infrared) spectra could not be recorded at temperatures above 110 °C, and no IR spectra of fully denatured MspA were measured. Therefore, the formal β-sheet content of denatured MspA was estimated to 5%, similar to that of other proteins (H. Engelhardt, unpublished data). The denaturation curve of MspA without SDS was extrapolated to determineT M. ND, not determined. Next, we examined whether the secondary structure of the MspA tetramer was affected at temperatures close to 100 °C, where gel electrophoresis showed that the MspA tetramer resisted dissociation into monomers even in the presence of denaturing agents. An MspA sample dissolved in D2O was incubated for 15–20 min in a special thermochamber at temperatures increasing in steps of 10 °C and in steps of 3 °C above 100 °C. IR spectra were recorded at each selected temperature (Fig.3 A). At 30 °C, the maximum of the amide I band in the IR spectrum appeared at 1634 cm−1 and was constant up to ∼80 °C. The peak position of the amide I band increased slightly up to ∼100 °C and shifted drastically to higher wave numbers above ∼100 °C, indicating the temperature-induced unfolding of MspA (Fig. 3, A andB). The amide I band region of the deconvoluted spectra was analyzed for fractional intensities of the secondary structure elements by curve fitting of spectral components as described above. The changes of the β-sheet content of MspA with increasing temperatures are depicted in Fig. 3 B. At 30 °C, curve fitting yielded a β-sheet content of 45%, in good agreement with the ATR-FTIR spectrum shown above (Fig. 1 B). The β-strand content decreased slightly to a relative amount of 40% at 100 °C but dropped sharply at temperatures above ∼100 °C, indicating denaturation of the protein. Thus, both the peak position of the amide I band and the calculated β-sheet content consistently indicated unfolding of MspA at temperatures above ∼100 °C. The addition of 2% SDS to MspA did not lead to visible differences in the IR spectra as compared with those depicted in Fig. 3 A.

Recent research has linked uncontrolled calpain activation to tissue damage after neuronal and cardiac ischemias, traumatic spine and brain injuries, as well as Alzheimer's disease and cataract formation. An imbalance between the activities of calpain and calpastatin is believed to be responsible for the pathological role of calpain. An important key to understanding calpain regulation by calpastatin is to determine, at the molecular level, how calpastatin interacts with calpain to inhibit its enzymatic activity. A 27-residue peptide (DPMSSTYIEELGKREVTIPPKYRELLA) derived from subdomain 1B of the repetitive domains of calpain, named peptide B27-WT, was previously shown to be a potent inhibitor of μ- and m-calpain. In this report, a combination of β-alanine scanning mutagenesis and kinetic measurements was used to probe, in a quantitative, systematic, and simultaneous fashion, the relative contribution of the amino acid side chain and backbone functionalities to the overall calpain-inhibitory activity of B27-WT. The study identified two “hot spots,” Leu11-Gly12 and Thr17-Ile18-Pro19, in B27-WT within which the residues critical for inhibitory function are clustered. Mutation of any one of the key residues in either of the two hot spots resulted in a dramatic loss of inhibitory activity. Furthermore, it was shown that a restricted conformation of the Leu11-Gly12 and Thr17-Ile18-Pro19 backbones is required for the peptide inhibitory function. These results suggest a plausible model in which the two hot spots are situated at or near the interface(s) of the calpain-calpastatin complex and act in a concerted fashion to inhibit calpain. The information on the specific contribution of the amide bond and side chain of each key residue to the bioactivity of B27-WT will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of calpain inhibition and lead to novel and effective therapies based on the specific inhibition of dysregulated or overactivated calpain.

The consequences of uncontrolled calpain activation have been witnessed in certain pathological conditions associated with excessive increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels, namely, in tissue destruction after spine and brain injuries, neuronal injury after cardiac and brain ischemia, demyelination diseases (multiple sclerosis), muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, and cataract formation (5James T.

Allen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 187-196Google Scholar). There are two well established calpain isoforms, μ- andm-calpain,1 which are ubiquitously expressed and require micro- and millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ to reach maximal activity, respectively, in vitro. The classical μ- andm-calpains exist as heterodimers consisting of a large (80-kDa) catalytic subunit and a small (28-kDa) regulatory subunit that dissociates in the presence of calcium (7Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 587: 101-103Google Scholar, 8Pal G.P. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47233-47238Google Scholar, 9Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S.

Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Google Scholar). The activity of calpain is tightly regulated through Ca2+-induced conformational changes in the proteinase and by interaction with its specific endogenous inhibitor calpastatin (11De Tullio R. Passalacqua M. Averna M. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 467-472Google Scholar, 12Averna M. De Tullio R. Passalacqua M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Biochem.

Modulation of calpain activity by phospholipids and protein activators has also been reported (14Molinari M. Carafoli E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 1-8Google Scholar). Calpain and calpastatin are widely distributed in all animal cells, with calpastatin in excess of calpain in erythrocytes and heart muscle (1Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 455-481Google Scholar, 14Molinari M. Carafoli E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 1-8Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that calpastatin resides predominantly in phosphorylated-aggregated bodies, with the inhibitor protein being dephosphorylated and distributed in a Ca2+-dependent manner (11De Tullio R. Passalacqua M. Averna M. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 467-472Google Scholar, 12Averna M. De Tullio R. Passalacqua M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 25-30Google Scholar). This observation demonstrates the vigorous regulation placed on the calpain-calpastatin system whereby both enzyme and inhibitor are under strict Ca2+ control. The primary structure of calpastatin is divided into four repeating inhibitory domains (domains 1–4) and an NH2-terminal domain that lacks inhibitory function (domain L) (6, 15–19; see Fig.1). The function of domain L is not clear, although it has been suggested that this domain may play a role in regulating calcium ion channels (16Hao L.-Y. Kameyama A. Kuroki S. Takano J. Takano E. Maki M. Kameyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 756-761Google Scholar). Inside each repetitive domain are three conserved subdomains referred to as A, B, and C. Subdomains A and C are rich in acidic residues that are scattered among hydrophobic residues and are predicted to form amphiphilic α-helices. It has been established, using the BIAcore™ surface plasmon resonance technology, that subdomain A binds to domain IV of the catalytic subunit of calpain, whereas subdomain C binds to domain VI in the regulatory subunit (17Yang H.Q. Ma H. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18977-18984Google Scholar, 18Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol.

Although neither subdomain A nor C inhibits calpain activity directly, these subdomains do act to potentiate the inhibitory ability of calpastatin by promoting its tight binding to calpain (14Molinari M. Carafoli E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 1-8Google Scholar,17Yang H.Q. Ma H. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18977-18984Google Scholar, 18Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M.

Previous studies using bacterially expressed calpastatin fragments have established that the inhibitory activity of calpastatin resides in subdomain B of the repeating structures (domains 1–4) (15Maki M.

Minami Y. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 274-281Google Scholar). Moreover, a chemically synthesized 27-residue peptide corresponding to subdomain 1B of human calpastatin showed strong inhibition against μ- and m-calpain, although to a slightly lesser extent than a whole functional domain 1 of calpastatin (18Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24430-24436Google Scholar). The subdomain 1B peptide, which we have named peptide B27-WT (see Fig. 2 A), bears no regular secondary structures such as α-helix and β-sheets; however, 1H NMR studies of B27-WT have shown the presence of a well defined type I β-turn in the Pro20-Lys21-Tyr22-Arg23region and probably another turn in the Glu10-Leu11-Gly12-Lys13region (21Ishima R. Tamura A. Akasaka K. Hamaguchi K. Makino K. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. Maki M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 64-66Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these β-turns could play an important role in mediating the biological activity of the peptide.Figure 2A, alignment of amino acid sequences of B27-WT and its β-Ala analogs. A library consisting of peptide B27-WT (derived from subdomain 1B of human calpastatin) and 27 β-Ala mutants was synthesized; only selected examples of the mutant peptides are shown in this figure. The nomenclature for the library is specified on the right of the figure. The mutant peptides are numbered β-Ala1–β-Ala27 starting at the NH2 terminus. The peptide with no structural modification was named B27-WT and, for example, the peptide with Pro19replaced by β-Ala was named B27-β-Ala19. B, NH2-terminally truncated fragments of B27-WT. Truncated peptides were generated starting with an 11-mer (CLP-1) that contains only the type I β-turn. The residues linking the type I and type II β-turns were added two at a time (CLP-2 and -3) until Gly-12 (CLP-4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An important key to understanding calpain function and regulation is to determine, at the molecular level, how calpastatin interacts with calpain to inhibit its enzymatic activity. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies on Ca2+-free μ- andm-calpain, as well as the Ca2+-bound protease core (domains I and II) of μ-calpain have provided very important insights into possible mechanisms by which calpain could be activated by Ca2+ (9Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Google Scholar, 13Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Google Scholar, 24Strobl S.

However, no crystal structures or molecular modeling data are available for the calpain-calpastatin complex. Even though calpastatin subdomain B or peptide B27-WT was shown to be responsible for calpain inhibition, no rigorous structure-function analysis has been performed to examine the individual contributions of each amino acid residue to the overall inhibitory activity. Because this type of study is absolutely critical to establish a detailed understanding of the mechanism employed by B27-WT to inhibit calpain, we embarked on a study that would identify the structural elements in the peptide which are important for calpain inhibition. This was accomplished by using “β-alanine scanning” mutagenesis to determine the effect of site-specific amide bond and/or side chain modifications on the biological activity of B27-WT. Porcine erythrocyte calpain I was purchased fromCalbiochem. Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC was obtained from Sigma. Fmoc-protected amino acids, Fmoc-Ala-Wang resin, piperidine, DIPEA, HBTU, and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, KY). Dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran were purchased from Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon, MI) and used without further purification. All other reagents were of analytical grade. The 27-residue calpastatin- (162–188)-peptide (B27-WT, DPMSSTYIEELGKREVTIPPKYRELLA) encoded by exon 1B of the human calpastatin gene (25Asada K. Ishiro Y. Shimada M. Shimojo T. Endo M. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1989; 3: 49-56Google Scholar) and its β-Ala-containing analogs (B27-β-Ala-X) were synthesized using a multiple peptide synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech, model 348Ω) using Fmoc/t-butyl chemistry. All peptides were synthesized on 150 mg (0.12 mmol) of preloaded Fmoc-Ala-Wang resin (0.8 mmol/g; 100–200 mesh). N-α-Fmoc deprotection was performed with 25% piperidine in dimethylformamide followed by washing with tetrahydrofuran (4 × 3 ml) and dimethylformamide (2 × 3 ml). The Fmoc-amino acids were activated with 0.9 eq of HBTU and 2 eq of DIPEA and coupled for 45 min using a 5-fold excess of activated amino acids. Side chain protecting groups used were (t-butyl) for Asp, Glu, Ser, Thr, and Tyr; (Pbf) for Arg; (t-butoxycarbonyl) for Lys. Side chain deprotection and cleavage of peptides from the resin were performed with 3 ml of trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of phenol/ethanedithiol/thioanisole/water (82.5:5:5:2.5:5, v/v). The crude peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C18column (10 μm, 250 × 50 mm; Grace Vydac, Hisperia, CA) using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (buffer A) to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (buffer B) over 100 min. Analytical reverse phase HPLC was performed on a Jupiter C5(10 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a 60-min gradient or a Discovery series C18 (5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm; Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA) using a 40-min gradient of 100% buffer A to 100% buffer B. Beckman System Gold equipment (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) was used for preparative HPLC, and analytical HPLC was performed with a Waters model 600E apparatus (Waters, Inc., Milford, MA). The purity of the peptides was confirmed by electrospray ionization and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. The concentrations of the peptide solutions used for the calpain inhibition studies were determined by amino acid analysis performed at the University of Michigan Protein Structure Facility (Ann Arbor, MI). Calpain activity was monitored using two different types of substrates: Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC and fluorescein thiocarbamoyl-casein (FTC-casein). The AMC fluorophore moiety of Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC has negligible fluorescence when its amino group is involved in an amide bond with the peptidyl portion (Suc-Leu-Tyr) of the substrate. Upon cleavage of the Tyr-AMC amide bond by calpain, the released AMC product, with a free amino functionality, emits a strong fluorescence signal at 460 nm when excited at 370 nm. Fluorescence emitted by the fluorescein groups on FTC-casein (∼ 3:1, number of probes/molecule of casein) is quenched through fluorescence resonance energy transfer because of the close proximity of the probes (10–100Å) on the intact substrate. An increase in fluorescence intensity is detected when FTC-casein is digested by calpain to produce fluorescein-labeled polypeptides that are distant from each other in solution. Rapid kinetic measurements of calpain inhibition by B27-WT in the presence of either Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC or FTC-casein were performed by stopped-flow fluorometry on an SX.18MV Stopped-Flow Reaction Analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Surrey, UK). The stopped-flow experiments were carried out under pseudo-first order conditions with B27-WT in at least 5-fold excess over calpain. Buffer conditions were as follows. Buffer C contained 20 mm HEPES, 130 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Buffer D contained 20 mm HEPES, 130 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Two separate experiments were carried out to determine the dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constant,k obs, on inhibitor concentration using either Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC or FTC-casein. A third experiment examined the dependence of k obs on Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC concentration. In the first set of experiments, the rate of calpain-mediated hydrolysis of Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC was monitored at various concentrations of inhibitor. Excitation was at 370 nm, and a filter with a cutoff below 405 nm was used to monitor the emission of liberated AMC. Calpain was prepared at twice the final reaction concentration (50 nm) in buffer C, and twice the final reaction concentration of Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC (0.2 mm) was prepared in buffer D. Various concentrations of inhibitor were premixed with substrate in buffer D to achieve final inhibitor concentrations between 0.1 and 1.1 μm. A second set of experiments was carried out in which FTC-casein was used as substrate to determine the dependence ofk obs on inhibitor concentration. Fluorescein was excited at 490 nm, and a filter with a cutoff below 505 nm was used to observe fluorescence emission. 20 nm calpain and 1.0 μm FTC-casein in buffer C (syringe 1) were rapidly reacted with 1.0 μm FTC-casein and various concentrations of B27-WT in buffer D (syringe 2) to final concentrations of 10 nm calpain, 1 μm FTC-casein, and peptide B27-WT (0.05–2.5 μm). The final concentration of substrate (1.0 μm) was prepared in both buffer C and D to prevent any change in fluorescence resonance energy transfer caused by dilution in the reaction cell. For the third set of experiments, 1 μm B27-WT and 50 nm calpain concentrations were fixed, and the concentration of Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC was varied between 0.05 and 1.0 mm in the final reaction mixture. The filter settings were the same as in the first set of experiments. The second order rate constant, ka, of B27-WT-μ-calpain complex formation was determined under pseudo-first order conditions as described previously and could be best fit to Equation 1 (26Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Google Scholar), [P]=vst+(v0−vs)(1−e−kobst)/kobsEquation 1 where [P] is the product concentration, andv 0 and v s are the initial and steady-state velocities, respectively. k obsis the pseudo-first order rate constant for the approach to steady state and is described by Equation 2 (26Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Google Scholar).kobs=ka[I]/1+[S0])/Km+kdEquation 2 The Michaelis constants (Km) for calpain-catalyzed hydrolysis of Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC (3.29 ± 0.18 mm) and FTC-casein (13.12 ± 5.55 μm) were determined experimentally using standard Lineweaver-Burk plots with substrate concentrations of 0.1–4 mm and 0.5–8 μm for Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC and FTC-casein, respectively (data not shown). All stopped-flow traces were best fit by a single exponential function with a linear component to obtaink obs and are reported as the averages of 6–10 replicate traces. The functional inhibitor concentration was determined by dividing experimental inhibitor concentration by the factor 1 + [S0]/Km to correct for the competitive effect of the substrate. The second order association rate constant (ka) was calculated from the slope of the linear regression fit to the dependence ofk obs on the corrected inhibitor concentration, and the ordinate intercept gave the first order dissociation rate constant (kd). For the substrate dependence reaction, ka was calculated from the slope of the linear regression fit to the dependence ofk obs on 1/(1 + [So]/Km) divided by the concentration of B27-WT (1.0 μm), and the ordinate intercept gave kd. The equilibrium constantKi (calculated) was calculated askd/ka. The effects of single amino acid modifications on the calpain-inhibitory activity of the library of β-Ala-containing B27-WT analogs were evaluated using steady-state fluorescence measurements. Various concentrations of the inhibitor peptides in 20 μl of assay buffer (20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 130 mm KCl) and 0.76 μg of calpain in 10 μl of assay buffer were added to microtiter wells. After the solutions were mixed for 5 min, 65 μl of assay buffer containing 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm dithiothreitol was added, yielding a final concentration of 1.0 mmCa2+, 0.05 mg/ml calpain, and 3.4 mmdithiothreitol. The enzyme-inhibitor complex was allowed to form while shaking the reaction mixture in the microtiter plate over a 15-min period, at which time 5.0 μl of a 6 mm Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC solution was added to reach a final substrate concentration of 300 μm. Residual calpain activity in the enzyme-inhibitor complex was determined by measuring the fluorescence increase over time resulting from the Ca2+-dependent hydrolysis of Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC, using a Fluoroscan Ascent FL microtiter plate reader (Labsystems, Inc.). The percent enzyme inhibition was determined by comparing the activity of the inhibitor-treated enzyme with that of a control reaction without inhibitor. The residual activities reported are the average of six to eight individual reactions for each inhibitor concentration tested. IC50 values (inhibitor concentration required for half-maximal inhibitory activity) were determined after dose-response curve analysis. Data were analyzed with the Ascent software version 2.4.1 provided with the instrument and a SigmaPlot 2001 software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago). The Ca2+/calpastatin peptide-treated calpain samples were also analyzed by gel electrophoresis. 2 μm calpain was incubated with various concentrations of B27-WT or 50 μmB27-β-Ala-X mutant in the presence or absence of Ca2+ for 15 min. The reactions were terminated by adding equal volumes of 2 × sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 4% w/v SDS, 10% v/v β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8), followed by heating the samples at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were stored at −20 °C until ready to be analyzed. SDS-PAGE was performed using the buffer system described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Gels were stained with GelCode® Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce), and band intensities were analyzed by densitometry (Bio-Rad GelDoc model 2000). A 27-residue human calpastatin subdomain 1B (162–188) peptide (named B27-WT, DPMSSTYIEELGKREVTIPPKYRELLA) was selected for this study. B27-WT and a library of B27-WT analogs containing specific positional modifications, a β-Ala substitution (β-alanine scan), as shown in Fig. 2 A, were synthesized. A group of NH2-terminally truncated fragments of B27-WT was also generated (Fig. 2 B). The synthetic peptides were purified to near homogeneity by HPLC, and their molecular weights were confirmed by electrospray ionization and/or MALDI mass spectrometry (Table I). No contamination by modified or incompletely deprotected peptides was detected after final purification.Table IAnalysis of the synthetic peptides for purity and for calpain inhibitory activityPeptide inhibitorExpected MassObserved Mass [M + H]+Retention time on C18 (C5) RP-HPLC columnCategory of inhibitory activitya+++, strong inhibition; ++, moderate inhibition; +, very moderate inhibition; −, weak inhibition; −−, very weak inhibition; −−−, no inhibition.Concentration of peptide required for 50% inhibitionResidue replaced with βAlag/molg/molminnMB27-WT3136.643137.50(43.68)+++33NoneB27-β-Ala13092.633093.4130.34 (43.80)++99Asp1B27-β-Ala23110.603111.3930.70 (42.65)+++36Pro2B27-β-Ala33076.523077.3430.07 (42.17)+++37Met3B27-β-Ala43120.633121.59(42.61)+++27Ser4B27-β-Ala53120.633121.55(42.65)+++36Ser5B27-β-Ala63106.603107.0831.07 (42.89)++59Thr6B27-β-Ala73044.543049.3830.87 (42.63)+108Tyr7B27-β-Ala83094.563092.6530.08 (41.99)++64Ile8B27-β-Ala93078.613078.8229.53 (42.76)+129Glu9B27-β-Ala103078.613079.1630.59 (42.23)+/−181Glu10B27-β-Ala113094.563094.8128.57 (41.41)−−−>1000Leu11B27-Ala113094.563094.65(41.32)+113Leu11B27-β-Ala123150.673151.1530.61 (41.77)−−−>750Gly12B27-β-Ala133079.553081.00(44.48)++99Lys13B27-β-Ala143051.533050.4731.69 (43.27)−279Arg14B27-β-Ala153108.593110.8031.24 (44.33)+++50Glu15B27-β-Ala163078.613082.5030.28 (42.11)++87Val16B27-β-Ala173106.623107.2429.98 (44.01)−−−559Thr17B27-Ala173106.623106.18(43.65)++61Thr17B27-β-Ala183094.563094.6530.14 (42.90)−−−>1000Ile18B27-Ala183094.563094.23(42.77)−−>300Ile18B27-β-Ala193110.603110.5430.73 (43.70)−−−>500Pro19B27-Ala193110.603110.18(43.18)+++44Pro19B27-β-Ala203110.603111.6729.30 (43.80)+129Pro20B27-β-Ala213079.553079.4529.61 (43.48)+++50Lys21B27-β-Ala223044.543045.0429.93 (43.23)++101Tyr22B27-β-Ala233051.533052.0230.06 (43.95)+++40Arg23B27-β-Ala243078.613079.13(41.80)+++32Glu24B27-β-Ala253094.563098.43(41.99)++66Leu25B27-β-Ala263094.563095.4029.65 (41.87)++83Leu26B27-β-Ala273136.643136.5030.23 (43.90)++60Ala27Peptide B27-WT: D - P - M - S - S - T - Y - I - E - E - L - G - K- R - E - V - T - I - P - P - K - Y - R - E - L - L - A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Type II β-turn region Type I β-turn regiona +++, strong inhibition; ++, moderate inhibition; +, very moderate inhibition; −, weak inhibition; −−, very weak inhibition; −−−, no inhibition.

A simple, competitive inhibition was assumed, as shown in Scheme I, E+S⇌ES→E+P+Ikd↑↓kaEIScheme 1 where ka is the second order rate constant of complex formation and kd is the rate constant of its decomposition. Stopped-flow traces of the fluorescence changes observed after rapid mixing of calpain with various concentrations of inhibitor preincubated with fixed concentrations of fluorogenic peptide (200 μm) or fluorescently labeled casein (1 μm) substrate are shown in Fig. 3, A andB, respectively. The dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constant (k obs) on the concentration of B27-WT was also examined. The experiments were performed under pseudo-first order conditions ([B27-WT] ≫ [calpain I]), which were verified by the independence of k obs on the concentration of calpain. The combination of a decrease in the steady-state rate, i.e. inhibition (Fig. 3, A andB) and an increase in k obs as the concentration of B27-WT increases (Fig. 4,A and B) provides evidence for a competitive component to the inhibitory mechanism. As shown in Fig. 4, k obs increased linearly with increasing concentrations of B27-WT up to the highest concentration investigated, when either Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC (Fig. 4 A) or FTC-casein (Fig. 4 B) was used as substrate, confirming a classical competitive inhibition in both cases. For the experiments performed with Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC, a second order association rate constant (ka) of (8.14 ± 0.21) × 105m−1 s−1 and a first order dissociation rate constant (kd) of 0.035 ± 0.010 s−1 were obtained. The equilibrium constant, Ki (=kd/ka), of 42.6 ± 11.9 nm was calculated from the association and dissociation rate constants. The ka andkd values obtained for the studies with FTC-casein as substrate were (4.28 ± 0.01) × 105m−1 s−1 and 0.0587 ± 0.0162s−1, respectively, giving aKi value of 137.4 ± 38"
https://openalex.org/W2011876370,"Lymphocyte stimulation by immunoreceptors is achieved through the activation of multiple signaling pathways leading to cytokine gene transcription. Adapter proteins are critical signaling components that can integrate multiple pathways by allowing the assembly of multimolecular signaling complexes. We previously showed that the cytoplasmic adapter 3BP2 (also known as SH3BP2) promotes NFAT/AP-1 transcriptional activities in T cells through the activation of Ras- and calcineurin-dependent pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms by which 3BP2/SH3BP2 regulates cell signaling and activation remain poorly documented. In this study, using a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis and biochemical approaches, we present evidence for a physical interaction between 3BP2 and the chaperone protein 14-3-3. This interaction was direct and constitutively detected in yeast and in mammalian cells. Phorbol ester, pervanadate, and forskolin/isobutylmethylxanthine stimulations enhanced this interaction, as well as co-expression of constitutive active mutants of serine/threonine kinases, including protein kinase C. We found that dephosphorylation of 3BP2 by alkaline phosphatase disrupted its interaction with 14-3-3 and that 3BP2 was a substrate of purified protein kinase C in vitro, suggesting that the phosphorylation of 3BP2 by upstream kinases was required for 14-3-3 binding. Using deletion mutants of 3BP2, two 14-3-3 binding domains were mapped to two proline-rich (residues 201–240 and 270–310) domains of 3BP2. These domains were shown to contain two 14-3-3 consensus binding motifs. We identified residues Ser225 and Ser277 of 3BP2 as being essential for interaction with 14-3-3 family proteins, optimal 3BP2 serine phosphorylation, and then for 3BP2-dependent function. Indeed, a 3BP2 mutant protein incapable of binding 14-3-3 showed increased capacity to stimulate NFAT transcriptional activities, suggesting that 14-3-3 binding to 3BP2 negatively regulates 3BP2 adapter function in lymphocytes. Lymphocyte stimulation by immunoreceptors is achieved through the activation of multiple signaling pathways leading to cytokine gene transcription.

In turn, the activated PTKs promote the assembly of intracellular protein complexes that transduce signals to the cytoplasm and nucleus (1Dustin M.L. Chan A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become apparent that adapter molecules play critical roles in the coupling of receptor-proximal events, such as protein-tyrosine kinases activation, to specific signaling processes linked to cell growth and differentiation (2Tomlinson M.G. Lin J. Weiss A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 584-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Leo A. Wienands J. Baier G. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Adapter proteins lack intrinsic catalytic activity, but they possess motifs and domains capable of mediating protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (4Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). The assembly of large signaling complexes, through the multiple interactions stabilized by adapters, allows the activation of downstream effectors, including phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), guanine nucleotide exchange factors of the Vav family, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which couple extracellular signals to small GTPases signaling, cytoskeletal reorganization, gene expression, and, ultimately, to lymphocyte activation and functions (1Dustin M.L. Chan A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,5Altman A. Deckert M. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 1-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, by SH2 domain-containing leukocyte phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) and by linker for activation of T cells (LAT), two adapter molecules expressed in T cells, are required for proper activation of PLCγ, intracellular calcium fluxes, and Ras stimulation during T cell activation (6Finco T.S.

Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In an analogous manner, the B cell linker protein (BLNK) is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ and activation of Jun N-terminal kinase in activated B lymphocytes (8Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the cytoplasmic adapter protein 3BP2 (also known as Abl SH3-binding protein 2 or SH3BP2) positively regulates T cell signaling (9Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 3BP2 has been originally described as an in vitro binding partner of the SH3 domain of the PTK c-Abl (10Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). 3BP2 is composed of a N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a central proline-rich (PR) region that interacts with c-Abl, and a C-terminal SH2 domain. Human 3BP2 transcripts are ubiquitously expressed but can be preferentially found in spleen, in peripheral blood leukocytes, and, to a lesser extent, in thymus (9Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Bell S.M. Shaw M. Jou Y.S. Myers R.M. Knowles M.A. Genomics. 1997; 44: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). During a screen for Syk kinase-interacting proteins in lymphocytes, we found a direct, activation-induced interaction of 3BP2 with the SH2 domain of Syk and Zap-70. In addition, the SH2 domain of 3BP2 was also found to associatein vitro several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including PLCγ1, c-Cbl, and LAT, proteins that have all been implicated in T cell signaling pathways (9Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We also showed that 3BP2 was a potent inducer of both basal and TCR-mediated activities of NFAT and AP-1, two transcription factors involved in interleukin 2 gene transcription. Furthermore, 3BP2-induced gene activation in T cell required the activation of a cyclosporin A-sensitive signaling pathway and of a Ras-dependent signaling pathway (9Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, 3BP2 was shown to also have a positive regulatory role during the development of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through the binding of several signaling molecules like PLCγ1 and Vav1 (12Jevremovic D. Billadeau D.D. Schoon R.A. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7219-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and to regulate FcεR1-mediated degranulation in basophilic cells (13Sada K. Miah S.M. Maeno K. Kyo S. Qu X. Yamamura H. Blood. 2002; 100: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, mutations in the 3bp2/sh3bp2 gene have been linked to a rare human disease of childhood characterized by proliferative lesions within the mandible and maxilla, suggesting that 3BP2 could be implicated in osteoclasts differentiation (14Ueki Y. Tiziani V. Santanna C. Fukai N. Maulik C. Garfinkle J. Ninomiya C. doAmaral C. Peters H. Habal M. Rhee-Morris L. Doss J.B. Kreiborg S. Olsen B.R. Reichenberger E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, the exact role of 3BP2 in hematopoietic/lymphoid cell signaling remains ill-defined. The 14-3-3 protein family constitutes a highly conserved group family of molecules present in high abundance in all eukaryotic cells (15Aitken A. Jones D. Soneji Y. Howell S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,16Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C.

They mediate signal transduction, cell cycle control, apoptosis, stress response, and malignant transformation by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins such as c-Raf, Cdc25c, and BAD (17Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell. Signalling. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins are considered as scaffold molecules modulating protein-protein interactions, protein subcellular localization, and enzyme activities. Evidences of their involvement in lymphocyte signaling have been provided. For example, it has been shown that the binding of 14-3-3τ to PKCθ prevents its translocation to the membrane, thereby decreasing its ability to activate the interleukin 2 promoter (18Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the interaction of 14-3-3 with the catalytic subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the Cbl protooncogene has been involved in the regulation of the Ras-dependent pathway leading to NFAT activation (19Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y.C. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Liu Y.

Signalling. 1998; 10: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified a novel interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and the adapter 3BP2. By using a yeast two-hybrid system, pull-down assays and Western ligand blot analysis, we show that 3BP2 specifically and directly associates in vitro and in vivo with 14-3-3. Our studies also provide ample evidence that 3BP2 interacts with 14-3-3 via a serine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism and that PKC is one of the Ser/Thr kinases that phosphorylates 3BP2 to facilitate this association. 3BP2 deletion analysis revealed the presence of two 14-3-3 binding sites located to the central proline-rich domain of 3BP2 and containing two serine residues (Ser225 and Ser277) critical for 14-3-3/3BP2 interaction. Finally, gene reporter analysis showed that mutation of the 14-3-3 binding motif on 3BP2 increases its ability to activate NFAT in T and B lymphoid cells, suggesting that 14-3-3 interaction with 3BP2 negatively regulates its adapter function in lymphocytes. Culture media, oligonucleotides, and enzymes were from Invitrogen. The chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies specific for Cbl, Raf-1, 14-3-3, and GST were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-hemagglutinin (HA; 12CA5) monoclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and Roche Diagnostics, respectively. The GST 3BP2 SH2 domain fusion protein was previously described (9Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against 3BP2 were prepared following rabbit immunization with the GST 3BP2 SH2 domain fusion protein. Alkaline phosphatase was from Roche Diagnostics, and purified catalytic subunit of rat brain PKC was obtained fromCalbiochem. The yeast expression plasmids pLex9, pACTII, and the HA-tagged 3BP2 constructs in the expression vector pMT3 were described before (9Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 3BP2 mutants were subcloned into a modified version of the pLex9 vector using an EcoRI fragment obtained from the pMT3 HA-3BP2 constructs. All of the additional point and deletion mutants were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. In-frame insertion of the murine 3BP2 cDNA into the pCS3 6-Myc vector was performed by PCR using High Fidelity Platinium Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The NFAT luciferase reporter construct was from G. Crabtree (Stanford, CA). Constitutively active PKA, Akt, and PKCθ expression vectors were provided by M. Montmigny, B. Hemmings, and A. Altman, respectively. Plasmids encoding 14-3-3τ in frame with Gal4 activation domain, GST, and HA were previously described (22Liu Y.C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The human leukemic Jurkat, U937 monocytic, and Burkitt's lymphoma Daudi cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Dutcher, Brumath, France), 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, nonessential amino acids solution, and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. Cells grown in a logarithmic growth phase were transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmids by electroporation using the Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Simian COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum. 1 × 107 cells were plated the day before transfection. Transfections were then performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Growth and transformation of the yeast strain L40 were performed as described before (23Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, a human lymphocyte cDNA library encoded by the yeast two-hybrid vector pACTII (Clontech) was transformed into the yeast strain L40 that was previously transformed by the pLex9 3BP2 bait vector. The transformed cells were plated on synthetic drop-out medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and uracil and grown for 4 days at 30 °C. The colonies were then assayed for β-galactosidase activity using a β-galactosidase filter assay (23Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). After a second round of screening performed with a LexA-lamin plasmid as a negative control, library plasmid cDNAs were rescued, sequenced, and identified using the BLAST algorithm. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 bacteria with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The proteins were affinity purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Purified proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie staining. For GST precipitations, the cells were lysed at 1 × 108 cells/ml in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaF, 5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and incubated with 10 μg of the indicated GST fusion protein and glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing in lysis buffer, the bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting as indicated below. The cells were lysed at 1 × 108cells/ml in ice-cold lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Cleared lysates were then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies and for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The pellets were then washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Eluted immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE-resolved samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. For Western ligand blot, electrophoresed immunoprecipitates were transferred to membranes and incubated with GST-14-3-3τ (10 μg/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C. After extensive washings, the membranes were successively incubated with anti-GST and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 3BP2. After cell lysate preparation, 3BP2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-3BP2 antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40. For dephosphorylation of 3BP2, the beads were washed twice with phosphatase buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm EDTA), resuspended in 50 μl of phosphatase buffer, and incubated or not with alkaline phosphatase (20 units/ml; Roche Diagnostic). After 2 h at 30 °C, the beads were spun down and eluted with SDS-PAGE buffer. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western ligand blotting with GST-14-3-3τ as described above. For phosphorylation of 3BP2, the beads were washed twice in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction mix (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.1 unit/ml of purified catalytic subunit of PKC (Calbiochem, Germany) and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× hot sample buffer and run on SDS-PAGE. The gel was then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to film. After autoradiography, the membrane was saturated and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-HA to quantitate the levels of 3BP2 proteins in the kinase reaction. The cellular localization of 3BP2 and 14-3-3 proteins was performed as described before (9Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 48 h, the transfected cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% saponin, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. 3BP2 proteins were stained with anti-Myc antibody, followed by incubation with a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody to mouse immunoglobulins. 14-3-3 proteins were stained with anti-14-3-3 antibody, followed by incubation with a secondary Texas Red-labeled antibody to rabbit immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The stained cells were analyzed with a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope. For luciferase assays, Jurkat TAg and Daudi cells were transiently transfected with 5–15 μg of the NFAT reporter plasmid together with the indicated expression plasmids. The luciferase activity was assayed and normalized by luminometry as described before (23Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was determined in triplicate and expressed as fold increase relative to the basal activity seen in unstimulated mock transfected cells. In an attempt to identify proteins able to bind to 3BP2, we employed the yeast two-hybrid interaction analysis. 3BP2 was fused in frame to the DNA-binding domain of LexA and used to screen a human lymphocyte library. 2.5 × 106 transformants were screened. Of the 48 clones selected for sequence analysis, three 14-3-3ζ clones, one 14-3-3ε clone, and one 14-3-3τ clone were identified by comparison with the nucleotide data base at the National Library of Medicine using the BLAST algorithm (Fig.1). For further experiments, we elected to use the 14-3-3τ isoform, which is expressed abundantly in lymphoid cells. Biochemical interaction between 3BP2 and 14-3-3 was next tested by co-immunoprecipitation assay. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged 3BP2, HA-tagged 14-3-3τ, or empty vectors. Lysates from unstimulated cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig.2 A, 3BP2 co-immunoprecipitated with 14-3-3, indicating that there is a constitutive complex in resting COS-1 cells between 3BP2 and 14-3-3. This result was confirmed by anin vitro pull-down assay using GST-14-3-3τ (Fig.2 B). Lysates of COS-1 cells transfected with Myc-tagged 3BP2 were incubated with recombinant GST or GST-14-3-3τ fusion protein. 3BP2 bound to immobilized GST-14-3-3τ fusion proteins but not to GST protein when lysate proteins were eluted from immobilized GST proteins and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody. To further demonstrate that 3BP2 interacts with 14-3-3, we immunoprecipitated endogenous 3BP2 (or Raf-1 as control) from U937 cells (Fig. 2 C). Western blot with anti-14-3-3 antibody showed that 3BP2 co-immunoprecipitated with a significant fraction of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins in resting monocytic U937 cells, reaching 0.5–1% of total 14-3-3τ, as judged by Western blot analysis of one-tenth of total cell lysate. Binding of 14-3-3τ to Raf-1 is also showed for comparison (Fig. 2 C). To further localize the association of 3BP2 and 14-3-3, we used double immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy and analyzed COS-1 cells co-transfected with Myc-tagged 3BP2 and HA-tagged 14-3-3. 3BP2 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm with a small fraction constitutively associated with the membrane (Fig. 2 D and Ref. 9Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 staining was found diffusely in the cytoplasm, partially overlapping with 3BP2 staining (Fig. 2 D,middle and right panels). This suggests that a significant fraction of 3BP2 and 14-3-3 proteins co-localized in COS-1 cells. Next, we used an in vitro pull-down assay and a Western ligand blot technique to study the effect of mitogenic stimulation on 3BP2/14-3-3 interaction. First, COS-1 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged 3BP2, and stimulated with PMA or pervanadate treatment. The cell lysates were incubated with recombinant GST or GST-14-3-3τ fusion protein, and bound proteins, which were recovered with glutathione-Sepharose beads, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. Raf-1, which associates directly with 14-3-3 proteins, was used here as a positive control. More 3BP2 was associated with GST-14-3-3τ in lysates from PMA or pervanadate-stimulated cells than in unstimulated samples (Fig.3 A). To determine whether the association between 3BP2 and 14-3-3τ is direct, we used the Western ligand blot technique. COS-1 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged 3BP2, either unstimulated or stimulated with PMA, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-3BP2 antibody. Electrophoresed precipitated 3BP2 was probed with a recombinant GST-14-3-3τ fusion protein, and binding was detected with anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3 B). As expected, GST-14-3-3τ bound immunoprecipitated 3BP2 from both unstimulated and activated cells. Immunoblotting of the same membrane with anti-3BP2 antibody showed that a similar amount of 3BP2 proteins was present in immunoprecipitates from resting and PMA-stimulated cells. A similar in vitro pull-down assay using a GST-14-3-3τ was performed from unstimulated COS-1 cells transfected with plasmids encoding for 3BP2-Myc without or with a constitutively active form of Ras. As shown in Fig. 3 C, activation of Ras mitogenic pathway led to increases 3BP2/14-3-3 interaction. Next, COS-1 cells were transfected with HA-tagged 3BP2 construct and either unstimulated or stimulated with PKA agonists, forskolin, and isobutylmethylxanthine. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and Western ligand blot was performed as described above. Fig. 3 D shows that cell stimulation with forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine increased the basal binding of 14-3-3τ to 3BP2. Altogether, our results indicate that the constitutive and direct association between 14-3-3 and 3BP2 is reinforced when cells are stimulated by agonists of PKC and PKA pathways. To determine whether phosphorylation on serine residues was involved in the interaction between 3BP2 and 14-3-3, we immunoprecipitated 3BP2 from resting COS-1 cells and treated these immune complexes with 20 units/ml alkaline phosphatase. The samples were then analyzed for binding of GST-14-3-3τ by Western ligand blotting. Treatment of anti-HA precipitates with alkaline phosphatase totally abrogated 3BP2/14-3-3 interaction (Fig. 4 A). Stripping and reprobing the membrane with anti-HA antibody showed that similar amounts of 3BP2 were present in all samples. These results suggest that phosphorylation of 3BP2 was required for its association with 14-3-3. PMA stimulation increases both 3BP2/14-3-3 interaction and PKC activation. To determine whether PKC directly phosphorylates 3BP2, 3BP2 immunoprecipitates from transfected COS-1 cells were used in in vitro kinase assay with a purified catalytic domain of rat brain PKC. 3BP2 phosphorylation was not detectable in the absence of PKC. When PKC was added, a band of phosphorylated 3BP2 was clearly visible (Fig. 4 B). Probing the membrane with anti-3BP2 antibody showed that similar amounts of 3BP2 were immunoprecipitated in all of the samples (bottom panel). These results support the notion that PKC directly phosphorylates 3BP2 in vitro. To further define the nature of the 3BP2/14-3-3 association, we evaluated the ability of different Ser/Thr kinases to modulate it. COS-1 cells were transfected with 3BP2-Myc expression vector and with cDNAs encoding for constitutively active forms of PKA, Akt, and PKCθ. The lysates were incubated with GST-14-3-3τ fusion protein or GST alone as control, and binding was detected with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 4 C). Surprisingly, all of the Ser/Thr kinases tested increased the interaction between 14-3-3 and 3BP2, suggesting that 3BP2 could be a substrate for several Ser/Thr kinases, including PKC. Next, we used the yeast-two hybrid system to map the minimum region of 3BP2 involved in this interaction. Structurally, 3BP2 is composed of three regions: a N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a central region containing three proline-rich domains, and a C-terminal SH2 domain. Various deletion mutants of 3BP2 fused to LexA protein were tested for binding to Gal4–14-3-3 fusion proteins in yeast. As shown in Fig.5 A, the deletion of either the pleckstrin homology domain (3BP2 130–553) or the SH2 domain (3BP2 1–455) did not alter the interaction with 14-3-3. In contrast, the central proline-rich region of 3BP2 was essential for the 3BP2/14-3-3 interaction. In this region, we defined three PR domains based on the presence of several putative SH3 domain binding sequences PXXP (4Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). The first (amino acids 201–240) and the second (amino acids 270–310) proline-rich domains were particularly important, as demonstrated by the decreased ability of the respective deletion mutant to bind 14-3-3, whereas the third domain (amino acids 340–384) was not (Fig. 5 A). Next, COS-1 cells"

By using peptide phage-displayed technology, we identified three critical motifs, LXPEXD, QSYP, and EX(E/D)PPV, within selected mimotopes which interacted with the human recombinant anti-TPO autoantibody (aAb) T13, derived from an antibody phage-displayed library obtained from thyroid-infiltrating TPO-selected B cells of Graves' disease patients. Mimotope sequence alignment on the TPO molecule, together with the binding analysis of the T13 aAb on TPO mutants expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells, demonstrated that regions 353–363, 377–386, and 713–720 from the myeloperoxidase-like domain and region 766–775 from the complement control protein-like domain are a part of the IDR recognized by the recombinant aAb T13. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these regions were involved in the binding to TPO of sera containing TPO-specific autoantibodies from patients suffering from Hashimoto's and Graves' autoimmune diseases.

Scheumann G.F. Bramswig J. Bocker W. Harms E. Schmid K.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 115-120Google Scholar). TPO generates the functional form of thyroglobulin by iodination and coupling of tyrosine residues (3Taurog A. Dorris M.L. Doerge D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 24-32Google Scholar). During autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), TPO represents a major target for the immune system (4McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 192-206Google Scholar, 5McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 19: 587-618Google Scholar), leading to high titer TPO-specific autoantibodies (aAbs) in the sera of patients suffering from Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease. Besides their role as efficient and early diagnostic markers of AITD, TPO-specific aAbs also act as effector molecules either through modulating antigen presentation to T cells or by mediating thyroid destruction after complement activation or antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (6Guo J.

Alignment studies and structural homologies have shown that TPO is formed by three distinct domains: a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-like, a complement control protein (CCP)-like, and an EGF-like domain, from the N- to the C-terminal extremities (13Hobby P. Gardas A. Radomski R. McGregor A.M. Banga J.P. Sutton B.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2018-2026Google Scholar).

These observations denote a highly complex structure of TPO, thus explaining the reason why TPO aAbs from patients' sera preferentially recognize discontinuous epitopes on TPO (19Portolano S.

These approaches have demonstrated a restricted response of TPO-specific aAbs, which mainly recognize a discontinuous immunodominant region (IDR). By competition between human anti-TPO from patients' sera and a pool of murine anti-TPO mAbs, the IDR was divided into two overlapping domains named A and B (25Ruf J. Toubert M.E. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J.M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Google Scholar). Using monoclonal human anti-TPO antibody fragments (Fabs) as competitor, Chazenbalk and co-workers (23Chazenbalk G.D. Portolano S. Russo D. Hutchison J.S. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin.

The IDR was only partially characterized, however, with no clear direct relation between the identified regions. We hypothesize that most of the techniques currently in use for mapping mAb linear epitopes are inadequate for precisely defining a discontinuous epitope on molecules like TPO, which have a highly organized architecture. To overcome this problem, we decided to combine two technological advances already used to delineate highly structured epitopes (36Ganglberger E. Grunberger K. Sponer B. Radauer C. Breiteneder H.

Tong J.C. Whisstock J. Scealy M. Mackay I.R. Rowley M.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3830-3838Google Scholar). First, antibody-specific peptides were selected for their ability to mimic natural epitopes by screening phage-displayed peptides libraries. Second, the sequence alignments of such selected mimotopes on the primary sequence of the antigen together with knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the antigen allowed the identification of a potential conformational epitope. We applied this strategy to the identification of the TPO immunodominant epitope involved in thyroid autoimmunity by using the human IDR-specific recombinant IgG1 aAb T13 derived from antibody phage-displayed libraries obtained from B cells extracted from thyroid tissue of Graves' disease patients (40Chapal N.

Four distinct regions, belonging to the MPO-like and CCP-like domains of TPO, delimited the discontinuous IDR, recognized by the human recombinant aAb T13 and identified by sera from patients suffering from Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease. Sera from five patients with Graves' disease, five with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and four healthy donors were obtained from Dr. L. Baldet and Dr. A. M. Puech (Guy de Chauliac Hospital, Montpellier, France). The anti-TPO aAb titers were determined by radioimmunoassay using the TPO-AB-CT Kit (Cis bio, Gif sur Yvette, France). The patients' sera were characterized further for the presence of anti-TSH receptor aAbs by a radio receptor assay using the TRAK human kit (BRAHMS, Hennigsdorf, Germany) and for triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (Table I). As controls, sera from eight patients suffering from other autoimmune affections, two with type 1 diabetes, four with human systemic lupus erythematosus, one with vascularitis, and one with rheumatoid arthritis were tested.Table IDescription of sera from patients suffering from autoimmune thyroid diseasesPatient no.DiseaseTPO autoantibody titer1-aThe values were obtained by radioimmunoassay and standardized to the WHO/National Institute for Biological Standards and Control 66/387 (see “Experimental Procedures”).TSHT3T4TRAK1-bThe values were obtained by a radio receptor assay using a DYNOtest TRAK human kit and standardized to the WHO 90/672 (see “Experimental Procedures”).units/mlmicrounits/mlpg/mlng/dlunits/liter1Hashimoto9,30911.842.130.98ND1-cND, not determined.2Hashimoto3,14132.202.380.95ND3Hashimoto7,14816.051.851.59ND4Hashimoto23,86714.801.60NDND5Hashimoto3,1410.013.743.15ND6Graves2,2426.022.8517.20ND7Graves4,6336.002.60ND19.008Graves3,7930.0116.202.0013.509Graves1,4262.82NDNDND10Graves1,4430.011.40ND1.15Normal values<1400.10–3.500.85–3.000.90–3.00<1.50TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TRAK, TSH receptor autoantibodies.1-a The values were obtained by radioimmunoassay and standardized to the WHO/National Institute for Biological Standards and Control 66/387 (see “Experimental Procedures”).1-b The values were obtained by a radio receptor assay using a DYNOtest TRAK human kit and standardized to the WHO 90/672 (see “Experimental Procedures”).1-c ND, not determined.

Rapoport (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA). Anti-TPO mAb 47 was provided by Dr. J. Ruf (INSERM Unit 555, Marseille, France) (42Finke R. Seto P. Ruf J. Carayon P. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 919-921Google Scholar). Anti-TPO mAb 6F5 and rabbit polyclonal anti-TPO were purchased from HyTest Ltd., and Abcys S.A. (Paris, France), respectively. The recombinant human anti-TPO scFv T13 was selected from an antibody phage-displayed library obtained from B cells extracted from thyroid tissue of Graves' disease patients (40Chapal N. Chardès T.

The purity was analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, then Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained or transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex, San Diego), and revealed by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc-specific Ab (Sigma) diluted 1:1,000, using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Then, the aAb specificity was determined by ELISA. The microtiter plate wells were coated with 9 nm (1 μg/ml) TPO in 100 mmNaHCO3, pH 9, overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T), pH 7.3, and blocked with 2% powdered milk in PBS-T for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, aAb T13 or purified human IgG1 (Sigma) as control was incubated with 1% powdered milk in PBS-T (incubation buffer) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After washing, an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-human IgG Ab (Sigma, diluted 1:1,000) in the incubation buffer was added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washings, the reactivity was revealed with 1 mg/ml of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.5 m diethanolamine/HCl, pH 9.6, for 1 h at 37 °C. Kinetic parameters of aAb T13 were obtained by real time analysis as described previously (41Bresson D. Chardès T. Chapal N. Bès C. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Bouanani M. Mani J.C. Peraldi-Roux S. Hum. Antibodies. 2001; 10: 109-118Google Scholar). The aAb T13, expressed as scFv or IgG1, inhibits between 7.3 and 100% of the binding to TPO of serum samples from patients with AITD that were tested (40Chapal N. Chardès T. Bresson D. Pugnière M.

Four phage-displayed libraries (LX-8/f88.4, X15/f88.4, X8CX8/f88.4, and X30/f88.4) in which peptides were displayed at the N terminus of the pVIII coat protein on the surface of the filamentous bacteriophage M13, were obtained from Dr. J. Scott (Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada) (45Bonnycastle L.L. Mehroke J.S. Rashed M. Gong X. Scott J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 747-762Google Scholar). Phages specific for aAb T13 were selected by biopanning as described previously (46Ferrieres G. Villard S. Pugnière M. Mani J.C. Navarro-Teulon I. Rharbaoui F. Laune D. Loret E. Pau B. Granier C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1819-1829Google Scholar). Antibody-bound phages were eluted (i) by 3 ml of acid elution (0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.2), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at room temperature and further neutralization by adding 300 μl of 2 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.2; (ii) by competition with a 180 nm (20 μg/ml) TPO solution in 5 ml of NaCl/Tris (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 2 h at 37 °C. Phages were amplified after each round of panning using an exponentially growing culture of Escherichia coli K91 cells, and T13-specific phages were cloned and characterized by ELISA as described (46Ferrieres G. Villard S. Pugnière M. Mani J.C. Navarro-Teulon I. Rharbaoui F. Laune D. Loret E. Pau B. Granier C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1819-1829Google Scholar). Clones giving an absorbance more than twice the background level were selected. Each selected and purified clone was checked further by ELISA for its ability to be inhibited by soluble TPO at a concentration of 90 nm (10 μg/ml). Briefly, wells from microtiter plates were coated with 13 nm aAb T13 in 100 mmNaHCO3, pH 9, overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS-T, and then 2% powdered milk in PBS-T was added for 1 h at 37 °C. After saturation and four washings, a 1:10 dilution of purified phages from each clone was coincubated with soluble TPO for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After washing, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 (Amersham Biosciences; diluted 1:5,000 with 1% powdered milk in PBS-T) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Three washings were performed, and residual bound phages were revealed with 4 mg/ml 2-phenylenediamine solution containing 0.03% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.0. After 20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 2 mH2SO4 to each well, and the resulting absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Selected phages, whose binding to aAb T13 was inhibited by more than 15%, were sequenced for peptide sequence identification. As a control, the effect of a solution containing 90 nm soluble thyroglobulin (60 μg/ml) on the binding of these selected phages to aAb T13 was tested. The general protocol of Spot parallel peptide synthesis has been described previously (47Laune D. Molina F. Ferrieres G. Mani J.C. Cohen P. Simon D. Bernardi T. Piechaczyk M. Pau B. Granier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30937-30944Google Scholar). 12 pentadecapeptides corresponding to the selected T13-specific mimotopes and their 15 alanine analogs were synthesized by the Spot method. The membrane-bound peptides were probed by coincubation of a 0.1 μm solution of aAb T13 with peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Fc specific antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:1,000 for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After three washings, the complex was revealed using the ECL detection system on a sensitive film, and the intensities of the spots were evaluated with ScionImage software. The membrane was reused after a regeneration cycle. Each amino acid sequence corresponding to an immunoreactive mimotope was aligned with the other selected peptides or with the hTPO sequence using the multiple sequence alignment program Multalin (48Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Google Scholar). The sequence homologies between T13-specific mimotopes and hTPO were located on a three-dimensional model of TPO, using the atomic coordinates kindly provided by Hobby et al. (13Hobby P. Gardas A. Radomski R. McGregor A.M. Banga J.P. Sutton B.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2018-2026Google Scholar). A KpnI restriction site was added by PCR just after the stop codon of the full-length hTPO cDNA. Wild-type TPO cDNA was cloned using the HindIII andKpnI sites into the pcDNA5/FRT expression vector from the Flp-In system (Invitrogen). The mutants were constructed by overlap extension PCR as described previously (49Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). The mutation replacements were performed as follows. The353HARLRDSGRAY363 sequence from wt TPO was replaced by sequence 353NQAFQANGAAL363 in the TPO353–363 mutant, wt TPO (377PEPGIPGETR386) by TPO377–386(377LLTNRLGRIG386), wt TPO (506ASFQEHPDL514) by TPO506–514(506NRYLPMEPN514), wt TPO (713KFPEDFES720) by TPO713–720(713SYARLAVN720), wt TPO (737PQDD740) by TPO737–740(737ALAA740), and wt TPO (766YSCRHGYELQ775) by TPO766–775(766LTCEGGFRIS775). All sequences were verified by the dideoxynucleotide termination method (50Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). The Flp-In system was used to generate isogenic stable mammalian cell lines expressing wt and mutated TPO. CHO cells (ATCC CCL61) were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Stable transfectants were obtained as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the CHO host cell line was constructed by transfection with 0.5 μg of the pFRT/lacZeo vector and selection with growth medium containing 500 μg/ml Zeocin™ (Cayla, Toulouse, France). Zeocin™-resistant clones were screened to identify those containing a single integrated FRT site and expressing a high β-galactosidase level. A single clone was selected and amplified for further studies. The generation of wt or mutated TPO was obtained by cotransfection, into the selected Zeocin™-resistant CHO host cell line, of the hygromycin-resistant pcDNA5/FRT plasmids bearing each form of TPO and the pOG44 plasmid which constitutively expresses the Flp recombinase. Two days later, the cells were fed with growth medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). The clones of interest were selected for hygromycin resistance, Zeocin™ sensitivity, and lack of β-galactosidase activity. Stably transfected CHO cells were washed three times with PBS and scraped at 4 °C. Membrane protein extraction was performed as follows. After centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, membrane proteins were solubilized by adding 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml of lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants containing membrane proteins were recovered and conserved at −80 °C. The protein concentrations were evaluated by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Approximately 20 μg of membrane proteins was mixed with protein buffer (0.2 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) for native conditions, supplemented with 10% dithiothreitol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled 5 min for denaturing conditions. Each sample was loaded into individual wells and electrophoresed through a 9% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then saturated with 5% powdered milk in PBS-T for 30 min at room temperature. The first antibodies, diluted with the incubation buffer, were applied overnight at 4 °C. After three washings with PBS-T for 10 min at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in incubation buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washings, the signal was detected with chemiluminescence ECL on a sensitive film. Competitive ELISA experiments were performed as follows. Briefly, the wells were coated with 9 nm (1 μg/ml) TPO in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 9, overnight at 4 °C. Then they were washed and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T (saturation buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washings, 3 nm mAb T13 (at a dilution giving anA 490 of 1.5) was incubated with or without decreasing concentrations of inhibitor in saturation buffer for 1.5 h at 37 °C under mild shaking. The wells were washed, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody diluted 1:2,000 in saturation buffer was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Three washings were performed, and then aAb T13 bound to TPO was detected by adding 4 mg/ml 2-phenylenediamine solution containing 0.03% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.0. The reaction was stopped with 2 mH2SO4, and the resulting absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Wells were coated with 20 μg/ml membrane proteins in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed with PBS-T and blocked with the saturation buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washings, mAb or serum was incubated in the saturation buffer for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG or anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:2,000 in saturation buffer) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Three washings were performed, and the reactivity was revealed as described above. The anti-TPO aAb T13 was first produced in the form of a human scFv (40Chapal N. Chardès T. Bresson D. Pugnière M. Mani J.C. Pau B. Bouanani M. Peraldi-Roux S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4740-4750Google Scholar). For the present study, we produced the entire human IgG1 T13 by using the baculovirus/insect cell system and purified it by protein G affinity chromatography. The purity was analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue under nonreducing conditions (Fig.1 A, left panel). We visualized a 150 kDa band corresponding to human IgG1 T13, and the purity was estimated to be superior to 95%. The identity of the band was confirmed by Western blotting, under nonreducing conditions, with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc-specific Ab (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Approximately 5 mg of purified aAb T13 was obtained per liter of Sf9 insect cell culture supernatant. The binding specificity of aAb T13 to hTPO was determined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1 B, aAb T13 specifically bound hTPO in a dose-dependent manner, whereas polyclonal human IgG1 as control did not. Moreover, no binding was observed for aAb T13 to thyroglobulin (data not shown). The kinetic parameters of aAb T13 were assessed by real time analysis, using a BIACORE 2000 as described previously (41Bresson D. Chardès T. Chapal N. Bès C. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Bouanani M. Mani J.C. Peraldi-Roux S. Hum. Antibodies. 2001; 10: 109-118Google Scholar), by injecting three concentrations of purified hTPO on aAb T13 or irrelevant Ab (Table II). We found that aAb T13 showed a high affinity for hTPO (KD = 0.9 nm, average of three experiments) with a low dissociation rate (kd = 1.6 10−4s−1, average of three experiments), whereas hTPO did not bind to the irrelevant Ab.Table IIKinetic parameters of aAb T13 as assessed by real time analysisAntibodyTPO concentrationBinding2-aThe binding of human purified TPO to monoclonal antibodies was measured in resonance units (RU) as described (41).

Tat, the viral trans-activator, can be endocytosed by uninfected cells and has been shown to inhibit p53 functions, providing a candidate mechanism through which the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 might contribute to malignant transformation. Because Tat has been shown to interact with histone acetyltransferase domains of p300/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein and p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor, we have investigated whether Tat might alter p53 acetylation and tumor suppressor-responsive transcription. Here, we demonstrate that both Tat and p53 co-localize with p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor and p300 in nuclei of IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells and in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. Further, p53 trans-activation of the 14-3-3ς promoter was markedly repressed by Tat-histone acetyltransferase interactions, and p53 acetylation by p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor on residue Lys320 was diminished as a result of Tat-histone acetyltransferase binding in vivo and in vitro.

Because the HAT domains of p300/CBP and P/CAF also target p53 for acetylation on residues Lys373/Lys382 and Lys320, respectively, we hypothesized that Tat-HAT interactions might competitively interfere with p53 acetylation and, consequently, tumor suppressor-responsive transcription functions (23Gu W.

IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (ATCC number CCL-127) were cultured in ATCC 2003, Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin-sulfate (Invitrogen). PC-12 rodent pheochromocytoma cells (ATCC number CRL-1721) were cultured in ATCC F-12K medium supplemented with 57 fetal bovine serum, 157 horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin-sulfate. All of the cells were grown either in tissue culture dishes or eight-chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) coated with mouse type IV collagen (Invitrogen) and were incubated under 107 CO2 at 37 °C. The transfections were performed using a calcium-phosphate system as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Calu-6 carcinoma cells (ATCC number HTB-56) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin-sulfate and were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended in the manufacturer's protocol. Molt-4 CD4+ lymphoblastic leukemia cells were grown at 37 °C under 107 CO2 in RPMI medium supplemented with 207 human donor serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin-sulfate. The protein extracts were prepared by rapid freeze-thawing followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C and quantified using the Bradford microassay and spectrophotometric analyses at 595 nm; 20 ॖl from each sample was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega Corp.) and a Lumat model LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold, Inc.). All of the experiments were carried out as dose responses in two different cell-lines (IMR-32 and PC-12) or in duplicates for single-point analyses (error bars representative of standard deviations are shown). Immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy was performed on IMR-32, PC-12, or HIV-1-infected Molt-4 cells using a Leica TCS spectrophotometric confocal microscope equipped with krypton and argon lasers, controlled by a Windows NT-based work station. Relative fluorescence intensities were quantified using TCS linear quantification software. Briefly, the cells were fixed in 0.27 glutaraldehyde and 17 formaldehyde in PBS, and nonspecific antigens were blocked by incubation with 37 (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.57 (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS. HIV-1 Tat was detected using the rabbit primary antibody, C-2145, and p53 was detected using either a monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (BP53–12; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or an anti-p53 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.). p300 was detected using a monoclonal anti-p300 CT antibody (RW-128; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody (N-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); P/CAF was detected using a goat polyclonal antibody (C-16; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Fluorescent secondary antibodies were used in appropriate combinations: rhodamine red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy-3-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, or rhodamine red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). For apoptosis and cell cycle analyses, transfected IMR-32 cells were treated with an arrest-inducing concentration of adriamycin (100 ॖm) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and either resuspended in 1× annexin-buffer and stained for annexin-V surface expression for 10 min (Pharmingen, Inc.) or fixed in 3.77 formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, washed, and permeabilized in 0.17 IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma)/PBS containing 5 ॖg/ml RNase and incubated on ice for 15 min. The samples were then stained using acridine orange (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at 4 °C for 30 min. FACS analyses were performed using a Becton Dickinson, FACSCalibur flow cytometer. The cell cycle analyses were gated to exclude aggregates and fragments. GST-Tat, GST-TatK28A/K50A, and GST-p53 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, strain DH5α, by induction with 100 ॖmisopropyl-ॆ-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Invitrogen) in LB broth containing 100 ॖg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C overnight. The cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm, washed twice with PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in 5 ml of cold PBS containing the protease inhibitors antipain-dihydrochloride, bestatin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 50 ng/ml each. Bacteria were lysed by sonication over an ice bath using a Bronson sonic dismembrator equipped with a microtip and operated at 707 duty cycle. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor (DuPont/Sorvall) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 500 ॖl of a 507 mixture of equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Following incubation, the matrices were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm at 4 °C and then washed twice with PBS (with protease inhibitors). Bound GST fusion proteins were eluted in four 200-ॖl fractions of 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in PBS (with protease inhibitors). The eluted fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 12.57 SDS-polyacrylamide gel; the proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining. Purified proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 107 glycerol; the fractions were stored in 20-ॖl aliquots at −80 °C. For in vitro acetylation, 100 ng of purified GST-p53 was mixed either with 5 units of purified p300 or P/CAF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in acetylation buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 50 ॖg/ml bovine serum albumin, 107 glycerol, and 5 ॖl of [acetyl-1-14C]acetyl coenzyme A (51.60 mCi/mmol, NEC-313; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of GST-Tat or GST-TatK28A/K50A (25, 50, or 100 ng) or Tat synthetic peptides (Tat23–43, TatK/A23–43, Tat41–61, or TatKK/AA41–61: 50, 100, or 200 ng; Biosynthesis, Inc.). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, then the reactions were quenched by the addition of 6 ॖl of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the acetylated products were resolved through 4–207 Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen, Inc.) and visualized by autoradiography/fluorography using ENHANCE reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Kodak XAR scientific imaging film was exposed for 72 h at −80 °C. To assess effects of HIV-1 infection upon p53 acetylation in response to UV irradiation in vivo, we infected 3 × 106 Molt-4 CD4+lymphoblastic leukemia cells with 150 ॖl of an infectious stock of HIV-1, HXB2IIIB (HXB2IIIB virus stock and Molt-4 cells were generously provided by Dr. G. Roderiquez, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), titered at ∼2 × 105 pg/ml of p24gag protein determined by a standard anti-p24gag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Aliquots were taken from HIV-1-infected samples on consecutive days (4–6 days post-infection), and half of the volume of infected cells were UV-irradiated for 1.5 min (Fisher UV-Crosslinker at 120 mJ/cm2 energy level), before culturing for an additional 3 h at 37 °C under 107 CO2. Induction of p53 protein by UV treatment was confirmed by immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy and immunoblotting using uninfected or HIV-1-infected cells and a p53-specific monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc). Tat expression was measured in lysates prepared from infected cells by immunoblotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Tat antibody or by direct visualization by immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy. Co-localization of Tat and p53 in UV-irradiated cells was determined and quantified by immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy. The status of p53 acetylation on lysine residues Lys320 and Lys373 was detected by immunoprecipitating total intracellular p53 from untreated or UV-irradiated, HIV-infected Molt-4 cells. The protein G-agarose immune complexes were washed, and the bound products were resolved by 12.57 SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize Lys320-acetylated p53 or Lys373-acetylated p53 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). We first assayed whether Tat-HAT interactions might interfere with neuronal p53-responsive transcription in human IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells and rodent PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. Because p53 regulates G2/M cellular arrest by driving 14-3-3ς promoter trans-activation, we investigated the effects of HIV-1 Tat expression upon a 14-3-3ς promoter luciferase reporter construct containing three p53-responsive elements (other regulatory elements are deleted in this plasmid.

Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, HIV-1 Tat effectively inhibited p53 trans-activation from the 14-3-3ς promoter in IMR-32 and PC-12 cells, respectively, whereas neither the TatK28A/K50A mutant nor green fluorescent protein significantly influenced p53 transcription. Consistently, Tat expression did not seem to alter p53 protein levels, suggesting that Tat causes functional impairment of p53 (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the relative contributions of Tat-p300 or Tat-P/CAF interactions toward the inhibition of p53 transcription, we analyzed a panel of previously characterized Tat mutants; the TatK28A mutant is defective for acetylation by P/CAF, and TatK50A is impaired for acetylation by p300/CBP (17Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Google Scholar). The results in Fig.2A indicate that TatK28A and TatK50A mutants are partially impaired in their abilities to repress p53-responsive 14-3-3ς transcription as compared with wild-type Tat. The differences in biological activities were not due to fluctuations in protein expression because these mutants were detected at levels comparable with wild-type Tat (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Thetrans-dominant-negative p53 mutant, R175H, which is defective for p53-responsive element DNA binding, was used as a control to verify the p53 dependence of 14-3-3ς promoter luciferase reporter gene activity (Fig. 2A and Ref. 26Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Google Scholar). Because the adenoviral E1A 12S factor also interacts with the CH3/HAT domains of both p300/CBP and P/CAF, inhibiting their acetyltransferase activities, we compared the effects of E1A 12S upon p53-responsive, 14-3-3ς transcription in PC-12 and IMR-32 cells (28Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Google Scholar, 29Hamamori Y. Sartorelli V. Ogryzko V. Puri P.L. Wu H.Y. Wang J.Y. Nakatani Y. Kedes L.

In both cell-types, E1A 12S inhibited p53 trans-activation in a dosage-dependent manner that resembled HIV-1 Tat (Fig. 2, B andC). An amino-terminal deletion mutant, E1A 12SΔN, defective for interactions with the HAT domains of these co-activators did not affect p53 transcription, which is consistent with the notion that p53 trans-activation functions require co-activator acetyltransferase activities (Fig. 2, B and C, and Refs. 23Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Google Scholar, 24Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell.

Indeed, co-expression of increasing amounts of either P/CAF or p300 significantly countered the repressive effects of Tat upon 14-3-3ς transcription, although ectopic p300 restored p53 trans-activation somewhat better than P/CAF (Fig. 2D). HIV-1 Tat and p53 were expressed in nuclei of transfected IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells, as determined by immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy, and both proteins displayed varied levels of co-localization with the transcriptional co-activator/acetyltransferase p300 (Fig. 3, A andB). The subcellular distribution of Tat was observed to be both nucleoplasmic and nucleolar by immunostaining (Fig.3B). Importantly, the Tat-derived mutant, TatK28A/K50A, was present in the nuclei of IMR-32 cells (Fig. 3C). We examined the localization of TatK28A/K50A because the K50A mutation is targeted within the nuclear localization sequence of Tat, and it was therefore necessary to establish whether the mutant protein is properly expressed in the nuclei. In addition, we observed that nuclear P/CAF levels appeared to be somewhat limiting in IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells, as revealed by comparatively weak, P/CAF-specific nuclear immunostaining (Fig. 3, A–C, lower panels). Direct interactions of co-activator HATs with Tat, p53, and E1A 12S provide a plausible basis for competitive inhibition of factor acetylation (Fig.4A and Refs. 17Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Google Scholar, 23Gu W. Roeder R.G.

El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Google Scholar). In IMR-32 cells co-transfected with p53 and either Tat or various Tat mutants, the wild-type Tat caused markedly diminished p53Lys-320 acetylation by P/CAF in vivo, whereas no significant difference was observed for p300-dependent, p53Lys-373 acetylation (Fig. 4B). The Tat-derived mutants did not affect p53 acetylation, despite having partially repressive effects upon p53-responsive transcription. These discrepancies may derive from weakened co-activator-binding affinities for the mutants or could suggest that alternate signaling interactions contribute to Tat-repression of p53 transcription. Overexpression of p53 did not result in increased levels of p53-acetylated forms (comparelanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 4B), supporting reports that nuclear co-activator concentrations are limiting (32Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Google Scholar, 33Nicot C. Harrod R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8580-8589Google Scholar). That no apparent difference was observed for p300-dependent, p53Lys-373 acetylation suggests that the restoring effect of ectopic p300 upon 14-3-3ς transcription may have resulted from enhanced factor recruitment (e.g. P/CAF) to p53-responsive elements (Fig.2E). The results from electrophoretic mobility shift/DNA binding assays using a radiolabeled, p53-responsive oligonucleotide probe revealed that decreased p53-specific DNA binding in nuclear extracts prepared from IMR-32 cells, expressing p53 in the presence of Tat or various Tat mutants, coincided with diminished p53Lys-320 acetylation (Fig. 4C, lower panel). The DNA binding activities of IMR-32 nuclear extracts were normalized to yield similar binding to a radiolabeled, consensus cyclic AMP-responsive element probe (Fig. 4C, top panel); the same amounts of nuclear extracts were then used to quantify p53-responsive element binding. We next tested whether GST-Tat or GST-TatK28A/K50A proteins or various Tat-derived synthetic peptides (Biosynthesis, Inc.) might influence the acetylation of GST-p53 in vitro by recombinant P/CAF or p300 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Amino acid sequences of full-length Tat and peptide derivatives (wild type and mutants) used in these analyses are provided in Fig. 4D. Relative input levels of GST-Tat, GST-TatK28A/K50A, and GST-p53 are shown in Fig. 4E. GST-Tat inhibited p53 acetylation by P/CAF and p300 in a dosage-dependent manner; in contrast, GST-TatK28A/K50A had no significant effect upon acetyltransferase activities (Fig. 4, E and F). Synthetic peptides spanning residues 23–43 (Tat23–43) and 41–61 (Tat41–61) of Tat inhibited p53 acetylation by P/CAF and p300, respectively, whereas mutant derivatives of these peptides (TatK/A23–43 and TatKK/AA41–61) did not (Fig. 4, E andF). Interestingly, the Tat41–61 peptide did not alter p53 acetylation by P/CAF, whereas p53 acetylation by p300 was slightly inhibited by Tat23–43. These results may reflect differences in substrate affinities between p300 and P/CAF. The wild-type Tat peptides (residues 23–43 or 41–61) were weakly acetylated in our in vitro assays (data not shown); we did not observe GST-Tat acetylation under the conditions promoting p53 acetylation. In addition, Tat-HAT binding inhibited acetylation of histones H3/H4 in vitro (data not shown). We infer, based upon these results, that the release (or 舠turnover舡) kinetics of Tat acetylation by p300 and P/CAF are comparatively slowversus p53/histone acetylation consistent with the acetyltransferase inhibitory functions of Tat. Because others have previously demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat directly interacts with p53 (6Clark E. Santiago F. Deng L. Chong S. de La Fuente C. Wang L. Fu P. Stein D. Denny T. Lanka V. Mozafari F. Okamoto T. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5040-5052Google Scholar), we attempted to determine whether observed differences in co-activator-mediated p53 acetylation between wild-type Tat and the TatK28A/K50A mutant might be attributed to differences in p53 binding. The results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments in Fig. 5Aindicate that both purified recombinant GST-HIV-1 Tat and GST-TatK28A/K50A interact with GST-p53 in vitrowith similar apparent affinities. In addition, we have also tested whether Tat-P/CAF acetyltransferase domain interactions might interfere with binding of p53 to the catalytic acetyltransferase site of the co-activator and thereby competitively inhibit p53 acetylation. To address this question, we expressed p53 in the background of p53-null, Calu-6 carcinoma cells and used equivalent amounts of total cellular proteins from prepared extracts in GST pull-down experiments. Increasing amounts of synthetic wild-type Tat23–43 or TatK/A23–43 mutant peptides were added to binding reactions in the presence of purified recombinant GST-P/CAF352–382, comprising the minimal acetyltransferase domain of P/CAF. As shown in Fig. 5B, the p53-P/CAF352–382 interaction was significantly diminished in a dosage-dependent manner in the presence of wild-type Tat23–43 peptide but was unaffected by the TatK/A23–43 mutant peptide. Indeed, because Tat23–43 peptides lack amino acid residues that are essential for p53 binding by Tat, we infer that HIV-1 Tat competes against p53 for binding to the minimal acetyltransferase domain of P/CAF in our in vitro assays. Because 14-3-3ς regulates p53-induced G2/M arrest under conditions of genotoxic stress, we addressed whether inhibition of p53 functions as a consequence of Tat-HAT binding might weaken the G2/M checkpoint in the presence of adriamycin (100 ॖm; Refs.26Hermeking H.

https://openalex.org/W2051635200,"An important goal is to identify the direct activation domain (AD)-interacting components of the transcriptional machinery within the context of native complexes. Toward this end, we first demonstrate that the multisubunit TFIID, SAGA, mediator, and Swi/Snf coactivator complexes from transcriptionally competent whole-cell yeast extracts were all capable of specifically interacting with the prototypic acidic ADs of Gal4 and VP16. We then used hexahistidine tags as genetically introduced activation domain-localized cross-linking receptors. In combination with immunological reagents against all subunits of TFIID and SAGA, we systematically identified the direct AD-interacting subunits within the AD-TFIID and AD-SAGA coactivator complexes enriched from whole-cell extracts and confirmed these results using purified TFIID and partially purified SAGA. Both ADs directly cross-linked to TBP and to a subset of TFIID and SAGA subunits that carry histone-fold motifs. An important goal is to identify the direct activation domain (AD)-interacting components of the transcriptional machinery within the context of native complexes. Toward this end, we first demonstrate that the multisubunit TFIID, SAGA, mediator, and Swi/Snf coactivator complexes from transcriptionally competent whole-cell yeast extracts were all capable of specifically interacting with the prototypic acidic ADs of Gal4 and VP16. We then used hexahistidine tags as genetically introduced activation domain-localized cross-linking receptors. In combination with immunological reagents against all subunits of TFIID and SAGA, we systematically identified the direct AD-interacting subunits within the AD-TFIID and AD-SAGA coactivator complexes enriched from whole-cell extracts and confirmed these results using purified TFIID and partially purified SAGA.

Snyder M. Nature. 2002; 415: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Affinity and specificity of interactions involving large multiprotein complexes often depend on the sum of cooperative interactions, interactions that individually can be rather weak and only moderately specific. For this reason it is desirable to identify directly interacting polypeptides in the context of their native complexes. A particularly clear case for this need is exemplified in the difficulties inherent in identifying the direct targets of transcriptional activation domains (ADs)1 within transcription complexes. The ADs of transcriptional activators are thought to recruit large coactivator complexes to promoters by direct protein-protein interactions (2Cosma M.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Two types of coactivator complexes can be distinguished: (i) those that are directly associated with the transcriptional machinery like the RNA polymerase II-associated mediator and the TAF components of the general transcription factor TFIID and (ii) chromatin-associated complexes like the chromatin-remodeling complex Swi/Snf and the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex SAGA. Most attempts to identify the AD-interacting subunits within these coactivator complexes have been based on binding experiments using isolated polypeptides outside of their native holocomplexes. Interactions observed in these analyses were weak, with apparent dissociation constants of ≥10−7m (3Ingles C.J. Shales M. Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Greenblatt J. Nature. 1991; 351: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 4Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Melcher K. J. Mol.

Moreover, many of these AD-target interactions display only moderate specificity. For example, certain nontranscriptional proteins bind ADs with strengths comparable with physiological targets. Furthermore, there is a remarkable correlation between apparent AD “strength”in vivo and binding to transcriptional and nontranscriptional proteins in vitro, suggesting that “stickiness” is an inherent and important property conferring function to ADs (5Melcher K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The most critical amino acids in ADs for bothin vivo function and in vitro binding are bulky hydrophobic amino acids, which in the acidic ADs are exposed by their vicinity to negatively charged amino acids (8Jackson B.M. Drysdale C.M. Natarajan K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5557-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J.

A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic surfaces are typically interaction sites between polypeptides within complexes, and it is likely that these surfaces are artificially exposed when these polypeptides are taken out of their native complexes. Based on the common negative-hydrophobic-negative residue distribution pattern of acidic ADs, hydrophobic surfaces exposed in the vicinity of positively charged amino acids are likely to interact, at least to some degree, with acidic ADs. Therefore, in vitrobinding studies with individual subunits are potentially prone to artifacts. Thus, it is an important challenge to determine the interaction sites of ADs in the context of native complexes, for instance by chemical cross-linking. However, this effort is hampered by the weakness of AD-target interactions relative to the much stronger interactions between the subunits of AD-interacting complexes. An elegant approach that avoids the formation of large and therefore difficult-to-analyze cross-linking complexes is the use of photoactivatable label transfer cross-linking reagents. This method has been successfully employed to identify several activator targets within intact complexes, including mediator (14Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), SAGA (15Brown C.E. Howe L. Sousa K. Alley S.C. Carrozza M.J. Tan S. Workman J.L. Science. 2001; 292: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and Swi/Snf (16Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Brown C.E. Howe L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) complexes, as well as in bacterial RNA polymerase (17Chen Y. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. Science. 1994; 265: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, as powerful as this approach is, it does have limitations. First, the label has to be at or immediately abutting the site that directly contacts its target, while at the same time the 15–21 Å photoactivatable group must not interfere with complex formation. Second, labile, light-sensitive radioactive protein-photoactive variants of ADs must be prepared. Finally, radioactively labeled target proteins are identified by size, a requirement that potentially limits the use of this approach for the analysis of large polypeptides or to analyze subunits with similar sizes relative to each other or to the labeled probe molecule (for instance, see Ref. 14Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Here we describe a variation on protein-protein cross-linking wherein we used immunodetection coupled with electrophoretic mobility changes to score protein-protein interactions. With this approach, we can clearly distinguish all of the subunits of the relevant, multisubunit complexes. We employed a newly developed site-specific cross-linking technique to identify protein-protein interactions termed hexahistidine-mediated cross-linking (18Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Fancy D.A. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that uses a common nickel-activated hexahistidine tag as receptor for a nondiffusible cross-linking reagent. With this method, there is no need to chemically modify the activator with photoprobes or radioactivity, and the hexahistidine tag can be genetically introduced at any inert position of the molecule. Finally, the reagent only cross-links residues that are very closely apposed (18Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Fancy D.A. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this analysis, we concentrated on the interactions of ADs with the TFIID and the SAGA complexes. These complexes partially overlap in subunit composition (20Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yares J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and function (21Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N. Jennings E.G. Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), a fact further complicating interpretations based on the analysis of the interactions of ADs with isolated, individual subunits. TFIID consists of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs) (22Sanders S.L. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13895-13900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Five TAFIIs are present in both TFIID and in the 17-subunit SAGA complex (20Grant P.A. Schieltz D.

Link A.J. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4723-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and each complex contains a subunit with intrinsic HAT activity (20Grant P.A. Schieltz D.

Although all but one of the yeast TAFIIs are essential for viability, only certain TAFIIs, particularly the ones shared by TFIID and SAGA with similarity to histones, are needed for the transcription of a broad set of genes (25Hahn S. Cell. 1998; 95: 579-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Using the hexahistidine cross-linking method, we have identified AD interacting subunits in the context of intact TFIID and SAGA and also show that although other proposed targets do bind and cross-link to ADs as isolated polypeptides, they are not accessible in the native complexes. Yeast strains with genomically triple-HA tagged TBP, TAF1, TAF5, TAF6, and TAF10 were described previously (26Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All other factors were genomically triple-HA tagged for this work in strain 21R (27Johnston S.A. Hopper J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using standard procedures (28Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4170) Google Scholar). Immunopurified rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against TAF1, TAF2, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF11, TAF12, TAF13, TBP, Ada2, and Gcn5 were described previously (26Klebanow E.R. Poon D. Zhou S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13706-13715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The antibody directed against Tra1p was a kind gift from J. L. Workman. Anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5) was purchased from Roche. Recombinant GST and GST-His6 fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli from pGexCS (29Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) variants in which an oligonucleotide encoding His6 was inserted into theNcoI site and from pKM vectors (30Melcher K. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GST-His6fusion proteins contain a cleavage site for TEV protease, which increases cross-linking efficiency by providing tyrosine residues as electron donors in the vicinity of the His6 tag (18Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were bound and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) using standard protocols (30Melcher K. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). TAF9-HA2 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from the TAF9-HA3 strain and cloned into pGexCS for expression. Transcriptionally competent WCE were prepared from 800-ml cultures of each genomically tagged yeast strain. Cells were grown to a density of OD600 ≈1, and extracts were prepared according to Woontner et al. (31Wootner M. Wade P.A. Bonner J. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 5–10 μg (0.3 μm, or concentrations as indicated in Fig. 1) of GST or GST-activator fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 500 μg of WCE protein (∼20 μl), each, for 1 h at 4 °C on a tiltboard in 1 ml of transcription buffer (S. Hahn: www.fhcrc.org/science/basic/labs/hahn/): 10 mmHepes-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mm K-glutamate, 10 mmMg-acetate, 2.5 mm EGTA, 3.5% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40). Beads were then washed 3× for 5–10 min in 500 μl of transcription buffer, each, on ice. Washed beads were resuspended in 500 μl of transcription buffer. 100 μl of the suspension were removed to control GST-fusion protein input (Coomassie stained gel) and 150 μl as control for the pull-down reaction. The remaining beads with bound complexes were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer. Hexahistidine tags were complexed with Ni2+ by addition of 25 μl of 60 mmNi-acetate and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was started by addition of 25 μl of 60 to 120 mm magnesium monoperoxyphtaleic acid (MMPP) and allowed to proceed for 6 min. Reactions were terminated by centrifugation, removal of supernatants, and resuspension of beads in 10 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Each cross-linking reaction was repeated at least once with independently prepared extracts. Further information on the His6-mediated cross-linking method can be found at www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/melcher.html. Beads from half of the cross-linking reactions were washed 3 times with 500 μl of transcription buffer. Washed beads were resuspended in 10 μl of the same buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothrietol plus 1 μl of TEV protease (2.5 μg/μl) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Supernatants were made 1× SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. To separate SAGA from TFIID, WCE was prepared from 4 liters of culture of yeast cells and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column as described (20Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yares J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Whereas essentially all of TFIID was found in the flow through, SAGA bound to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose and was eluted with 300 mm imidazole. TFIID was purified as described (22Sanders S.L. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13895-13900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To immunologically identify individual subunits of yeast transcription complexes, we genomically tagged and/or raised antibodies against all subunits of TFIID and SAGA as well as against the mediator component Med6 and the Swi/Snf component Swi2 (Fig. 1). Genomically tagged strains were created by introducing a triple influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-tag by homologous recombination at the 3′ end of the respective open reading frames. Thus, tagged proteins were expressed from these genes under their native promoters and in their endogenous chromosomal environment. WCEs were prepared from these strains and used for GST-AD pull-down experiments. We incubated glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-VP16 AD with transcriptionally competent yeast WCE and determined whether the four coactivator complexes bound to the VP16 AD. As shown in Fig.2 A, all four components were retained by saturating amounts of GST-VP16 AD but not by GST alone. To test the specificity of these interactions, transcription extracts were incubated with the wild-type Gal4 and VP16 ADs as well as with transcriptionally inactive variants of the two ADs. Both SAGA (as scored by Ada1p) and TFIID (as scored by TAF4) were retained by the two functional ADs but even under saturating conditions of immobilized ADs, these coactivator complexes did not bind inactive derivatives (Fig.2 B). To determine the relative affinities of interactions, we titrated the concentration of immobilized ADs in 3-fold increments down from the saturating concentrations used in panels A andB. The minimal concentration of Gal4p AD needed to efficiently retain SAGA from WCE was at least 10-fold lower than the concentrations of any of the other coactivator complexes, consistent with SAGA being the predominant complex recruited in vivo by Gal4 AD in the absence of a core promoter and other coactivator complexes (32Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, TFIID, which is only recruited at sub-stoichiometric levels to the GAL1 promoter in vivo (33Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), is actually more efficiently retained by Gal4 AD than the mediator and Swi/Snf complexes (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the efficient recruitment of mediator (34Pokholok D.K. Hannett N.M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 799-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) likely depends on additional interactions. Importantly, a series of coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that TFIID and SAGA remained stable in the WCE during the course of these experiments (data not shown, and see below) indicating that these experiments truly scored the interactions of the coactivator complexes with ADs. We used hexahistidine-mediated cross-linking (19Fancy D.A. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to probe for direct interactions within the context of intact TFIID and SAGA. Briefly, complexes were collected from WCE by fusion proteins consisting of a GST tag, a hexahistidine tag, and the Gal4 or VP16 AD bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described above. The His6tag was then complexed with Ni(II) by short incubation with nickel acetate followed by incubation with the peracid MMPP, which activates the complexed Ni(II) to Ni(III). It has been proposed that this Ni(III) extracts an electron from an aromatic side chain, resulting in the formation of highly reactive radicals that lead to fast and efficient 0Å cross-linking (i.e. direct cross-linking of side chains, without a linker in between). Importantly, it has been documented that even in crude cellular extracts, only those interacting proteins that are complexed with a hexahistidine-tagged protein become cross-linked (19Fancy D.A. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows an outline of the experiment, and Fig. 3 B shows an example of MMPP-dependent, His6-mediated cross-linking of the VP16 and Gal4p ADs to TAF12 within TFIID and/or SAGA in WCE. SAGA and TFIID complexes derived from WCE were bound to the Gal4 and VP16 ADs, cross-linked to the AD with MMPP, and denatured. Cross-linking products were identified by immunoblotting. The top panel of Fig. 3 B shows the blot incubated with anti-TAF12 antibody. In the lane containing the cross-linking reaction with Gal4 AD, the anti-TAF12 antibody recognized three bands, one band of around 61 kDa corresponding to monomeric TAF12, one band at around 120 kDa corresponding to the 60-kDa GST-His6-Gal4AD dimer cross-linked to TAF12, and one band that did not enter the gel corresponding to a high molecular weight complex (see below). In the cross-linking reaction with VP16 AD qualitatively the same 61 kDa and high molecular weight bands were visible. However, instead of the 120-kDa band (i.e. the TAF12(GST-His6-Gal4AD)2 adduct), a band of about 130 kDa was recognized by the anti-TAF12 antibody corresponding to the 70-kDa GST-His6-VP16AD dimer cross-linked to TAF12. The characteristic shift in mobility of the cross-linking complexes, due to the size difference of the Gal4 and VP16 ADs, serves to indicate that the cross-linking complexes recognized by the antibody do indeed contain the two different ADs. Radicals created in the cross-linking reaction can migrate through more than one protein in a complex and can thus cause high molecular weight complexes as well (19Fancy D.A. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The protein complexes not entering the gel are likely such high molecular weight complexes and were not analyzed further. Only cross-linked complexes consisting solely of the GST-His6-AD and the subunit detected by the antibody are indicative of direct interaction. The anti-TAF12 blot shown at the top of Fig. 2 Bwas then stripped and reprobed with anti-Ada2 antibody to determine whether cross-linked AD-Ada2p adducts had also been formed in the same samples and experiment. Like TAF12, Ada2p is also part of the SAGA complex and was retained by the Gal4 and VP16 ADs to the same degree as TAF12 (cf. lanes 2–4, top and bottomblots of Fig. 2 B). However, no cross-linking product of the correct size was observed between Ada2p and either AD (Fig.2 B, lower panel), suggesting that the ADs bind the SAGA complex without directly contacting Ada2p. Untagged SAGA specifically binds to Ni-agarose and can be efficiently separated from TFIID by metal affinity chromatography (20Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yares J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Hexahistidine-mediated cross-linking might therefore also occur within SAGA in the absence of the His6-tagged AD. To test this possibility, we repeated the above experiment with GST-Gal4AD lacking the His6 tag. As expected, GST-Gal4AD retained TAF12 just as efficiently as GST-His6-Gal4AD, however, no TAF12-AD adducts were observed when the GST-AD-SAGA beads were treated with cross-linker (Fig. 3 C). We conclude that the SAGA component TAF12 does not form cross-linking products in the absence of an introduced His6 tag. These data provide additional support for the specificity of the observed AD-TAF12 adducts described above. Having demonstrated the utility of this chemical cross-linking approach, we next performed identical binding and cross-linking reactions with extracts that allowed analysis of each subunit of TFIID and SAGA in turn. Only TAF2 was not examined as we were neither able to genomically tag TAF2 nor reproducibly detect this TAF with our polyclonal anti-TAF2 IgG. Another limitation of our technique applies to the Tra1p subunit of SAGA. The Tra1 monomer has a size of 430 kDa, close to the exclusion limit of the SDS-PAGE gels used. We were therefore not able to separate a potential cross-linked product (i.e. Tra1 and the ADs, M r 430 + 60 kDa) from monomeric Tra1. Each experiment was repeated several times with independently prepared extracts and with different concentrations of cross-linking reagents, with equivalent results. In this extensive series of experiments, in addition to TAF12, we found that TBP, TAF4, TAF6, and Ada1p directly cross-linked to both Gal4 and VP16 ADs (Fig.2 B). In no case have we observed differential interaction of either AD with the five target proteins. Importantly, although all other subunits were retained specifically and to a very similar degree by GST-AD beads, consistent with TFIID and SAGA being intact, we did not detect any specific cross-linking complexes with any of the other TFIID and SAGA subunits (Fig. 4). With the exception of TBP, the proteins cross-linked contained histone-fold motifs and were the ones with homology to histones H2A (TAF4 and Ada1), H2B (TAF12), and H4 (TAF6) in both complexes. The characteristic mobility shift of cross-linking complexes from Gal4 versus VP16 reactions argued strongly that these ADs were present in the cross-linked products. To further confirm this conclusion, we engineered a TEV protease cleavage site between the N-terminal tags and the VP16 AD. We reasoned that if the putative AD-protein complexes truly contain the VP16 AD, TEV cleavage should induce a significant mobility shift upon SDS-PAGE fractionation of the digested complexes (see schematic in Fig.5 A). We used this TEV-cleavage approach to examine all five of the AD-protein complexes that we had positively scored for direct interactions in our standard cross-linking protocol (i.e. TBP, TAF4, TAF6, TAF12, and Ada1). After pull-down and cross-linking, half of the reactions were incubated with TEV protease before denaturation (Fig. 5 A). In every case, TEV cleavage induced the predicted dramatic mobility change in these complexes (Fig. 5 B), demonstrating that the cross-linking complexes did indeed contain the AD. The two major TEV cleavage products correspond to cross-linked adducts in which one or both of the TEV protease sites were cleaved (cf. Fig. 5 A: TAF4, TAF6, TAF12, Ada1). Note that the cross-linking and cleavage experiment with the TBP-HA3-tagged strain was performed with a different preparation of AD-fusion protein, which, due to a read-through product, migrates as two distinct monomer bands on SDS-PAGE and consequently gives rise to three different forms of dimers. Like the dimeric fusion protein by itself, both the uncleaved cross-linking product as well as the singly and doubly cleaved complexes migrate as characteristic triplet bands, providing additional proof for the presence of the VP16 AD in the cross-linking complex and in the proteolytic cleavage products. Ada2p and TAF9 did not cross-link to the Gal4 and VP16 ADs when probed within the context of intact complexes in WCE (Figs. 3 B and 4). However, it has been reported that recombinant Ada2p (35Barlev N.A. Candau R. Wang L. Darpino P. Silverman N. Berger S.L. J. Biol.

One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the AD-interacting surfaces of these factors are not accessible in the native complexes but are only (artificially) exposed when in the absence of their normal binding partners. Alternatively, these proteins could also bind ADs in the context of their multiprotein complexes, but our cross-linking method fails to work efficiently with these two proteins. Although the proposed mechanism of hexahistidine-mediated cross-linking does not predict such a selectivity for the target proteins, it was important to experimentally address this possibility. We therefore isolated the ADA2 andTAF9-HA2 genes and expressed and purified the corresponding proteins from E. coli. To avoid any potential driving of cross-linking efficiencies by mass action, the concentrations of recombinant Ada2p and TAF9-HA2 in binding and cross-linking reactions were chosen to be in the same concentration range (about 1 nm) used in the cross-linking experiments with WCE (Figs. 3 and 4). As shown in Fig.6, both recombinant Ada2p and TAF9-HA2, as well as TBP as a positive control, bound and cross-linked to the Gal4 and VP16 ADs. We conclude that the inabili"

The minus strand transfer mechanism in human immunodeficiency virus-1 was examined in vitro with purified protein and substrates. Blocking donor RNA 5′-end cleavage inhibited transfers when template homology was 19 nucleotides (nt) or less. Cleavage of the donor 5′-end occurred prior to formation of transfer products. This suggests that when template homology is short, transfer occurs through a primer terminus switch-initiated mechanism, which requires cleavage of the donor 5′ terminus. On templates with 26-nt and longer homology, transfer occurred before cleavage of the donor 5′ terminus. Transfer was unaffected when donor 5′-end cleavages were blocked but was reduced when internal cleavages within the donor were restricted. Based on the overall data, we conclude that in human immunodeficiency virus-1, which contains a 97-nt R sequence, minus strand transfer occurs through an acceptor invasion-initiated mechanism. Transfer is initiated at internal regions of the homologous R sequence without requiring cleavage at the donor 5′-end. The acceptor invades at gaps created by reverse transcriptase-RNase H in the donor-cDNA hybrid. The fragmented donor is eventually strand-displaced by the acceptor, completing the transfer.

Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar and reference therein). This process is catalyzed by the virus-encoded enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT).1 RT has two enzymatic activities, the DNA polymerase and the RNase H activities. Reverse transcription is initiated by the partial annealing between the cellular tRNALys3 primer and the viral primer binding site, which is located near the 5′-end of the viral RNA. Synthesis proceeds to the 5′-end of the genomic RNA, creating the minus strand strong stop DNA (−sssDNA), which comprises all of the U5 and R sequences from the 5′-untranslated region. During minus strand synthesis, RT simultaneously cleaves the copied RNA using its RNase H activity. This frees the −sssDNA, enabling its transfer to the homologous R sequence in the 3′-untranslated region and continuation of minus strand synthesis. This step is called minus strand strong stop transfer (minus strand transfer), and it is obligatory for reverse transcription and viral replication. Extensive studies have identified the RT-RNase H activity, R sequence homology, and viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein as important components for minus strand transfer (see Ref. 2Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase.

HIV-1 RT has been shown to partially cleave the template RNA during polymerization, leaving RNA fragments annealed to the cDNA (9DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A.

Since there are 50–100 RTs and only two copies of the RNA genome in a viral particle (11Vogt V.M. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Labortatory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 27-69Google Scholar), RTs not involved in polymerization are available for cleaving these fragments. The RNase H acts independently of polymerization in these reactions, serving to clear off the partially degraded RNA fragments left after the partial RNA removal associated with polymerization. Failure to detect significant amounts of −sssDNA in the infected cell cytoplasm indicates that minus strand transfer is an efficient event in vivo (12Varmus H.E. Heasley S. Kung H.J. Oppermann H.

In HIV-1, the R region is 97 nt long and contains all of the TAR hairpin and part of the poly(A) hairpin. Studies with mutations within the R segment indicate that transfers predominantly take place after the DNA synthesis reaches the 5′-end of the genome (14Lobel L.I. Goff S.P. J.

Deletion and mutational analysis of the R region shows that not all the R region is required for transfer in HIV-1. HIV-1 can still effectively complete replication with an R homology much shorter than 97 nt (20Berkhout B. van Wamel J. Klaver B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 59-69Google Scholar). In murine leukemia virus, an R region with as little as 12 or 14 nt does not affect transfer significantly (21Dang Q. Hu W.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 809-820Google Scholar, 22Pfeiffer J.K. Telesnitsky A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11263-11274Google Scholar). In addition to homology, RNA structure has also been implicated in the minus strand transfer mechanism (17Kulpa D. Topping R. Telesnitsky A.

It is estimated that one molecule of NC protein coats about 7 nt of genomic RNA in vivo (25Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder II, R.C. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K.

NC has been shown to function in several steps of viral replication, including genomic RNA maturation, reverse transcription, and integration. NC displays nucleic acid chaperone activity, catalyzing the melting, reannealing, and folding of nucleic acid into their most stable conformations (31–44). All of these have important implications in strand transfer and reverse transcription. NC protein noticeably stimulates transfer in reconstituted in vitro systems. The strand annealing and chaperone activities of NC plus its effects on RT-RNase H have been implicated in facilitating the transfer reaction (34Tsuchihashi Z. Brown P.O. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 4370-4378Google Scholar). Analyses in vitrohave been used to show that NC inhibits the formation of dead end, self-primed products from the −sssDNA, allowing it to be used for transfers (38Guo J. Henderson L.E. Bess J. Kane B. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5178-5188Google Scholar, 49Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Google Scholar, 50Driscoll M.D. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8785-8792Google Scholar). In addition, NC has been shown to stimulate RT-RNase H activity, especially on a blunt-ended substrate (33Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13817-13823Google Scholar, 43Wisniewski M. Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28400-28410Google Scholar). Although direct interaction between NC and RT has been reported (51Lener D. Tanchou V. Roques B.P. Le Grice S.F. Darlix J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33781-33786Google Scholar,52Druillennec S. Caneparo A. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11283-11288Google Scholar), the nature of such interactions is unclear.Two possible mechanisms can be envisioned for minus strand transfer (Fig. 1). In the first, transfer primarily involves switching of the 3′ terminus of the fully extended strong stop DNA from the donor to the acceptor. Here, the degradation of the genomic RNA, specifically at the 5′-end, is required to release the primer terminus such that it is free to anneal to the acceptor. This is therefore referred to as the primer terminus switch-initiated pathway. The second, referred to as acceptor invasion-initiated pathway, proposes that RNase H cleavages within the internal regions of the donor RNA are critical in facilitating the transfer. The homologous acceptor RNA anneals to the cDNA at gaps created within the donor RNA template and initiates the transfer well behind the primer terminus. The acceptor template strand displaces the fragmented donor and captures the primer terminus, thereby completing the transfer.Using a reconstituted HIV-1 R sequence-based transfer system, we set out to test the primary pathway for minus strand transfer in HIV-1. Templates with longer homology supported more transfers, and NC protein further enhanced the efficiency. Inhibiting internal RNase H cleavages within the donor reduced transfer with long homology. However, inhibiting cleavages at the donor 5′-end specifically inhibited transfers only for short (and not for long) homology template systems. In long homology templates, in the presence of NC, transfer products were formed before degradation of the donor 5′-end. The overall data support that minus strand transfer in retroviruses with long R sequences, such as HIV-1, occurs through an acceptor invasion-initiated mechanism that does not require terminal cleavages at the 5′-end of R. Whereas DNA synthesis is completed to the 5′-end of the R sequence, the transfer is initiated well behind the primer terminus and is promoted through internal RNase H cleavages with the donor template and the strand exchange and chaperone activities of NC.RESULTSResults from our laboratory and others have shown that during −sssDNA synthesis, cleavage of the genomic RNA at the 5′-end is relatively inefficient, leaving a 14–15-nt fragment annealed to the 3′-end of the extended DNA (43Wisniewski M.

However, sequence analysis of the transfer product suggests that most RT copies all of the 5′ R sequence before the transfer occurs (15Ramsey C.A. Panganiban A.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4114-4121Google Scholar, 16Klaver B. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 137-144Google Scholar, 17Kulpa D. Topping R. Telesnitsky A.

Virol. 2000; 74: 8324-8334Google Scholar). These observations led us to hypothesize two possible transfer processes shown in Fig.1. The primer terminus switch-initiated pathway predicts that the transfer is initiated through annealing of the 3′ terminal region (10–20 nt) of the fully extended −sssDNA to the acceptor template. In this mechanism, degradation of the 5′-end genomic RNA fragments is important to allow the critical annealing step. The acceptor invasion-initiated pathway, on the other hand, is unaffected by the presence of the uncleaved 5′-end RNA fragments. Instead, transfers would depend on initiation of DNA-acceptor template interaction at a site internal to the primer terminus and a propagation of that interaction to the 3′ terminus of the strong stop DNA. RNA in the path of the propagation, including the terminal segment, would be presumably displaced. An efficient invasion mechanism would therefore require an extended homology between the donor and acceptor templates.Cleavage at the 5′-End of the HIV-1 Genome after −sssDNA Synthesis Is Poor and Is Facilitated by NC ProteinCharacterization of RT-RNase H cleavage shows that on RNA fragments annealed to a DNA template, RT preferentially binds the RNA 5′-end, making a cut 18–19 nt from the RNA 5′-end (59Gopalakrishnan V.

We refer to the 18–19-nt and 8–10-nt cuts as the primary and the secondary cuts, respectively, based on their rate of formation (55Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Google Scholar). On blunt-ended hybrid substrates, where the RNA 5′-end is flush with the DNA 3′-end, secondary cleavages are less efficient and stimulated by NC protein (43Wisniewski M. Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28400-28410Google Scholar). This was true for substrates comprising nonviral or HIV-1 R sequences (43Wisniewski M. Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28400-28410Google Scholar).In the current study, we analyzed the role of the RNase H cleavages during the course of minus strand DNA synthesis and transfer. A 71-nt RNA template (D71) corresponding to the 5′-end of the HIV-1 genome was used as the donor template, and minus strand DNA synthesis was initiated using a DNA primer (Fig. 2,A and B). Synthesis to the end of the donor RNA would create a blunt-ended hybrid substrate. Overall RNA degradation of the template (overall RNase H) and formation of the 5′-end 8–10-nt cleavage product (secondary cut) were examined in the presence and absence of NC (Fig. 2, A and B). For comparison, RNase H cleavages were also examined on preformed blunt-ended and recessed substrates (Fig. 2, C and D). For the preformed substrates, D71 RNA was annealed to appropriate cDNAs to generate blunt-ended and recessed substrates. In the absence of NC, both the overall RNase H and secondary cut at the donor 5′-end were lower when examined during synthesis than with the preformed blunt-ended hybrid substrate (Fig. 2, compare A andC with B and D). This is not surprising, considering that in the synthesis reactions, the substrate for RNase H cleavage had to be created during the reaction. The presence of NC (at 200% coating; i.e. 1 NC/3.5 nt) during minus strand DNA synthesis increased the overall RNase H cleavage by 50% (Fig. 2 A) and the 8–10-nt cut at the RNA 5′-end by 100% (Fig. 2 B). With the preformed substrates in the absence of NC, the 8–10-nt terminal cut was slower for the blunt-ended substrate as compared with the recessed substrate (Fig. 2 D). This result was consistent with those observed previously with the shorter 28- and 41-nt viral and nonviral substrates (43Wisniewski M. Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28400-28410Google Scholar). In comparison, NC stimulation of RNase H, in particular the 8–10-nt cut, was more significant on preformed blunt-ended substrate as compared with those during synthesis (Fig. 2, compare B andD). At 200% NC coating, the 8–10-nt cut efficiency on the blunt-ended substrate was enhanced by 4–5-fold, making it comparable with that on the recessed substrate (Fig. 2 D). NC did not alter the specificity of RNase H cuts on any of the substrates tested (data not shown). This suggests that NC not only stimulates RT-RNase H during synthesis but also specifically stimulates the 8–10-nt cut at the blunt end of an RNA/DNA hybrid.Figure 2Effect of NC on RNA 5′-end cleavages.Schematics of the substrates used are indicated, with RNA ingray and DNA in black.

Quantitation was based on at least three independent experiments. Overall RNase H was determined as 100 × (1 − radioactivity of the full-length RNA/radioactivity of the whole lane), whereas the secondary cut was determined as 100 × (radioactivity of the 8–10-nt product/radioactivity of the whole lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of Homology on TransferTo determine the most likely pathway for minus strand transfer in HIV-1, we designed a transfer system in vitro using the HIV-1 R sequences (Fig.3 A).

All four acceptor templates (A12h, A19h, A26h, and A45h) shared the same 5′-end but differed at the 3′-end, such that they generated 12, 19, 26, and 45 nucleotides of homology, respectively, with the 5′-end of the donor template (Fig. 3 A). This ensured that the transfer product remained the same size (90 nt) irrespective of the acceptor used.Figure 3Effect of template homology on minus strong stop transfer. A, schematic of the minus strand transfer system and sequences of the substrates used in the study. Description of the schematic is the same as in Fig. 1. Theasterisk indicates the position of the 32P label. DNA sequences are in italics. Length of homology between the donor and acceptor RNA are indicated across from each acceptor. B, extension assay were performed in the absence of acceptor (lanes 1–5) and in the presence of acceptors A12h (lanes 6–10), A19h (lanes 11–15), A26h (lanes 16–20), and A45h (lanes 21–25). Reactions were performed in the absence of NC (lanes 1, 6, 11,16, and 21) or in the presence of 200% (lanes 2, 7, 12,17, and 22), 400% (lanes 3, 8, 13, 18, and23), 800% (lanes 4, 9,14, 19, and 24), and 1200% (lanes 5, 10, 15,20, and 25) NC protein. L, the 10-bp DNA ladder. Transfer product (T), self-priming product (SF), full-length donor extension product (FL), and primer (P) are indicated. C, quantitation of transfer efficiencies from assays with the D71 donors. Quantitation was based on at least three independent experiments. Transfer efficiency was defined as 100 × transfer product/(full-length product + self-priming product + transfer product).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Primer extension on the donor template resulted in a 71-nt full-length donor extension product (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). In addition, an 85-nt product was also detected, resulting from self-priming of the full-length extension product. A ladder of pause sites was observed from position 47 through 53. Analysis of the predicted secondary structure of this region suggested that the pausing ladder was due to displacement synthesis through an alternate hairpin structure formed from refolding of the template, as shown previously (50Driscoll M.D. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8785-8792Google Scholar).We next examined transfers, using the four different acceptor RNA templates (Fig. 3 B). An expected 90-nt transfer product was detected in all of the reactions with acceptor template. Similar synthesis profiles were observed with the donor extension and transfer reactions, with respect to pausing sites, full-length donor extension, and self-priming products. Quantitative values for the transfer efficiencies are shown in Fig. 3 C. In the absence of NC, transfer products were almost undetectable, with the acceptor having the shortest homology, A12h (Fig. 3 B, comparelane 6 with lanes 11,16, and 21). Increasing the homology to 19 nt (Fig. 3 B, lane 11) resulted in a 1.9% transfer efficiency (Fig. 3 C), whereas both 26-nt (Fig.3 B, lane 16) and 45-nt (Fig.3 B, lane 21) homologies yielded transfer efficiencies of 3.6 and 4.2%, respectively (Fig.3 C). Data indicate that within a certain range, increasing the length of homology between donor and acceptor increased strand transfer efficiency.NC protein has been shown to stimulate strand transfer and inhibit self-priming (3Luo G.X.

We therefore examined the effect of NC on transfers as template homology was increased. The amount of NC was titrated to achieve from 100 to 1200% coating of the substrates. The presence of NC did not alter the overall extension profile in the absence or presence of acceptor (Fig.3 B). 100% NC coating had no obvious effect on transfer efficiency and self-priming for the four substrates (data not shown). As NC concentration was increased to 200% coating, a noticeable increase in transfer product together with a slight decrease in self-priming product was generally observed (Fig. 3 B,lanes 7, 12, 17, and22). Subsequent increases in NC concentration further enhanced transfer efficiency (Fig. 3, B and C). With the 12-nt homology substrate, transfer efficiency increased 22-fold with 400 and 800% NC coating but decreased as NC was further increased to 1200% coating. For longer homologies of 19, 26, and 45 nt, transfer efficiencies increased up to 39, 65, and 46%, respectively, with 1200% NC coating (Fig. 3 B(lanes 15, 20, and 25) and 3C). The slight decrease of transfer efficiency from 26- to 45-nt homology will be discussed later. This set of reactions was also performed using the 55-amino acid form of NC protein, and results with the same trend were obtained (data not shown). Overall, NC was found to increase transfer efficiency, while slightly decreasing self-priming, in a concentration-dependent manner.Blocking Donor RNA 5′-End Cleavage Inhibits Transfer with Short but Not Long Homo"
https://openalex.org/W1999294768,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of lipoproteins, providing tissues like adipose tissue or skeletal muscle with fatty acids. LPL is also expressed in the brain, fulfilling yet unknown functions. Using a neuroblastoma cell line transfected with a NEO- or a LPL-expression vector, we have developed a model to study the function of LPL in neurons exposed to native or copper-oxidized lipoproteins. The addition to the culture media of VLDL with 10 μm copper sulfate led to a significant reduction in the viability of NEO transfectants whereas LPL-transfectants were protected from this injury. In the presence of VLDL and CuSO4, LPL transfectants were even able to display significant neurite extension. This neuritogenic effect was also observed in LPL transfectants exposed to native lipoproteins. However, addition of VLDL particles oxidized with CuSO4 prior to their addition to the culture media resulted in neurotoxic effects on LPL transfectants. These findings suggest that the presence of LPL in cultured neuronal cells modulates the physiological response of neurons following exposure to native or oxidized lipoproteins. LPL could thus play a key role in the differentiation of Neuro-2A cells and in the pathophysiological effects of oxidative stress in several neurodegenerative disorders.

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) 1The abbreviations used are: LPL, lipoprotein lipase; apo, apolipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoproteins; NEO, neomycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; VLDL, very low density lipoproteins; ANOVA, analysis of variance; XTT, 2,3-Bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5- carboxanilide is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. LPL is expressed mainly in skeletal muscles and adipose tissues, providing fatty acids to these tissues for β-oxidation or storage (1Santamarina-Fojo S. Dugi K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 117-125Google Scholar). In the brain, strong LPL expression has been detected in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, as well as in other brain areas (2Yacoub L.K. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1845-1852Google Scholar, 3Ben-Zeev O. Doolittle M.H. Singh N. Chang C.H. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1307-1313Google Scholar, 4Lorent K. Overbergh L. Moechars D. De Strooper B. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. Neuroscience. 1995; 65: 1009-1025Google Scholar). Presently, only limited information is available regarding the role of LPL in the brain. Previous studies have shown that LPL can stimulate the neurite extension process in cultured chick sympathetic neurons (5Postuma R.B. Martins R.N. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Strickland D.K. Mok S.S. Small D.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 13-16Google Scholar) and have suggested that mutant forms of LPL may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (6Baum L. Wiebusch H. Pang C.P. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 291-296Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that mechanisms are present in the brain to ensure proper lipid transport and homeostasis (7Roheim P.S. Carey M. Forte T. Vega G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4646-4649Google Scholar, 8Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14352-14360Google Scholar). Various classes of lipoproteins have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid, most of them containing apolipoprotein E (apoE) as their major apolipoprotein (9Demeester N. Castro G. Desrumaux C. De Geitere C. Fruchart J.C. Santens P. Mulleners E. Engelborghs S. De Deyn P.P. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Labeur C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 963-974Google Scholar, 10Koch S. Donarski N. Goetze K. Kreckel M. Stuerenburg H.J. Buhmann C. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1143-1151Google Scholar). In humans, apoE is present in three different isoforms: E2, E3, and E4, each encoded by a different allele. In the brain, specific isoforms of apoE are associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (11Beffert U. Danik M. Krzywkowski P. Ramassamy C. Berrada F. Poirier J. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 27: 119-142Google Scholar) and poor outcome from brain injury (12Sheng H. Laskowitz D.T. Mackensen G.B. Kudo M. Pearlstein R.D. Warner D.S. Stroke. 1999; 30: 1118-1124Google Scholar). It has been postulated that apoE could be involved in the redistribution of cholesterol and phospholipids among neuronal cells involved in synaptogenic processes following brain injury (11Beffert U. Danik M. Krzywkowski P. Ramassamy C. Berrada F. Poirier J. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 27: 119-142Google Scholar).In vitro studies with neuronal cell lines have suggested that alternate apoE effects because of different apoE isoforms may be mediated by lipoprotein receptors, which are involved in the endocytosis of apoE-enriched lipoproteins by neurons (13Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y. Daugherty A. Holtzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Google Scholar, 14Pitas R.E. Nutr. Metab. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1997; 7: 202-209Google Scholar). These multiligand receptors have been identified as important players in neurophysiological mechanisms involved in the long term potentiation of hippocampal cells (15Cavus I. Koo P.H. Teyler T.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 282-288Google Scholar) and in the differentiation of neuronal cell lines (16Narita M. Bu G. Holtzman D.M. Schwartz A.L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 587-595Google Scholar, 17Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J. Nathan B. Mahley R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9480-9484Google Scholar). Cerebrospinal fluid lipoproteins, which have a beneficial role in cholesterol homeostasis in the brain, are found to be susceptible to oxidative modifications. These oxidative processes could be associated with the development of neuropathologies or result from brain injuries (18Arlt S. Finckh B. Beisiegel U. Kontush A. Free Radical Res. 2000; 32: 103-114Google Scholar, 19Hall E.D. Braughler J.M. Res. Publ. Assoc. Res. Nerv. Ment. Dis. 1993; 71: 81-105Google Scholar, 20Robberecht W. J.

Neurol. 2000; 247 Suppl. 2: II82-II94Google Scholar). Several independent studies have described the cytotoxic potential of oxidized lipoproteins on different cell types, including neurons (23Sugawa M. Ikeda S. Kushima Y. Takashima Y. Cynshi O. Brain Res. 1997; 761: 165-172Google Scholar, 24Papassotiropoulos A. Ludwig M. Naib-Majani W. Rao G.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 209: 33-36Google Scholar, 25Keller J.N. Hanni K.B. Pedersen W.A. Cashman N.R. Mattson M.P. Gabbita S.P. Friebe V. Markesbery W.R. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 157: 202-210Google Scholar). The capacity of LPL to act as a ligand for lipoprotein receptors and to synergize with apoE in the uptake of lipoproteins by these receptors (26Mann W.A. Meyer N. Weber W. Rinninger F. Greten H. Beisiegel U. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 880-882Google Scholar, 27Beisiegel U. Heeren J. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1997; 56: 731-737Google Scholar) leads us to hypothesize that LPL could play important physiological functions in neuronal cells and could thus be involved in the processing of native, as well as oxidized lipoproteins in the brain. In the present study, we show that LPL can modulate the physiological response of neuronal cells to native and oxidized triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Human lymphocytes were isolated by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Paque gradient (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from these cells was extracted with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 μg was reverse transcribed with EXPAND reverse transcriptase primed with an oligo(dT15) primer (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of LPL cDNA was carried out using primers LPL-ExtA (5′-GAAAGCTGCCCACTTCTA-3′) and LPL-ExtB (5′-CCTTATTTTACTCTGCGCTC-3′). Each primer was added to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 1 μm. Other components of the reaction consisted of deoxynucleotides (1 mm each), 1× TAQ reaction buffer, and 1 unit of TAQ polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction mixtures were denaturated at 94 °C for 5 min. PCR amplification was then performed using 30 successive cycles of primer annealing (57 °C/1 min), extension (72 °C/1 min), and denaturation (94 °C/1 min). This PCR amplification gave a single DNA fragment of 1894 bp containing the coding sequence of the human LPL gene, including the signal peptide. This fragment was then ligated in pGEM-T vector (Promega) and the identity of the cDNA insert in the resulting construct, pGEM-LPL, was confirmed by sequencing. To prepare a LPL expression vector, the pGEM-LPL plasmid was digested with restriction enzyme, NotI (New England Biolabs Ltd., Mississauga, Canada), and the resulting 1900-bp fragment containing the LPL cDNA was purified using a QIAQUICK gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada). The purified cDNA fragment was ligated into a pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) previously digested with NotI. The resulting constructs were transformed and amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α cells and the colonies were screened for a plasmid containing the LPL cDNA inserted in the sense orientation. This plasmid, pcDNA-LPL, was purified using a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen) and the purified DNA was then subsequently used for the transfection of Neuro-2A cells. Neuro-2A cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). They were grown and transfected at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For experimental protocols requiring Neuro-2A cells cultured in serum- and lipoprotein free-media (N2 media, see Ref. 28Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seiman J.G. Smith J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Greene Publishing Associates-Wiley Intersciences, New York1992: 9.0.1-9.1.9Google Scholar), the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing the following additives: 5 μg/ml insulin, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 20 nm progesterone, 100 μm putrescin, and 30 nm selenium. All media, serum, and supplements were from Sigma. Neuro-2A cells were transiently transfected using calcium/phosphate-precipitated plasmid DNA. Briefly, the cells were rinsed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), trypsinized, counted, and 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 100-mm cell culture Petri dishes (Falcon-BD, Oakville, Canada) containing 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 20 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cell culture media were changed and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2–4 h more before the addition of the calcium/phosphate-precipitated DNA. Either pcDNA-LPL vector or control pcDNA-NEO vector were precipitated by the calcium/phosphate procedure (28Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seiman J.G. Smith J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Greene Publishing Associates-Wiley Intersciences, New York1992: 9.0.1-9.1.9Google Scholar) and aliquots of the precipitates containing 20 μg of DNA were added to each individual 100-mm culture plates. The cells were incubated with the precipitate for 16 h after which the Petri dishes were rinsed with 5 ml of PBS before addition of 10 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 10% fetal bovine serum media. During the next 8 h, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted. In all the experiments, 200,000 cells were seeded in 9.5-cm2well from cell culture grade multiwell plates (Falcon-BD, Oakville, Canada). All human volunteers were normolipidemic individuals who were previously characterized as homozygotes for the apoE3 allele at the Lipid Research Centre according to Hixson and Vernier (29Hixson J.E. Vernier D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 545-548Google Scholar). Human VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) was isolated by ultracentrifugation from fasting plasma. The purity of VLDL was verified by gel electrophoresis using a commercial kit from Beckman Instruments. Apolipoprotein levels in the lipoprotein preparations were determined by an automated nephelometric assay using specific antibodies against apoE, apoB (Dade-Behring, Deerfield, IL), and apoC-II and C-III (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA). Cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid concentrations were determined enzymatically using an automated RA-1000 analyzer (Technicon Instruments, Tarrytown) as previously described (30Cantin B. Brun L.D. Gagne C. Murthy M.R. Lupien P.J. Julien P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 25-31Google Scholar). Purified VLDL were dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl solution for 24 h using Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis cassette with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Pierce). The total protein content of each sample was determined using the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). LPL activities in transient transfectants were determined after incubating Neuro-2A-transfected cells in N2 media for 48 h. When necessary, the culture media were harvested and kept frozen at −80 °C for later determination of LPL activity. The cells were then washed once with PBS and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of N2 media containing 50 units/ml heparin (Sigma). In some experiments, VLDL were added at 40 μg/ml in N2 media and incubated with the cells as described for the N2-heparin media. The N2-heparin or N2-VLDL media were then removed from the culture plate and immediately frozen at −80 °C for LPL activity determinations. Measurements of LPL activities using a 14C-labeled triolein substrate (Amersham Biosciences) were performed as described elsewhere (31Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Google Scholar) in the N2, N2-heparin, and N2-VLDL samples. Following transfection, Neuro-2A cells were incubated in N2 media with 0, 10, 20, or 40 μg/ml of VLDL, based on their total protein concentration. In some experiments, freshly prepared copper sulfate (CuSO4) (Fisher Scientific) was also added to the culture media at 10 μm as an oxidative agent (32Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After this incubation period, culture media were removed and frozen at −80 °C for later determination of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels. To measure the phenotypic differentiation of Neuro-2A transfectants, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (v/v) and stained with Oil Red O (33Zehentner B.K. Leser U. Burtscher H. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 275-281Google Scholar). Photomicrographs were taken with a DAGE-3CCD camera (DAGE-MTI, Michigan City, MI) mounted on an Olympus CK-40 phase-contrast microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY). Following image acquisition, measurement of neurite extension and cell perimeters were performed using ImagePro 4.0 analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Evaluation of cell survival following exposure to lipoproteins and CuSO4was made by the XTT reduction assay as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Laval, Canada). To assess the extent of peroxidation in the culture media containing VLDL and CuSO4, levels of TBARS were measured using the procedure of Hessler et al. (34Hessler J.R. Morel D.W. Lewis L.J. Chisolm G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 215-222Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 200 μl of culture medium was mixed with 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Following protein precipitation, 1 ml of a 1% thiobarbituric acid solution was added to each sample and incubated at 95 °C for 45 min. The tubes were cooled and centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min. Absorbance of the supernatants was determined at 532 nm using a Cary 219 spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA). Malonaldehyde bis(dimethylacetal) (Sigma) diluted in 0.15 m NaCl was used to establish a standard curve. VLDL was diluted with 0.15 m NaCl to a concentration of 600 μg/ml, based on their total protein concentration. Freshly prepared CuSO4 was added at 10 μm to the VLDL suspension. An aliquot was immediately taken out and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 50 μm to prevent the oxidation process. This sample was used as the nonoxidized control VLDL in the following experiments. The remaining VLDL/CuSO4 solution was incubated at 37 °C for 3, 6, or 24 h. At each time point, samples were treated with EDTA and transferred to 4 °C. CuSO4-oxidized VLDL were then dialyzed against a 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% EDTA solution using a Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis cassette with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Pierce). Protein concentrations of the dialyzed samples were determined as indicated for the native VLDL preparation. All VLDL preparations were diluted to a final concentration of 40 μg/ml with N2 media and added to Neuro-2A transfectants. The cells were incubated for 18 h after which cell viability was determined using the XTT reduction assay, as previously described. The extent of VLDL oxidation was assessed using the TBARS assay as described previously. The data were expressed as nanomoles of malonaldehyde/mg of VLDL protein. For each transfectant, the percentage of cell survival was determined by comparing the viability of cells incubated with VLDL preoxidized for 3, 6, or 24 h with the viability of cells incubated with nonoxidized control VLDL (0 h incubation time point). Statistical analyses were performed using the JMP 4.0 software (SAS Institute Canada, Ste-Foy, Canada). The normality of distribution of all data sets was assessed with a Shapiro-Wilks test. For data sets with a normal distribution, Student's t test and standard ANOVA were done to identify significant differences across experimental groups. For sets of data with a non-normal distribution, the Wilcoxon/Kruskall-Wallis and Spearman's nonparametric tests were used. Spearman's nonparametric test was used to assess the degree of correlation between each of the lipoprotein constituents and the observed neurite lengths. The amplified LPL cDNA used in this study contained a single base change at position 1536 (G/A) of the human LPL mRNA (GenBankTM accession number M15856) (35Wion K.L. Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Google Scholar). This constituted a silent polymorphism and did not affect the amino acid sequence of the LPL protein. Calcium/phosphate transfection of Neuro-2A cells with pcDNA-LPL vector resulted in secretion of variable levels of heparin-releasable LPL activity, ranging from 25 to 390 μmol of free fatty acids released per hour, with a mean activity of 132.0 μmol ± 57.2 (mean ± S.E., n = 6). As determined by β-galactosidase staining (data not shown), we consistently observed that ∼30% of the cell population was transfected. The heparin-releasable LPL activity secreted by control NEO transfectants was low at 3 ± 1 μmol of free fatty acids released per hour (mean ± S.E., n = 6). In all experiments (n = 6), a large proportion of the secreted enzyme remained closely associated with the cell surface, as only 13.4 ± 1.9% of total LPL activity was released spontaneously into the culture media, in the absence of added heparin or VLDL. The remaining bound LPL activity was released upon addition of heparin to the media. Interestingly, we observed that VLDL was almost as effective as heparin in releasing LPL from the cell surface. Thus, heparin released a mean LPL activity of 386.8 μmol of free fatty acids per hour (n = 3), compared with an activity of 313.9 μmol of free fatty acids per hour (n = 3) released by VLDL. This suggests that, as observed in adipocytes or endothelial cells (1Santamarina-Fojo S. Dugi K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 117-125Google Scholar, 36Hata A. Ridinger D.N. Sutherland S. Emi M. Shuhua Z. Myers R.L. Ren K. Cheng T. Inoue I. Wilson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8447-8457Google Scholar), the secreted LPL remains associated with cell surface proteoglycans present on Neuro-2A cells and can be released by either heparin or VLDL (37Zambon A.

To determine the impact of LPL expression on cell morphology and differentiation following exposure to lipoproteins, LPL and control NEO transfectants were incubated in the presence of VLDL. VLDL particles were isolated from five apoE 3/3 normolipidemic donors. Cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid concentrations of donor plasma and VLDL particles as well as the apolipoprotein composition of VLDL were determined and are shown in Table I. The effect of VLDL oxidation on cell differentiation and survival was also evaluated following the addition of CuSO4, a pro-oxidative agent, to the culture media containing native VLDL. Representative photomicrographs of NEO- and LPL-transfected Neuro-2A cells exposed to VLDL with or without CuSO4 are shown in Fig.1. There were no significant morphological changes visible between LPL and control NEO transfectants incubated in the N2 media alone (Fig. 1, A versus E), indicating that LPL expression by itself was not sufficient to trigger pathways leading to phenotypic differentiation of Neuro-2A cells. Similarly, addition of CuSO4 alone to the N2 media (Fig. 1, C and G) did not induce any significant morphological changes in either the LPL or NEO transfectants. However, following the addition of VLDL to the culture media (Fig. 1, B and F), striking differences were observed in the morphology of the LPL-transfected cells as compared with NEO transfectants. In LPL-secreting cells (Fig.1 F), addition of VLDL markedly stimulated the extension of neurites and induced a significant enlargement of cell volume. Oil Red O staining demonstrated the presence of intracellular vesicles filled with lipids probably resulting from endocytosis of lipoproteins (Fig.1 F). No such lipid vesicles were detected in LPL transfectants cultured in N2 media alone (Fig. 1 E), or in NEO transfectants incubated with or without VLDL (Fig. 1, Band A). In the presence of VLDL and 10 μmCuSO4, there was a marked reduction in the number of NEO transfectants (Fig. 1 D). However, the LPL transfectants were not affected by CuSO4 (Fig. 1 H) and the cells continued to extend neurites as in the case of LPL transfectants incubated with VLDL alone (Fig. 1 F).Table ILipid and lipoprotein composition of human plasma and VLDL used in the present studiesnConcentration1-aMean ± S.E.Plasma lipids (millimoles/liter)Cholesterol54.50 ± 0.28Triglycerides51.30 ± 0.17Phospholipids32.48 ± 0.07VLDL lipids (millimoles/liter)Cholesterol51.96 ± 0.13Triglycerides54.54 ± 0.23Phospholipids51.49 ± 0.08VLDL apoproteins (milligrams/liter)ApoE540.50 ± 2.89ApoB5450 ± 30ApoC-II552.67 ± 1.24ApoC-III5209.33 ± 12.61Plasma lipids, VLDL lipids, and VLDL apoproteins were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a Mean ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Plasma lipids, VLDL lipids, and VLDL apoproteins were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The morphological changes in neurons consequent to the additions of VLDL and CuSO4 were quantified by computer analysis of the photomicrographs and the data are presented in Fig.2. At 10 μg/ml VLDL, the mean neurite length of LPL transfectants had increased by 250% when compared with cells incubated in N2 media alone, extending from 17.65 to 44.19 μm (Fig. 2 A). No further increase in neurite outgrowth was found in LPL transfectants when incubated with higher concentrations of VLDL ranging up to 40 μg/ml (Fig. 2 A). Neurite extension because of VLDL was accompanied by simultaneous increases in cell diameter as indicated by a 150% increase in cell volume, observed in LPL transfectants (Fig. 2 B). As shown earlier (Fig.1 F), this cell enlargement was concomitant with the intracellular accumulation of lipid vesicles. In control NEO cells, addition of VLDL had no effect on neurite length and cell size, but it significantly increased the number of neurites per cell (Fig.2 C). In contrast, the number of neurites per cell was not affected by VLDL in LPL-transfected cells. Following simultaneous addition of VLDL and 10 μm CuSO4 to the culture media, the number of neurites per NEO cell (Fig. 2 C) decreased considerably whereas in LPL-transfected cells incubated with VLDL, the addition of CuSO4 had no significant effect either on the neurite extension (Fig. 2 A) or the increase in cell size (Fig. 2 B) or the number of neurite per cell (Fig.2 C), as compared with those observed with VLDL alone. In view of the observation that lipid uptake by Neuro-2A cells leads to neurite extension, it was of interest to ascertain which of the principal components of the VLDL may be responsible for this effect. As neurons are not normally exposed to substantial concentrations of VLDL, identification of the key components of VLDL that mediate neurite extension might point to other potential lipid or lipoprotein molecules that may be physiologically relevant in neurite extension. With this in mind, we performed Pearson's correlation analyses between the main VLDL components and the neurite length observed in LPL transfectants across seven independent experiments. Using this strategy, we found that three of the VLDL constituents (triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids) showed strong and significant degrees of correlation with neurite lengths observed in these experiments (TableII). No correlation was found for apoE, suggesting that LPL may well serve the purpose of ligand for lipid receptors on the neurons (53de Chaves E.I. Rusinol A.E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J.

Open table in a new tab Spearman's nonparametric correlation analysis was performed, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The LPL and the control NEO transfectants were incubated in the presence of 40 μg/ml VLDL. To better understand the vulnerability of Neuro-2A upon exposure to VLDL and CuSO4, the viability of Neuro-2A transfectants and the accumulation of lipoperoxidation products in the culture media were measured. The degree of cell survival in Neuro-2A transfectants was evaluated by the XTT reduction assay, and the accumulation of peroxidation products was measured by the levels of TBARS in the culture media. Addition of VLDL alone to LPL and NEO transfectants did not affect cell survival, as both cell types exhibited a 100% survival rate at each of the VLDL concentrations tested, ranging from 0 to 40 μg/ml (Fig.3 A). Addition of CuSO4 (10 μm) to N2 media containing 0–20 μg/ml VLDL also had no effect on the survival of the two neuronal transfectants. However, when the VLDL concentration was elevated to 40 μg/ml (in the presence of Cu2+), this caused a 72% reduction in the viability of NEO transfectants whereas LPL transfectants remained fully viable even under these conditions (Fig.3 B). The degree of oxidation of VLDL particles was measured by determining the production of TBARS in the culture media following incubation with increasing concentrations of VLDL and 10 μmCuSO4. In the absence of neuronal cells, incubation of N2 media with 40 μg/ml VLDL plus 10 μm CuSO4induced a 2-fold production of TBARS as compared with N2 media without VLDL (Fig. 4 A). At concentrations of VLDL lower than 40 μg/ml, there were no significant changes in the level of TBARS under the conditions used in these experiments.

The mechanisms by which such recruitment takes place are not well understood. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate dynamic alterations in the abundance of histones H2A, H3, and H4 at promoters of genes regulated by the HSF and Gal4 activators ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcriptional activation of these genes, particularly those regulated by HSF, is accompanied by a significant reduction in both acetylated and unacetylated histones at promoters and may involve the transient displacement of histone octamers. To gain insight into the function of ADs, we conducted a genetic screen to identify polypeptides that could substitute for the 340-residue C-terminal activator of HSF and rescue the temperature sensitivity caused by its deletion. We found that thets− phenotype of HSF(1–493) could be complemented by peptides as short as 11 amino acids. Such peptides are enriched in acidic and hydrophobic residues, and exhibit bothtrans-activating and chromatin-modifying activities when fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. We also demonstrate that a previously identified 14-amino acid histone H3-binding module of human CTF1/NF1, which is similar to synthetic ADs, can substitute for the HSF C-terminal activator in conferring temperature resistance and can mediate the modification of promoter chromatin structure.

Activation domains (ADs)1 of gene-specific transcription factors are critical for these recruitment steps. ADs are believed to work by directly contacting coactivators, components of the mediator complex and basal transcriptional machinery, and polymerase II holoenzyme itself (reviewed in Refs. 1Ptashne M.

In certain cases, the biochemical data have been buttressed by mutational analyses showing a correlation between the change in the affinity of these contacts and transcriptional activity in vivo (7Koh S.S.

Howe L. Sousa K. Alley S.C. Carrozza M.J. Tan S. Workman J.L. Science. 2001; 292: 2333-2337Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that recruitment of coactivators is often sequential and gene-specific (13Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Google Scholar, 14Krebs J.E. Fry C.J.

Despite these advances, there is little clarity of how multiple factors are recruited to a given promoter or what determines their order of recruitment. An important quality of ADs is that they can substitute for one another not only between transcription factors of a given species, but also between transcription factors from such diverse eukaryotes as human, fungi, and plants. This suggests some uniformity in the mechanism(s) by which ADs work and implies that ADs share sequence or structural homology. In fact, although most ADs fall into one of three categories, acidic, glutamine-rich, or proline-rich, there is no consensus sequence or clear homology, even within a particular class. Moreover, ADs often lack any discernable secondary structure (1Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Google Scholar, 16Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Google Scholar, 17Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Google Scholar, 18Cho H.S. Liu C.W. Damberger F.F. Pelton J.G. Nelson H.C. Wemmer D.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 262-269Google Scholar). The conservation of mechanism in the absence of any sequence or structural homology is paradoxical and reflects a gap in our understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Recruitment of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and histone modifying enzymes to gene promoters is especially important since chromatin remodeling is a fundamental prerequisite to transcriptional activation. It has been shown that yeast Swi/Snf and histone acetyltransferase-containing complexes interact in vitro with a variety of transcription activators, including Gal4, Gcn4, Swi5, and Gal4-VP16 (7Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Google Scholar, 8Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Wallberg A.E. Steger D.J. Cairns B.R. Wright A.P. Workman J.L. Mol.

Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 498-502Google Scholar). Recruitment of the SAGA complex by ADs of Gal4 and Gal4-VP16 has also been demonstrated in vivo(19Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Google Scholar, 20Larschan E. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Google Scholar). Recent investigations employing photo-cross-linking label transfer methodology identified the Tra1 subunit of SAGA and three subunits of the Swi/Snf complex (Snf5, Swi1, and Swi2/Snf2) as primary targets of a number of ADs (11Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Brown C.E. Howe L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1615-1625Google Scholar, 12Brown C.E. Howe L. Sousa K. Alley S.C. Carrozza M.J. Tan S. Workman J.L. Science. 2001; 292: 2333-2337Google Scholar). In these studies a strong correlation was observed between the level of transcription and strength of AD-target interactions for mutated ADs. Yet the multiplicity of targets capable of interacting with the same AD suggests the existence of a hierarchy of recruitment steps in vivo, and how such a hierarchy might be established is unknown. Heat shock factor (HSF) is a key transcriptional activator of stress-responsive genes in yeast. It is also responsible for establishing the constitutive DNase I hypersensitive chromatin structures within the promoter regions of at least two genes,HSP82 and HSC82 (21Gross D.S. Adams C.C. Lee S. Stentz B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3931-3945Google Scholar, 22Erkine A.M. Adams C.C. Diken T. Gross D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7004-7017Google Scholar). As such, it is likely that HSF recruits nucleosome-remodeling and histone-modifying activities to target promoters using its ADs. Yeast HSF is comprised of a highly conserved core, consisting of DNA-binding and trimerization domains, and two activation domains, one located at the N terminus and the other at the C terminus (Fig. 1). The N-terminal activator (NTA) has been shown to be critical for the transient heat shock response of the cell, while the C-terminal activator (CTA) is important for sustained stimuli, and its deletion results in lethality at elevated temperatures (23Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Google Scholar, 24Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Google Scholar). As HSF has been shown to bypass the requirement for a number of key PIC components, including TFIIA, TAF17, Srb4, Srb6, Kin28, and the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of polymerase II (25Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A. Holstege F.C. Wang J. Young R.A. Green M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 653-661Google Scholar, 26Lee D. Lis J.T. Nature. 1998; 393: 389-392Google Scholar, 27Lee D.K. Kim S. Lis J.T.

Genetics. 1999; 153: 1573-1581Google Scholar), the targets of its ADs may extend beyond the typical repertoire of most yeast activators (27Lee D.K. Kim S. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2934-2939Google Scholar). In this work, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to provide evidence for dynamic alterations of chromatin structure at heat shock promoters upon induction. Similar changes in histone content are observed at two promoters regulated by the Gal4 activator,GAL1 and GAL7. For both sets of genes, chromatin remodeling depends on the presence of an AD in the corresponding gene-specific activator. Using a genetic screen, we found that the temperature sensitivity associated with deletion of the HSF CTA can be alleviated by substituting short synthetic peptides enriched in hydrophobic and acidic residues for the large, native C-terminal domain. These peptides also function as ADs when tethered to the heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain. At least some of them can trigger histone modifications at Gal4-regulated promoters. The nature of these peptides suggests that their interacting targets likely are hydrophobic and basic, pointing toward histones as possible targets. Consistent with this notion, we found that the ts −phenotype resulting from a CTA deletion can be rescued by fusing short histone-binding modules, derived from either human CTF1/NF1 or the mouse liver-specific activator HNF3, to HSF(1–493). Two yeast strains were used in the experiments described here: PS128 (MATaade2–1 trp1–1 can1–100 leu2,3–112 his3–11 ura3 hsf1Δ2::LEU2 carrying HSF1 on a YCp50-based plasmid) (23Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Google Scholar); and PJ69–4A (MATatrp1–901 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ) (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar). Saccharromyces cerevisiaestrains were cultivated at 30 °C to early log phase (1–2 × 107 cells/ml) in rich YPD broth supplemented with 0.04 mg/ml adenine. Heat shock induction was achieved by transferring 110 ml of cultures to a vigorously shaking 39 °C waterbath; once the temperature had risen to 39 °C, incubation was allowed to continue for an additional 15 min or 4 h. For GAL gene induction, cells were cultivated in rich medium as above, except containing 2% galactose rather than 2% glucose. In vivo cross-linking/chromatin immunoprecipitation was conducted essentially as described (32Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 403-414Google Scholar), except that PCR amplification was for 23 cycles, not 25. Our procedure differs from other yeast histone ChIP protocols (14Krebs J.E. Fry C.J. Samuels M.L. Peterson C.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 587-598Google Scholar, 38Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Google Scholar) in that the wash steps following incubation with antibodies included (i) 1% Triton rather than 0.1% SDS and (ii) either 500 mm NaCl or 250 mm LiCl instead of 150 mm NaCl. Linearity of the PCR was confirmed through use of 3-fold serial dilutions of template DNA. Polyclonal anti-histone H4 (tetra-acetylated isoform), anti-histone H3 (unacetylated isoform), anti-histone H3 (Lys-14 mono-acetylated isoform), and anti-histone H2A (residues 88–97) antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Promoter-specific primers used in this study were as follows:HSP12, ATACGCAAGCATTAATACAACCCACA, AGAGAGAGATTAAATAAGATCAAACGCA; HSP26, CGGAATAGTAACCGTCTTTACATGAACA, AACAGATCTCTAACTAATGGAGGTCCTA;HSP82, GGACTCTATTTTCTATCAGGTATGATTTCTTGAACTC, CACCCCCCCTCTCTCAACACAGTAATCC; HSP104, GAATCTACCTATTCACTTATTTATTCATTTACT, GCTGATTCGATTCAAGGGTAAAAAGGAAC;GAL1, CCTTTGCGCTAGAATTGAACTCAGGTA, AATTGGCAGTAACCTGGCCCCACAAAC; GAL7, TCCCCTTTATTTTGTTCATACATTCTT, TTTCCGACCTGCTTTTATATCTTTGCT. Band intensities were quantified on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) utilizing ImageQuant 1.11 software. To calculate the relative abundance of a given promoter DNA present in an immunoprecipitate (IP), we used the following formula: Qpromoter X = IPpromoter X/Inputpromoter X. Abundance of each test promoter is expressed relative to that ofPHO5, which served as a normalization control (32Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 403-414Google Scholar). The library cloning vector pAME3000 (Fig. 4 A) was constructed by insertion of a truncated version of HSF1 (positions −1018 to +1479, encompassing the HSF1 promoter and amino acids 1–493 of the coding region) into the polylinker of pRS314. To facilitate cloning,KpnI and ClaI linkers were appended during PCR amplification of HSF1. In addition, a uniqueBglII site was engineered just 5′ of the truncation site followed by several stop codons in different reading frames. The plasmid construction was confirmed by restriction digestion analysis and by sequencing of junction points. The BglII site was used to insert fragments (mean size ∼2 kb) generated bySau3AI digestion of yeast genomic DNA. The library contained 7000 independent clones with at least 70% clones containing inserts. The plasmid library was isolated from bacteria and transformed into PS128, selecting for Trp+ prototrophs. The transformation plate, containing ∼10,000 individual clones, was replica-plated onto two 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing plates, one of which was incubated at 30 °C and the other at 37 °C. Gal4 fusions were constructed as follows. Fragments of yeast genomic DNA from pAME3000 derivatives were PCR-amplified using primers flanking the BglII cloning site and containing synthetic BamHI and SalI and, using this sites, were recloned into the pGBD C-1 vector (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar) maintaining the reading frame and stop codons. Resulting constructs were sequenced to confirm the intact reading frame and stop codon position. The CTF1/NF1 histone-binding module fusion was constructed by insertion of a synthetic oligonucleotide (complemented by opposite strand oligonucleotide) bearing the CTF1/NF1 DNA sequence with the natural Sau3AI site at the 5′-end and a syntheticNotI site after the stop codon at the 3′-end into pAME3000 using the corresponding sites. The resulting construct was sequenced to confirm the intact reading frame and position of the stop codon. Fusion of the HNF3 histone-binding module to HSF(1–493) was constructed similarly by in-frame fusion of a PCR-amplified HNF3 DNA fragment encoding amino acids 421–468. Northerns were performed as previously described (33Erkine A.M. Magrogan S.F. Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1627-1639Google Scholar) using the following gene-specific probes:HSP12, PCR product spanning positions +3 to +296;HSP26, PCR product spanning positions +67 to +251;HSP82, synthetic oligonucleotide spanning positions +2071 to +2270; HSP104, PCR product spanning positions +2528 to +2726; ACT1, PCR product spanning positions +984 to +1125. Coordinates listed are relative to the ATG start codon. All hybridization probes were constructed by 20 rounds of primer extension with the appropriate antisense oligonucleotide: HSP12, GGGTCTTCTTCACCGTGGACACGACCG; HSP26, GGAAACCGAAACCGAATGG;HSP82, TCCATGCAGATGCCCTATTTACATA; HSP104, TAATCTAGGTCATCATCAATTTCCA; and ACT1, GAAACACTTGTGGTGAACGATAGATGG in the presence 5 mmMgCl2, 300 μm dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 3 μm dATP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]dATP and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. Blots were hybridized overnight at 55 °C. The activity of β-galactosidase in liquid cell cultures (grown in synthetic complete 2% glucose-containing medium lacking tryptophan) was measured as described elsewhere (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 13.6.2-13.6.4Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis and calculation of the isoelectric point of synthetic peptides was conducted using Vector NTI software. The calculation of protein secondary structure was done using the nnPredict algorithm of Vector NTI. The expression of yeast heat shock genes is principally under the control of HSF. However, the extent to which their promoter chromatin structure is remodeled upon transcriptional induction is unclear. On the one hand, DNA footprinting has demonstrated the presence of constitutive, promoter-associated DNase I hypersensitivity at HSF target genes that is unaffected by heat shock (35Szent-Gyorgyi C. Finkelstein D.B. Garrard W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 71-80Google Scholar, 36Erkine A.M. Adams C.C. Gao M. Gross D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1822-1829Google Scholar, 37Chen J. Pederson D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7442-7448Google Scholar). Yet on the other, chemical cross-linking experiments suggest that substantial histone displacement may occur upon heat shock at these same promoters (32Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 403-414Google Scholar, 38Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Google Scholar). To help resolve this discrepancy, we performed ChIP experiments using antibodies to both acetylated and unacetylated histone isoforms. To ensure quantitative, reproducible results the PHO5 promoter was co-amplified in each PCR to serve as a loading and amplification control. The promoter chromatin structure of PHO5 is well characterized; under phosphate-rich conditions it consists of an array of four stable, sequence-positioned nucleosomes (39Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Horz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Google Scholar, 40Svaren J. Horz W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 93-97Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, A–H, the abundance of tetra-acetylated H4 and both unacetylated and mono-acetylated H3 is drastically reduced at each heat shock promoter following a 15-min heat shock. These histone rearrangements are dynamic, since during a chronic heat shock (4 h), when transcriptional attenuation is seen (Fig. 2,I–L, striped bars), histones are once again detected (Fig. 2, A–H). Indeed, there is a striking inverse relationship between promoter histone content and transcriptional activity. To extend the analysis to H2A, we performed ChIP with an antibody raised against its globular domain (residues 88–97), and thus theoretically insensitive to either N- or C-terminal tail modification. As shown in Fig. 3, the 15-min heat impulse induced a significant reduction of H2A content within the promoters of HSP12, HSP26, and HSP82; following a 15-min return to non-stressful conditions (recovery), the pre-heat-shock abundance of H2A was restored. Taken together with the H3 and H4 ChIP data, we conclude that dynamic alterations occur inHSP promoter chromatin as a function of transcription and that such alterations may involve the displacement and reinstatement of histone octamers in response to activating and attenuating conditions, respectively. The dramatic chromatin modifications seen at HSF target promoters are a likely consequence of the activity of the ADs of HSF. It was shown previously that deletion of the HSF CTA causes ats − phenotype and diminishes expression of heat shock genes (23Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Google Scholar, 41Young M.R. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5637-5646Google Scholar, 42Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the CTA enhances transcription and participates in chromatin remodeling at target promoters is unknown. To gain insight into its function, we substituted the sequence encoding the 340-amino acid CTA with random yeast genomic DNA fragments. Our goal was to select those protein domains whose in-frame fusion with HSF(1–493) suppresses thets − phenotype, thereby complementing the loss of the CTA. A library of plasmids bearing the 3′-truncatedhsf1(1–493) gene fused to Sau3AI-generated genomic DNA fragments (mean size ∼2 kb) was constructed (Fig.4 A). This was transformed into an hsf1Δ::LEU2 strain (PS128) whose viability is maintained by an episomal HSF1+gene harbored on a URA3-CEN vector. Using the technique of plasmid shuffling, the original HSF1-containing plasmid was substituted with those from the library and transformants were screened for growth at the elevated temperature. It was anticipated that this approach would lead to the isolation of the natural targets of the CTA (coactivators and components of the basic transcription machinery), thereby bypassing the requirement for the CTA (in analogy to the “artificial recruitment” model (1Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Google Scholar)), or to the isolation of ADs derived from other activators (e.g.see Ref. 43Bonner J.J. Heyward S. Fackenthal D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1021-1030Google Scholar). Either way, we anticipated that productive fusions would be rare events. Instead, complementation of thets − phenotype was readily obtained. One percent of library transformants survived at the elevated temperature (data not shown). In contrast, there were no survivors at 37 °C when PS128 was transformed with the episomal hsf1(1–493) gene, ruling out homologous recombination between hsf1 alleles as contributing to the revertant phenotype. To confirm plasmid-borne complementation of the ts − phenotype, plasmids were isolated from randomly selected clones. Each one was retransformed into the original PS128 strain, and the HSF1-containing plasmid counterselected as above. As assessed by a spot dilution assay, all transformants were able to grow at elevated temperature, although at different rates (Fig. 4 B). 493)—The inserts of the complementing plasmids were sequenced and their sequences searched against the S. cerevisiae genome data base. Remarkably, the isolated fragments have little if any relationship to transcription. Moreover, some of the cloned fragments were fused out of frame (Table I, clones 3024 and 3021), i.e. encode fortuitous peptides. The amino acid sequences specified by these DNA fragments underlined yet another remarkable observation, namely the short length of the encoded peptides. Some as short as 11 or 12 residues (Table I, clones 3021, 3022, 3024) successfully complemented the 340-amino acid deletion of HSF.Table ISequence analysis of fragments complementing the ts− phenotype of HSF(1–493)CloneAD DNA characteristicsAD polypeptide characteristicsNameGrowth at 37 °CLength in bpOriginLength in a.a.aAmino acid.pISequencebBold, negatively charged residues; underlined, hydrophobic residues.WT5+1023Native3404.28Native300000None030025+92In frame from SLN1 ORF (histidine kinase)322.34D LIP ED VL DSLFPLSTDTPLPSSL ETIGILTD L30225+33In frame from YRF1 ORF (telomere-located helicase)112.47D PWM D VVGF ED30244+151Out of frame from ENA1ORF123.96D PSLWYHNYL E F30213+31Out of frame from NAM1ORF113.66DQMVLKCFW D L30852+70In frame from DOG1 ORF (2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate phosphatase)243.79D PVYQLIANL DAINHE LLNNPRD L30961+52In frame from YOR296WORF183.63D L DKTLFLL ESF EEKAD L3106c3106 is a chimeric insert comprised of 76 bp fromVMA7 and ≈2 kb from a second locus.

Open table in a new tab While amino acid sequence analysis failed to identify any consensus, it did reveal a tendency for negatively charged residues alternating with hydrophobic residues. Although all cloned fragments encode peptides with a strong total negative charge, the complementation is weaker for those fragments containing fewer hydrophobic and more positively charged residues (clones 3085 and 3096). Another interesting feature of the isolated peptides is the absence of any predicted secondary structure (see “Experimental Procedures”). These findings are highly reminiscent of those of Ptashne and co-workers (44Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Google Scholar, 45Lu X. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1988-1992Google Scholar), who previously identified synthetic ADs encoded by E. coligenomic DNA fragments or synthetic oligonucleotides (see “Discussion”). Even though the polypeptides described in Table I complemented the loss of the CTA, it is possible that the presence of these short fragments unmasked a cryptic activation domain in HSF(1–493). To address whether these polypeptides possess intrinsic activation potential, DNA molecules encoding them were ligated in-frame to Gal4(1–147), and these new constructs were transformed into the strain PJ69–4A. This strain originally was constructed for yeast two-hybrid screens (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar) and contains three reporter genes, each under the control of a different Gal4-regulated promoter (Fig.5 A). The resultant PJ694A transformants were assayed for GAL reporter gene expression. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, polypeptides that complemented the HSF(1–493) ts − phenotype also acted as activators of the GAL7-lacZ andGAL1-HIS3 reporters. Moreover, the activation potential of each fragment is similar in the context of either Gal4(1–147) or HSF(1–493), indicating that these polypeptides can act as activation domains independent of the DNA-binding domain to which they are tethered. For the GAL2-ADE2 reporter, which confers the most stringent test of transcription (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar), only clones 3002 and 3024 supported viability (Fig. 5 D), underscoring their strength as activators. In the context of HSF, the function of the synthetic ADs is obscured by the presence of the NTA (Fig. 1), which is capable of trans-activation, particularly in response to acute heat shock (23Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Google Scholar). Gal4(1–147), which has little or no intrinsic activation potential (44Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B, strain 3000), permits a more straightforward test of remodeling activity. To examine the activity of Gal4(1–147) fused to the potent 3002 synthetic AD, ChIP analysis was employed as above. At the GAL1 andGAL7 promoters in a Gal4+ strain, there is a significant decrease in the relative abundance of both unacetylated and acetylated isoforms of H3 following galactose induction (Fig.6, A and B). These results indicate that Gal4 catalyzes the alteration of promoter-associated nucleosomes, although to a lesser degree than HSF (Fig. 2). Strikingly, the synthetic AD 3002, derived from a gene whose product is not related to transcription regulation, shows a similar capability at both promoters (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, depletion of both acetylated and unacetylated H3 isoforms accompanying transcriptional induction can be induced by simple polypeptide modules that are normally not part of either transcription factors or their coactivators. The above data are consistent with a model in which chromatin modifications are central to the function of HSF and that its CTA plays a role in such modifications. Furthermore, short acidi"

These frog ribonucleases are composed of 104–111 amino acid residues, which are similar to mammalian ribonucleases in their amino acid sequence. The conserved amino acid residues for the catalytic activity, i.e. His-12, Lys-41, and His-119 in RNase A, are also found in frog ribonucleases.

To investigate the novel properties of frog ribonucleases, we mutated the residue potentially involved in the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of RC-RNase based on the alignment of amino acid sequences in the ribonuclease superfamily (Fig.1) and the known structures of frog ribonucleases, e.g. onconase (21Mosimann S.C.

The cytotoxicity of RC-RNase is correlated, but not proportional to, its catalytic activity. To elucidate the molecular interaction between frog ribonuclease and possible RNA targets in tumor cells, we grew the co-crystal of RC-RNase and substrate analog d(ACGA) and illustrated the possible hydrogen bonds for the specific recognition of RC-RNase on RNA substrate. The cDNA of wild type RC-RNase was cloned from bullfrog liver using a SmartTMrapid amplification of cDNA ends kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (6Huang H.C. Wang S.C. Leu Y.J.

The DNA sequences of mutated ribonuclease genes were analyzed by a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 377 automated DNA sequencer using the dideoxy chain termination method from a d-Rhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant ribonuclease genes subcloned in a pET11d containing the modified pelB signal peptide were transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain and cultured at 34 °C for 3 days. After centrifugation, the culture medium containing secreted ribonuclease was concentrated by polyethylene glycol 20,000 absorption and dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA). The crude samples were then purified by phosphocellulose and carboxymethyl-cellulose chromatographies, and eluted with 0–0.4m and 0–0.2 m KCl gradient in buffer A, respectively (6Huang H.C. Wang S.C.

CD experiments were carried out using an Aviv CD 202 spectrometer (AVIV, Lakewood, NJ) calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid at 298 K. In general, a 2-mm path length cuvette with 10–20 μm ribonuclease in 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, was used for CD experiments, and all protein solutions were made up to 1 ml. The spectra were recorded from 180 nm to 260 nm. After background subtraction and smoothing, all CD data were converted from CD signal (millidegree) into mean residue ellipticity (degrees cm2/dmol). The mass spectrometry analyses of C4-desalted ribonucleases were performed on a Micromass Q-TOF UltimaTMAPI spectrometer (Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK) equipped with an orthogonal electrospray source operated in the positive ion mode. Ribonuclease activity was determined by the release of acid-soluble ribonucleotides from the RNA substrate following ribonuclease digestion. The yeast total RNA (120 μg) was incubated with purified ribonuclease in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold stop solution (7% perchloric acid, 0.1% uranylacetate, 200 μl). The reaction mixtures remained on ice for 30 min before centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 4 °C for 20 min). The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 260 nm. One unit of ribonuclease activity is defined as the amount of enzyme producing one A 260acid-soluble material at 37 °C for 10 min. Ribonuclease activities were also analyzed by zymogram assay on RNA-casting PAGE (22Liao Y.D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 20: 149-154Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, after electrophoresis the gel was washed twice with 25% isopropyl alcohol in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to remove SDS for protein renaturation. The activity was visible after incubating the gel at room temperature for 30 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and staining by 0.2% toluidine blue O for 10 min. The specific cleavage sites of ribonucleases were determined by incubation of ribonucleases with 5′-32P-labeled synthetic 18-mer RNA with the known sequence 5′-AAGGUUAUCCGCACUGAA-3′, followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (22Liao Y.D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 20: 149-154Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thek cat/Km values of ribonucleases toward dinucleotides, e.g. CpG, UpG, UpU, CpU, and UpA, were measured by HPLC separation and quantification (23Shapiro R. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3527-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24Russo N. Acharya K.R. Vallee B.L. Shapiro R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dinucleotides were digested with ribonucleases at 37 °C for 10 min in buffer containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml RNase-free bovine serum albumin. Digested nucleotides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using 1–5% acetonitrile (depending on products) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on a Vydac C18 column with a Waters automated gradient controller. Thek cat/Km values were calculated after quantification of the substrate and product. Values were obtained from at least two independent experiments. HeLa cells (5 × 103) were grown in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in 96-well plates and treated with 2 μm ribonuclease for 48 h. 50 μl of lysis buffer was added to each well and incubated for 2 min before 50 μl of substrate solution was added. The luminescence was measured in a dark adapt plate by Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard A Canberra Company) according to the manufacturer's instructions (ATP Lite-M assay system, Packard BioScience Company, The Netherlands) (6Huang H.C. Wang S.C. Leu Y.J. Lu S.C. Liao Y.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6395-6401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity was expressed in percentage of loss in cell viability caused by RC-RNase treatment compared with control cells. The value was determined from the mean of six wells. Adequate RC-RNase·d(ACGA) co-crystals were obtained using a three-step seeding method. Briefly, 10 mg/ml RC-RNase was dissolved in 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 4 mmNaCl. Crystals were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. 1.5 μl of reservoir solution (0.1m potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, 24% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6) in a 1:1 ratio was incubated with 1.5 μl of protein solution. Minute RC-RNase crystals were obtained and transferred to the mixture of RC-RNase and d(ACGA) (0.81 mm:1.62 mm) and incubated with the reservoir solution in a 1:1 ratio as described above. The newly formed small RC-RNase·d(ACGA) crystals were further transferred to a new RC-RNase·d(ACGA) mixture with the same composition as described above and incubated for 3 weeks. RC-RNase·d(ACGA) co-crystals up to 0.05 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm were obtained for data collection. Before data collection, RC-RNase·d(ACGA) complex crystals were immersed in a cryoprotectant consisting of 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20% (w/v) glycerol in a reservoir solution for 5 min at each step. The diffraction data were collected at 100 K using wavelength 1.05 Å at beamline X4A on an Area Detector Systems Corporation Q4 CCD area detector at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data reduction was performed using the Denzo/Scalepack software package (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38241) Google Scholar).

The structure of the RC-RNase·d(ACGA) complex was solved by the molecular replacement method using the software package AmoRe (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar), and the structure of RC-RNase (Protein Data Bank code 1KM8) was used as the probe. All data with I/ς>0 were used for the subsequent refinement using crystallography NMR software (27Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1999; 55: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and manual adjustments were performed using molecular graphics package O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Most of the substrate analog d(ACGA) was located at the electron density map and added manually. Two 3′-end adenosines of d(ACGA) have two conformation disorders, and the adenosine models were adjusted manually and fixed in the refinement. Water molecules were added in areas of electron density in difference Fourier maps that were <3.2 Å from a hydrogen bond partner. Assessment of the quality of the coordinates was performed using the programs PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) and MOLEMAN (30Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Molecular graphics were generated with MOLSCRIPT (31Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Insight II and QUANTA (Accelrys, Inc. San Diego) programs. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1M07) (32Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J.

RNase A, onconase (AF332139), cloned in this laboratory, the wild type RC-RNase gene, and the mutated RC-RNase genes were expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3). The secreted proteins in the media were purified to homogeneity by phosphocellulose and carboxymethyl column chromatographies (Fig. 2 A). Onconase and most of the recombinant RC-RNases, except for those with N-terminal mutants, possessed Pyr at their N termini as did that of native frog RC-RNase detected by mass spectrum analysis and Edman degradation after Pfu aminopeptidase treatment (6Huang H.C. Wang S.C. Leu Y.J. Lu S.C. Liao Y.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6395-6401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RC-Q1E had two kinds of product, ended with pyroglutamate or glutamate at the N terminus, which were separated by FPLC Mono S column chromatography using 0.07–0.11 n NaCl salt gradient elution (Amersham Biosciences). The CD spectra of most RC-RNase mutants were analyzed to rule out the possibility of incorrect folding. There was no significant difference among native RC-RNase, wild type secretory RC-RNase, RC-Q1A, RC-Q9A, RC-N38Q, RC-T39A, RC-T70A, RC-T70D, RC-K95A, RC-E97A, RC-V102A, and RC-V102D, some CD spectra of which are shown in Fig.3. This similarity indicates that the secondary structures of these RC-RNase mutants are similar to that of native RC-RNase. The ribonuclease activities of RC-RNase and its mutants were analyzed using an acid-insoluble method as shown in TableII. The specific activity of RC-RNase toward yeast total RNA was slightly less than that of RNase A (19Liao Y.D. Huang H.C. Leu Y.J. Wei C.W. Tang P.C. Wang S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas the activity of native and recombinant wild type RC-RNase was similar. When Pyr-1, Lys-9, or Asn-38 was mutated, most of the enzymatic activity was destroyed (RC-Q1A, 1.5%; RC-K9A, 2.2%; RC-N38A, 1.0% left) (Table II). However, RC-Q1E retained 28% of its activity. These results indicate that Pyr-1, Lys-9, and Asn-38 along with His-10, Lys-35, and His-103 are involved in catalytic activity.Table IISpecific activities, cell survival rate, and relative cytotoxicity of RC-RNase and its variantsEnzymeSpecific activityaResults obtained by acid-insoluble methods as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Residues adjacent to the predicted B1 site based on the structure of native RC-RNase (1KM8), Val-37, Thr-39, Thr-70, or Phe-104, were mutated and assayed for catalytic activity (Table II). We found that 5.8% of activity remained in RC-T39A, 41.0% in RC-T39S, 65.8% in RC-T70A, 79.6% in RC-T70S, 21.5% in RC-F104A, and 79.2% in RC-V37A. Similarly, residues adjacent to the hypothesized B2 site were also mutated and assayed for catalytic activity. The RC-K95A (24.2% remained), RC-E97A (11.6%), RC-V102A (19.1%), and RC-V102D (3.4%) had a marked reduction in activity, whereas RC-N57A (48.7%) and RC-N59A (76.2%) did not exhibit marked reduction. These findings suggest that Thr-39, Lys-95, Glu-97, Val-102, and Phe-104 may participate in the catalytic activity of RC-RNase through base recognition. The relative activity of most RC-RNase mutants was also determined by zymogram as shown in Fig. 2 B. Most of the recombinant RC-RNases had the same mobility as native RC-RNase, except for RC-K9A and RC-K95A, which likely have a more compact structure than native RC-RNase. The relative activity of these recombinant ribonucleases shown by zymogram is in good agreement with the activity obtained by the acid-insoluble method (Table II). One exception was RC-K95A, which was less active than native RC-RNase when assayed by the acid-insoluble method, but it was more active than native RC-RNase when assayed by zymogram. This discrepancy in relative activity may result from the difference in molecular weight of the nucleotides released from the gel and that remained in aqueous solution. Because of the broader base specificity of the RC-K95A (see below) and complete digestion of RNA substrate in the gel, the shorter oligonucleotide produced by RC-K95A tends to diffuse from gel. In contrast, the RNA was only partially digested by the ribonuclease to obtain the absorbance of soluble oligonucleotides within the linear range (A 2600.1–0.3). The residues adjacent to the predicted B1 site, Val-37, Thr-39, Thr-70, and Phe-104, were mutated and analyzed for base specificity. We found that both CpG and UpG of an 18-mer RNA were cleaved by native and wild type recombinant RC-RNase, whereas CpG was preferentially cleaved by the T39A or T70A mutant (Fig. 4). However, both CpG and UpG were cleaved if Thr-39 or Thr-70 was replaced by a cognate residue in RC-T39S or RC-T70S. Interestingly, UpG of 18-mer RNA was more susceptible than CpG in T70D. The catalytic activity and substrate binding affinities of Thr-39 and Thr-70 mutants toward these dinucleotides CpG or UpG were determined bykcat/Km value analyses (Table III). RC-T70A had a decreasedKm for CpG (17%) and increasedKm for UpG (213%), whereas RC-T70D had an increased Km for CpG (178%) and decreasedKm for UpG (54%). These findings indicate that the hydroxyl group of Thr-70 allows the binding of both cytosine and uracil at B1 site, whereas the carboxyl group of Asp-70 favors the binding of uracil. The base specificity of RC-RNase was not changed significantly in RC-F104A.Table IIISubstrate specificities of RC-RNase and its variantsEnzymek cat/K mCpGUpGUpUCpUUpA(s−1m−1) × 106Wild type81 ± 2 (100)aThe values in parentheses are expressed in percentage compared with that of wild type RNase.110 ± 4 (100)1.3 ± 0.03 (100)0.8 ± 0.02 (100)0.4 ± 0.02 (100)P1 siteQ1A0.5 ± 0.01 (0.6)1 ± 0.3 (1)0.007 ± 0.0002 (1)0.007 ± 0.0002 (1)–bNot done.K9A4 ± 0.1 (5)12 ± 0.2 (11)0.02 ± 0.001 (1)0.01 ± 0.0002 (1)–B1 siteT39A6 ± 0.4 (8)0.3 ± 0.01 (0.3)NDcND, nondetectableND–T39S27 ± 0.7 (28)39 ± 7 (36)0.1 ± 0.03 (11)ND–T70A300 ± 8 (376)5 ± 0.5 (5)0.01 ± 0.001 (1)7 ± 0.08 (868)–T70S130 ± 5 (157)98 ± 6 (91)2 ± 0.03 (163)2 ± 0.03 (177)–T70D9 ± 0.1 (11)62 ± 5 (58)0.9 ± 0.02 (71)0.1 ± 0.001 (13)–F104A7 ± 0.1 (9)7 ± 0.6 (6)0.05 ± 0.0001 (4)0.02 ± 0.0005 (3)–B2 siteN57A32 ± 2 (40)92 ± 9 (86)0.4 ± 0.02 (28)0.2 ± 0.01 (22)0.1 ± 0.01 (38)N59A78 ± 7 (96)84 ± 3 (78)1.2 ± 0.07 (99)0.8 ± 0.01 (93)0.2 ± 0.02 (59)K95A14 ± 1 (17)15 ± 1 (36)0.1 ± 0.001 (11)0.1 ± 0.003 (11)0.6 ± 0.07 (164)K97A6 ± 0.1 (7)6 ± 0.3 (6)0.1 ± 0.01 (10)0.1 ± 0.02 (16)0.1 ± 0.003 (37)V102A5 ± 0.2 (6)9 ± 0.1 (8)0.08 ± 0.004 (6)0.04 ± 0.002 (5)0.03 ± 0.007 (9)Activities were determined as described in under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the mean ± S.D.

The results shown in Table III and Fig. 4 Aindicate that the base specificities were not significantly changed in N57A and N59A mutants. CpU, along with the original scissile substrate CpG and UpG, was cleaved by RC-E97A.

When the nearby residue Lys-95 was mutated to Ala, CpC, CpA, CpU, UpA, and UpU, along with the original scissile substrate CpG and UpG, were cleaved. Thekcat/Km value for CpG and UpG was dramatically decreased to 17 and 36, respectively, whereas thekcat/Km value for UpA increased 1.6-fold compared with that of the wild type RC-RNase.

https://openalex.org/W2136938827,"Inactivation of the visual G-protein transducin by GTP hydrolysis is regulated by the GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) RGS9-1. Regulation of RGS9-1 itself is poorly understood, but we found previously that it is subject to a light- and Ca2+-sensitive phosphorylation on Ser475. Because there are much higher RGS9-1 levels in cones than in rods, we investigated whether Ser475 is phosphorylated in rods usingConeless mice and found that both the phosphorylation and its regulation by light occur in rods. Therefore, we used rod outer segments as the starting material for the purification of RGS9-1 kinase activity. Two major peaks of activity corresponded to protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, PKCα and PKCθ. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the Ser475 RGS9-1 sequence and RGS9-1 were substrates for recombinant PKCα and PKCθ. This phosphorylation was removed efficiently by protein phosphatase 2A, an endogenous phosphatase in rod outer segments, but not by PP1 or PP2B. Phosphorylation of RGS9-1 by PKC had little effect on its activity in solution but significantly decreased its affinity for its membrane anchor protein and GAP enhancer, RGS9-1 anchor protein (R9AP). PKCθ immunostaining was at higher levels in cone outer segments than in rod outer segments, as was found for the components of the RGS9-1 GAP complex. Thus, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of RGS9-1 represents a potential mechanism for feedback control of the kinetics of photoresponse recovery in both rods and cones, with this mechanism probably especially important in cones.

Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Google Scholar, 10He W. Lu L. Zhang X. El-Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Google Scholar, 13Kovoor A. Chen C.K. He W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3397-3402Google Scholar). ROS membranes from knockout mice lacking RGS9 hydrolyze GTP more slowly than ROS membranes from control mice. Moreover, in electrophysiological measurements, the flash responses of RGS9−/− rods recovered much more slowly than normal after illumination (5Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the RGS9 gene yields two molecular forms of RGS9, RGS9-1 and RGS9-2, that vary only in the amino acid sequence of the C terminus. RGS9-1 is a retina-specific transcript, whereas RGS9-2 is expressed in the brain (1He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Google Scholar, 14Zhang K. Howes K.A. He W. Bronson J.D.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2016-2026Google Scholar). Immunolocalization using monoclonal antibodies and confocal microscopy revealed that RGS9-1 is present in cones at significantly higher levels than in rods, implying that the RGS9-1 level is a potentially important determinant of the faster response kinetics and lower sensitivity of mammalian cones compared with rods (16Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Google Scholar). RGS9-1 also forms a complex with a 25-kDa photoreceptor-specific phosphoprotein, RGS9-1 anchor protein (R9AP). R9AP binds to the N-terminal domain of RGS9-1 and anchors RGS9-1 to the disk membrane (17Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9755-9760Google Scholar). We previously reported that RGS9-1 is phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase in ROS membranes with an average stoichiometry of 0.2–0.45 mol of phosphates/mol of RGS9-1 (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). A single major site of phosphorylation was identified by a combination of mass spectrometric analysis and mutagenesis as Ser475. The kinase responsible has been only partially characterized. Initial studies revealed that the RGS9-1 kinase is a peripheral membrane protein that differs from protein kinase A, protein kinase G, rhodopsin kinase, CaM kinase II, casein kinase II, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5. In addition, it is sensitive to the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmalemide I. The kinase activity was also inhibited by EGTA and restored by submicromolar [Ca2+]. The kinase co-purifies with rhodopsin in sucrose gradients and can be extracted in buffers of high ionic strength (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). We also developed a monoclonal antibody specific for the Ser475-phosphorylated form of RGS9-1 and found that it recognized RGS9-1 in immunoblots of dark-adapted mouse retina (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). Retinas from light-adapted mice had much lower levels of RGS9-1 phosphorylation. Thus, RGS9-1 is phosphorylated on Ser475 in vivo, and the phosphorylation level is regulated by light and by [Ca2+], suggesting the importance of the modification in light adaptation. Phosphorylated RGS9-1 is present exclusively in the cholesterol-rich detergent-insoluble membrane domains (Rafts), whereas the unphosphorylated form can be readily extracted with mild detergent (19Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Google Scholar). These results demonstrate differences in the subcellular localization between phosphorylated RGS9-1 and its unphosphorylated form. In another study, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor H89 reduced RGS9-1 phospholabeling by more than 90%, whereas dibutyryl-cAMP stimulated it 3-fold (20Balasubramanian N. Levay K. Keren-Raifman T. Faurobert E. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12619-12627Google Scholar). These studies suggested PKA as the major kinase responsible for RGS9-1 phosphorylation in ROS. The PKA catalytic subunit was found to phosphorylate recombinant RGS9-1, and mutational analysis of a fragment of RGS9 (residues 276–431) identified the phosphorylation sites as Ser427 and Ser428. However, in ROS, RGS9-1 phosphorylation required the presence of free Ca2+ ions and was inhibited by light (20Balasubramanian N. Levay K. Keren-Raifman T. Faurobert E. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12619-12627Google Scholar). The current work focused on the identification of the protein kinase(s) and the protein phosphatase responsible for regulating phosphorylation of RGS9-1. We used bovine ROS as a starting material and carefully fractionated protein kinase activities, quantitatively accounting for the RGS9-1 kinase activity. We report here that two PKC isozymes from ROS, PKCα and PKCθ, co-purify with RGS9-1 kinase activity, that both phosphorylate RGS9-1 at Ser475, and that protein phosphatase 2A is responsible for the RGS9-1 dephosphorylation at this site. Recombinant kinases, phosphatases, and antibodies were purchased as follows: PKA and PKCα from Sigma; PKGI, anti-PKGI antibody, and Ca2+/CaM II kinase from Calbiochem; PKCθ and PKCε from PanVera; PP1 and PP2A phosphatases from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); and PP2B and CaM from Biomol. Fluorescein-labeled peanut agglutinin (PNA) was from Vector Laboratory Inc. Monoclonal antibody D7 was raised against bacterially expressed RGS9-1 as described previously (16Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Google Scholar). Mouse anti-phosphorylated RGS9-1 monoclonal antibody (A4) was raised against a C-terminal peptide derived from mouse phosphorylated RGS9-1, (KLDRRpSQLKKELPPK, where pS represents phosphorylated serine); Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc., Hopkinton, MA), and coupled to a carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-RGS9-1c polyclonal serum was generated as described previously (1He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Google Scholar). RGS9-1 proteins, with either a glutathione S-transferase or His6 tag on the N terminus, bound to Gβ5 were expressed using baculovirus and Sf9 cells, as described previously (10He W. Lu L. Zhang X. El-Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Google Scholar,18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar), and affinity-purified using either immobilized metal or glutathione affinity chromatography. The RGS9-1 membrane anchor protein, R9AP, with an N-terminal His6 tag, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, as described elsewhere. 2Hu, G., Zhang, Z., and Wensel, T. G. (January 30, 2003) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.m212046200. All animal experiments employed procedures approved by the University of Washington Animal Care Committee and conformed with recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia. All animals were maintained in complete darkness, and all manipulations were done under dim red light employing Kodak number 1 safelight filters (transmittance >560 nm). Coneless mice were obtained from J. Nathans (Johns Hopkins University) and GCAP1/2 knockout mice from J. Chen (Southern California University). The analysis of RGS9-1 phosphorylation of mouse retinas was carried out essentially as described previously (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were maintained in a dark room (dark-adapted) or in full room light (light-adapted) for a period of 16 h prior to euthanasia and removal of retinas under dim red light. The retinas were homogenized with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, ∼20 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent, plus 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 15 μm fenvalerate, and 100 nm okadaic acid to inhibit phosphatase activities. Immunoprecipitation of RGS9-1 was carried out using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitated protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the mouse monoclonal antibody A4 specific for the phosphopeptide and phosphorylation-independent antibody D7 at a dilution of 1:500. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Promega), and detection was done by chemiluminescence using the ECL® system (Amersham Biosciences). RGS9-1 phosphorylation was compared between dark- and light-adapted animals by densitometry of films. Three data points from immunoblots were averaged, and relative phosphorylation levels were calculated as follows: relative RGS9-1 phosphorylation = (average densities of RGS9-1 bands in Ser475-phosphate-specific antibody immunoblots)/(average densities of RGS9-1 bands in monoclonal anti-RGS9-1 antibody D7 immunoblots). Phosphorylation levels were normalized to the relative phosphorylation value obtained in wild type mice. The RGS9-1 kinase activity was routinely assayed using the KLDRRSQLKKGLPPK peptide derived from the C-terminal region of RGS9-1 that is phosphorylated in vitroin ROS suspensions (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). This site is also phosphorylated in RGS9-1in vivo (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). In the standard conditions, phosphorylation was carried out in 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, containing 13 mg/ml peptide with and without 0.1 mm cGMP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.01 mm DAG, 1 mm PMA, 50 mm Ca2+, 50 mm EGTA, 3 μm CaM, and 230 mg/ml PS. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by an addition of [γ-33P]ATP to a final concentration of 0.1 mm with a specific activity of 100,000 dpm/nmol and a total volume of 75 μl. Samples were incubated for 10 min or a longer time as indicated, at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 100 mm H3PO4.33P incorporation into the RGS peptide was determined by a phosphocellulose filter paper method (21Witt J.J. Roskoski Jr., R. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 253-258Google Scholar). Alternatively, qualitative assays of RGS9-1 kinase activity were carried out using similar conditions as described for the peptide assays, using the recombinant His6-RGS9-1/Gβ5-subunit complex as a substrate, and phosphorylation was detected using the A4 antibody specific for Ser475 phosphorylation. His6- or glutathioneS-transferase-tagged RGS9-1 full-length protein with Gβ5L was affinity-purified from insect Sf9 cells as described (10He W. Lu L. Zhang X. El-Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Google Scholar).In vitro phosphorylation assays were performed in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm ATP) containing either 1 mmCaCl2 for PKCα or 1 mm EDTA for PKCθ. PS (0.1 mg/ml) and DAG (0.01 mg/ml, Upstate Biotechnology) were added after sonication on ice for 2 min to resuspend the lipid micelles. Either PKCα (60 ng) or PKCθ (60 milliunits) was used in the assay, unless otherwise indicated. For autoradiography, [γ-32P]ATP was added with a working concentration of 200 Ci/mol. The reactions were performed at 30 °C for 60 min or as indicated, and then either diluted directly into GAP assay reactions for GAP activity measurement or quenched by SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 32P into RGS9-1 after kinase assays was determined by autoradiography after separating the proteins by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation on Ser475 was determined by immunoblotting using Ser475phosphorylation-specific A4 antibody. Reactions without PKC kinases were used as negative controls. ROS were purified in dim red light from fresh or frozen bovine retinas as described (22Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Google Scholar). All procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Bovine ROS (obtained from 200 retinas) were homogenized with 50 ml of water, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 20 min. The water extraction was repeated a second time, and two additional extractions were performed in 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl. RGS kinase(s) was extracted using 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NH4Cl. The high salt extraction was repeated twice, and the obtained supernatants were combined (∼150 ml) and loaded onto hydroxyapatite (1.5 ml) at a flow rate of 15 ml/min. The column was washed with 300 mm NaCl in 10 mmBTP, pH 7.5, and proteins containing the RGS9-1 kinase activity were eluted with 300 mm K2HPO4 in 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5. Salt was removed by dialysis against 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, and proteins were chromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose (5 ml; Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Unbound proteins were removed by 10 mm BTP buffer, pH 7.5, whereas remaining proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1m NaCl in 10 mm BTP buffer, pH 7.5. Fractions with kinase activity were pooled together, dialyzed, and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with 10 mmBTP, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.4m NaCl in 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5. RGS9-1 kinase activity was monitored using the peptide or recombinant RGS9-1 immunoblot assays as described above. HEK cells at 40% confluence in 10-cm plates were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 20 μg/plate of pCMV.CGKII (a gift from M. Uhler) (23Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Google Scholar). After 26 h, the cells were washed with PBS buffer, scraped, and homogenized. Expression of the enzyme was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-PKGII (M. Uhler). Dephosphorylation was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C in 15 μl of 10 mm BTP pH 7.5, with the addition of 0.4 units of phosphatase, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5 μg of bovine ROS. The reaction was quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After separation in SDS-PAGE gels, dephosphorylation/phosphorylation was visualized by immunoblot and A4 antibody. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) with 12% polyacrylamide gels. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (D7 and A4), 1:1000 or 1:500. When secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Promega) was used, the dilution was 1:7000, and antibody binding was detected using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as a substrate. When secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Promega) was used, the dilution was 1:5000, with detection by chemiluminescence using the ECL® system (Amersham Biosciences). For flat mount localization, bovine eyes obtained from a local slaughterhouse were held briefly on ice prior to dissection. For localization in mouse and bovine retinas, the anterior segment and vitreous humor were removed from each eye, and the eye cups were immersed for 6 h in chilled 4% formaldehyde in 0.086m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. Pieces of retina (5 mm2) were excised, washed in phosphate buffer, and embedded in 5% agarose in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections of retina (100 μm thick) were cut with a VT1000E vibrating microtome (Leica). Antibody labeling was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Sections were first incubated in normal goat serum diluted 1:50 in ICC buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.05% sodium azide, pH 7.3) for 1 h to reduce nonspecific labeling. Mouse monoclonal RGS9 antibody (A 280 = 0.69) diluted 1:25 in ICC buffer was added to retinal sections for incubation overnight in a humidified chamber. Negative controls for antibody labeling were produced by omitting primary antibody from the incubation buffer or by preadsorbing RGS9 antibody with purified full-length RGS9 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (0.5 ml, 1 mg/ml RGS9). After repeated washing in buffer, sections were incubated for 4 h in indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.) diluted 1:200 in ICC buffer. Sections were washed repeatedly with ICC buffer, mounted in 5% n-propyl gallate in glycerol, coverslipped, and examined on a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Scan head parameters influencing image intensity and resolution (pinhole aperture, PMT gain and black level, and attenuation of laser by neutral density filters) were standardized for all samples. Single plane and Z series images were collected and stored as unprocessed files. Images for publication were processed with Adobe Photoshop 3.0. Single-turnover GTPase assays were performed as described previously (1He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Google Scholar, 25Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Google Scholar). PKC-phosphorylated or -unphosphorylated RGS9-1 were mixed with urea-washed ROS, purified Gt, PDEγ, and [γ-32P]GTP to measure GAP activity. Final concentrations of the proteins in the assays were as follows: 0.5 μm RGS9-1/Gβ5, 15 μm rhodopsin, 1 μm Gt, and 2 μm PDEγ. The first order rate constant for GTP hydrolysis was calculated by fitting data with PSI-Plot. The binding assays were carried out as described recently.2 E. coliexpressed His6-R9AP was purified in detergent and reconstituted into lipid vesicles containingl-α-phosphatidylserine (PS; brain, porcine-sodium salt),l-α-phosphatidylcholine (egg, chicken),l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (egg, chicken) (Avanti Polar Lipids) at a ratio (w/w/w) ofl-α-phosphatidylcholine/l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine/PS = 50:35:15 as described. Rhodamine-labeledl-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-(6- tetramethylrhodaminethiocarbamoyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, triethylammonium salt; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added in the lipid mixture to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/w) to facilitate the visualization of the lipids. Purified glutathioneS-transferase-RGS9-1/Gβ5 proteins (in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mmMgCl2) were first incubated with buffer only or phosphorylated by commercial PKCα or PKCθ at room temperature for 60 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C at 88,000 × gfor 40 min to remove aggregates. Supernatants were diluted to desired concentrations in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 mg/ml ovalbumin, mixed with R9AP vesicles in a volume of 150 μl, and incubated with gentle vortexing at 4 °C for ∼2 h. An aliquot (100 μl) of the reaction mixture was then transferred to a new polypropylene (Beckman) tube to separate unbound proteins from bound proteins by pelleting the vesicles at 88,000 × g for 40 min. The pelleted vesicles were clearly visible as a pink pellet at the bottom of the tube due to the rhodamine-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine. The final concentrations in the binding reactions were as follows: RGS9-1, 0.1 μm; R9AP (total concentration), 1.0 μm. Equal proportions of the starting binding reactions, the supernatant after pelleting the vesicles, and the pelleted vesicles were loaded on SDS-PAGE, and the RGS9 proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-RGS9-1c antiserum. RGS9-1 localizes in rod and cone photoreceptors in the bovine retina (16Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that RGS9-1 is phosphorylated in ROS preparations (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). We reinvestigated localization of RGS9-1 using the D7 antibody raised against bacterially expressed RGS9-1 and the flat mount section of bovine retina. The flat mount immunolocalization revealed a significantly higher level of RGS9-1 in cones rather than in rods as shown at lower (Fig. 1 Aa) and higher magnification (Fig. 1 Ab). Immunolabeling of RGS9-1 using the cross-section confirmed higher cone expression (Fig.1 Ac). Preincubation with purified protein abolished RGS9-1 immunoreactivity (data not shown). Because of the higher expression levels of RGS9-1 in cone photoreceptors, we sought additional proof that RGS9-1 is phosphorylated in ROS. One possible explanation for our previous results on RGS9-1 phosphorylation in ROS was that isolated ROS were contaminated by RGS9-1 from cone outer segments, where it is highly enriched, and consequently, phosphorylation was a cone-specific phenomenon. Therefore, to evaluate RGS9-1 phosphorylation in rods, we employed mice lacking cone photoreceptors (Coneless mice) (26Soucy E. Wang Y. Nirenberg S. Nathans J. Meister M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 481-493Google Scholar). RGS9-1 immunoprecipitated from retinal homogenates obtained from dark- and light-adapted wild type and Coneless mice was subjected to electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon membrane, and probed for RGS9-1 phosphorylation with the Ser475phosphate-specific antibody A4 (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with the D7 anti-RGS9-1 antibody revealed that the total amount of immunoprecipitated RGS9-1 was similar in wild type andConeless, as well as in light- and dark-adapted mice (Fig.1 B). Comparison of the phosphorylation level between dark- and light-adapted mice revealed that light reduced phosphorylation by ∼50% in both wild type and Coneless mouse retina (Fig.1 B). These results demonstrate that RGS9-1 phosphorylation occurs in rod cells in vivo and is regulated by light. Because RGS9-1 phosphorylation is regulated in vitro by Ca2+, we also measured RGS9-1 phosphorylation in mice lacking GCAP1/GCAP2, two Ca2+-binding proteins in photoreceptors (27Sokal I. Li N. Verlinde C.L. Haeseleer F. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 233-251Google Scholar, 28Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 547-554Google Scholar). We found similar results in those mice as compared with wild type mice, suggesting that GCAP1 and GCAP2 are not involved in the regulation of RGS9-1 phosphorylation (data not shown). To identify protein kinases responsible for phosphorylation of RGS9-1 at Ser475, bovine ROS was fractionated, and the kinase activity was quantitatively assessed. ROS were used as starting material, because they are readily accessible for biochemical procedures. Two specific assays were utilized to determine RGS9-1 kinase activity. The first assay involves phosphorylation of full-length recombinant RGS9-1 obtained from Sf9 cells, in a complex with Gβ5, followed by separation of the phosphorylated products on SDS gel and identification and quantification of the phosphorylation by monoclonal anti-Ser475–phosphate-specific antibody (A4) (18Hu G. Jang G.F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Google Scholar). The advantage of this method is its ability to recognize the specific phosphorylation on the in vivo phosphorylation site Ser475, regardless of other nonspecific phosphorylations that could result from high kinase concentrations or missing regulatory components in in v"
https://openalex.org/W1983877760,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation are critical for initiating the transcriptional expression of cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and other factors in the macrophage immune response. Nitric oxide (NO), an endogenous free radical, is a product of macrophages that mediates inflammatory and cytotoxic processes in the immune system. Here we report the effects of NO on MAP kinase signaling and NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and correlate these effects to the induction target genes, including interferon-β (IFN-β) and IκB-α. LPS alone induced a rapid phosphorylation of the stress-activated MAP kinases: c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. Simultaneous treatment with LPS and the NO donor, diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO), enhanced and prolonged JNK and p38 phosphorylation. Similarly, DEA/NO prolonged the LPS-induced degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory subunit, IκB-α, despite an increase in IκB-α mRNA levels. Whereas DEA/NO alone was sufficient to induce JNK and p38 phosphorylation, it was not sufficient to cause IκB-α degradation. The enhancement of IκB-α degradation by DEA/NO correlated with an increase in the nuclear levels of the p50 and p65 subunits and DNA-binding activity determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. DEA/NO and an additional NO donor, MAHMA/NO, are further demonstrated to enhance the transcriptional expression of the IFN-β gene. The results suggest a role for NO in enhancing and propagating inflammatory conditions and the immune response.

Similarly, DEA/NO prolonged the LPS-induced degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory subunit, IκB-α, despite an increase in IκB-α mRNA levels. Whereas DEA/NO alone was sufficient to induce JNK and p38 phosphorylation, it was not sufficient to cause IκB-α degradation. The enhancement of IκB-α degradation by DEA/NO correlated with an increase in the nuclear levels of the p50 and p65 subunits and DNA-binding activity determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. DEA/NO and an additional NO donor, MAHMA/NO, are further demonstrated to enhance the transcriptional expression of the IFN-β gene. The results suggest a role for NO in enhancing and propagating inflammatory conditions and the immune response. mitogen-activated protein interferon-β inducible nitric-oxide synthase lipopolysaccharide diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N′-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (Z)-1-[N-methyl-N-[6-(N-methylaminohexyl)amino]]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxyl-3-oxide dithiothreitol c-Jun N-terminal kinase electrophoretic mobility shift assay Inducible expression of a variety of genes is mediated through mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase signaling pathways. MAP kinases regulate the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, including c-Jun, activating transcription factor-2, and Elk-1. The activation of MAP kinase pathways is critical in the induced expression of inflammatory cytokines. For example, MAP kinases regulate the transcriptional expression of the genes encoding tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-β (IFN-β) (1Hoffmeyer A. Grosse-Wilde A. Flory E. Neufeld B. Kunz M. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4319-4327Google Scholar, 2Ajizian S.J. English B.K. Meals E.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 939-944Google Scholar, 3Kim T. Kim T.Y. Lee W.G. Yim J. Kim T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16910-16917Google Scholar). In addition, MAP kinase pathways have been demonstrated to contribute to the activation of the ubiquitous transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (4Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Google Scholar, 5Korus M. Mahon G.M. Cheng L. Whitehead I.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4601-4612Google Scholar). The NF-κB pathway also has a critical role in the immune system, regulating both innate and adaptive responses. NF-κB is essential for the inducible expression of cytokines, receptors for immune recognition, cell adhesion proteins, and the genes encoding inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (6Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Google Scholar). Although NF-κB is comprised of a family of homologous DNA-binding proteins, it is prototypically represented as a heterodimer of p50 and p65 (RelA) subunits. Each subunit contains a conserved Rel homology domain, which encompasses the dimerization and DNA-binding motifs, and a nuclear localization signal (7Ghosh S. Gifford A.M. Riviere L.R. Tempst P. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1019-1029Google Scholar, 8Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Liou H.C. Tempst P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 961-969Google Scholar). Transcriptional enhancement is conferred by the transactivation domain of NF-κB, which is encoded at the C-terminal end of the p65 subunit (9Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Google Scholar). In nonstimulated cells, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex through interactions with the inhibitory protein IκB (10Ganchi P.A. Sun S.C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Google Scholar, 11Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Google Scholar). NF-κB can be activated by a number of immunological stimuli, including the bacterial product, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cytokines, and double-stranded RNA. Treatment with an appropriate stimulus induces rapid phosphorylation of IκB on two specific serine residues (Ser-32 and Ser-36 for IκB-α) (12Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G.

Subsequent ubiquitination of IκB and degradation by the 26 S proteasome releases the inhibition on NF-κB, which then translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of target genes (15Li C.C.

Transcriptional expression of IFN-β is regulated by an enhancer region located 55–105 bp upstream of the transcription start site (+1), and which is highly conserved between human and mouse (19Dirks W. Mittnacht S. Rentrop M. Hauser H. J. Interferon Res. 1989; 9: 125-133Google Scholar). Induction of IFN-β mRNA does not require de novoprotein synthesis, but depends on existing transcription factors, which assemble into an enhanceosome complex at specific positive regulatory domains within the IFN-β promoter. The activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways are critical for the formation of the IFN-β enhanceosome, because NF-κB and a heterodimer of c-Jun/activating transcription factor-2 bind to positive regulatory domains II and IV, respectively (20King P. Goodbourn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30609-30615Google Scholar, 21Garoufalis E. Kwan I. Lin R. Mustafa A. Pepin N. Roulston A. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. J.

Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenously synthesized free radical species that has been demonstrated to modulate a variety of cellular and physiological processes. Elevated levels of NO, as are generated by macrophages at sites of inflammation, infection, or during septic shock can potentially lead to nitrosative stress. The effects of nitrosative stress relate to the ability of NO and NO-derived species to react with biological molecules and thereby alter normal cellular functions (24Wink D.A. Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 621-623Google Scholar). Alterations in gene expression have been shown to occur in cells subjected to nitrosative stress, because of both direct and indirect effects on various signaling pathways and transcription factors (25Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Beck K.F. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 442: 479-486Google Scholar,26Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Google Scholar). In this study we investigate the effect of NO on NF-κB activation and MAP kinase signaling pathways, and demonstrate both time- and concentration-dependent effects. Furthermore, we correlate the effects of NO on signal transduction pathways to the transcriptional expression of two LPS-inducible genes, IFN-β and IκB-α. In conclusion, we propose a model for the actions of NO in enhancing and propagating pathological inflammatory conditions and mediating immune responses. RAW 264.7 macrophages were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in 10-cm culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 50 mm HEPES, 4 mm l-glutamine, 1.2 mm l-arginine, 10 IU/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown to confluence, then split using 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA and plated at a density of 3 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish for propagation, or as indicated for experiments. Cells were counted using a hemacytometer, and viability assayed using trypan blue dye exclusion was typically greater than 95%. Cultures were maintained until passage 20, and then discarded. LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0128:B12, Sigma) was reconstituted in sterile water and added to obtain the desired concentration for experiments. The nitric oxide donors, diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N′-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DEA/NO; Cayman Chemical) and (Z)-1-[N-methyl-N-[6-(N-methylaminohexyl)amino]]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (MAHMA/NO; Cayman Chemical) were dissolved in slightly basic (pH 10.0), ice-cold sterile water immediately prior to addition to cell culture. The compound 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxyl-3-oxide (carboxy-PTIO; Cayman Chemical) was dissolved in water immediately prior to use. Both DEA/NO and MAHMA/NO were examined for their effect on macrophage viability using the trypan blue dye exclusion assay, and each donor was determined to be negligible under the conditions used in the experiments. Following treatment with experimental agents, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and collected by centrifugation. For total proteins, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.05, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotonin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, and samples were diluted to 2 μg/μl. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described, with slight modifications. Briefly, fresh cell pellets were resuspended in 800 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 50 μl of Igepal CA-630 was added. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and washed twice with buffer A. Nuclear proteins were extracted by addition of buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris. Nuclear protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, and samples were diluted to 1 μg/μl. An equal amount of protein per sample (as indicated in figure legends) was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electroblotted onto a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane using a Mini Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated with blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk) prior to incubation with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After washing 3 times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Membranes were subsequently washed 3 times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, and a chemiluminescence-based detection with luminol reagent was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-p38, anti-phospho-p38, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-JNK, and anti-IκB-α fromCell Signaling Technology; anti-p50/p105, anti-p65, anti-actin, and all secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Double stranded oligonucleotide encompassing the κB element 5′-GGGGATTTCCC-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP, 7,000 Ci/mmol (ICN), and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Assays were performed according to an established method, with slight variations (27Camandola S. Leonarduzzi G. Musso T. Varesio L. Carini R. Scavazza A. Chiarpotto E. Baeuerle P.A. Poli G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 643-647Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear protein extract was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 5% Ficoll-400, 2% glycerol, 0.025% Igepal CA-630, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 10 μg of bovine serum albumin and 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI·dC). 100,000 cpm of radiolabeled consensus oligonucleotide (∼0.1 pmol) was subsequently added to each sample, and incubated at room temperature for an additional 30 min. Samples labeled cold competitor indicate the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled κB oligonucleotide. Protein-DNA complexes were subsequently resolved in a 5% native Tris/taurine-buffered gel. Gels were dried and exposed to autoradiographic film at −80 °C. Following treatment with experimental agents, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested using a cell scraper and collected by centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. 15 μg of RNA was dried using a Speed-Vac (Savant) and stored at −80 °C. Radiolabeled antisense RNA was synthesized using the Riboprobe transcription kit (Promega) and [α-32P]CTP, 800 Ci/mmol (ICN). The antisense templates for murine IFN-β and IκB-α were constructed using a reverse transcriptase-PCR method. Briefly, total RNA collected from LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript preamplification system (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was subsequently amplified by PCR using the puReTaq Ready-To-Go PCR system (Amersham Biosciences). For IFN-β, the primers 5′-AAACAATTTCTCCAGCACTG-3′ and 5′-ATTCTGAGGCATCAACTGAC-3′ were used, and for IκB-α the primers 5′-TGGCCTTCCTCAACTTCC-3′ and 5′-CTGCGTCAAGACTGCTACAC-3′ were used. The resulting PCR products were annealed into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), amplified in competent E. coli, and linearized using the restriction enzymes NcoI andSpeI, respectively. The probe for IFN-β yields a protected fragment of 312 nucleotides, and the probe for IκB-α yields a protected fragment of 194 nucleotides. The template for murine β-actin was purchased from Ambion and yields a protected fragment of 245 nucleotides. Ribonuclease protection assay was performed using the RPA-III kit (Ambion), but substituting RNase ONE (Promega) for the supplied RNases. Protected fragments were resolved using a 5% polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1) 25 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 8 m urea gel. Gels were dried, and exposed to both autoradiographic film and a PhosphorImager cassette (Amersham Biosciences). The radiographic intensities of individual bands on the gels were determined using the program ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages LPS (100 ng/ml) induced a rapid phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase on amino acid residues threonine 180 (Thr-180) and tyrosine 182 (Tyr-182). Phosphorylation of JNK (p46 and p54) was also induced on amino acid residues threonine 183 (Thr-183) and tyrosine 185 (Tyr-185) (Fig. 1). Nonstimulated macrophages did not have detectable levels of phosphorylated p38 or JNK. At 15 min after LPS addition, phosphorylation of both p38 and JNK was noticeably up-regulated. However, by 45 min levels of phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK had decreased significantly, and by 75 min had returned to an almost undetectable level, as in nonstimulated cells. Simultaneous treatment of macrophages with LPS and the NO donor, DEA/NO, significantly enhanced phosphorylation of both p38 and JNK. In contrast to macrophages treated with LPS alone, when treated with LPS plus DEA/NO, the levels of phosphorylated p38 and JNK remained elevated at the 45- and 75-min time points after addition. This is despite our calculations that the NO donor was fully degraded at these time points, because of its relatively short half-life (∼2 min at 37 °C, pH 7.4). The effect of adding DEA/NO alone on p38 and JNK phosphorylation was also investigated. DEA/NO was capable of inducing a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of both MAP kinases, which was significantly stronger and of greater duration than in cells treated with LPS alone. As a control, the products of DEA/NO decomposition were tested for their ability to activate p38 and JNK phosphorylation. In contrast to freshly prepared DEA/NO, decomposed DEA/NO (obtained by allowing DEA/NO to decay in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, at 25 °C for several days), which contains mostly nitrite and diethylamine, had no observable effect on either p38 or JNK phosphorylation. MAP kinase pathways have been demonstrated to contribute to the activation of NF-κB. Therefore, the effect of DEA/NO on the degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory protein, IκB-α, was investigated. Accordingly, RAW macrophages were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml), DEA/NO (1 mm), or LPS plus DEA/NO for various amounts of time, and total protein samples were analyzed by immunoblot for IκB-α expression. Treatment of macrophages with LPS alone induced a rapid degradation of IκB-α (Fig.2). A total loss of detectable IκB-α protein was observed 15 min after LPS addition, but by 45 min the levels of IκB-α had recovered to the basal level. In contrast, when macrophages were treated simultaneously with a combination of LPS (100 ng/ml) and DEA/NO (1 mm), IκB-α levels remained low at 45 and 75 min after treatment. The ability of DEA/NO to inhibit the restoration of IκB-α levels in LPS-stimulated macrophages was both concentration- and time-dependent. Higher concentrations of DEA/NO (100 μm to 1 mm) were most effective at inhibiting IκB-α levels, and at maintaining this inhibition at later time points (Fig.3). Because DEA/NO alone was capable of inducing p38 and JNK phosphorylation, it was hypothesized that DEA/NO might also induce IκB-α degradation in the absence of LPS. However, IκB-α levels in cells not treated with LPS were unaffected by the addition of DEA/NO, indicating that NO alone and the resulting activation of p38 and JNK pathways is insufficient to cause NF-κB activation (data not shown).Figure 3Concentration-dependent enhancement of LPS-induced degradation of IκB-α by DEA/NO. RAW 264.7 macrophages were untreated, treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or LPS + DEA/NO (100 μm to 1 mm) for 45 (A) min, or 75 min (B). 20 μg of total protein per sample was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nitrocellulose blots were probed with antibodies specific for IκB-α or actin (loading control). The immunoblots shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is regulated by the degradation of the inhibitor, IκB, and the resulting translocation of the p50/p65 heterodimer into the nucleus. Nuclear p50/p65 then mediates the transcription of target genes. Because DEA/NO enhanced the magnitude and duration of LPS-induced IκB-α degradation, we decided to examine the effect of DEA/NO on LPS-induced NF-κB translocation. A modest level of NF-κB exists in the nucleus of nonstimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. When treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 75 min, the nuclear levels of p50 and p65 were moderately increased. However, when treated with a combination of LPS and DEA/NO (100 μm to 1 mm), the nuclear levels of p50 and p65 increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4). The activity of NF-κB in the nucleus is also regulated by the inhibitory actions of IκB, which has been reported to enter the nucleus and down-regulate NF-κB-mediated gene expression (28Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of LPS and DEA/NO on nuclear IκB-α expression was also investigated. Whereas nuclear IκB-α expression by immunoblot analysis could not be detected, significant levels of the p50 precursor protein, p105 were observed. Like IκB, p105 is able to repress NF-κB through its inhibitory associations with the transcription factor, masking the nuclear translocation and DNA-binding domains (29Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Fujita T. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3003-3009Google Scholar). LPS alone did not cause a significant reduction in p105 levels at 45 min following treatment (Fig. 4). However, simultaneous addition of LPS and DEA/NO induced a marked, concentration-dependent decrease in nuclear p105 expression, suggesting that less nuclear NF-κB is in an inactive state, and able to promote the transcription of target genes. Other investigators have reported that NO may inhibit DNA binding of NF-κB because of the formation of an S-nitrosothiol on residue Cys-62 of the p50 subunit. Therefore, nuclear protein extracts from DEA/NO-treated macrophages were tested for their ability to bind to a κB oligonucleotide. As determined by EMSA, a dramatic increase in NF-κB binding was seen at higher DEA/NO concentrations (Fig. 5), consistent with the enhanced p50 and p65 levels in the nucleus (Fig.4). Nuclear extracts from macrophages were also treated in vitro with DEA/NO to verify that NO could inhibit the DNA binding of NF-κB, which has been reported by other investigators (30Matthews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Google Scholar, 31Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts from LPS-induced macrophages, or recombinant human p50 were treated with DEA/NO (1 mm final concentration) and analyzed by EMSA in the presence or absence of DTT (1 mm). DTT was added 1 h subsequent to the NO donor to limit the production of HNO from the reaction of NO with DTT. Consistent with the observations in these earlier reports, the addition of NO to NF-κB in the absence of reducing thiols completely inhibited NF-κB binding to DNA (data not shown). When DTT was added to the reaction after DEA/NO, the inhibition was reversed, and the full level of DNA binding was restored. The results of this experiment are consistent with results from the exposure of NO to cultured cells (Fig.5). Thus, the reason that the inhibition of NF-κB was not observed when cultured cells were treated with DEA/NO is likely because of the high intracellular thiol content, which limitsS-nitrosation. The increase in NF-κB activation caused by DEA/NO was significantly greater at higher concentrations (500 μm to 1 mm). Therefore, we hypothesized that the effect on NF-κB was related to nitrosation reactions associated with the generation of NO2 and N2O3, which is facilitated by high NO levels. To examine this possibility, the compound carboxy-PTIO was used. In combination with NO added in the form of DEA/NO, carboxy-PTIO can be utilized to generate NO2 and N2O3 (32Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30085-30091Google Scholar). Thus, carboxy-PTIO enhances the nitrosative reactions caused by the addition of DEA/NO. Accordingly, the addition of DEA/NO (1 mm) alone caused a significant increase in NF-κB binding, but the simultaneous addition of DEA/NO and carboxy-PTIO (100 μm) caused a further increase in NF-κB (Fig. 6). Therefore, we speculate that the biochemical mechanism by which NO increases NF-κB activation is likely correlated with a nitrosation event. NF-κB and the MAP kinase-activated transcription factors c-Jun and activating transcription factor-2 are part of an enhanceosome complex that is responsible for the induction of IFN-β in LPS-stimulated or virus-challenged cells. Because DEA/NO enhanced NF-κB activation in LPS-treated macrophages and stimulated phosphorylation of p38 and JNK MAP kinases, we decided to investigate the effect of DEA/NO on IFN-β gene expression. Addition of LPS (100 ng/ml) induced a modest expression of IFN-β mRNA, measured 3 h later (Fig.7). Simultaneous treatment with LPS and DEA/NO (100 μm to 1 mm) caused a dramatic concentration-dependent increase in IFN-β mRNA levels. To examine the contribution of NO-derived nitrosating species (NO2 and N2O3) to the enhanced expression of IFN-β mRNA, carboxy-PTIO (100 μm) was added in combination with DEA/NO. Accordingly, the addition of carboxy-PTIO caused a marked increase in IFN-β mRNA levels compared with treatment with DEA/NO alone (Fig. 7). This data supports the hypothesis that the stimulatory effect of DEA/NO correlates with the nitrosation of some biochemical species, which promotes the enhanced activation of NF-κB and transcription of NF-κB regulated genes. The expression of IκB-α is also mediated by NF-κB, evidenced by the presence of κB regulatory elements in its promoter region (33Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Google Scholar, 34Noble P.W. McKee C.M. Cowman M. Shin H.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2373-2378Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of DEA/NO on LPS-stimulated IκB-α message expression was also examined. Similar to the effect on IFN-β, the addition of LPS (100 ng/ml) induced a modest expression of IκB-α mRNA (Fig. 8). Furthermore, simultaneous treatment with LPS and DEA/NO (100 μm to 1 mm) caused a dramatic concentration-dependent increase in IκB-α message expression. However, the magnitude of the effect was not as substantial as the increase in IFN-β expression caused by DEA/NO. We currently speculate that the reason IFN-β expression is more enhanced by DEA/NO than IκB-α is because of the additional contribution of MAP kinase-stimulated transcription factors in the IFN-β promoter. The NO donor, DEA/NO, decomposes spontaneously at physiological pH to NO and other products. To confirm that our observations were because of an effect of NO, and not other decomposition products, an additional NO donor was compared for its effects on IFN-β and IκB-α mRNA expression. Thus, the NO donor, MAHMA/NO (500 μm, 1 mm) was added to macrophages in combination with LPS (100 ng/ml), and total RNA was extracted 3 h later. RNA was then analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay for the levels of IFN-β and IκB-α transcripts. The addition of MAHMA/NO caused a similar, concentrationdependent enhancement in the expression of IFN-β and IκB-α (Fig. 9). Moreover, the magnitude of the increase in mRNA expression was comparable with that caused by DEA/NO under the same range of concentrations. We also examined the possibility that an increase in mRNA stability was accounting for the observed elevation in IFN-β message levels. However, the addition of actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) to inhibit mRNA transcription indicated no differences in IFN-β mRNA lifetime between LPS-treated and LPS plus DEA/NO-treated cells (Fig.10). This data implies that the enhancement of IFN-β mRNA levels caused by DEA/NO is not because of a change in message stability, but rather to an increase in the efficiency of transcription. NO is an endogenous free radical species that is both a signaling molecule and a cytotoxic agent (35MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Google Scholar, 36Ignarro L.J. Biosci. Rep. 1999; 19: 51-71Google Scholar). The function of NO in the immune system is principally to facilitate the killing of invading microorganisms.

When expressed as individual subunits or domains, TAP1 and TAP2 NBD differ markedly in their nucleotide binding properties. We investigated whether the two nucleotide-binding sites of TAP1/TAP2 complexes also differed in their nucleotide binding properties. To facilitate electrophoretic separation of the subunits when in complex, we used TAP complexes in which one of the subunits was expressed as a fluorescent protein fusion construct. In binding experiments at 4 °C using the photo-cross-linkable nucleotide analogs 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP, TAP2 was found to have reduced affinity for nucleotides compared with TAP1, when the two proteins were separately expressed.

TAP1/TAP2 NBD interactions appear to contribute at least in part to enhanced nucleotide binding at the TAP2 site upon TAP1/TAP2 complex formation.

Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Google Scholar). TAP is comprised of two related subunits, TAP1 and TAP2, which are necessary and sufficient for peptide translocation from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (2Abele R. Tampe R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Google Scholar, 3Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 68: 191-256Google Scholar). Both proteins contain an N-terminal membrane-spanning region (MSR) and a C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Peptide translocation by TAP complexes is preceded by peptide binding to the cytosolic face of TAP1/TAP2 complexes, a step that appears to be nucleotide binding-independent, at least at low temperatures (4Androlewicz M.J. Ortmann B. van Endert P.M. Spies T. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12716-12720Google Scholar, 5Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Google Scholar). However, the presence of ATP or ADP is critical for maintaining the structural stability of TAP complexes at physiological temperatures (6van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14632-14638Google Scholar), and TAP mutants that are defective in nucleotide binding at the TAP2 site lose their ability to bind peptide at 37 °C but not at lower temperatures (7Saveanu L. Daniel S. van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22107-22113Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis is critical for peptide translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (8Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Google Scholar), and a peptide-stimulated ATPase activity has been described for TAP complexes (9Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Google Scholar). The role of each NBD during peptide translocation is not well understood. Mutations in both NBD have been shown to affect peptide translocation efficiency, although mutations on TAP2 NBD generally have more severe consequences. Based upon mutagenesis studies at structurally analogous residues on TAP1 and TAP2, experiments from several labs have resulted in the postulation of functional distinctions between a TAP1 and a TAP2 NBD during transport (5Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Google Scholar, 7Saveanu L. Daniel S. van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22107-22113Google Scholar, 10Alberts P. Daumke O.

A. 2001; 98: 7431-7436Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies indicated that chimeric TAP complexes containing two TAP1 NBD and two TAP2 NBD are capable of peptide translocation but with reduced efficiency relative to wild type complexes (12Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7241-7246Google Scholar). TAP complexes containing two TAP2 NBD were less efficient in nucleotide binding and peptide translocation, relative to TAP complexes containing two TAP1 NBD. Likewise the isolated TAP2 subunit and TAP2 NBD bound nucleotides with reduced efficiency compared with the isolated TAP1 subunit and TAP1 NBD (5Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Google Scholar, 7Saveanu L. Daniel S. van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22107-22113Google Scholar, 11Karttunen J.T. Lehner P.J. Gupta S.S. Hewitt E.W. Cresswell P.

These observations raised the question of whether the TAP1 and TAP2 nucleotide-binding sites of TAP1/TAP2 complexes also had distinct nucleotide binding properties. TAP is a member of a family of transporter proteins called ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC transporters have similar domain organizations and have considerable sequence identity in their NBD. Conserved sequence motifs within the NBD include the Walker A and Walker B motifs, the consensus C (signature) motif, and the switch region (reviewed in Ref. 14Jones P.M. George A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 187-202Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence in the literature that the NBD of ABC transporters interact in a manner similar to that observed in the DNA repair enzyme Rad50 (15Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Google Scholar). Indeed, recent structures of the intact ABC transporter (BtuCD) (16Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Google Scholar) and of NBD dimers of the ABC transporter MJ0796 (17Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Google Scholar) and biochemical studies analyzing the products of vanadate-catalyzed photo-cleavage of the maltose transporter NBD (18Fetsch E.E. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9685-9690Google Scholar) have provided strong evidence in favor of a Rad50-like NBD-NBD interface for ABC transporters. In such an interaction, each ATP-binding site is comprised of residues that derive from the interface of two NBD. If TAP1 and TAP2 NBD interact in a Rad50-like manner, the TAP1 nucleotide-binding site would contain residues primarily from the Walker A motif of TAP1 and from the consensus C motif of TAP2, whereas the TAP2 nucleotide-binding site would include residues primarily from the Walker A motif of TAP2 and the TAP1 consensus C motif (see “Discussion”). A Rad50-like interface for ABC transporter NBD could explain the high degree of conservation of the consensus C motif. Furthermore, a Rad50-like interface provides a greater number of protein-nucleotide contacts than those observed in structures of ABC transporter NBD monomers (19Yuan Y.R. Blecker S. Martsinkevich O. Millen L. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32313-32321Google Scholar, 20Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Google Scholar, 21Gaudet R. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4964-4972Google Scholar). Therefore, it was conceivable that the nucleotide binding properties of isolated TAP1 and TAP2 subunits were not reflective of their nucleotide binding properties when in complex. Human TAP1 and TAP2 are not well resolved on SDS-PAGE gels; however, by creating a fusion protein of TAP1 and TAP2 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (TAP1-eGFP) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (TAP2-eYFP), respectively, the complexes of one tagged subunit and the partner untagged subunit could be easily resolved and quantified on a gel. By cross-linking radiolabeled 8-azido nucleotides at varying concentrations, we were able to derive affinity constants for 8-azido nucleotide binding to the individual TAP subunits when expressed alone and in complex. We found that in a TAP1/TAP2 complex, but not in the individual subunits, the nucleotide binding affinities derived from labeling of the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits, respectively, were almost identical. The TAP2 subunit when expressed alone had reduced affinity for both nucleotide triphosphates and nucleotide diphosphates, compared with TAP1. Baculoviruses encoding wild type human TAP1 and TAP2 were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Robert Tampé (22Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Google Scholar). We have previously described the construction of baculoviruses encoding the TAP1 mutant (TAP1(K544M) and the TAP2 mutant (TAP2(K509M)) (5Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Google Scholar). Construction of the chimeric TAP proteins T1MT2C (containing the TAP1 MSR and TAP2 NBD) and T2MT1C (containing the TAP2 MSR and TAP1 NBD) has also previously been described (12Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7241-7246Google Scholar). For construction of TAP1 and TAP2 fluorescent protein fusions, human TAP1 and TAP2 cDNA were obtained from Dr. John Trowsdale. Bridge PCR was used to generate the TAP1-eGFP fusion, for which the eGFP template was obtained from the pEGFP plasmid (Clontech). The first PCR amplified the TAP1 portion of the fusion construct using a 5′ primer with aBglII site followed by a sequence complementary to the 5′ end of TAP1 and a 3′ primer with the last 15 nucleotides of the TAP1 sequence and the first 15 nucleotides of the eGFP sequence. The second PCR used a 5′ primer that was complementary to the 3′ primer used for TAP1 amplification and a 3′ primer complementary to the 3′ end of the eGFP sequence followed by a BglII site. Both of these PCR products were gel-extracted and used as templates for a third PCR, which used the 5′ primer of the TAP1 PCR and the 3′ primer of the eGFP PCR. This bridge PCR product was gel-extracted, ligated into pPCRScript (Stratagene), and sequenced. The TAP1-eGFP fusion was then ligated into the Bgl II site of pAcUW51 (BD Pharmingen), which was used to generate a TAP1-eGFP-encoding baculovirus using the BaculoGold Transfection kit (BD Pharmingen). For construction of the TAP2-eYFP fusion, TAP2 in pCR2.1 (5Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Google Scholar) was first extracted by PCR using 5′ and 3′ primers that had BglII sites. Two extra nucleotides were added between the last codon of TAP2 and the 3′ BglII site to maintain the reading frame for YFP. This PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into the vector pPCR Script (Stratagene). The TAP2 was then excised from pPCRscript withBglII and ligated into the vector pVL1393-YP (BD Pharmingen) at the BamHI site to generate the TAP2 fusion with YFP. This vector was then used to generate a TAP2-eYFP-encoding baculovirus. Sf21 cells were cultured in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown to confluence and infected with the desired baculovirus combinations at appropriate multiplicities of infection values (usually 5–30, depending on the individual baculovirus) and incubated at 27 °C for ∼60 h. Following these infections, microsomal membrane fractions were generated as described (22Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Google Scholar). TAP expression in the microsomes was verified by immunoblotting analyses with the TAP1-specific antibody 148.3 (22Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Google Scholar) and the TAP2-specific antibody (435.3) (23van Endert P.M. Tampe R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Google Scholar). Where comparison of the relative expression levels of the different TAP constructs was required, we used the 1P3 antiserum (24Nijenhuis M. Hammerling G.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5467-5477Google Scholar), which recognizes all of the TAP constructs described here. Iodinated peptide translocation experiments were performed using the desired microsome preparations as described previously (5Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Google Scholar). This procedure was based upon well characterized assays (8Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Google Scholar, 22Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Google Scholar). Insect cell microsomes were washed three times in assay buffer (40 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) and resuspended in half their original volume in the same buffer. When 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP was used, the following ATPase inhibitors were added to the assay buffer: 5 mmNaN3, 2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm ouabain. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP, 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP, or 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP (Affinity Labeling Technologies) and assay buffer were combined in a total volume of 10 μl, following which 10 μl of the washed microsomes were added. After a 15-min incubation on ice, the samples were transferred to wells of a 96-well plate on ice, cross-linked immediately with a 254-nm UV lamp for 3 min, and then transferred back into tubes. The samples were then washed three times with assay buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and dried using a Bio-Rad model 483 gel drier. The dried gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager plate overnight, and labeled TAP proteins were visualized using a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics). Quantifications were obtained using ImageQuant software. After background subtraction, the amounts of radioactivity observed were plotted and analyzed using the Prism software package (graph Pad software). The data were fitted to a one-site binding equation, Y =B max*X/(K D +X), where B max is the maximal binding, X is the concentration of 8-azido nucleotide, andK D is the binding constant for 8-azido-32P-nucleotide. Typically, between 60 and 80% of the input radioactivity was associated with the supernatants from the first centrifugation step after cross-linking, with a higher percentage being associated at the higher concentrations of 8-azido nucleotides. Analogous binding experiments with crude membranes have previously been used to estimate the 8-azido nucleotide binding affinities of the NBD of P-glycoprotein and CFTR, respectively (25Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15419-15425Google Scholar, 26Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21199-21208Google Scholar). For the ATP/ADP competition experiments, the same protocol as above was used, except that varying amounts (0.25–600 μm) of unlabeled ATP or ADP were added to the tubes before adding the microsomes. The EC50 values were derived by plotting labeling intensities corresponding to TAP1 and TAP2 as a function of unlabeled ATP and ADP concentrations. We created TAP1-eGFP and TAP2-eYFP fusion constructs and expressed the proteins in insect cells using a baculovirus-based system. By expressing tagged TAP1 protein (TAP1-eGFP), tagged TAP2 protein (TAP2-eYFP), wild type TAP1, or wild type TAP2 in any combination of a TAP1 and a TAP2, we were able to generate complexes that were functional for peptide translocation. This was tested by using insect cell microsomes expressing both tagged proteins (TAP1-eGFP/TAP2-eYFP) or the individual subunits expressed singly in a radiolabeled peptide-based translocation assay. Indeed, the tagged TAP complex was able to translocate peptides, whereas the individual subunits were not (Fig. 1 B). TAP complexes expressing one tagged subunit and one wild type subunit (TAP1-eGFP/TAP2 and TAP1/TAP2-eYFP) were also competent for peptide translocation (data not shown). We next examined 8-azido-[α-32P]nucleotide binding to individual TAP subunits or TAP complexes in which one of the subunits was expressed as a fluorescent protein fusion construct. To examine 8-azido-[α-32P]nucleotide binding in the absence of detergent, we incubated insect cell microsomes expressing one or both TAP subunits or neither protein with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by UV-induced covalent cross-linking of bound 8-azido-[α-32P]nucleotides. The membranes were washed to remove unbound nucleotide. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins that had bound 8-azido-[α-32P]nucleotides were visualized using phosphorimaging analyses of dried gels. Compared with microsomes derived from uninfected cells, additional labeled bands were visualized in microsomes expressing one or both TAP subunits at the expected molecular weights corresponding to the wild type subunits and/or that corresponding to the fluorescent protein fusion constructs (Fig.1 D, lane 1 compared with other lanes). The use of the fluorescent protein epitope tags allowed for adequate separation of the TAP subunits by SDS-PAGE and for visualization of the labeling of individual components of the TAP1/TAP2 complex by 8-azido-[α-32P]nucleotides (Fig. 1 D,lane 2). Labeling of TAP subunits was inhibitable by unlabeled ATP and ADP, with derived EC50 values in the low micromolar range (Fig. 1, E and F, respectively). For all of the ATP binding analyses described here on in the manuscript, we used 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP rather than 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, because we found that insect cell microsomal membrane preparations had measurable ATPase activity, even at 4 °C in the presence of the ATPase inhibitors ouabain, EGTA, and sodium azide (regardless of TAP expression). Although 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP would be expected to be hydrolyzed as efficiently as 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, labeling by 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP would report just on nucleotide triphosphate binding to TAP complexes. Microsomal membrane fractions were prepared of insect cells infected with viruses encoding single TAP subunits (Fig. 2 A), or TAP1/TAP2 combinations (Fig. 2, B and C). For examining nucleotide binding by TAP2 when in complex, the TAP1 component was expressed in excess (Fig. 2 B), and for examining nucleotide binding by TAP1 when in complex, the TAP2 component was expressed in excess (Fig. 2 C). The membranes were incubated with different concentrations of photo-cross-linkable nucleotide analog 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP, followed by UV cross-linking and analyses of TAP labeling by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging analyses (Fig.2, D–F). The extent of labeling of the TAP subunits was quantified using ImageQuant software, plotted as a function of the input 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP concentration, and then fitted to a one-site binding model to derive K D values corresponding to TAP1 and TAP2 labeling, when expressed individually or in combination (Fig. 2, G–I). TAP2-eYFP (or TAP2; data not shown), when expressed separately, had reduced 8-azido-ATP binding affinity (K D = 19.3 ± 2.5 μm) compared with TAP1 (K D = 4.6 ± 1.9 μm) (or TAP1-eGFP; data not shown) expressed alone (Fig. 2 G and TableI). When TAP2 is complexed with excess TAP1-eGFP, the affinity corresponding to the TAP2 labeling is increased (K D = 2.7 ± 1 μm) (Fig.2 H and Table I). Mutation of the TAP2 Walker A lysine residue (TAP2(K509M)) reduced the TAP2-associated signal and derived affinity (K D > 20 μm when expressed in complex with TAP1-eGFP) (Fig. 2, E, bottom panel compared with top panel, and H and Table I). Thus, the 8-azido-ATP binding affinity derived for TAP2 in the wild type TAP1-eGFP/TAP2 complexes (K D = 2.7 ± 1 μm) must correspond to binding via residues in the TAP2 Walker A motif. These studies indicated that the nucleotide binding affinity of the isolated TAP2 subunit was lower than that of the TAP1 counterpart but that TAP1/TAP2 complex formation induced changes that enhanced the nucleotide binding affinity at the TAP2 site.Table IApparent affinities of the wild type or mutant TAP subunits for 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP when expressed individually or in combination with an excess of partner TAP subunit.K D(ATP)nK D (ADP)nμmμmTAP2 nucleotide bindingTAP2-eYFP19.3 ± 2.524.4 ± 1.42TAP2/TAP1-eGFP2.7 ± 1.030.5 ± 0.12TAP2(K509M)/TAP1-eGFP>2049.0 ± 1.42TAP1 nucleotide bindingTAP14.6 ± 1.931.4 ± 0.12TAP1-eGFP/TAP22.1 ± 0.830.7 ± 0.13TAP1-eGFP/TAP2(K509M)2.8 ± 2.940.6 ± 0.23 Open table in a new tab When TAP1-eGFP is co-expressed with excess TAP2 (Fig. 2, C,F, and I), the affinity corresponding to TAP1-eGFP labeling was 2.1 ± 0.8 μm (Fig.2 I and Table I). In the corresponding TAP1-eGFP/TAP2(K509M) complexes, a similar affinity was derived corresponding to TAP1-eGFP labeling (K D = 2.8 ± 2.9 μm) (Fig. 2 I and Table I). Thus, high affinity binding by TAP1-eGFP is visualized even in the absence of high affinity nucleotide binding to TAP2. However, the signals derived for TAP1-eGFP in the TAP1-eGFP/TAP2(K509M) mutant complex are reduced compared with that derived for the wild type complex (Fig. 2 I), even though slightly higher levels of TAP1-eGFP were present in the mutant complex (Fig. 2 C,lane 1 compared with lane 2). Taken together, the observations described so far indicate that both nucleotide-binding sites of TAP1/TAP2 complexes can bind 8-azido-ATP with similar affinities. However, the signal intensitiescorresponding to TAP2 labeling are consistently lower than those observed for TAP1 labeling (for example, Fig. 2 F, compare TAP1-EGFP and TAP2 labeling in the upper panel), even when the expression level of TAP1 is lower than TAP2 (Fig. 2 C,lane 1). Possible explanations for this observation are considered under “Discussion.” The data shown in Fig. 2 were derived from analyses of 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP binding to TAP1/TAP2 complexes. A similar set of analyses was also carried out using 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP, and analogous results were obtained (Table I). TAP2-eYFP had reduced affinity for 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP compared with TAP1 when the two subunits were separately expressed. Complex formation with TAP1 increased the binding affinity corresponding to TAP2 labeling by 9-fold (Table I), whereas complex formation with TAP2 increased the binding affinity corresponding to TAP1 labeling by only 2-fold (Table I). The marked affinity enhancement at the TAP2 nucleotide-binding site upon TAP1/TAP2 complex formation could result from a general stabilization of the TAP2 structure upon TAP1/TAP2 complex formation or, more specifically, result from NBD-NBD interactions that allow a greater set of nucleotide contacts at the TAP2 site of TAP1/TAP2 complexes compared with free TAP2. To distinguish these possibilities, we compared affinities corresponding to TAP1 and TAP2 labeling in TAP1/TAP2-eYFP complexes as well as T1MT2C/TAP2-eYFP complexes. T1MT2C is a chimeric protein containing the MSR of TAP1 and the NBD of TAP2 (12Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7241-7246Google Scholar). We have previously shown that this chimera forms complexes with TAP2 and that these complexes are functional for peptide translocation, although with reduced efficiency relative to wild type. The affinity corresponding to TAP2-eYFP labeling was 1.8 ± 1.4 μm in TAP1/TAP2-eYFP complexes, compared with 11.4 ± 2.4 μm in T1MT2C/TAP2-eYFP complexes (∼6-fold different; Fig. 3 C, first and second panels). As expected, the affinity corresponding to T1MT2C labeling was also reduced in T1MT2C/TAP2-eYFP complexes (25 ± 14.2 μm) (Fig. 3). These observations suggested that TAP1/TAP2 NBD/NBD interactions are important for optimal nucleotide binding at the TAP2 nucleotide-binding site and that TAP2/TAP2 NBD interactions or TAP1/TAP2 MSR interactions are not fully sufficient for affinity enhancement at the TAP2 site. We also examined 8-azido-ATP binding by TAP1-eGFP/T2MT1C complexes (Fig. 3, B and C, third panel). T2MT1C is a chimeric construct containing the MSR of TAP2 and the NBD of TAP1 (12Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7241-7246Google Scholar). We previously showed strong binding of TAP1/T2MT1C complexes to ATP and ADP agarose beads compared with TAP2/T1MT2C complexes, which correlated with enhanced translocation efficiency of the TAP1/T2MT1C complexes. Measurement of 8-azido-ATP binding to TAP1-eGFP/T2MT1C complexes indicated an affinity of 0.5 ± 0.3 μmcorresponding to T2MT1C labeling and 0.4 ± 0.1 μmcorresponding to TAP1-eGFP labeling. Interestingly, at comparable expression levels, the intensity of labeling of the T2MT1C construct was significantly higher than that of TAP1-eGFP (Fig. 3, Band C, third panel), a reversal of the trend observed with TAP1-eGFP/TAP2 complexes (Figs. 2 F and 3,B and C, top panels). Furthermore unlike TAP2, T2MT1C bound 8-azido-ATP with high affinity regardless of being complexed with TAP1 (data not shown). Thus, whereas high affinity nucleotide binding to a TAP1 NBD is observed both in the presence and absence of a TAP2 NBD, high affinity nucleotide binding to a TAP2 NBD requires the presence of a TAP1 NBD. The above observations raised the possibility that the presence of TAP1 residues at the TAP2 nucleotide-binding site could be responsible for the observed affinity enhancement at the TAP2 site upon TAP1/TAP2 complex formation. To further explore this possibility and also investigate the effect of TAP1 nucleotide binding upon TAP2 labeling, we examined 8-azido-ATP binding by a mutant TAP complex containing a defective TAP1 nucleotide-binding site (Fig. 4). We previously showed that mutation of the Walker A lysine of TAP1 (TAP1(K544M)) resulted in significantly reduced binding of single subunit TAP1 to ATP- and ADP-agarose beads (5Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, when TAP1(K544M) was expressed in combination with TAP2-eYFP, the labeling intensities observed for TAP1(K544M) and TAP2-eYFP were almost identical over the entire concentration range, and thus, nearly identical affinities were derived (3.8 ± 3.5 and 4.0 ± 2.5 μm, corresponding to TAP1(K544M) and TAP2-eYFP labeling, respectively; Fig. 4, A–C). The parent TAP1/TAP2-eYFP complexes yielded K Dvalues of 1.5 ± 0.4 and 1.3 ± 0.5 μm, corresponding to labeling of TAP1 and TAP2-eYFP, respectively (data not shown). We also investigated labeling of TAP1(K544M) in the absence of a functional TAP2 nucleotide-binding site. For these analyses, we prepared microsomes containing TAP1(K544M)/TAP2 complexes and TAP1(K544M)/TAP2(K509M) complexes. Because only untagged versions (but not fluorescent protein fusions) of the mutant TAP subunits were available, only the combined signal on both the TAP1 and TAP2 components could be visualized with these complexes (Fig. 4,D and E). At comparable expression levels of both components (Fig. 4 D), strong labeling was visualized for the TAP1(K544M)/TAP2 combination, whereas signals for the TAP1(K544M)/TAP2(K509M) combination were barely detectable (Fig.4 E, top and middle panels, respectively). These results demonstrated that the TAP1(K544M) component by itself did not bind very efficiently to 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP, consistent with our previous report that the TAP1(K544M) mutant was impaired in binding to ATP-agarose and ADP-agarose beads relative to wild type TAP1 (5Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Google Scholar). Most interestingly, although distinct labeled bands corre"

We compared the results for ligated 40-mer duplexes with those of the mixtures of the two unligated duplexes used to generate the 40-mers. The salient results are as follows: (i) T4 Dam MTase modifies 40-mer duplexes in a processive fashion. (ii) During processive movement, T4 Dam rapidly exchanges productS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) for substrate AdoMet without dissociating from the DNA duplex. (iii) T4 Dam processivity is consistent with an ordered bi-bi mechanism AdoMet↓DNA↓DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑. However, in contrast to the steady state, here DNAMe↑ signifies departure from a methylated site GMTC↑ without physically dissociating from the DNA.

In eukaryotes, this process is essential for controlling transcription, genomic imprinting, developmental regulation, mutagenesis, DNA repair, and chromatin organization (1Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, Dam DNA methyltransferases (MTases)1 regulate a number of cell functions (reviewed in Ref. 2Barras F. Marinus M.G. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 139-143Google Scholar). An essential biological role for DNA adenine methylation in determining bacterial virulence was discovered in Salmonella typhimurium, wheredam− mutants were found to be avirulent; such strains were effective in producing live vaccines against murine typhoid fever (3Heithoff D.M. Sinsheimer R.L. Low D.A. Mahan M.J. Science. 1999; 284: 967-970Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, other MTases are usually found as components of restriction-modification systems (4Anderson J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 24-30Google Scholar). Three kinds of DNA MTases are known to exist in prokaryotes, i.e. C5-cytosine (Cyt), N 4-Cyt, andN 6-adenine (Ade) MTases (1Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of methyl group transfer from the donor,S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), in the case of C5-Cyt MTases, involves an intermediate in which the enzyme is covalently bound to the target Cyt (5Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Google Scholar). In contrast,N 6-Ade and N 4-Cyt MTases transfer a methyl group to the exocyclic amino group without forming such an intermediate. It appears, however, that all MTases access their target base by flipping it out of the DNA double helix, as first reported for HhaI MTase (6Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Google Scholar). In general, DNA MTases appear to be functional monomers, and one of their natural substrates is hemimethylated DNA, the product of semi-conservative DNA replication. Hence, one methyl group transfer is sufficient to methylate completely one specific (hemimethylated) site; this process is generally referred to as “maintenance” methylation. In this regard, productive interaction between a monomeric MTase and its hemimethylated target site is accomplished only after the enzyme is correctly oriented to the unmodified target-strand base. Reich and Mashhoon (7Reich N.E. Mashhoon N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9191-9193Google Scholar), measuring single turnovers in the reaction catalyzed by EcoRI MTase, showed that there was no specificity in binding orientation; i.e. the enzyme methylated only 50% of the substrate-hemimethylated duplexes. However, a different result was obtained in pre-steady state kinetics of methylation of 20-mer duplexes by the bacteriophage T4 Dam (N 6-Ade)-MTase. Equal bursts of product formation were observed with both a symmetric site GATC/GATC and a hemimethylated, asymmetric site, GATC/GMTC (where M representsN 6-methyl Ade) (8Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4207-4211Google Scholar). This was contrary to expectation for a monomeric enzyme binding randomly to its target site with respect to an unmethylated (productive) versusmethylated (nonproductive) strand. We hypothesized that the T4 Dam-AdoMet complex is capable of undergoing a rapid reorientation following binding to the nonproductive DNA strand. Analogous results were obtained for the RsrI (9Szegedi S.S. Reich N.O. Gumport R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3962-3971Google Scholar), HhaI (10Vilkaitis G. Merkiene E. Serva S. Weinhold E. Klimasauskas S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20924-20934Google Scholar), andEcoDam (11Urig S. Gowher H. Herman A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Google Scholar) DNA MTases. Earlier, we investigated the kinetic characteristics of relatively short (20-mer) oligonucleotide substrates containing one specific site, native 5′-GATC/5′-GATC or modified 5′-GATC/5′-GATC (hemimethylated, or with substitutions/deletions of different structural elements in one of the two strands) (8Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4207-4211Google Scholar, 12Malygin E.G. Zinoviev V.V. Petrov N.A. Gorbunov Y.A. Kossykh V.G. Jen-Jacobson L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1135-1144Google Scholar). These studies permitted us to characterize the interaction of T4 Dam with one specific site as well as the influence of defined modifications in site structure on kinetic parameters. In addition, we used fluorescence titration to investigate the interaction of T4 Dam with these 20-mer oligonucleotide duplexes in which one or two target Ade residues were substituted by 2-aminopurine (N), and we showed that AdoMet plays a crucial role in T4 Dam reorientation about the DNA duplex (13Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Google Scholar). The intensity of 2-aminopurine (N) residue fluorescence is low inside the double-stranded DNA helix; however, it increases sharply if the fluorophor is out of stacking interaction, permitting one to study the base flipping process induced by enzyme binding (14Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Google Scholar). The addition of T4 Dam at a saturating concentration to an unmethylated target (N/A duplex) or its methylated derivative (N/M duplex) resulted in an up to 50-fold increase in fluorescence (13Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Google Scholar). This indicated that T4 Dam binding promotes or stabilizes base (nucleoside) flipping out of the DNA helix. However, the addition of AdoMet sharply reduced the Dam-induced fluorescence with these complexes. In contrast, AdoMet had no effect on the fluorescence increase produced with an N/N doubly substituted duplex. Because the N/M duplex cannot be methylated, the AdoMet-induced decrease in fluorescence could not be due to methylation per se. We proposed that T4 Dam randomly binds to the asymmetric N/A and N/M duplexes and that AdoMet induces an allosteric T4 Dam conformational change, allowing a rapid reorientation of the enzyme to the strand that contains the unmethylated Ade. This capability is likely to be advantageous for more efficient maintenance methylationin vivo. Natural in vivo DNA substrates are much longer and contain many potential methylation sites. Thus, in vitro methylation of short single-site duplexes is not going to take into account possible processive behavior of the DNA MTases; i.e.movement of the enzyme along the DNA via one dimensional (or linear) diffusion and carrying out multiple turnovers on the same substrate molecule (11Urig S. Gowher H. Herman A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Google Scholar, 15Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Beechem J.M.

To initiate a bridge between studies using short (20-mer) one-site DNA substrates and natural long DNA substrates, we constructed two-site DNA duplexes to compare their substrate characteristics with those of their one-site constituents. While this work was in progress, Urig et al. (11Urig S. Gowher H. Herman A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Google Scholar) reported that theEcoDam MTase acts in a processive manner on both synthetic duplexes and polymeric phage λ DNA. [3H-CH3]AdoMet (15 Ci/mmol; 1 mCi/ml) was purchased from Amersham. Unlabeled AdoMet (Sigma) was purified further by chromatography on a C18 reversed phase column as described previously (17Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (Table I) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA); their concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. The duplexes were obtained by heating and annealing complementary oligonucleotide chains from 90 to 20 °C over 7–12 h. The 40-mer duplexes were constructed from corresponding short component duplexes using T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase (SibEnzyme). T4 Dam MTase was purified to homogeneity as described previously (17Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), which yielded values in close agreement with those determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm from the known composition and molar extinction coefficients of individual aromatic amino acid residues in 6.0 m guanidinium hydrochloride and 0.02 mphosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H.

DNA MTase assays were similar to those reported previously (20Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Gorbunov Yu.A. Malygin E.G. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 481-488Google Scholar). T4 Dam reactions were carried out at 25 °C in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (17Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Google Scholar). The reactions were initiated by the addition of prewarmed T4 Dam to preincubated mixtures of [3H-CH3]AdoMet and substrate DNA. At appropriate intervals, aliquots (15 μl) were withdrawn from the mixture and spotted on a DE81 anion-exchange filter disc (Whatman, 1.5 cm). Filters were washed three times with 0.02 mNH4HCO3, twice with water, once with 75% ethanol, and then dried. They were counted in a toluene liquid scintillator. The molar concentrations of3H-CH3 groups incorporated into DNA were quantified as described previously (21Thielking V. Dubois S. Eritja R. Guschlbauer W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 407-415Google Scholar). The validity of the quantification procedure was confirmed under complete methylation conditions (∼1 h at a 1:2 enzyme/substrate ratio) where the calculated number of 3H-CH3 groups incorporated into DNA coincided with the number of methylatable Ade residues. All experiments were done at least twice. Kinetic data were analyzed using the program Scientist 2.01 (MicroMath®) for regression analysis. The burst values (B) and steady state rate constants (k cat) were determined using the equation [3H-DNA]/[enzyme] = B +k cat t. Investigation of the kinetics and processivity of methylation of oligomeric and concatemeric DNAs containing multiple GATC and (hemi) methylated GMTC sites can extend our understanding of the mechanism of site/strand selectivity. To approach these issues, we constructed substrates by ligating short, defined synthetic duplexes containing complementary single-stranded overhangs (Table II) and generated a series of 40-mer duplexes with different combinations of GATC and GMTC sites (TableIII). For example, ligation of duplexes 1a/a and 2a/a (each containing a single symmetric unmodified site GATC/GATC) created the control prototype duplex A as illustrated below in Structure 1,Table IISynthetic single-site duplexes used to construct 40-mer substrates containing two specific sitesNo.Combination of oligonucleotidesStructure1a/aI + II5′-CAGTTTAGGATCCATTTCG3′-GTCAAATCCTAGGTAAAGCCTAC1m/aIm + II5′-CAGTTTAGGMTCCATTTCG3′-GTCAAATCCTAGGTAAAGCCTAC1a/mI + IIm5′-CAGTTTAGGATCCATTTCG3′-GTCAAATCCTMGGTAAAGCCTAC1m/mIm + IIm5′-CAGTTTAGGMTCCATTTCG3′-GTCAAATCCTMGGTAAAGCCTAC2a/aIII + IV5′-GATGCATAAGGATCCCTGGGT3′-GTATTCCTAGGGACCCA2m/aIIIm + IV5′-GATGCATAAGGMTCCCTGGGT3′-GTATTCCTAGGGACCCADuplexes were produced by heating and annealing complementary oligonucleotide chains (90–20 °C over 7–12 hours).

Consider the methylation of the 40-mer duplex E (1m/m*2m/a), which has only one GATC site available for methylation. At high [DNA]/[enzyme] ratios, a T4 Dam monomer will bind the duplex, as seen in Structure 2,View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)asymmetrically at one of four possible positions (denoted “1”–“4”). If the enzyme is unable to reorient on the duplex and does not act processively, then we would expect a maximum “burst” value of 0.25 (number of 3H-CH3groups transferred per bound T4 Dam in the pre-steady state phase) because “4” is the only productive site, and appropriate orientation to it is necessary for methylation. However, if the enzyme is capable of reorienting at position “3” to position “4,” then the burst could be as high as 0.5. Moreover, T4 Dam bound at position “1” may be capable of moving (by linear diffusion) to “3” and reorient to “4”; perhaps it might even reorient from “2” to “1” and diffuse to “3,” where it reorients. If some combination of these events occurs, then even higher burst values could be registered (with 1.0 as the theoretical maximum). Hence, by determining the burst value we can ascertain whether T4 Dam was able to adapt to a substrate in which a productive target site-strand represented only one-quarter of the initial binding orientations. This type of experiment was carried out with several 40-mer duplexes containing differing combinations of variant sites. The pre-steady state burst values (B) and steady state rate constants (k cat) were determined for both the 40-mers and the stoichiometric mixtures of the unligated component duplexes used to generate each 40-mer (Fig. 1 and TableIII). The k catvalues for 40-mer duplexes A–D (with two potential sites for methylation) and the corresponding mixtures of constituents were all comparable; they were close to the value of k cat= 0.015 s−1 observed for a single-site 20-mer duplex (20Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Gorbunov Yu.A. Malygin E.G. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 481-488Google Scholar). Hence, it appears that T4 Dam steady state methylation of 40-mer duplexes is similar to the methylation of a shorter 20-mer duplex, and both have the same rate-limiting step in the overall reaction. In this regard, we recently showed that methylation of a 20-mer duplex is consistent with a steady state-ordered bi-bi mechanism in which the order of substrate binding and product release (methylated DNA, DNAMe, and the S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, AdoHcy) is AdoMet↓DNA↓DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑ (21Thielking V. Dubois S. Eritja R. Guschlbauer W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 407-415Google Scholar). The related EcoDam MTase has a steady state-ordered bi-bi mechanism where the order of substrate binding is DNA↓AdoMet↓ (11Urig S. Gowher H. Herman A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Google Scholar). After the chemical step (methyl group transfer from AdoMet to DNA), product DNAMe dissociates relatively rapidly (k off = 1.7 s−1) from the complex. In contrast, dissociation of product AdoHcy proceeds relatively slowly (k off = 0.018 s−1), indicating that its release is the rate-limiting step, consistent with thek cat = 0.015 s−1 (20Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Gorbunov Yu.A. Malygin E.G. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 481-488Google Scholar). In contrast to the results for steady state methylation, the burst values differed for the 40-mer duplexes versus the stoichiometric mixtures of their component-short duplexes. For example, 40-mer duplex A (1a/a*2a/a) had a burst of 1.86 compared with 1.01 for the corresponding mixture of short constituents “1a/a + 2a/a”. The latter burst value was also observed with a single-site 20-mer duplex (8Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4207-4211Google Scholar). It follows that, after methylation of one Ade in the palindromic GATC/GATC site, T4 Dam dissociates from a short duplex prior to its exchanging product AdoHcy for substrate AdoMet. In contrast, the burst value of 1.8 with 40-mer duplex A suggests that, after methylation of one site, T4 Dam is capable of linear diffusion, release of product AdoHcy without dissociating from DNA, binding another AdoMet, and methylation of a second site. This appears to contradict the sequence of events observed during steady state cycles, viz.AdoMet↓DNA↓DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑. To reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we propose the following series of events during the pre-steady state methylation phase of the two-site 40-mer duplex A. First, T4 Dam binds substrate AdoMet (AdoMet↓), this complex binds randomly to the 40-mer duplex (DNA↓), and methylation of a target GATC ensues (GATC→GMTC). Next, T4 Dam bound with product AdoHcy leaves the methylated site (GMTC↑); at a nonspecific DNA sequence, AdoHcy rapidly dissociates from the T4 Dam-DNA-AdoHcy complex (AdoHcy↑) and is exchanged with AdoMet (AdoMet↓). Only this enzymic form is capable of reorientation (8Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4207-4211Google Scholar, 13Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Google Scholar) at a hemimethylated site (see below). This sequence of the events does not contradict the scheme AdoMet↓DNA↓DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑, but here the event DNAMe↑ signifies departure from the GMTC site without physically dissociating from the DNA duplex. We proposed earlier that AdoMet induces an allosteric T4 Dam conformational change, allowing a rapid reorientation of the enzyme to the DNA strand that contains the unmethylated GATC (8Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4207-4211Google Scholar, 13Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O.

Thus, when comparing bursts for different duplexes, it is important to keep in mind that, according to our model, only T4 Dam-AdoMet is capable of reorientation at a hemimethylated site. It follows that when a hemimethylated site is generated enzymatically, the T4 Dam-product AdoHcy cannot reorient to the other strand. Rather, it diffuses away from the newly created GMTC. The 40-mer duplex B (Table III) is distinguished from duplex A by having one hemimethylated target; however, the two bursts were almost identical. This can be explained according to the following scenario. T4 Dam bound oriented to the lower strand can methylate one or two A residues (positions “2” and “4”), assuming for simplicity that diffusion is unidirectional (e.g. only 5′ → 3′). (In contrast, EcoDam appears to diffuse bi-directionally;i.e. does a random walk on the DNA; Ref. 11Urig S. Gowher H. Herman A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Google Scholar). Some T4 Dam molecules may bind duplex B oriented to the top strand and methylate “position 1.” These then diffuse away from the product GMTC site, and exchange AdoHcy for substrate AdoMet. Upon reaching methylated site “3,” the T4 Dam-AdoMet complex reorients to “4” and is proficient for methyl transfer. This route allows for a successive transfer of up to 3 methyl groups, at positions “1,” “4,” and “2,” respectively. Finally, some T4 Dam molecules may bind at “3,” where they can reorient to “4” and then transfer up to two methyl groups to the bottom strand. Thus, with duplex B, the theoretical maximum burst is somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0. However, some T4 Dam molecules may catalyze a methyl transfer and diffuse off the duplex before exchanging product AdoHcy for AdoMet. The observed burst of 1.0 for both unligated A and B component 20-mer duplexes (Table III) is consistent with this notion. It should be noted that our assumption about unidirectional movement is not implausible. The transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to DNA can be considered irreversible for the T4 Dam MTase (22Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 279-286Google Scholar), because the reverse reaction was estimated to be at least 500-fold slower than the forward one. Hence, it follows, that DNA methylation is accompanied by the liberation of significant energy (ΔG0 = −3.7 kcal/mole). This energy can be used in part for T4 Dam isomerization (22Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 279-286Google Scholar) and for unidirectional 5′ → 3′ movement of T4 Dam along the DNA. We measured burst values for duplexes in which two methylated positions are located in cis on one strand (duplex C) or in trans on the complementary strands (duplex D). As shown in TableIII, their burst values were about 1.8. If no reorientation could occur, then we would expect a maximum burst of 0.75 with duplex C, because only one or two methyl transfers would be catalyzed by T4 Dam productively bound on the lower strand. T4 Dam bound unproductively oriented on the top strand would not register any methyl transfers. Furthermore, with duplex D, we'd expect a maximum of one methyl group transferred to each strand, Thus, the observed bursts can best be explained by T4 Dam being capable of rapid reorientation at hemimethylated sites. In this regard, formation of T4 Dam dimers cannot explain these results, because the calculated burst values would have to be reduced 2-fold to account for the binding of two enzyme molecules. Moreover, under the conditions similar to those used in these experiments, we found no evidence for the formation of appreciable amounts of T4 Dam dimers (13Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Google Scholar). The methylation results with duplexes E and F are distinct from those obtained with the other 40-mer duplexes (Table III). First, duplexes E and F have only one methylatable site (M/A and A/A, respectively) plus one fully methylated site (M/M). Both 40-mers gave burst values of about 1.0 (almost 2-fold lower compared with duplexes A–D). In the case of duplex F, this indicates that T4 Dam was not able to reorient following methylation at the A/A site, essentially what would be predicted if T4 Dam-AdoHcy diffused away from an enzymatically created GMTC site and could not reorient. Thus, the interaction of T4 Dam with duplex F is functionally equivalent to that observed for a 20-mer duplex with a single unmethylated site, because both give bursts of 1.0. The unligated duplex F component 20-mers, 1m/m and 2a/a, gave a burst of 0.5 as expected, because one-half of the T4 Dam molecules bound unproductively to the fully methylated 1m/m duplex. For duplex E, T4 Dam binding oriented to the lower strand would result in the transfer of zero or one methyl group, depending on the location of the initial binding and assuming unidirectional diffusion. In contrast, T4 Dam binding oriented to the upper strand would not result in any methyl group transfer to that strand. However, the enzyme could reorient at the hemimethylated M/A site and catalyze methyl transfer. It follows that a burst of one with duplex E is possible only if T4 Dam were able to reorient at the hemimethylated site. The mixtures of unligated, component 20-mers for duplexes E and F contained stoichiometric amounts of molecules with a fully methylated M/M site and a methylatable A/A or M/A site. These mixtures are similar to those for duplexes A and C, except that the latter do not contain any M/M duplexes. Because half of the 20-mer duplex E and F components can not contribute to a burst, we'd predict that the burst values should be ∼50% of those obtained with the duplex A and duplex C mixtures. As seen in Table III, this was indeed the case,i.e. 1.01 versus 0.52 and 1.12 versus0.69. Taken together, these results lend strong support to the model for pre-steady state methylation described above. Finally, it should be noted that the stoichiometric mixtures of the E and F unligated component-short duplexes had about 2-fold lowerk cat and burst values compared with those for duplexes A-D; this might be due to “product inhibition” by the fully methylated, short duplex “1m/m.” In contrast, judging from the higher k cat values for the 40-mer duplexes E and F, it would appear that a fully methylated site exerted little inhibition. This suggests that T4 Dam is better able to move from one site to another on longer 40-mer duplexes compared with dissociation/reassociation with the shorter one-site duplexes. Based on the results presented, we draw the following conclusions. (i) T4 Dam MTase modifies the 40-mer two-site duplexes in a processive fashion. (ii) During processive movement on DNA from one site to the next, T4 Dam is capable of rapidly exchanging product AdoHcy (in the ternary complex) for substrate AdoMet without dissociating from the DNA duplex. (iii) The processive steps of T4 Dam action are consistent with an ordered bi-bi mechanism AdoMet↓DNA↓DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑. However, in contrast to the steady state, here DNAMe↑ signifies departure from a methylated site, GMTC↑, without physically dissociating from the DNA molecule. (iv) Following methyl transfer at one site and linear diffusion to a hemimethylated site, T4 Dam-AdoMet is capable of rapidly reorienting itself to the (productive) unmethylated strand. In contrast, T4 Dam-AdoHcy is not capable of reorientation at an enzymatically created GMTC site. (v) The inhibition potential of fully methylated sites, 5′-GMTC/5′-GMTC, is much lower in a long DNA molecule compared with short single-site duplexes."

The GIRK channels are regulated by diverse intra- and extracellular signaling molecules. Previously, we have shown that GIRK1/GIRK4 channels are activated by extracellular protons. The channel activation depends on a histidine residue in the M1-H5 linker and may play a role in neurotransmission. Here, we show evidence that the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels are inhibited by intracellular acidification. This inhibition was produced by selective decrease in the channel open probability with a modest drop in the single-channel conductance. The inhibition does not seem to require G-proteins as it was seen in two G-protein coupling-defective GIRK mutants and in excised patches in the absence of exogenous G-proteins. Three histidine residues in intracellular domains were critical for the inhibition. Individual mutation of His-64, His-228, or His-352 in GIRK4 abolished or greatly diminished the inhibition in homomeric GIRK4. Mutations of any of these histidine residues in GIRK4 or their counterparts in GIRK1 were sufficient to eliminate the pHi sensitivity of the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. Thus, the molecular and biophysical bases for the inhibition of GIRK channels by intracellular protons are illustrated. Because of the inequality of the pHi and pHo in most cells and their relatively independent controls by cellular versus systemic mechanisms, such pHisensitivity may allow these channels to regulate cellular excitability in certain physiological and pathophysiological conditions when intracellular acidosis occurs.

It is known that the activation of GIRK channels depends on G-protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) that are released from the Gαβγ heterotrimer when G-protein-coupled receptors are activated by extracellular hormones or neurotransmitters. The Gβγ-dependent activation can be eliminated by disrupting certain protein domains and amino acid residues that may be involved in channel gating or the interaction with the Gβγ (4Kunkel M.T.

Such complex regulations suggest that GIRK channels are capable of integrating extra- and intracellular signals and coupling the information to cellular excitability. One important signaling molecule is the hydrogen ion. Our recent studies have shown that the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels are stimulated by a drop in extracellular pH (pHo) (20Mao J. Li L. McManus M. Wu J. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46166-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The pHo sensitivity depends on a histidine residue located in the M1-H5 linker and may play a role in enhancing the GIRK-mediated synaptic transmission. Increasing evidence indicates that intracellular protons can serve as a second messenger in regulating multiple cellular functions (21Yuli I. Oplatka A. Science. 1987; 235: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Alfonso A. Cabado A.G. Vieytes M.R. Botana L.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas pHo is controlled by several buffer systems, allowing its change in a rather narrow range, intracellular pH (pHi) can vary widely under certain physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In the central nervous system, intracellular protons are involved in modulations of synaptic transmission, membrane excitability, and neuronal plasticity (23Kaila K. Ransom B.R. Kaila K. Ransom B.R. pH and Brain Function. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 3-10Google Scholar) in which GIRK channels are ubiquitously involved (3Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-760PubMed Google Scholar). In the brainstem, pH-dependent regulation of G-protein-coupled K+ channels are known to be important for the generation and control of central respiratory activity and CO2 central chemoreception (24Pineda J. Aghajanian G.K. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 723-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Ballanyi K. Onimaru H. Homma I. Prog.

There is evidence suggesting that certain types of epilepsy are related to dysfunction of GIRK channels and the decrease in pHi (28Signorini S. Liao Y.J. Duncan S.A. Jan L.Y. Stoffel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 29Xiong Z.Q. Saggau P. Stringer J.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1290-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, pHi shifts seem to be a mechanism for several local anesthetics (30Terada H. Shima O. Yoshida K. Shinohara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7837-7842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sun X. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19147-19154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are likely to be produced by changing GIRK channel activity as well (32Zhou W. Arrabit C. Choe S. Slesinger P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, the modulation of GIRK channels by intracellular protons is an important cellular mechanism in regulating membrane excitability under these physiological and pathophysiological conditions. GIRK channels belong to a subfamily of inward rectifying K+channels, several members of which have been demonstrated to be pHi-sensitive (30Terada H. Shima O. Yoshida K. Shinohara Y. J. Biol.

To test the hypothesis that the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels are sensitive to intracellular protons, we performed these experiments in a heterologous expression system. Our data showed that these channels were inhibited by intracellular pH at near physiological levels. The pHisensitivity does not seem to require G-proteins and relies on a few histidine residues in the intracellular C and N termini. Experiments were performed as we described previously (34Qu Z.

Frogs were anesthetized by bathing them in 0.3% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. A few lobes of ovaries were removed after a small abdominal incision (∼5 mm). Then, the surgical incision was closed, and the frogs were allowed to recover from the anesthesia.Xenopus oocytes were treated with 2 mg/ml of collagenase (Type IA, Sigma) in the OR2 solution: 82 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 for 60 min at room temperature. After three washes (10 min each) of the oocytes with the OR2 solution, cDNAs (25–50 ng in 50 nl of water) were injected into the oocytes. The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C in the ND-96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate with 100 mg/liter geneticin added (pH 7.4). Rat GIRK1 (Kir3.1) cDNA (GenBankTM accession number U01071) and rat GIRK4 (Kir3.4) cDNA (GenBankTM accession number X83584) are gifts from Dr. Norman Davidson at Caltech, Pasadena, CA. These cDNAs were subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and used for Xenopus oocyte expression without cRNA synthesis. Homomeric expression of GIRK4 was attempted using cRNA that was synthesized with an in vitro transcription kit (Riboprobe, Promega Inc., Madison, WI) by the T7 promoter. PCR was used to generate GIRK1/GIRK4 dimer. Two PCR fragments encoding the entire length of GIRK1 and GIRK4 were joined with an XbaI restriction site created in the primers with the GIRK1 at the 5′ end and then cloned to the pcDNA3.1. Five extra amino acids (RCQQQ) were created between the C terminus of GIRK1 and the N terminus of GIRK4. We did not find any detectable effect of these additional residues on channel expression, current profile, and pH sensitivity. Site-specific mutations were made using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Correct constructions and mutations were confirmed with DNA sequencing. Whole-cell currents were studied on the oocytes 2–4 days after injection. The two-electrode voltage clamp test was performed using an amplifier (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) at room temperature (∼24 °C). The extracellular solution contained 90 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Experiments were performed using a perfusion chamber with a total volume of 1 ml (RC-3Z, Warner Instruments, New Haven, CT). Intracellular acidification was produced using an extracellular solution in which all KCl (90 mm) was replaced with 90 mm KHCO3. This solution was titrated to pH 7.4 immediately before experiments. Intracellular pH was measured in our previous studies, indicating that exposure of the Xenopusoocytes to this solution produces a rapid drop in intracellular pH to 6.6 (35Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Qu Z.

(Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Leak currents were constantly monitored using a series of command pulses. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship was plotted. The I-V plots were then compared between the test record and baseline control at the lowest conductance region. There was no detectable leakage in most cells. In a small number of cells (10–20%), the conductance changes were evident. In the cells, the off-line leak subtraction was performed to remove the additional linear current component using Clampfit 6.0 (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Single-channel currents were studied in an inside-out patch configuration. The bath solution contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2H2P2O7, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO3, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH = 7.4). The pipette was filled with the same solution (37Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Yang Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 921-927Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The open-state probability (P o) was calculated as we described previously (37Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Yang Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 921-927Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The number of active channels was determined at the maximal channel activity and used for all records obtained from a given patch. The single-channel conductance was measured using a slope command potential from −100 to 100 mV or an all-time histogram fitted with Gaussian distribution. To change pHi, the internal surface of patch membranes was perfused with solutions in different pH levels with no dead space. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (standard error). Analysis of variance or Student's ttest was used. Differences of pH effects before versusduring exposures were considered to be statistically significant ifp ≤ 0.05. Heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels were expressed inXenopus oocytes and studied using the two-electrode voltage clamp test. Whole-cell currents were recorded using a solution containing 90 mm K+. The currents showed strong inward rectification (Fig. 1 A) and were blockable with micromolar concentrations of Ba2+(data not shown). To study the effect of low pHi on GIRK channels, intracellular acidification was produced by perfusing the oocytes for 10 min with a solution in which all KCl was replaced with 90 mm KHCO3 (pH 7.4). This solution has been previously shown to selectively reduce the pHi to 6.6 without changing pHo (33Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P.

In comparison, currents recorded from oocytes injected with the expression vector alone or the Kir2.1 cDNA showed no significant changes (−1.9 ± 1.7%, n = 4, and 2.8 ± 1.1%, n = 4), indicating that the GIRK1/GIRK4 channels but not Xenopus oocyte-endogenous currents are inhibited. This inhibition occurred at 3 min and reached plateau in 6–7 min (Fig.1, A and B). Washout led to complete recovery in most cells studied. The current inhibition did not show voltage dependence (Fig. 1, C–E). Similar current inhibition was observed in a GIRK1-GIRK4 tandem-dimeric channel (32.4 ± 2.2%,n = 7). The biophysical mechanism underlying the GIRK1/GIRK4 inhibition was studied in inside-out patches. In these experiments, oocytes expressing GIRK currents were first identified in whole-cell recording. In the cell-attached patch configuration, large inward rectifying currents were seen. Channel activity rapidly declined after patch excision. In about two-thirds of the patches, these currents remained active in inside-out patches with single-channel conductance of 31.0 ± 0.3 picosiemens (n = 8). Exposure of the internal surface of patch membranes to perfusates with various pH levels produced concentration-dependent inhibitions of the P o (Fig.2 A). The inhibition was reversible and dependent on pH levels. The pH-current relationship showed a sigmoid shape with the 50% current inhibition (pK) at pH 6.95 (Fig. 2 D). Acidic pH also had modest inhibitory effect on single-channel conductance. At pH 6.2, the single-channel conductance was slightly inhibited by ∼10% (27.3 ± 0.4 picosiemens, n = 7) (Fig. 2, B andC). Thus, these results indicate that the inhibition of whole-cell GIRK currents at acidic pHo is mainly produced by the suppression of the P o. Since GIRK channels are activated by Gβγ (4Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 39Kofuji P. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1996; 380: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is possible that intracellular protons exert effects by interference of the interaction of the GIRK channels with G-proteins. To address this possibility, we took advantage of two mutants that are defective in G-protein-dependent channel gating (i.e. GIRK1/GIRK4C216T, GIRK1C179A/GIRK4C185A) (41Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both of these mutants retained almost the same sensitivity to intracellular acidification as the WT GIRK1/GIRK4 (Fig.3). These results as well as our single-channel recordings in the absence of exogenous G-proteins suggest that the inhibition appears independent of G-proteins. The G-protein independence suggests that protons may directly act on the channel protein. If this is true, there should be specific amino acid residues that are titratable, exist in intracellular protein domains, and play a critical role in the pH sensitivity of the channels. We thus performed studies on the molecular mechanism for the channel inhibition. To understand which subunit has such proton sensors, we first studied homomeric GIRK channels. Although some previous studies showed homomeric expression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 (43Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar,44Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), we found that neither the WT GIRK1 nor the WT GIRK4 expressed detectable basal currents recorded 2–4 days after cDNA injections. Similarly, we failed to express GIRK4 currents with cRNA injections. The GIRK1F137S and GIRK4S143T mutants have been shown to be expressed as homomeric channels (45Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46166-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, we found that intracellular acidification activated both the channels rather than inhibiting them (data not shown). Because these mutations per se affected the channel sensitivity to pHi, they were rejected for further studies. Since mutations of cysteine 185 in GIRK4 and cysteine 179 in GIRK1 enable expression of constitutively active heteromeric GIRK1C179A/GIRK4C185A channels (42Sadja R. Smadja K. Alagem N. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it is possible that these cysteine mutations also allow homomeric expressions. Therefore, we injected these two mutants individually and observed that the GIRK4 but not GIRK1 expressed detectable inward rectifying currents. When the homomeric GIRK4C185A was studied, the mutant channel was inhibited by intracellular acidification to almost the same degree as the WT channels (34.7 ± 3.6%, n = 5, Fig.3 A). Thereafter, we decided to perform further studies using the homomeric GIRK4C185A channel. To identify amino acid residues involved in proton sensing, we carried out systematic mutational analysis on all histidine residues in the intracellular protein domains as histidine is likely to be protonated in the pH range 7.2–6.6 with its side chain pK of 6.04. Eight histidine residues are located in the cytosolic N and C termini of GIRK4. When they were individually mutated to non-titratable glutamine, all mutants except H278Q expressed functional channels. The channel inhibition by intracellular protons was completely eliminated in the H64Q and H228Q mutants. Instead, they were activated by 47.0 ± 4.9% (n = 6) and 57.0 ± 7.3% (n = 5), respectively (Fig.4). The H352Q mutant showed a significant decrease in pH sensitivity (−9.8 ± 2.6%, n = 6; Fig. 4 C). Mutations of all other histidines did not produce any significant change in the pH sensitivity (Fig. 4 C). Since mutation of critical amino acids in either GIRK1 or GIRK4 could completely eliminate basal channel activity and agonist-induced currents of heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels (7He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8He C. Yan X. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Jin T. Huang A. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6088-6096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it is possible that mutation of histidines in either GIRK1 or GIRK4 subunit can also remove the channel inhibition by intracellular protons. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of histidine mutations in either GIRK4 or GIRK1 on the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. The GIRK4 with histidine mutations was co-injected with WT GIRK1 into oocytes, and the cells expressing functional channels were challenged with intracellular acidification. Consistent with the homomeric studies, individual mutation of His-64 or His-228 in GIRK4 completely eliminated the pHi-induced inhibition of the heteromeric channels (their currents were enhanced by 21.8 ± 4.4%, n = 5, and 27.7 ± 6.8%, n = 12, respectively). The inhibition of GIRK1/GIRK4H352Q by acidification was significantly decreased in comparison with the WT GIRK1/GIRK4 (9.6 ± 3.1%,n = 12; p < 0.05). In contrast, all the other mutants, including GIRK1/GIRK4H22Q, GIRK1/GIRK4H63Q, GIRK1/GIRK4H278Q, and GIRK1/GIRK4H 400Q, were still inhibited by intracellular acidification (Fig. 5). To elucidate whether the corresponding histidines in GIRK1 were also critical for the inhibition, we co-injected cDNAs of WT GIRK4 with GIRK1H57Q, GIRK1H222Q, or GIRK1H346Q, counterparts of His-64, His-228, and His-352 in GIRK4. They all interrupted the channel inhibition by intracellular protons (GIRK1H57Q-GIRK4: 0.0 ± 5.4%, n = 7; GIRK1H222Q-GIRK4: 85.6 ± 3.9%,n = 4; GIRK1H346Q-GIRK4: −5.9 ± 3.2%,n = 9). Furthermore, we studied heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 with multiple mutations of the histidine residues critical for the pHi sensitivity. Effects similar to single mutations were observed (Fig. 5). Joint mutations of other histidines had no additional effect (Fig. 5), further suggesting that they are not involved. Taken together, these results indicate that His-64, His-228, and His-352 in GIRK4 and His-57, His-222, and His-346 in GIRK1 are critical sites, any mutation of which is sufficient to disrupt the pHi sensitivity of the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. In the present study, we have elucidated the inhibition of GIRK1/GIRK4 channels by intracellular acidification and shown evidence for the biophysical and molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition. The inhibition of whole-cell GIRK currents is produced by strong suppression of channel open-state probability with modest inhibition of the single-channel conductance. Such an inhibition does not seem to require G-proteins and is likely to be a result of the direct interaction of protons with three histidine residues in the channel protein. GIRK channels belong to a subfamily of inward rectifying K+channels. Recent studies have shown that most of these channels are sensitive to intra- and/or extracellular acidification (33–37,46). In the present study, we have shown evidence for the pHisensitivity of the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. Using 90 mm KHCO3 to replace all KCl in the extracellular solution, we selectively reduced the pHi without changing the pHo, a technique that has been widely used in lowering the pHi of Xenopus oocytes by several groups (33Fakler B.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C1173-C1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the pHi in our previous studies and found that the pHi was reduced to 6.6 under such an experimental condition. At this pHi level, whole-cell GIRK1/GIRK4 currents are inhibited by ∼35%. We have studied the biophysical mechanism for the inhibition. We have found that acidic pHi strongly inhibits the P o with pK of 6.95, suggesting that these GIRK channels can be regulated under most physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Intracellular acidification also suppresses the single-channel conductance. The latter effect, however, is rather small (2–3% at a pHi of 7.0) in comparison with the pHi effect onP o (∼20% at a pHi of 7.0). Therefore, the inhibition of whole-cell GIRK currents seems to attribute mainly to the inhibition of P o. Intracellular acidification has been previously shown to inhibit cell-endogenous KACh channels in atrial myocardium (48Pleumsamran A. Wolak M.L. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H751-H759PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with our current observations, intracellular protons act on the P o in the cardiac K+ channels with modest inhibitory effect on single-channel conductance. The involvement of G-proteins in the pH sensitivity has been examined in the present study. Our results support the idea that the pH effect does not require G-proteins for the following reasons. First, both GIRK1/GIRK4C216T and GIRK1C179A/GIRK4C185A are equally sensitive to pHi as the WT GIRK1/GIRK4. Whereas the former is known to be less sensitive to Gβγ (41Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the latter can neither be activated by Gβγ nor inhibited by Gα (42Sadja R. Smadja K. Alagem N. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Second, in excised patches in the absence of G-proteins, we observed similar inhibition of single-channel currents. Third, a previous report has shown that G-proteins themselves are activated at a low pHi (49Ishizaka H. Gudi S.R. Frangos J.A. Kuo L. Circulation. 1999; 99: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). If the channel inhibition were mediated by G-proteins, such G-protein activation would lead to a stimulation of the GIRK channels rather than inhibition at acidic pHi, which is exactly opposite to what we found. Thus, the intracellular proton-induced inhibition of GIRK channels does not appear to be a result of the interference of the GIRK channel-G-protein interaction. Our results support the direct interaction of protons with the channel protein. By systematic scanning of all histidine residues in the channel proteins, three sites have been found to be critical,i.e. His-64, His-228, and His-352 in the GIRK4. Mutation of any of them totally abolished or greatly diminished the pHisensitivity of the homomeric GIRK4C185A and the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4. These histidines are seen in the GIRK1 channel, too,i.e. His-57, His-222, His-346 in corresponding positions. They play an equally important role as mutations of them have the same effect on the pHi sensitivity of the heteromeric channels as the mutations in GIRK4. His-228 and His-352 in GIRK4 are conserved in all GIRK channels, whereas the His-64 is absent in GIRK3. The existence of some of these histidine residues in GIRK2 and GIRK3 channels suggests that they are likely to be pHi-sensitive as well, although seemingly to a less degree. It is worth noting that the GIRK1F137S and GIRK4S143T mutants are activated by intracellular acidification instead of inhibition. The Phe-137 in GIRK1 and its corresponding site Ser-143 in GIRK4 have been shown to be critical for channel gating (50Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Wischmeyer E. Spauschus A. Thomzig A. Veh R. Karschin A.

The opposite effect on these channel gating-defective mutants to the WT channels suggests that the channel gating mechanism may be separate from proton binding in these GIRK channels. Although the pHi sensitivity does not seem to interfere with G-protein binding in these GIRK channels, protonations of certain intracellular protein domains have been shown to affect other cellular functions. Previous studies have indicated that pH differentially modulates the effects of GTP and ATP on GIRK channels (48Pleumsamran A. Wolak M.L. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H751-H759PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent studies have shown that protonation of a histidine residue in the intracellular C terminus affects the ATP sensitivity of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels through the allosteric mechanism (36Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 53Wu J. Cui N. Piao H. Wang Y. Xu H. Mao J. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 495-504Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the Kir1.1 channel, intracellular protons produce direct inhibition, and reciprocally affect the interaction of the channel protein with phospholipids and protein phosphorylation (54Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,55Leipziger J. MacGregor G.G. Cooper G.J. Xu J. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F919-F926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thereby, the possibility that protonations of histidines affect other functions of the GIRK channels cannot be excluded. Recently, we have shown that GIRK1/GIRK4 channels are activated by extracellular acidification, likely through protonation of a histidine residue in the extracellular domain (20Mao J. Li L. McManus M. Wu J. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46166-46171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Why do protons act on these channels in such an opposite manner? The pHo sensitivity appears to enhance synaptic transmission because it is known that a large quantity of protons is released from neurotransmitter-containing vesicles after vesicle fusion to presynaptic membranes (56Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). The pHi sensitivity shown in the present study may be involved in the regulation of membrane excitability within the postsynaptic cell. Inhibition of the GIRK channels results in depolarization and an increase in cellular excitability. In the brain, this may help recruit neurons and raise the arousal state of the central nervous system. In the heart, the inhibition of the GIRK channels during intracellular acidosis may affect myocardium excitability (57Bethell H.W. Vandenberg J.I. Smith G.A. Grace A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H551-H561PubMed Google Scholar, 58Boachie-Ansah G. Kane K.A. Rankin A.C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1992; 20: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is also possible that these channels detect a transmembrane pH gradient instead of the absolute pH levels. In light of the inequality of the pHi and pHo in most cells, and their relatively independent regulations by cellular versus systemic mechanisms, the detection of pH gradient across the plasma membranes may constitute an important cellular function in neurons, myocardium, and other cells. Thus, the information about the pHi and pHo sensitivities of the GIRK channels contributes to the understanding of GIRK channel functions under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

It has already been shown that E2 modulates AR function in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and xenograft CWR22 prostate cancer tissues. Using a molecular model of E2 bound-AR-ligand binding domain (LBD) and employing site-directed mutagenesis strategies, we screened several AR mutants that were mutated at E2-AR contact sites. We found a mutation at amino acid 749, AR(M749L), which confers AR hypersensitivity to E2. The reporter assays demonstrate that E2 can function, like androgen, to induce AR(M749L) transactivation. This E2-induced AR mutant transactivation is a direct effect of the AR(M749L), because the transactivation was blocked by antiandrogens. The hypersensitivity of AR(M749L) to E2 is not due to increased affinity of AR(M749L) for E2, rather it may be due to the existence of the proper conformation necessary to maintain E2 binding to the AR-LBD long enough to result in E2-induced transactivation. AR(M749L) transactivation can be further enhanced in the presence of AR coregulators, such as ARA70 and SRC-1. Therefore, amino acid 749 may represent an important site within the AR-LBD that is involved in interaction with E2 that, when mutated, allows E2 induction of AR transactivation.

Bunick D. Bahr J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 178: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Male estrogen is synthesized by aromatization of the principle androgen, testosterone, in many tissues, including brain, liver, adipose tissue, and prostate. The physiological level of circulating 17β-estradiol (E2)1 in the adult male is ∼0.1 nm (∼73–184 pm or 12–34 pg/ml) (2Tanagho E.A. McAninch J.W. Smith's General Urology. 14th Ed. Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, CT1995: 795Google Scholar), however, local aromatase activity may cause tissue levels to be higher than the serum level. Estrogens exert feedback control at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary by decreasing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone production. The necessity of estrogens for male fertility was discovered in aromatase knockout (3Robertson K.M. Simpson E.R. Lacham-Kaplan O. Jones M.E. J. Androl. 2001; 22: 825-830PubMed Google Scholar) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) knockout (4Eddy E.M. Washburn T.F. Bunch D.O. Goulding E.H. Gladen B.C. Lubahn D.B. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) mice. Both strains of mice develop infertility and exhibit defects of the reproductive system. Furthermore, estrogen imprinting on male reproductive organs causes poor semen quality, cryptorchidism, and testicular and prostatic hyperplasia in male offspring with prenatal exposure to high levels of estrogen (5Prins G.S. Birch L. Couse J.F. Choi I. Katzenellenbogen B. Korach K.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6089-6097PubMed Google Scholar). Estrogen (C18 steroid) and androgen (C19 steroid) are similar in structure, however, estrogen possesses a hydroxyl group at C3 of the phenolic A ring, whereas androgen does not (6Anstead G.M. Carlson K.E. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Steroids. 1997; 62: 268-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Although estrogen binds to the androgen receptor (AR), it has little influence on AR transactivation at the physiological concentration in males (7Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G.

Traditionally, the estrogen receptor (ER) has been considered the sole mediator of estrogen action. However, several findings show that estrogen can directly activate AR function after loss of ligand specificity due to mutations of the AR ligand binding pocket (7Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Estrogen, primarily E2, activation of AR function has been observed in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells lines containing three major AR mutations.

Therefore, E2 is not only able to bind but also activate AR(T877A) transactivation (7Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C. Trapman J.

In terms of estrogen sensitivity, the induction level of AR(H874Y) is higher compared with that of the AR(T877A), AR(T877S), and AR(R726L) in response to E2 (14Tan J. Sharief Y. Hamil K.G.

Birch L. Couse J.F. Choi I. Katzenellenbogen B. Korach K.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6089-6097PubMed Google Scholar), and this evidence suggests the possibility that estrogen may act through AR to influence prostate hyperplasia. In addition, patients who have partial androgen insensitivity syndrome show an intact androgen-AR-coregulator pathway but loss of the E2-AR-coregulator pathway (9Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C.

This also indicates that E2 may influence AR function, in the presence of coregulators, by modulating androgen action in male reproductive organ development. Here, we report the isolation of an AR mutant that confers hypersensitivity to E2. A screening system was applied to a series of site-directed AR mutants that were generated by replacing AR-LBD residues with ER-LBD residues at the predicted sites of E2 contact in the AR ligand binding pocket. The prediction of E2 contact sites was based on the molecular model of the crystal structure of the AR-LBD (17Matias P.M. Donner P. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Peixoto C. Macedo S. Otto N. Joschko S.

The estrogenic profiles of the AR mutants have been determined using AR response element (ARE)-based reporter assays in both prostate and non-prostate cell lines, and the estrogenic activity of AR(M749L) was found to be a direct effect via the mutant receptor. The estrogen induction of AR(M749L) is similar to the androgen stimulation of wtAR, and the site of the mutation is also a hot spot for mutations in AR-associated diseases, such as androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and prostate cancer. E2 (Sigma), [3H]E2 (3H-labeled (2,4,6,7)-17β-estradiol, specific activity 118 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and trypsin (Promega) were purchased. ICI 176,334 (Micronised, Adm:44008/90 C:41567, Imperial Chemical Industries, PLC Pharmaceuticals Division, Great Britain) was kindly provided by Dr. R. Harrison, and hydroxyflutamide (HF) was obtained from Schering-Plough Corp. The crystal structure of the hAR LBD bound to R1881 was used as the starting model (17Matias P.M. Donner P. Coelho R.

Mutations in the structure were introduced using the SWISS-MODEL (18Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). The resulting models were energy-minimized using the CNS suite of programs (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

The positions of AR mutations are based on the presumed E2 contact sites determined via the molecular model of AR bound with E2, considering residues within 4.5 Å of E2 (Fig. 1, A andB). The AR residues were changed to the homologous residue of ER (Fig. 1 B). The AR(M749I) prostate cancer and AR(M749V) androgen insensitivity phenotype mutations (8Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Lumbroso R. Pinsky L. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were also constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. In each case, the presence of the correct mutation was confirmed by sequencing. AR-negative DU145 human prostate cancer cells and both AR- and ER-negative COS-1 monkey kidney cells were maintained in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate with 5% CO2, at 37 °C. Transfections and luciferase assays were performed as previously described (12Thin T.H. Kim E. Yeh S. Sampson E.R. Chen Y.T. Collins L.L. Basavappa R. Chang C. J. Biol.

Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Steroid binding was performed on intact COS-1 cells as described previously (12Thin T.H. Kim E. Yeh S. Sampson E.R.

COS-1 cells were transfected with either the wtAR or the mutant (5 μg). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were treated with [3H]E2 ranging from 0.01 to 1 nmin the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled E2, for 2 h, at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2incubator. Specific binding was determined from the difference between radioactivity in the presence or absence of unlabeled E2. Scatchard plot analysis was used to determine binding affinity. Data are presented as a mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. The whole cell-binding assay was used to determine the effect of mutation on dissociation of E2 from the AR (12Thin T.H. Kim E.

COS-1 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pSG5wtAR or mutant AR. After 24 h, the transfected cells were treated with 1 nm [3H]E2 in the presence or absence of 1000-fold excess of unlabeled E2at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were harvested at various time points. The radioactivity of crude cell lysates, containing AR, was determined using a scintillation counter. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. In vitrotranscription/translation reactions were performed using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Two microliters of labeled translation mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, with 2 μl of ethanol, 10 nm DHT, or 100 nmE2. Limited trypsinization was performed by addition of 1 μl of trypsin solution (50 μg/ml) (dissolved in 50 mmTris-HCl/pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2) for various lengths of time, at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of SDS sample buffer, and samples were separated by 11% SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography was performed overnight. Pooled data are reported as the mean ± S.D., and statistical significance was determined using the Student's unpaired t test. Probabilities < 5% (p < 0.05) were considered significant. The molecular models of the AR-LBD bound to either E2 (Fig. 1) or DHT (data not shown) were constructed based on the crystal structure of the human AR-LBD bound to R1881, a synthetic androgen (17Matias P.M. Donner P. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Peixoto C. Macedo S. Otto N. Joschko S. Scholz P. Wegg A. Basler S. Schafer M. Egner U. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol.

The modeling was limited to identifying the residues that might affect ligand binding specificity and ligand specific activation. Fig. 1 A shows the fourteen residues that have been identified as being involved in E2 contact with the AR-LBD. Each residue is located within 4.5 Å of E2. Fig. 1 B lists the AR-LBD contact residues (column 1); corresponding ER-LBD residues (column 2); the ligand, either DHT or E2, that contacts each AR-LBD residue (column 3); and the AR helix containing each AR-LBD residue (column 4). Leu-704, Leu-707, Gly-708, Gln-711, Met-742, Met-745, Met-749, Arg-752, Phe-764, Met-787, Leu-873, and Thr-877 are not only the contact sites identified by the molecular model of AR-LBD bound to E2 but also the contact sites in the molecular model of the AR-LBD bound to DHT (data not shown). With the exception of residue Leu-707, the same residues have been identified as the contact sites of R1881 in the AR-LBD crystal structure (16Sack J.S. Kish K.F. Wang C. Attar R.M. Kiefer S.E. An Y. Wu G.Y. Scheffler J.E. Salvati M.E. Krystek Jr., S.R. Weinmann R. Einspahr H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4904-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 17Matias P.M. Donner P.

Conserved amino acids in the LBDs of AR and ER, Leu-704, Leu-707, Arg-752, and Phe-764 indicate the importance of these residues for the receptor-LBD pocket structure. Val-746 and Leu-873 have been identified as the primary E2 contact sites in the AR-LBD. To isolate an E2-sensitive AR mutant, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce several point mutations over 14 residues in the wtAR-LBD. The positions of mutations are based on the E2 contact sites in the E2·AR molecular model (Fig. 1 A). The AR contact site residues were replaced with the corresponding ER residues (Fig. 1 B), and the desired mutations were confirmed by sequencing. A luciferase reporter assay was used to screen the AR mutants for their transactivation under 1 or 10 nm E2 treatment using the (ARE)4-pG1-luciferase reporter construct in AR-negative DU145 prostate cancer cells. The AR(H874Y) mutant construct was used as a control for estrogen stimulation. In the reporter assays, E2-fold induction was expressed in comparison to the induction level of each AR, wt, or mutant in response to ethanol. Fig.2 A shows that, after screening all mutants, the AR(M749L) mutant showed the most significant hypersensitivity to E2. E2-dependent transcriptional activity of AR(M749L) was highly induced by 1 nm E2 and induction further increased at 10 nm E2. Interestingly, we found that E2 stimulation of the AR(H874Y) mutant in DU145 cells was far less compared with a previous report where 10 nm E2 treatment activated the mutant receptor severalfold in CV-1 cells (14Tan J. Sharief Y. Hamil K.G. Gregory C.W. Zang D.Y. Sar M. Gumerlock P.H. DeVere White R.W. Pretlow T.G. Harris S.E. Wilson E.M. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 450-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the functional ability of the AR(H874Y) mutant construct in response to DHT in our system, using DU145 cells. Fig. 2 B demonstrates that wtAR, the AR(M749L) mutant, and the AR(H874Y) mutant are induced to approximately the same level in response to DHT. This result confirms that the AR(H874Y) plasmid is functional and suggests that there are cell-specific factors that mediate differences in E2induction of AR mutant in CV-1 versus DU145 cells. Nevertheless, based on Fig. 2 (A and B), we can conclude that the AR(M749L) mutant is highly sensitive to E2 using the (ARE)4-pG1-luciferase reporter in DU145 cells. The AR(G708A), like wtAR, can be activated in response to DHT, but not to E2 (Fig. 2, A (lanes 5 and6) versus B (lane 4)). The AR(Q711E), AR(M742L), AR(M745L), AR(M787L), AR(L873G), and AR(T877L) are very weakly activated by DHT. We also tested the expression level of each mutant and found similar expression levels of the AR mutants compared with wtAR (data not shown). We next searched the AR gene mutation data base (8Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Lumbroso R. Pinsky L. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) to understand the physiological importance of the amino acid residue Met-749. Fig. 3 A shows that mutations at Met-749 have been correlated with various pathological phenotypes. Interestingly, in the case of AR(M749L), a direct connection between a pathological phenotype and this mutation has not yet been found. Fig. 3 B shows the side-chain differences among mutants. From the AR gene mutation data base (8Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Lumbroso R. Pinsky L. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), there were four reports describing two different mutations of AR at position 749. These mutants involved a change from Met (M) to either Ile (I) or Val (V). Met-749 mutated to Ile, AR(M749I), has been detected in androgen-independent prostate cancer as a somatic mutation (22Takahashi H. Furusato M. Allsbrook Jr., W.C. Nishii H. Wakui S. Barrett J.C. Boyd J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1621-1624PubMed Google Scholar). AR(M749) mutated to Val, AR(M749V), was isolated from a germ line mutation associated with AIS, either complete or partial, and found in individuals from different families (23De Bellis A. Quigley C.A. Cariello N.F. el-Awady M.K. Sar M. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 24Jakubiczka S. Werder E.A. Wieacker P. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These reports reflect the possible significance of Met-749 as a hot spot for mutations in AR-associated diseases. We generated the AR(M749I) prostate cancer mutant and the AR(M749V) AIS mutant, using site-directed mutagenesis and tested the E2-dependent transactivation of each mutant. Fig. 4 shows the luciferase activities of three AR mutants compared with the activity of the wtAR using three different ARE reporters: (ARE)4-pG1-Luciferase, (ARE)-PSA-Luciferase, and (ARE)2-MMTV-Luciferase in DU145 cells. Ethanol treatment was used as a control for the basal level of receptor activity. Fig. 4 A shows the transactivation profiles of the wtAR, AR(M749L), AR(M749I), and AR(M749V) in response to various concentrations of either DHT or E2, using the (ARE)4-pG1-Luciferase reporter in DU145 cells. Both wtAR and AR(M749L) were activated in response to DHT. This activation started at the very low concentration of 0.001 nm DHT and reached the maximum level at 10 nm DHT (lanes 2–6). However, there is undetectable or very low wtAR activity in response to E2even at the 10 nm concentration. In contrast, AR(M749L) activation was observed in response to 0.1 nmE2 (physiological concentration), and increased activity was demonstrated at 10 nm E2 (lanes 10–12). This suggests that AR(M749L) is highly sensitive to E2 for functional activation. Similar to AR(M749L), AR(M749V) showed clear activation at 10 nm DHT. However, in contrast to AR(M749L), the lower sensitivity of AR(M749V) at the physiological concentration of 1 nm DHT matches its association with the AIS phenotype. In terms of sensitivity to estrogen, AR(M749V) also demonstrated an estrogenic profile, similar to M749L, with lower intensity and shows higher sensitivity than wtAR in response to 10 nm E2 (lane 12). The AR(M749I) mutant shows very weak activation in response to 10 nm DHT (lane 6) and a negligible level of activation in response to 10 nm E2(lane 12). We also made use of two AR target gene (PSA and MMTV) promoter reporters, to confirm the responsiveness of AR(M749L), AR(M749I), and AR(M749V) to estrogen. Fig. 4 B shows not only high stimulation of AR(M749L) (lanes 4 and 5, and9 and 10) in response to E2, but also the relative stimulation of AR(M749V) by E2 (lanes 4 and 5, and 9 and 10), which are effects that can be demonstrated consistently with different reporters. The effects of DHT are less consistent among the mutants using various reporter genes. AR(M749V)-mediated induction in response to 1 nm DHT is higher using the PSA reporter construct. 10 nm DHT weakly induced AR(M749I) transactivation of both the (ARE)PSA (lane 3) and (ARE)2-MMTV (lane 8) promoters, however, E2 did not significantly induce transactivation of AR(M749I) using either of the promoters (lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10). Together, the data indicate that Met-749 of AR is a critical amino acid involved in the control of ligand specificity and that particular mutants of Met-749 intensify the responsiveness of AR to E2. Fig.5 A shows the sequence alignment and homology of the helix 5 region of the human AR (hAR), human progesterone receptor (hPR), human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR), and human ERα (hERα) (17Matias P.M. Donner P. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Peixoto C. Macedo S. Otto N. Joschko S. Scholz P. Wegg A. Basler S. Schafer M. Egner U. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol.

Most of the residues in helix 5 of the AR are either identical or conserved among the steroid receptors. The AR and ER crystal structures show that Met-749 of AR and Leu-391 of ER are not only aligned but also reside in the ligand contact sites of AR and ER, respectively. The difference between Met and Leu is that the side chain of Met contains sulfur atoms, whereas that of Leu is aliphatic. It is reasonable to expect that the selectivity could be offset by steric factors due to differences in the shape of Met and Leu, although the substitution of Leu for Met is a favorable amino acid change according to the studies of context-dependent protein stabilization (25Lipscomb L.N. Gassner N.C. Snow S.D. Eldridge A.M. Baase W.A. Drew D.L. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment indicates that all steroid receptors contain Leu at amino acid 749, except AR, which contains Met at that position. We next tested whether the broadened specificity of AR(M749L) involves only E2 or applies to other steroids as well. Fig.5 B shows reporter transactivation mediated by the wtAR, AR(M749L), AR(M749I), and AR(M749V) in the presence of 10 nm DHT, 10 nm E2, 10 nmprogesterone, or 10 nm dexamethasone. The wtAR is activated by 10 nm DHT (lane 2) but not by other steroids (lanes 3–5), compared with no activation upon ethanol treatment (lane 1). AR(M749L) is significantly activated by 10 nm DHT (lane 7) and 10 nmE2 (lane 8), is moderately induced by 10 nm progesterone (lane 9), but shows no induction with 10 nm dexamethasone (lane 10), compared with no activation upon ethanol treatment (lane 6). 10 nm E2 stimulates AR(M749L) activity (lane 8) to a higher level compared with 10 nm DHT treatment (lane 7), in COS-1 cells. The reporter induction mediated by progesterone (lane 9) is one-third of the induction mediated by E2 (lane 8). Induction of reporter activity stimulated by progesterone is not surprising, because hPR and hAR share the greatest structural homology among the classic steroid receptors. 10 nm dexamethasone did not stimulate AR(M749L) transactivation (lane 10) indicating that the position of the AR mutation, M749L, is particularly important for E2 stimulation. AR(M749V) is clearly activated by 10 nm DHT (lane 17) and weakly activated by 10 nm E2 (lane 18), compared with ethanol treatment (lane 16), similar to the induction of AR(M749V) activity by 10 nm DHT and 10 nmE2 in DU145 cells (Fig. 4). Neither 10 nmprogesterone nor 10 nm dexamethasone stimulated AR(M749V) transactivation (lanes 19 and 20), and AR(M749I) shows negligible activation in response to 10 nmprogesterone or dexamethasone (lanes 14 and15). We next tested whether the transactivation of AR mutants induced by E2 occurs via the AR. The AR- and ER-negative COS-1 cells were used for tran"
https://openalex.org/W2001397821,"Xanthine nucleotide-selective small GTP-binding proteins with an Asp/Asn mutation are valuable for the analysis of individual GTP-binding proteins in complex systems. Similar applications can be devised for heterotrimeric G-proteins. However, Asp/Asn mutants of Gαo, Gα11, and Gα16 were inactive. An additional Gln/Leu mutation in the catalytic site, reducing GTPase activity and increasing GDP affinity, was required to generate xanthine nucleotide-selective unspecified G-protein α-subunit (Gα). Our study aim was to generate xanthine nucleotide-selective mutants of Gαs, the stimulatory G-protein of adenylyl cyclase. The short splice variant of Gαs (GαsS) possesses higher GDP affinity than the long splice variant (GαsL). Nucleoside 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphates (NTPγSs) and nucleoside 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphates effectively activated a GαsS mutant with a D280N exchange (GαsS-N280), whereas nucleotides activated a GαsL mutant with a D295N exchange (GαsL-N295) only weakly. The Gln/Leu mutation enhanced GαsL-N295 activity. NTPγSs activated GαsS-N280 and a GαsL mutant with a Q227L and D295N exchange (GαsL-L227/N295) with similar potencies, whereas xanthosine 5′-triphosphate and xanthosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate were more potent than GTP and guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate, respectively. GαsS-N280 interacted with the β2-adrenoreceptor and exhibited high-affinity XTPase activity. Collectively, (i) GαsS-N280 is the first functional xanthine nucleotide-selective Gα with the Asp/Asn mutation alone; (ii) sufficiently high GDP affinity is crucial for Gα Asp/Asn mutant function; (iii) with nucleoside 5′-triphosphates and nucleoside 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphates, Gαs-N280 and GαsL-L227/N295 exhibit xanthine nucleotide selectivity, whereas NTPγSs sterically perturb the catalytic site of Gα and annihilate xanthine selectivity. Xanthine nucleotide-selective small GTP-binding proteins with an Asp/Asn mutation are valuable for the analysis of individual GTP-binding proteins in complex systems. Similar applications can be devised for heterotrimeric G-proteins. However, Asp/Asn mutants of Gαo, Gα11, and Gα16 were inactive. An additional Gln/Leu mutation in the catalytic site, reducing GTPase activity and increasing GDP affinity, was required to generate xanthine nucleotide-selective unspecified G-protein α-subunit (Gα). Our study aim was to generate xanthine nucleotide-selective mutants of Gαs, the stimulatory G-protein of adenylyl cyclase. The short splice variant of Gαs (GαsS) possesses higher GDP affinity than the long splice variant (GαsL). Nucleoside 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphates (NTPγSs) and nucleoside 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphates effectively activated a GαsS mutant with a D280N exchange (GαsS-N280), whereas nucleotides activated a GαsL mutant with a D295N exchange (GαsL-N295) only weakly. The Gln/Leu mutation enhanced GαsL-N295 activity. NTPγSs activated GαsS-N280 and a GαsL mutant with a Q227L and D295N exchange (GαsL-L227/N295) with similar potencies, whereas xanthosine 5′-triphosphate and xanthosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate were more potent than GTP and guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate, respectively.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar, 2Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 163-224Google Scholar, 3Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Google Scholar). Activated receptor promotes GDP dissociation from Gα.1 GDP dissociation is the rate-limiting step of the G-protein cycle. Subsequently, receptor catalyzes GTP binding to Gα. GTP binding to Gα induces the active conformation of the G-protein, leading to the dissociation of the heterotrimer into Gα-GTP and the βγ-complex. Both Gα-GTP and βγ regulate the activity of effector systems. Gα possesses GTPase activity. The GTPase hydrolyzes GTP into GDP and Pi and thereby deactivates the G-protein. Gα-GDP and βγ reassociate, completing the G-protein cycle. The GTP analogs GTPγS and GppNHp are GTPase-resistant and persistently activate G-proteins (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar, 4Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Google Scholar). The γ-thiophosphate of GTPγS is bulkier than the γ-phosphate of GppNHp/GTP (4Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Google Scholar, 5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Google Scholar). As a result of these chemical differences, GTPγS, unlike GppNHp, sterically perturbs the structure of the catalytic site of Gα (6Coleman D.E. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16669-16672Google Scholar). These crystallographic data imply that Gα-GppNHp resembles Gα-GTP more closely than Gα-GTPγS. Gα consists of the ras-like domain that is structurally similar to small GTP-binding proteins and the α-helical domain that is unique in Gα. The two domains embed the nucleotide-binding pocket (3Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Google Scholar, 7Rens-Domiano S. Hamm H.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1059-1066Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding to Gα involves several hydrogen and ionic bonds. Of particular importance for guanine selectivity is an aspartate that is conserved among small GTP-binding proteins and Gα (3Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Google Scholar, 7Rens-Domiano S. Hamm H.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1059-1066Google Scholar, 8Powers T. Walter P. Science. 1995; 269: 1422-1424Google Scholar, 9Schmidt G. Lenzen C.

Exchange of this aspartate against asparagine (Asp/Asn mutation) in small GTP-binding proteins switches base selectivity from guanine to xanthine. Such mutants are valuable to study a specific small GTP-binding protein in complex systems containing multiple GTP-binding proteins (8Powers T. Walter P. Science. 1995; 269: 1422-1424Google Scholar, 9Schmidt G. Lenzen C. Simon I. Deuter R. Cool R.H. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 87-96Google Scholar, 10Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M.

Similar applications can be devised for G-proteins. Unexpectedly, Asp/Asn mutants of Gαo, Gα11, and Gα16 were inactive (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

However, the additional exchange of a conserved glutamine against leucine (Gln/Leu mutation) in the catalytic site of Gα (3Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Google Scholar, 7Rens-Domiano S. Hamm H.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1059-1066Google Scholar) resulted in active Gα with the expected xanthine nucleotide selectivity (5Yu B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 71-76Google Scholar). The Gln/Leu mutation reduces GTPase activity and increases GDP-affinity of Gα (14Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Google Scholar, 15Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Google Scholar). Our study aim was to generate xanthine nucleotide-selective mutants of Gαs. Gαs mediates coupling of the β2AR to AC (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar, 2Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 163-224Google Scholar). Gαs exists as two splice variants, GαsS and GαsL, with GαsS possessing ∼2–3-fold higher GDP-affinity than GαsL (16Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 409-418Google Scholar). We generated GαsS-N280, GαsS-L212, GαsS-L212/N280, GαsL-N295, GαsL-L227, and GαsL-L227/N295 and analyzed these Gαsmutants with guanine-, hypoxanthine-, and xanthine-substituted NTPs, NTPγSs, and NppNHps. We used Sf9 cells as an expression system because this system is suitable for Gαs analysis, and there is no interference of nucleoside diphosphokinase-mediated trans(thio)phosphorylation reactions with the effects of NTPs/NTPγSs on Gαs (17Seifert R.

Gilman (Department of Pharmacology, University of Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Baculovirus encoding GαsL was kindly donated by Dr. H. Bourne (Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, CA). [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [32P]Pi (8500–9000 Ci/mmol), and [3H]dihydroalprenolol (85–90 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled ATP (special quality, <0.01% (w/w) GTP as assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography, # 519 979), GDP, GTP, GTPγS, GppNHp, adenosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate, and adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate were of the highest quality available and were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [γ-32P]XTP (∼6000 Ci/mmol) was synthesized as described previously (20Klinker J.F. Seifert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 341-345Google Scholar). ISO, XDP, IDP, bovine liver nucleoside diphosphokinase, and the M1 monoclonal antibody (anti-FLAG Ig) were from Sigma. IppNHp and XppNHp were obtained from JenaBioscience (Jena, Germany). ICI 118,551 was from RBI (Natick, MA).Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The anti-Gαs Ig (C-terminal) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). ITPγS and XTPγS were synthesized by nucleoside diphosphokinase-catalyzed transthiophosphorylation as described previously (21Goody R.S. Eckstein F. Schirmer R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 155-161Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, reaction mixtures contained 10 mm IDP or XDP and 5 mmadenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with 5.0 mm dithiothreitol and 5.0 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 78 IU nucleoside diphosphokinase and conducted at 37 °C for 24–48 h until the reaction equilibrium resulted in maximum NTPγS product. The product NTPγS was then purified by fast protein liquid chromatography mono Q ion-exchange chromatography using either a 30 min linear gradient from 0.1–2 m ammonium acetate, pH >8.0, or by isocratic elution in the same buffer (the gradient method allowed the recovery of starting IDP/XDP). The collected product peak was lyophilized and, if necessary, repurified using a shallow gradient. The final product was analyzed for purity by both isocratic and gradient elution from the same chromatography systems used for the purification. The pH > 8.0 ammonium acetate purification buffer produced synthetic NTPγS of >98% purity based on fast protein liquid chromatography elution. At lower pH, the product was a mixture of NTPγS and IDP/XDP at a ratio of >88:12. Purified products contained 0.75–1.2 μmol of NTPγS as assessed by UV absorption at λmax relative to IDP/XDP standard. cDNAs for Gαs mutants were generated by overlap extension PCR (22Seifert R.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Google Scholar) using pGEM-3Z-β2AR-GαsL as template. Sense and antisense primers encoding for the Q227L mutation (L227) created a diagnostic BanII site; sense and antisense primers encoding for the D295N mutation (N295) resulted in the loss of aBglII site. For generation of GαsL-L227/N295 cDNA, pGEM-β2AR-GαsL-L227 served as template, using the primers for generation of the D295N mutation. Recombinant pGEM-3Z-β2AR-GαsL plasmids were digested with EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into pVL1392-β2AR-GαsL digested withEcoRI and XbaI. To generate the corresponding GαsS cDNAs, the NheI/EcoRI fragment of pGEM-3Z-β2AR-GαsS replaced theNheI/EcoRI fragment of pGEM-3Z-β2AR-GαsL mutants. For generation of pVL1392-Gαs plasmids devoid of β2AR cDNA, pVL1392-β2AR-Gαs plasmids were digested with SacI and PflMI to eliminate β2AR cDNA. The noncoherent DNA ends were filled with Klenow fragment, and the pVL1392-Gαs plasmids were religated. Extensive restriction enzyme diagnostics and enzymatic sequencing confirmed all mutations. Sf9 cells were cultured in 250-ml disposable Erlenmeyer flasks at 28 °C under shaking at 125 rpm in SF 900 II medium (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated in Sf9 cells using the BaculoGOLD transfection kit (Pharmingen) as described previously (23Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Google Scholar). For protein expression, Sf9 cells were infected with 1:100 dilutions of high titer baculovirus stocks and cultured for 48 h (17Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Google Scholar). Sf9 membranes were prepared as described previously (17Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Google Scholar). Membranes were suspended in binding buffer (12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 75 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) at a concentration of ∼1–2 mg protein/ml and stored at −80 °C until use. Expression levels of β2AR-Gαs fusion proteins were determined by [3H]dihydroalprenolol saturation binding (17Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Google Scholar). Immediately before AC and NTPase experiments, membrane aliquots were thawed and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and 15,000 × g to remove, as far as possible, endogenous nucleotides (23Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Google Scholar). The determination of AC activity in Sf9 membranes was performed as described previously (23Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Google Scholar). Briefly, tubes (30 μl) contained membranes (20–40 μg protein/tube), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and nucleotides at various concentrations. Some experiments were conducted in the presence of ISO or ICI 118,551. Tubes were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C before the addition of 20 μl of reaction mixture containing (final) [α-32P]ATP (0.5–1.5 μCi/tube) plus 40 μm ATP, 2.7 mm mono(cyclohexyl)ammonium phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.125 IU pyruvate kinase, 1.0 IU myokinase, and 0.1 mm cAMP. Reactions were conducted for 20 min. Stopping of reactions and separation of [α-32P]ATP from [32P]cAMP were performed as described previously (23Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Google Scholar). In some experiments, the incubation temperature was varied from 16–37 °C. High-affinity GTPase activity in Sf9 membranes expressing β2AR-Gαs fusion proteins was determined as described previously (23Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Google Scholar). Briefly, tubes (80 μl) contained membranes (10 μg protein/tube), 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm adenosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 40 μg creatine kinase, 30 nm to 10 μmunlabeled GTP, 10 μm ISO, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 3 min at 25 °C before the addition of 20 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (2.0 μCi/tube). Nonenzymatic [γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis was determined in the presence of a large excess of unlabeled GTP (1 mm) and amounted to <1% of total [γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis. Reactions were conducted for 20 min. Stopping of reactions and recovery of [32P]Pi were performed as described previously (23Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Google Scholar). XTPase activity was determined as GTPase activity, except that XTP and [γ-32P]XTP were used. Membrane proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 10% (w/v) acrylamide. Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were reacted with anti-Gαs Ig or anti-FLAG Ig (1:1000 each). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by donkey anti-rabbit IgG (anti-Gαs Ig) or sheep anti-mouse IgG (anti-FLAG Ig) coupled to peroxidase at 1:1000 dilutions, usingo-dianisidine and H2O2 as substrates. Immunoblots were scanned using a Molecular Imager FX and evaluated with the Quantity One 4.3 software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), using β2AR-Gαs fusion proteins (25–75 μg/lane) expressed at defined levels ([3H]dihydroalprenolol saturation binding) as standard. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Data shown in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Prism 3.02 software (GraphPad, Prism, San Diego, CA).Figure 3Effects of NTPs, NTP γSs, and NppNHps on AC activity in Sf9 membranes expressing GαsS proteins. AC activity in Sf9 membranes was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reaction mixtures contained Sf9 membranes (20–40 μg protein/tube) expressing GαsS (A,E, and I), GαsS-N280 (B,F, and J), GαsS-L212/N280 (C, G, and K), or GαsS-L212 (D, H, and L) in the presence of NTPs (A–D), NTPγSs (E–H), or NppNHps (I–L) at the concentrations indicated on theabscissa. Log −10 designates the absence of added guanine, hypoxanthine, or xanthine nucleotide. Note that because of the high AC activities with membranes expressing GαsS-L212, the scale of the y axis in D, H, andL is different than from in the other panels. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and best fitted to sigmoid concentration-response curves. Data shown are the means ± S.D. of four to six experiments performed in duplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2Effects of NTPs, NTP γSs, and NppNHps on AC activity in Sf9 membranes expressing GαsL proteins. AC activity in Sf9 membranes was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reaction mixtures contained Sf9 membranes (20–40 μg protein/tube) expressing GαsL (A,E, and I), GαsL-N295 (B,F, and J), GαsL-L227/N295 (C, G, and K), or GαsL-L227 (D, H, and L) in the presence of NTPs (A–D), NTPγSs (E–H), or NppNHps (I–L) at the concentrations indicated on theabscissa.

Zhang H.J. Olson L.K. Schroeder W.A. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21106-21111Google Scholar, 25Jones D.T. Masters S.B. Bourne H.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol.

The same was true for GαsS and GαsL expressed in Sf9 membranes (Fig.1 A). In agreement with a recent report (27Kühn B. Christel C. Wieland T. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 365: 231-241Google Scholar), GαsL expressed in Sf9 membranes also showed a ∼40-kDa proteolytic fragment. In contrast, GαsS did not exhibit major proteolytic fragments. However, in membranes expressing GαsS-L212, GαsS-N280, and GαsS-L212/N280, a prominent ∼39-kDa proteolytic fragment became apparent (Fig. 1 B). In membranes expressing the corresponding GαsL mutants, the ∼40-kDa fragment was present, and an additional ∼46-kDa proteolytic fragment emerged. These data indicate that Gαs and Gαs mutants possess different conformations,i.e. proteases access Gαs mutants more readily than Gαs. Gαs and Gαs mutants were expressed at similar levels (9–15 pmol/mg). We also expressed β2AR-Gαs fusion proteins. Fusion proteins allow for the sensitive analysis of β2AR/Gαs coupling, particularly with respect to NTP hydrolysis (17Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Google Scholar, 18Seifert R. Gether U. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 348-358Google Scholar). β2AR-GαsS and β2AR-GαsL proteins exhibited the expected molecular masses of ∼100 and 106 kDa, respectively (Fig.1 C) (22Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Lee T.W. Gether U. Sanders-Bush E. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5109-5116Google Scholar). The expression levels of β2AR-Gαs proteins ranged between 4 and 7 pmol/mg. Collectively, Gαs and Gαs mutants in the nonfused and fused state were expressed at similar levels in Sf9 membranes. For brevity, we only show the AC data with nonfused Gαs. Studies with β2AR-Gαs proteins yielded essentially the same results. GTP, ITP, and XTP were essentially devoid of stimulatory effects on AC in membranes expressing GαsL, GαsL-N295, and GαsL-L227 (Fig. 2,A, B, and D). A striking difference among those three constructs was the extremely high basal AC activity in the absence of GTP, ITP, or XTP in membranes expressing GαsL-L227. This finding could be explained by the GTPase deficiency brought about by the Gln/Leu mutation (14Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Google Scholar, 15Masters S.B.

However, the Gln/Leu mutation also increases the GDP affinity of GαsL(14Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Google Scholar, 15Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Google Scholar), and Gαs-GDP activates AC as efficiently as Gαs-GTPγS, provided that the concentration of Gαs-GDP is sufficiently high (28Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Google Scholar). As will be shown at the end of “Results,” the β2AR agonist ISO efficiently reduces AC activity in the absence of GTP in membranes co-expressing the β2AR plus GαsL-L227/N295 through GDP dissociation and generation of nucleotide-free Gαs. Nucleotide-free Gαs is less efficient at activating AC than Gαs-GDP (22Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Lee T.W. Gether U. Sanders-Bush E. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5109-5116Google Scholar, 23Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Google Scholar). These data indicate that the increase in GDP affinity induced by the Gln/Leu mutation critically contributes to the high basal AC activity in membranes expressing such mutants. GαsL-N295 and GαsL-L227/N295 were expected to possess decreased GDP affinity (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Google Scholar, 12Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Google Scholar, 13Yu B. Gu L. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 71-76Google Scholar) and basal AC activity relative to GαsL and GαsL-L227, respectively. The experimental data were in agreement with these assumptions (Fig. 2, A–D). In contrast to membranes expressing GαsL and GαsL-N295, NTPs significantly increased AC activity in membranes expressing GαsL-L227/N295, compatible with a reduction of NTPase activity of GαsL-L227/N295 (14Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15475-15482Google Scholar, 15Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Google Scholar). In fact, ISO had virtually no stimulatory effect on GTP and XTP hydrolysis in membranes expressing β2AR-GαsL-L227/N295 (data not shown). In agreement with data for the rab5-N136 mutant (29Hoffenberg S. Nikolova L. Pan J.Y. Daniel D.S. Wessling-Resnick M. Knoll B.J. Dickey B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 241-249Google Scholar), the order of potency of NTPs at GαsL-L227/N295 was XTP > GTP > ITP. In membranes expressing GαsL, NTPγSs stimulated AC activity in the expected order of potency, GTPγS > ITPγS > XTPγS (Fig. 2 E) (18Seifert R. Gether U. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 348-358Google Scholar, 29Hoffenberg S. Nikolova L. Pan J.Y. Daniel D.S. Wessling-Resnick M. Knoll B.J. Dickey B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 241-249Google Scholar). In membranes expressing GαsL-N295, the order of potency was XTPγS > ITPγS > GTPγS, but the maximum AC activities in those membranes amounted to only ∼20% of the AC activities in membranes expressing GαsL. These data indicate that GαsL-N295, despite its efficient expression in Sf9 membranes (Fig. 1 B), exhibited only low functional activity. Routinely, we conducted AC assays at 37 °C. Intriguingly, the GαsL-A366S mutant, which, like GαsL-N295, possesses lower GDP affinity than GαsL, denatures at 37 °C and requires temperatures of <33 °C to be active (30Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. van Dop C. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Google Scholar). Therefore, we varied the incubation temperature in the AC assay from 16 °C to 37 °C, but these maneuvers did not increase AC activation by GαsL-N295 (data not shown). These data indicate that GαsL-N295 was largely expressed as a functionally inactive protein, although the incubation temperature of Sf9 cells was rather low (28 °C). The poor activity of GαsL-N295 is reminiscent of the properties of the analogous Asp/Asn mutants of Gαo, Gα11, and Gα16 (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Google Scholar, 12Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Google Scholar, 13Yu B. Gu L. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 71-76Google Scholar). In Gαo, Gα11, and Gα16 Asp/Asn mutants, the additional Gln/Leu mutation resulted in XTPγS-selective Gα mutants (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Google Scholar, 12Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Google Scholar, 13Yu B. Gu L. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 71-76Google Scholar). However, the switch in base selectivity in GαsL-L227/N295 was incomplete, i.e. GTPγS, ITPγS, and XTPγS were similarly potent (Fig. 2 G). In membranes expressing GαsL-L227, NTPγSs were similarly potent at moderately reducing AC activity (Fig.2 H). In agreement with the NTPγS data, the order of potency of NppNHps at activating AC in membranes expressing GαsL was GppNHp > IppNHp > XppNHp, but the potencies of NppNHps were lower than the potencies of the corresponding NTPγSs (Fig. 2,E and I). In membranes expressing GαsL-N295, NppNHps stimulated AC in the order of potency XppNHp > GppNHp > IppNHp, but again, maximum AC activities were very low (Fig. 2 J). XppNHp increased AC activity in membranes expressing GαsL-L227/N295 with ∼10-fold higher potency than GppNHp (Fig. 2 K). These data fit to the data obtained with XTP/GTP (∼20-fold potency difference) (Fig. 2 C). IppNHp was virtually inactive in membranes expressing GαsL-L227/N295 (Fig. 2 K). In contrast to NTPγSs, NppNHps had only minimal inhibitory effects on AC activity in membranes expressing GαsL-L227 (Fig. 2,H and L). There were no notable differences in the effects of NTPs, NTPγSs, and NppNHps at GαsS and GαsS-L212 relative to the corresponding GαsL constructs, except that AC inhibition by NTPγSs in membranes expressing GαsS-L212 was only marginal (Figs. 2 H and3 H). Compared with membranes expressing GαsS, basal AC activity in membranes expressing GαsS-N280 was lower, indicative for the reduction in GDP affinity of the GαsS mutant (Fig. 3,E and F). In contrast to the observations made for the GαsL/GαsL-N295 couple (Fig. 2,E, F, I, and J), GαsS-"
