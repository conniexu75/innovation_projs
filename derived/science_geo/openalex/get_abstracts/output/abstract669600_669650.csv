https://openalex.org/W3134208712,"A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, VOC 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7), emerged in southeast England in September 2020 and is rapidly spreading toward fixation. Using a variety of statistical and dynamic modeling approaches, we estimate that this variant has a 43 to 90% (range of 95% credible intervals, 38 to 130%) higher reproduction number than preexisting variants. A fitted two-strain dynamic transmission model shows that VOC 202012/01 will lead to large resurgences of COVID-19 cases. Without stringent control measures, including limited closure of educational institutions and a greatly accelerated vaccine rollout, COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths across England in the first 6 months of 2021 were projected to exceed those in 2020. VOC 202012/01 has spread globally and exhibits a similar transmission increase (59 to 74%) in Denmark, Switzerland, and the United States."

https://openalex.org/W3134158070,"Lead halide perovskites are promising semiconductors for light-emitting applications because they exhibit bright, bandgap-tunable luminescence with high colour purity1,2. Photoluminescence quantum yields close to unity have been achieved for perovskite nanocrystals across a broad range of emission colours, and light-emitting diodes with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 20 per cent—approaching those of commercial organic light-emitting diodes—have been demonstrated in both the infrared and the green emission channels1,3,4. However, owing to the formation of lower-bandgap iodide-rich domains, efficient and colour-stable red electroluminescence from mixed-halide perovskites has not yet been realized5,6. Here we report the treatment of mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals with multidentate ligands to suppress halide segregation under electroluminescent operation. We demonstrate colour-stable, red emission centred at 620 nanometres, with an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 20.3 per cent. We show that a key function of the ligand treatment is to ‘clean’ the nanocrystal surface through the removal of lead atoms. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the binding between the ligands and the nanocrystal surface suppresses the formation of iodine Frenkel defects, which in turn inhibits halide segregation. Our work exemplifies how the functionality of metal halide perovskites is extremely sensitive to the nature of the (nano)crystalline surface and presents a route through which to control the formation and migration of surface defects. This is critical to achieve bandgap stability for light emission and could also have a broader impact on other optoelectronic applications—such as photovoltaics—for which bandgap stability is required. The binding of multidentate ligands to the surface of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals suppresses the formation of surface defects that result in halide segregation, yielding materials with efficient and colour-stable red emission."
https://openalex.org/W3134798533,"Growing interest in quantum computing for practical applications has led to a surge in the availability of programmable machines for executing quantum algorithms. Present day photonic quantum computers have been limited either to non-deterministic operation, low photon numbers and rates, or fixed random gate sequences. Here we introduce a full-stack hardware-software system for executing many-photon quantum circuits using integrated nanophotonics: a programmable chip, operating at room temperature and interfaced with a fully automated control system. It enables remote users to execute quantum algorithms requiring up to eight modes of strongly squeezed vacuum initialized as two-mode squeezed states in single temporal modes, a fully general and programmable four-mode interferometer, and genuine photon number-resolving readout on all outputs. Multi-photon detection events with photon numbers and rates exceeding any previous quantum optical demonstration on a programmable device are made possible by strong squeezing and high sampling rates. We verify the non-classicality of the device output, and use the platform to carry out proof-of-principle demonstrations of three quantum algorithms: Gaussian boson sampling, molecular vibronic spectra, and graph similarity."

https://openalex.org/W3133905451,"Axon degeneration is a central pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor motif-containing 1 (SARM1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-cleaving enzyme whose activation triggers axon destruction. Loss of the biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT2, which converts nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) to NAD+, activates SARM1 via an unknown mechanism. Using structural, biochemical, biophysical, and cellular assays, we demonstrate that SARM1 is activated by an increase in the ratio of NMN to NAD+ and show that both metabolites compete for binding to the auto-inhibitory N-terminal armadillo repeat (ARM) domain of SARM1. We report structures of the SARM1 ARM domain bound to NMN and of the homo-octameric SARM1 complex in the absence of ligands. We show that NMN influences the structure of SARM1 and demonstrate via mutagenesis that NMN binding is required for injury-induced SARM1 activation and axon destruction. Hence, SARM1 is a metabolic sensor responding to an increased NMN/NAD+ ratio by cleaving residual NAD+, thereby inducing feedforward metabolic catastrophe and axonal demise."

https://openalex.org/W3163549629,"Controlling matter-light interactions with cavities is of fundamental importance in modern science and technology. It is exemplified in the strong-coupling regime, where matter-light hybrid modes form, with properties controllable via the photon component on the optical-wavelength scale. In contrast, matter excitations on the nanometer scale are harder to access. In two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures, a tunable moir\'e lattice potential for electronic excitations may form, enabling correlated electron gases in lattice potentials. Excitons confined in moir\'e lattices have also been reported, but cooperative effects have been elusive and interactions with light have remained perturbative. Here, integrating MoSe$_{2}$-WS$_{2}$ heterobilayers in a microcavity, we establish cooperative coupling between moir\'e-lattice excitons and microcavity photons up to liquid-nitrogen temperature, thereby integrating into one platform versatile control over both matter and light. The density dependence of the moir\'e polaritons reveals strong nonlinearity due to exciton blockade, suppressed exciton energy shift, and suppressed excitation-induced dephasing, all of which are consistent with the quantum-confined nature of the moir\'e excitons. Such a moir\'e polariton system combines strong nonlinearity and microscopic-scale tuning of matter excitations with the power of cavity engineering and long range coherence of light, providing a new platform for collective phenomena from tunable arrays of quantum emitters."
https://openalex.org/W3133800993,"Symmetric cell division requires the even partitioning of genetic information and cytoplasmic contents between daughter cells. Whereas the mechanisms coordinating the segregation of the genome are well known, the processes that ensure organelle segregation between daughter cells remain less well understood1. Here we identify multiple actin assemblies with distinct but complementary roles in mitochondrial organization and inheritance in mitosis. First, we find a dense meshwork of subcortical actin cables assembled throughout the mitotic cytoplasm. This network scaffolds the endoplasmic reticulum and organizes three-dimensional mitochondrial positioning to ensure the equal segregation of mitochondrial mass at cytokinesis. Second, we identify a dynamic wave of actin filaments reversibly assembling on the surface of mitochondria during mitosis. Mitochondria sampled by this wave are enveloped within actin clouds that can spontaneously break symmetry to form elongated comet tails. Mitochondrial comet tails promote randomly directed bursts of movement that shuffle mitochondrial position within the mother cell to randomize inheritance of healthy and damaged mitochondria between daughter cells. Thus, parallel mechanisms mediated by the actin cytoskeleton ensure both equal and random inheritance of mitochondria in symmetrically dividing cells. During mitosis, complementary actin-based mechanisms ensure equal and random distributions of mitochondria among daughter cells following symmetrical cell division."

https://openalex.org/W3134409008,"The microvasculature underlies the supply networks that support neuronal activity within heterogeneous brain regions. What are common versus heterogeneous aspects of the connectivity, density, and orientation of capillary networks? To address this, we imaged, reconstructed, and analyzed the microvasculature connectome in whole adult mice brains with sub-micrometer resolution. Graph analysis revealed common network topology across the brain that leads to a shared structural robustness against the rarefaction of vessels. Geometrical analysis, based on anatomically accurate reconstructions, uncovered a scaling law that links length density, i.e., the length of vessel per volume, with tissue-to-vessel distances. We then derive a formula that connects regional differences in metabolism to differences in length density and, further, predicts a common value of maximum tissue oxygen tension across the brain. Last, the orientation of capillaries is weakly anisotropic with the exception of a few strongly anisotropic regions; this variation can impact the interpretation of fMRI data."
https://openalex.org/W3135029012,"Mitochondria are specialized eukaryotic organelles that have a dedicated function in oxygen respiration and energy production. They evolved about 2 billion years ago from a free-living bacterial ancestor (probably an alphaproteobacterium), in a process known as endosymbiosis1,2. Many unicellular eukaryotes have since adapted to life in anoxic habitats and their mitochondria have undergone further reductive evolution3. As a result, obligate anaerobic eukaryotes with mitochondrial remnants derive their energy mostly from fermentation4. Here we describe 'Candidatus Azoamicus ciliaticola', which is an obligate endosymbiont of an anaerobic ciliate and has a dedicated role in respiration and providing energy for its eukaryotic host. 'Candidatus A. ciliaticola' contains a highly reduced 0.29-Mb genome that encodes core genes for central information processing, the electron transport chain, a truncated tricarboxylic acid cycle, ATP generation and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. The genome encodes a respiratory denitrification pathway instead of aerobic terminal oxidases, which enables its host to breathe nitrate instead of oxygen. 'Candidatus A. ciliaticola' and its ciliate host represent an example of a symbiosis that is based on the transfer of energy in the form of ATP, rather than nutrition. This discovery raises the possibility that eukaryotes with mitochondrial remnants may secondarily acquire energy-providing endosymbionts to complement or replace functions of their mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W3134805716,"Internal state controls olfaction through poorly understood mechanisms. Odours that represent food, mates, competitors and predators activate parallel neural circuits that may be flexibly shaped by physiological need to alter behavioural outcome1. Here we identify a neuronal mechanism by which hunger selectively promotes attraction to food odours over other olfactory cues. Optogenetic activation of hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AGRP) neurons enhances attraction to food odours but not to pheromones, and branch-specific activation and inhibition reveal a key role for projections to the paraventricular thalamus. Mice that lack neuropeptide Y (NPY) or NPY receptor type 5 (NPY5R) fail to prefer food odours over pheromones after fasting, and hunger-dependent food-odour attraction is restored by cell-specific NPY rescue in AGRP neurons. Furthermore, acute NPY injection immediately rescues food-odour preference without additional training, indicating that NPY is required for reading olfactory circuits during behavioural expression rather than writing olfactory circuits during odour learning. Together, these findings show that food-odour-responsive neurons comprise an olfactory subcircuit that listens to hunger state through thalamic NPY release, and more generally, provide mechanistic insights into how internal state regulates behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3134644881,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted lifestyle behaviour as public health initiatives aim to “flatten the curve”. This study examined changes in activity patterns (physical activity, sedentary time, sleep), recreational physical activities, diet, weight and wellbeing from before to during COVID-19 restrictions in Adelaide, Australia. This study used data from a prospective cohort of Australian adults (parents of primary school-aged children; n = 61, 66% female, aged 41±6 years). Participants wore a Fitbit Charge 3 activity monitor and weighed themselves daily using Wi-Fi scales. Activity and weight data were extracted for 14 days before (February 2020) and 14 days during (April 2020) COVID-19 restrictions. Participants reported their recreational physical activity, diet and wellbeing during these periods. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine change over time. Participants slept 27 minutes longer (95% CI 9–51), got up 38 minutes later (95% CI 25–50), and did 50 fewer minutes (95% CI -69–-29) of light physical activity during COVID-19 restrictions. Additionally, participants engaged in more cycling but less swimming, team sports and boating or sailing. Participants consumed a lower percentage of energy from protein (-0.8, 95% CI -1.5–-0.1) and a greater percentage of energy from alcohol (0.9, 95% CI 0.2–1.7). There were no changes in weight or wellbeing. Overall, the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on lifestyle were small; however, their impact on health and wellbeing may accumulate over time. Further research examining the effects of ongoing social distancing restrictions are needed as the pandemic continues."
https://openalex.org/W3135371821,"Millions of migratory birds occupy seasonally favourable breeding grounds in the Arctic1, but we know little about the formation, maintenance and future of the migration routes of Arctic birds and the genetic determinants of migratory distance. Here we established a continental-scale migration system that used satellite tracking to follow 56 peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) from 6 populations that breed in the Eurasian Arctic, and resequenced 35 genomes from 4 of these populations. The breeding populations used five migration routes across Eurasia, which were probably formed by longitudinal and latitudinal shifts in their breeding grounds during the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene epoch. Contemporary environmental divergence between the routes appears to maintain their distinctiveness. We found that the gene ADCY8 is associated with population-level differences in migratory distance. We investigated the regulatory mechanism of this gene, and found that long-term memory was the most likely selective agent for divergence in ADCY8 among the peregrine populations. Global warming is predicted to influence migration strategies and diminish the breeding ranges of peregrine populations of the Eurasian Arctic. Harnessing ecological interactions and evolutionary processes to study climate-driven changes in migration can facilitate the conservation of migratory birds. The routes and lengths of migrations of Eurasian Arctic peregrine falcons have probably been shaped by climate change across the Last Glacial Maximum–Holocene transition and by selection for long-term memory acting on ADCY8, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W3135180116,"Understanding diet is critical for conservation of endangered predators. Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW) ( Orcinus orca ) are an endangered population occurring primarily along the outer coast and inland waters of Washington and British Columbia. Insufficient prey has been identified as a factor limiting their recovery, so a clear understanding of their seasonal diet is a high conservation priority. Previous studies have shown that their summer diet in inland waters consists primarily of Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ), despite that species’ rarity compared to some other salmonids. During other times of the year, when occurrence patterns include other portions of their range, their diet remains largely unknown. To address this data gap, we collected feces and prey remains from October to May 2004–2017 in both the Salish Sea and outer coast waters. Using visual and genetic species identification for prey remains and genetic approaches for fecal samples, we characterized the diet of the SRKWs in fall, winter, and spring. Chinook salmon were identified as an important prey item year-round, averaging ~50% of their diet in the fall, increasing to 70–80% in the mid-winter/early spring, and increasing to nearly 100% in the spring. Other salmon species and non-salmonid fishes, also made substantial dietary contributions. The relatively high species diversity in winter suggested a possible lack of Chinook salmon, probably due to seasonally lower densities, based on SRKW’s proclivity to selectively consume this species in other seasons. A wide diversity of Chinook salmon stocks were consumed, many of which are also at risk. Although outer coast Chinook samples included 14 stocks, four rivers systems accounted for over 90% of samples, predominantly the Columbia River. Increasing the abundance of Chinook salmon stocks that inhabit the whales’ winter range may be an effective conservation strategy for this population."

https://openalex.org/W3133632896,"The lipid chemoattractant sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) guides cells out of tissues, where the concentration of S1P is relatively low, into circulatory fluids, where the concentration of S1P is high1. For example, S1P directs the exit of T cells from lymph nodes, where T cells are initially activated, into lymph, from which T cells reach the blood and ultimately inflamed tissues1. T cells follow S1P gradients primarily using S1P receptor 1 (ref. 1). Recent studies have described how S1P gradients are established at steady state, but little is known about the distribution of S1P in disease or about how changing levels of S1P may affect immune responses. Here we show that the concentration of S1P increases in lymph nodes during an immune response. We found that haematopoietic cells, including inflammatory monocytes, were an important source of this S1P, which was an unexpected finding as endothelial cells provide S1P to lymph1. Inflammatory monocytes required the early activation marker CD69 to supply this S1P, in part because the expression of CD69 was associated with reduced levels of S1pr5 (which encodes S1P receptor 5). CD69 acted as a 'stand-your-ground' signal, keeping immune cells at a site of inflammation by regulating both the receptors and the gradients of S1P. Finally, increased levels of S1P prolonged the residence time of T cells in the lymph nodes and exacerbated the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. This finding suggests that residence time in the lymph nodes might regulate the differentiation of T cells, and points to new uses of drugs that target S1P signalling."
https://openalex.org/W3135196038,"The mechanical properties of olivine-rich rocks are key to determining the mechanical coupling between Earth’s lithosphere and asthenosphere. In crystalline materials, the motion of crystal defects is fundamental to plastic flow1–4. However, because the main constituent of olivine-rich rocks does not have enough slip systems, additional deformation mechanisms are needed to satisfy strain conditions. Experimental studies have suggested a non-Newtonian, grain-size-sensitive mechanism in olivine involving grain-boundary sliding5,6. However, very few microstructural investigations have been conducted on grain-boundary sliding, and there is no consensus on whether a single or multiple physical mechanisms are at play. Most importantly, there are no theoretical frameworks for incorporating the mechanics of grain boundaries in polycrystalline plasticity models. Here we identify a mechanism for deformation at grain boundaries in olivine-rich rocks. We show that, in forsterite, amorphization takes place at grain boundaries under stress and that the onset of ductility of olivine-rich rocks is due to the activation of grain-boundary mobility in these amorphous layers. This mechanism could trigger plastic processes in the deep Earth, where high-stress conditions are encountered (for example, at the brittle–plastic transition). Our proposed mechanism is especially relevant at the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary, where olivine reaches the glass transition temperature, triggering a decrease in its viscosity and thus promoting grain-boundary sliding. Amorphization at grain boundaries in olivine-rich rocks under stress and consequent grain-boundary sliding could explain the decrease in viscosity between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere."

Here, we investigate the impact of different scenarios of releasing strong measures implemented around the U.S. on COVID-19 hospitalized cases and the risk of overwhelming the hospitals while considering resources at the county level. We show that multiple waves might cause an unprecedented impact on the hospitals if an increasing number of the population becomes susceptible and/or if the various protective measures are discontinued. Furthermore, we explore the ability of different mitigation strategies in providing considerable relief to hospitals. The results can help planners, policymakers, and state officials decide on additional resources required and when to return to normalcy."
https://openalex.org/W3134837291,"Introduction Adolescents living with HIV have poor treatment outcomes, including lower rates of viral suppression, than other age groups. Emerging evidence suggests a connection between improved mental health and increased adherence. Strengthening the focus on mental health could support increased rates of viral suppression. In sub-Saharan Africa clinical services for mental health care are extremely limited. Additional mechanisms are required to address the unmet mental health needs of this group. We consider the role that community-based peer supporters, a cadre operating at scale with adolescents, could play in the provision of lay-support for mental health. Methods We conducted qualitative research to explore the experiences of peer supporters involved in delivering a peer-led mental health intervention in Zimbabwe as part of a randomized control trial (Zvandiri-Friendship Bench trial). We conducted 2 focus group discussions towards the end of the trial with 20 peer supporters (aged 18–24) from across 10 intervention districts and audio recorded 200 of the peer supporters’ monthly case reviews. These data were thematically analysed to explore how peer supporters reflect on what was required of them given the problems that clients raised and what they themselves needed in delivering mental health support. Results A primary strength of the peer support model, reflected across the datasets, is that it enables adolescents to openly discuss their problems with peer supporters, confident that there is reciprocal trust and understanding derived from the similarity in their lived experiences with HIV. There are potential risks for peer supporters, including being overwhelmed by engaging with and feeling responsible for resolving relationally and structurally complex problems, which warrant considerable supervision. To support this cadre critical elements are needed: a clearly defined scope for the manageable provision of mental health support; a strong triage and referral system for complex cases; mechanisms to support the inclusion of caregivers; and sustained investment in training and ongoing supervision. Conclusion Extending peer support to explicitly include a focus on mental health has enormous potential. From this empirical study we have developed a framework of core considerations and principles (the TRUST Framework) to guide the implementation of adequate supportive infrastructure in place to enhance the opportunities and mitigate risks."

https://openalex.org/W3134526570,"Background Osteoporosis has increased and developed into a serious public health concern worldwide. Despite the high prevalence, osteoporosis is silent before major fragility fracture and the osteoporosis screening rate is low. Abdomen-pelvic CT (APCT) is one of the most widely conducted medical tests. Artificial intelligence and radiomics analysis have recently been spotlighted. This is the first study to evaluate the prediction performance of femoral osteoporosis using machine-learning analysis with radiomics features and APCT. Materials and methods 500 patients (M: F = 70:430; mean age, 66.5 ± 11.8yrs; range, 50–96 years) underwent both dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and APCT within 1 month. The volume of interest of the left proximal femur was extracted and 41 radiomics features were calculated using 3D volume of interest analysis. Top 10 importance radiomic features were selected by the intraclass correlation coefficient and random forest feature selection. Study cohort was randomly divided into 70% of the samples as the training cohort and the remaining 30% of the sample as the validation cohort. Prediction performance of machine-learning analysis was calculated using diagnostic test and comparison of area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed between training and validation cohorts. Results The osteoporosis prevalence of this study cohort was 20.8%. The prediction performance of the machine-learning analysis to diagnose osteoporosis in the training and validation cohorts were as follows; accuracy, 92.9% vs. 92.7%; sensitivity, 86.6% vs. 80.0%; specificity, 94.5% vs. 95.8%; positive predictive value, 78.4% vs. 82.8%; and negative predictive value, 96.7% vs. 95.0%. The AUC to predict osteoporosis in the training and validation cohorts were 95.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 93.7%-98.1%] and 96.0% [95% CI, 93.2%-98.8%], respectively, without significant differences (P = 0.962). Conclusion Prediction performance of femoral osteoporosis using machine-learning analysis with radiomics features and APCT showed high validity with more than 93% accuracy, specificity, and negative predictive value."
https://openalex.org/W3135803280,"The potential outcome of flavivirus and alphavirus co-infections is worrisome due to the development of severe diseases. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide live under the risk of infections caused by viruses like chikungunya virus (CHIKV, genus Alphavirus ), dengue virus (DENV, genus Flavivirus ), and zika virus (ZIKV, genus Flavivirus ). So far, neither any drug exists against the infection by a single virus, nor against co-infection. The results described in our study demonstrate the inhibitory potential of two flavonoids derived from citrus plants: Hesperetin (HST) against NS2B/NS3 pro of ZIKV and nsP2 pro of CHIKV and, Hesperidin (HSD) against nsP2 pro of CHIKV. The flavonoids are noncompetitive inhibitors and the determined IC 50 values are in low µM range for HST against ZIKV NS2B/NS3 pro (12.6 ± 1.3 µM) and against CHIKV nsP2 pro (2.5 ± 0.4 µM). The IC 50 for HSD against CHIKV nsP2 pro was 7.1 ± 1.1 µM. The calculated ligand efficiencies for HST were &gt; 0.3, which reflect its potential to be used as a lead compound. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations display the effect of HST and HSD on the protease 3D models of CHIKV and ZIKV. Conformational changes after ligand binding and their effect on the substrate-binding pocket of the proteases were investigated. Additionally, MTT assays demonstrated a very low cytotoxicity of both the molecules. Based on our results, we assume that HST comprise a chemical structure that serves as a starting point molecule to develop a potent inhibitor to combat CHIKV and ZIKV co-infections by inhibiting the virus proteases."
https://openalex.org/W3134944471,"Meiotic processes are potentially dangerous to genome stability and could be disastrous if activated in proliferative cells. Here we show that two key meiosis-defining proteins, the topoisomerase Spo11 (which forms double-strand breaks) and the meiotic cohesin Rec8, can dismantle centromeres. This dismantlement is normally observable only in mutant cells that lack the telomere bouquet, which provides a nuclear microdomain conducive to centromere reassembly1; however, overexpression of Spo11 or Rec8 leads to levels of centromere dismantlement that cannot be countered by the bouquet. Specific nucleosome remodelling factors mediate centromere dismantlement by Spo11 and Rec8. Ectopic expression of either protein in proliferating cells leads to the loss of mitotic kinetochores in both fission yeast and human cells. Hence, while centromeric chromatin has been characterized as extraordinarily stable, Spo11 and Rec8 challenge this stability and may jeopardize kinetochores in cancers that express meiotic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3135273910,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is rapidly detected in the airways by the immune system, with resident parenchymal cells and leukocytes orchestrating viral sensing and the induction of antiviral inflammatory responses. The airways are innervated by heterogeneous populations of vagal sensory neurons which also play an important role in pulmonary defense. How these neurons respond to IAV respiratory infection remains unclear. Here, we use a murine model to provide the first evidence that vagal sensory neurons undergo significant transcriptional changes following a respiratory IAV infection. RNA sequencing on vagal sensory ganglia showed that IAV infection induced the expression of many genes associated with an antiviral and pro-inflammatory response and this was accompanied by a significant increase in inflammatory cell recruitment into the vagal ganglia. Assessment of gene expression in single-vagal sensory neurons confirmed that IAV infection induced a neuronal inflammatory phenotype, which was most prominent in bronchopulmonary neurons, and also evident in some neurons innervating other organs. The altered transcriptome could be mimicked by intranasal treatment with cytokines and the lung homogenates of infected mice, in the absence of infectious virus. These data argue that IAV pulmonary infection and subsequent inflammation induces vagal sensory ganglia neuroinflammation and this may have important implications for IAV-induced morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3135231879,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are effective in MYCN-driven cancers, because of a unique need for HDAC recruitment by the MYCN oncogenic signal. However, HDAC inhibitors are much more effective in combination with other anti-cancer agents. To identify novel compounds which act synergistically with HDAC inhibitor, such as suberanoyl hydroxamic acid (SAHA), we performed a cell-based, high-throughput drug screen of 10,560 small molecule compounds from a drug-like diversity library and identified a small molecule compound (SE486-11) which synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effects of SAHA. Effects of drug combinations on cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and colony forming were assessed in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines. Treatment with SAHA and SE486-11 increased MYCN ubiquitination and degradation, and markedly inhibited tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma xenografts, and, MYCN transgenic zebrafish and mice. The combination reduced ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (USP5) levels and increased unanchored polyubiquitin chains. Overexpression of USP5 rescued neuroblastoma cells from the cytopathic effects of the combination and reduced unanchored polyubiquitin, suggesting USP5 is a therapeutic target of the combination. SAHA and SE486-11 directly bound to USP5 and the drug combination exhibited a 100-fold higher binding to USP5 than individual drugs alone in microscale thermophoresis assays. MYCN bound to the USP5 promoter and induced USP5 gene expression suggesting that USP5 and MYCN expression created a forward positive feedback loop in neuroblastoma cells. Thus, USP5 acts as an oncogenic cofactor with MYCN in neuroblastoma and the novel combination of HDAC inhibitor with SE486-11 represents a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W3135107923,"An intrinsic property of the heart is an ability to rapidly and coordinately adjust flux through metabolic pathways in response to physiologic stimuli (termed metabolic flexibility). Cardiac metabolism also fluctuates across the 24-hours day, in association with diurnal sleep-wake and fasting-feeding cycles. Although loss of metabolic flexibility has been proposed to play a causal role in the pathogenesis of cardiac disease, it is currently unknown whether day-night variations in cardiac metabolism are altered during disease states. Here, we tested the hypothesis that diet-induced obesity disrupts cardiac “diurnal metabolic flexibility”, which is normalized by time-of-day-restricted feeding. Chronic high fat feeding (20-wk)-induced obesity in mice, abolished diurnal rhythms in whole body metabolic flexibility, and increased markers of adverse cardiac remodeling (hypertrophy, fibrosis, and steatosis). RNAseq analysis revealed that 24-hours rhythms in the cardiac transcriptome were dramatically altered during obesity; only 22% of rhythmic transcripts in control hearts were unaffected by obesity. However, day-night differences in cardiac substrate oxidation were essentially identical in control and high fat fed mice. In contrast, day-night differences in both cardiac triglyceride synthesis and lipidome were abolished during obesity. Next, a subset of obese mice (induced by 18-wks ad libitum high fat feeding) were allowed access to the high fat diet only during the 12-hours dark (active) phase, for a 2-wk period. Dark phase restricted feeding partially restored whole body metabolic flexibility, as well as day-night differences in cardiac triglyceride synthesis and lipidome. Moreover, this intervention partially reversed adverse cardiac remodeling in obese mice. Collectively, these studies reveal diurnal metabolic inflexibility of the heart during obesity specifically for nonoxidative lipid metabolism (but not for substrate oxidation), and that restricting food intake to the active period partially reverses obesity-induced cardiac lipid metabolism abnormalities and adverse remodeling of the heart."

Methods We retrospectively enrolled 857 HCC patients who received primary resection from April 2001 to June 2016. 222 patients were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) from medical record. Factors influence the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Results During the follow-up period (mean, 75 months), 471 (54.9%) patients experienced recurrence, and 158 (18.4%) patients died. Multivariate analysis revealed that DM ( p = 0.015), elevated AST ( p = 0.006), hypoalbuminemia ( p = 0.003), tumor number ( p = 0.001), tumor size ( p &lt; 0.001), vascular invasion ( p &lt;0.001), high Ishak fibrosis score ( p &lt;0.001), hepatitis B ( p = 0.014), hepatitis C ( p = 0.001) were independent predictors for RFS. In diabetic patients, only HbA1c&gt;9% ( p = 0.033), hypoalbuminemia ( p = 0.030) and vascular invasion ( p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence; but the metformin use revealed no significance on recurrence. DM is a risk factor of HCC recurrence after resection. Adequate DM control can reduce the recurrence of HCC. However, the use of metformin does not reduce the risk of HCC recurrence in diabetic patient after initial resection. Hence, metformin may not have protective influences on HCC recurrence in diabetic patients who undergo initial liver resection."

In the present study, the kefir yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus 4G5 was used as host for the transformation of form I and form II RubisCO genes derived from the nonsulfur purple bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris using the Promoter-based Gene Assembly and Simultaneous Overexpression (PGASO) method. Hungateiclostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405, a well-known bacterium for its efficient solubilization of recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass, was used to degrade Napier grass and rice straw to generate soluble fermentable sugars. The resultant Napier grass and rice straw broths were used as growth media for the engineered K . marxianus . In the dual microbial system, H . thermocellum degraded the biomass feedstock to produce both C 5 and C 6 sugars. As the bacterium only used hexose sugars, the remaining pentose sugars could be metabolized by K . marxianus to produce ethanol. The transformant RubisCO K . marxianus strains grew well in hydrolyzed Napier grass and rice straw broths and produced bioethanol more efficiently than the wild type. Therefore, these engineered K . marxianus strains could be used with H . thermocellum in a bacterium-yeast coculture system for ethanol production directly from biomass feedstocks."
https://openalex.org/W3134187751,"Several species of bears are known to rub deliberately against trees and other objects, but little is known about why bears rub. Patterns in rubbing behavior of male and female brown bears (Ursus arctos) suggest that scent marking via rubbing functions to communicate among potential mates or competitors. Using DNA from bear hairs collected from rub objects in southwestern Alberta from 2011-2014 and existing DNA datasets from Montana and southeastern British Columbia, we determined sex and individual identity of each bear detected. Using these data, we completed a parentage analysis. From the parentage analysis and detection data, we determined the number of offspring, mates, unique rub objects where an individual was detected, and sampling occasions during which an individual was detected for each brown bear identified through our sampling methods. Using a Poisson regression, we found a positive relationship between bear rubbing behavior and reproductive success; both male and female bears with a greater number of mates and a greater number of offspring were detected at more rub objects and during more occasions. Our results suggest a fitness component to bear rubbing, indicate that rubbing is adaptive, and provide insight into a poorly understood behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3134986792,"Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully revealed many common risk variants for bladder cancer, the heritability is still largely unexplained. We hypothesized that low-frequency variants involved in bladder cancer risk could reveal the unexplained heritability. Next-generation sequencing of 113 patients and 118 controls was conducted on 81 genes/regions of known bladder cancer GWAS loci. A two-stage validation comprising 3,350 cases and 4,005 controls was performed to evaluate the effects of low-frequency variants on bladder cancer risk. Biological experiments and techniques, including electrophoretic mobility shift assays, CRISPR/Cas9, RNA-Seq, and bioinformatics approaches, were performed to assess the potential functions of low-frequency variants. The low-frequency variant rs28898617 was located in the first exon of UGT1A3 and was significantly associated with increased bladder cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.50, P = 3.10 × 10-6). Intriguingly, rs28898617 was only observed in the Asian population, but monomorphism was observed in the European population. The risk-associated G allele of rs28898617 increased UGT1A3 expression, facilitated UGT1A3 transcriptional activity, and enhanced the binding activity. In addition, UGT1A3 deletion significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of bladder cancer cells and xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, UGT1A3 induced LAMC2 expression by binding CBP and promoting histone acetylation, which remarkably promoted the progression of bladder cancer. This is the first targeted sequencing study to reveal that the novel low-frequency variant rs28898617 and its associated gene UGT1A3 are involved in bladder cancer development, providing new insights into the genetic architecture of bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3133652880,"The importance given to minimising health issues and promoting natural behaviours is a polarising issue within farm animal welfare. It is predominantly thought that members of the public prioritise animals being able to behave naturally over other aspects of farm animal welfare, such as addressing health issues. However, public perspectives may be more multi-dimensional than is generally thought, with the importance given to these different elements of welfare dependent on the situation and state of the animals in question. To examine this, a factorial survey using vignettes, which experimentally manipulated the different levels of health (high health vs. low health) and natural behaviour provision (high behaviour vs. low behaviour), was completed by a sample (n = 810) representative of the UK population (on age, gender, ethnicity). Contrary to the predominant view, this study found animal health had the greatest effect on participants' judgements, explaining more of the variance in their assessments of animal welfare than any other factor. However, findings also indicated that participants considered animal welfare to be most positive when both health issues are minimised and natural behaviours are promoted. Attitudes to natural behaviours also varied more between participants, with females, individuals who do not (regularly) eat meat and those with a greater belief in animal mind giving greater priority to natural behaviours. In the context of public and private welfare standards seeking to meet public expectations, this study provides important insights into how public perspectives of animal welfare are more nuanced than previously thought, influenced by the context of the animal, the aspect of welfare in question and personal characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3134267993,"Introduction Bleeding is a concern after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and subsequent dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). We herein report the incidence and risk factors for major bleeding in the Norwegian Coronary Stent Trial (NORSTENT). Materials and methods NORSTENT was a randomized, double blind, pragmatic trial among patients with acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary disease undergoing PCI during 2008–11. The patients ( N = 9,013) were randomized to receive either a drug-eluting stent or a bare-metal stent, and were treated with at least nine months of DAPT. The patients were followed for a median of five years, with Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3–5 major bleeding as one of the safety endpoints. We estimated cumulative incidence of major bleeding by a competing risks model and risk factors through cause-specific Cox models. Results The 12-month cumulative incidence of major bleeding was 2.3%. Independent risk factors for major bleeding were chronic kidney disease, low bodyweight (&lt; 60 kilograms), diabetes mellitus, and advanced age (&gt; 80 years). A myocardial infarction (MI) or PCI during follow-up increased the risk of major bleeding (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1-29-2.15). Conclusions The 12-month cumulative incidence of major bleeding in NORSTENT was higher than reported in previous, explanatory trials. This analysis strengthens the role of chronic kidney disease, advanced age, and low bodyweight as risk factors for major bleeding among patients receiving DAPT after PCI. The presence of diabetes mellitus or recurrent MI among patients is furthermore a signal of increased bleeding risk.

https://openalex.org/W3135255641,"Mast cells (MCs) play a pivotal role in inflammatory responses and had been studied in inflammatory bone disorders, however, their role in alveolar bone loss induced by periodontal disease (PD) is not yet fully understood. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the effects of MCs depletion in the PD-induced alveolar bone loss in Wistar (W) and Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs). PD was induced by ligating the lower first molars with silk thread one day after the MCs depletion, by the pre-treatment with compound 48/80 for 4 days. After 15 days of PD induction, the hemi-mandibles were surgically collected for qRT-PCR, histological analyses, immunostaining, and ELISA. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was verified by tail plethysmography to confirm the hypertensive status, and SHR presented SBP &gt;150 mmHg, and previous MC depletion alone or associated with PD did not alter this parameter. SHRs showed a more severe alveolar bone loss compared to W, and MC depletion significantly inhibited this response in both strains, with a more significant response in SHRs. MCs were less abundant in 48/80+PD groups, thus validating the previous MCs depletion in our model. PD increased the number of MC in the gingival tissue of SHR. Cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and CXCL3) was constitutively higher in SHR and increased further after PD, which was also significantly reduced in the MCs-depleted animals. PD led to an increased expression of Opn , Rankl , Rank , Vtn , Itga5 , Itgb5 , Trap , and Ctsk in the mandible of W and SHRs, which was reversed in MCs-depleted animals. These results suggest that MCs significantly contributes to the PD-induced alveolar bone resorption, especially in the SHR, which is associated with a more severe PD progression compared to Wistar, partly explained by these cells contribution to the inflammatory status and mediator production, stimulating osteoclast-related response markers, which were reduced after MC depletion in our experimental model."
https://openalex.org/W3133632672,"Consumption of pepeta, a traditionally processed immature rice product, is common in Tanzania, where it contributes to food security as an early rice food i.e. when there is no other food available at the household while the crops in the field not yet fully ripe. Many production steps are needed to guarantee a consistent, good quality pepeta product, and this hinders its utilization in other rice-growing sub-Saharan regions. This study aims to gain insight into the pepeta processing knowledge and final product, and assess variations in the processing conditions and parameters across the study area. A survey among 257 Tanzanian processors and consumers revealed that the pepeta product is widely known, rated second (73.5% respondents) as rice-based food after wali (cooked white rice, (100%)) and linked to traditions of the communities in the study area. Harvest of immature rice grain, roasting, pounding, cleaning, and packing are the main process steps of pepeta production. Method of rice harvest, rice suitability for pepeta production after optimum harvest, dryness of grains and number of pounding as indicator to terminate roasting and pounding process respectively, and packaging materials used varied significantly across respondents in the study area. Reported criteria considered by respondents for product acceptability did not vary significantly across study area. The criteria include colour (76.5%), general appearance (60.8%), texture (64.7%) and taste (52.9%). Immature rice paddy and pepeta were sold at a higher price than mature rice paddy and white rice, respectively, which implies that options to facilitate pepeta processing through, for instance, standardization of processing conditions and parameters could lead to increased income."
https://openalex.org/W3133658169,"Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a group of seizure disorders prominently associated with mutations in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). The most prevalent central nervous system nAChR subtype contains α4 and β2 subunits, in two ratios. (α4β2)2β2-nAChR have high agonist sensitivity (HS-isoform), whereas (α4β2)2α4-nAChR agonist responses exhibit a small high-sensitivity, and a predominant low-sensitivity, phase of function (LS-isoform). Multiple non-synonymous mutations in the second and third transmembrane domains of α4 and β2 subunits are associated with SHE. We recently demonstrated that two additional, SHE-associated, missense mutations in the major cytoplasmic loops of these subunits [α4(R336H) and β2(V337G)] cause increased macroscopic function-per receptor. Here, we use single-channel patch-clamp electrophysiology to show that these mutations influence single-channel amplitudes and open- and closed-state kinetics. Pure populations of HS- or LS-isoform α4β2-nAChR were expressed by injecting either 1:10 or 30:1 α4:β2 cRNA ratios, respectively, into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Functional properties of the resulting mutant α4β2-nAChR isoforms were compared to their wildtype counterparts. α4(R336H) subunit incorporation minimally affected single-channel amplitudes, whereas β2(V337G) subunit incorporation reduced them significantly in both isoforms. However, for both mutant subunits, increased function-per-receptor was predominantly caused by altered single channel kinetics. The α4(R336H) mutation primarily destabilizes desensitized states between openings. By contrast, the β2(V337G) mutation principally stabilizes receptor open states. The use of naturally-occurring and physiologically-impactful mutations has allowed us to define valuable new insights regarding the functional roles of nAChR intracellular domains. Further mechanistic context is provided by intracellular-domain structures recently published for other members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily (α3β4-nAChR and 5-HT3AR)."
https://openalex.org/W3135332203,"Introduction High residual platelet reactivity (RPR) in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) receiving antiplatelet agents has been associated with a high risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Study aim This study aimed at identification of independent prognostic predictors of AKI risk in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after PCI. Study design, setting and patients This was a prospective single-center clinical trial that included 155 patients (n = 119 without AKI, n = 36 with AKI, mean age 64.0±10.6 years, of whom 74.2% were males), who underwent PCI with stenting. We prospectively evaluated RPR using optical aggregometry. Development of AKI was the primary endpoint. Results Acute renal dysfunction was observed in 36 patients (23.2%) after PCI, the risk factors of which according to univariate regression analysis were: age (p = 0.040), low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p = 0.001), having severe heart failure (HF) according to Killip (p&lt;0.001), low level of hemoglobin (p = 0.026) and erythrocytes (p = 0.005), increased creatinine (p&lt;0.001), low baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (p&lt;0.001), low left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) (p = 0.003), high residual platelet reactivity (RPR) (p&lt;0.001) and platelet aggregation area under the curve (AUC) with 10 μg/mL ADP (p&lt;0.001), as well as dose of X-ray contrast medium (XCM) (p = 0.008). As a result of multivariate regression analysis the following independent predictors of AKI were established with the inclusion of the above factors: baseline creatinine level [OR 1.033 at 95% CI from 1.017 to 1.049; p&lt;0.001], RPR with 10 μg/mL ADP [OR 1.060 at 95% CI from 1.027 to 1.094; p = 0.001], dose of an XCM [ОR 1.005 at 95% CI from 1.001 to 1.008; р = 0.014], diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [OR 0.926 at 95% CI from 0.888 to 0.965; p&lt;0.001]. Conclusion ADP-induced high residual platelet reactivity, baseline creatinine level, X-ray contrast medium, low diastolic blood pressure were independent predictors of AKI in patients with ACS after PCI."
https://openalex.org/W3135815659,"African Americans endure a nearly two-fold greater risk of suffering a stroke and are 2–3 times more likely to die from stroke compared to those of European ancestry. African Americans also have a greater risk of recurrent stroke and vascular events, which are deadlier and more disabling than incident stroke. Stroke is a multifactorial disease with both heritable and environmental risk factors. We conducted an integrative, multi-omic study on 922 plasma metabolites, 473,864 DNA methylation loci, and 556 variants from 50 African American participants of the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention clinical trial to help elucidate biomarkers contributing to recurrent stroke rates in this high risk population. Sixteen metabolites, including cotinine, N-delta-acetylornithine, and sphingomyelin (d17:1/24:1) were identified in t-tests of recurrent stroke outcome or baseline smoking status. Serum tricosanoyl sphingomyelin (d18:1/23:0) levels were significantly associated with recurrent stroke after adjusting for covariates in Cox Proportional Hazards models. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis identified moderate correlations between sphingolipid markers and clinical traits including days to recurrent stroke. Integrative analyses between genetic variants in sphingolipid pathway genes identified 29 nominal associations with metabolite levels in a one-way analysis of variance, while epigenomic analyses identified xenobiotics, predominately smoking-associated metabolites and pharmaceutical drugs, associated with methylation profiles. Taken together, our results suggest that metabolites, specifically those associated with sphingolipid metabolism, are potential plasma biomarkers for stroke recurrence in African Americans. Furthermore, genetic variation and DNA methylation may play a role in the regulation of these metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W3135463002,"Objective Several serum biomarkers have been investigated for their potential as diagnostic tools in aortic disease; however, no study has investigated the association between serum biomarkers and outcomes after aortic surgery. This study explored the predictive ability of serum soluble lumican in postoperative outcomes after aortic surgery. Methods In total, 58 patients receiving aortic surgery for aortic dissection or aneurysm at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan in December 2011–September 2018 were enrolled. Blood samples were collected immediately upon patients’ arrival in the intensive care unit after aortic surgery. The diagnostic properties of soluble lumican levels were assessed by performing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The confidence interval (CI) of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured using DeLong’s nonparametric method and the optimal cutoff was determined using the Youden index. Results The serum soluble lumican level distinguished prolonged ventilation (AUC, 73.5%; 95% CI, 57.7%–89.3%) and hospital stay for &gt;30 days (AUC, 78.2%; 95% CI, 61.6%–94.7%). The optimal cutoffs of prolonged ventilation and hospital stay for &gt;30 days were 1.547 and 5.992 ng/mL, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were respectively 100% (95% CI, 71.5%–100%) and 40.4% (95% CI, 26.4%–55.7%) for prolonged ventilation and 58% (95% 27.7%–84.8%) and 91.3% (95% CI, 79.2%–97.6%) for hospital stay for &gt;30 days. Conclusions The serum soluble lumican level can be a potential prognostic factor for predicting poor postoperative outcomes after aortic surgery. However, more studies are warranted in the future."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-calcification effects of Entelon150 ® (consisting of grape-seed extract) in a beagle dog model of intravascular bovine pericardium implantation. Methods In total, 8 healthy male beagle dogs were implanted with a bovine pericardium bilaterally in the external jugular veins and divided into two groups. Animals in the Entelon150 ® group (n = 4) were treated with 150 mg of Entelon150 ® twice daily for six weeks after surgery. The negative control (NC) group (n = 4) was treated with 5 ml of saline using the same method. After six weeks, we measured the calcium content, performed histological examination, and performed molecular analysis. Results The calcium content of implanted tissue in the Entelon150 ® group (0.56±0.14 mg/g) was significantly lower than that in the NC group (1.48±0.57 mg/g) (p &lt; 0.05). Histopathological examination showed that infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells, such as fibroblasts and macrophages, occurred around the graft in all groups; however, the inflammation level of the implanted tissue in the Entelon150 ® group was s lower than that in the NC group. Both immunohistochemical and western blot analyses revealed that bone morphogenetic protein 2 expression was significantly attenuated in the Entelon150 ® group. Conclusions Our results indicate that Entelon150 ® significantly attenuates post-implantation inflammation and degenerative calcification of the bovine pericardium in dogs. Therefore, Entelon150 ® may increase the longevity of the bovine pericardium after intravascular implantation."

This study aimed to investigate the concomitant deformities in medial ankle osteoarthritis and the difference between the two types, varus angulation and medial translation.A retrospective study was conducted using medical records and radiographic data. Patients with medial ankle osteoarthritis that underwent weight-bearing X ray imaging and radiographic measurements including tibial plafond inclination (TPI), tibiotalar tilt angle (TT), lateral talo-first metatarsal angle, naviculo-cuboid overlap, and mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA) were studied. The patients were categorized into two groups, the varus angulation group (TT ≥4°) and medial translation group (TT <4°). The radiographic measurements were compared between the two groups.A total of 102 patients (male = 44; female = 58) were included; the mean age was 64.9 years (SD 8.3 years). The varus rotation group (N = 66) showed a significantly smaller lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (p<0.001), naviculo-cuboid overlap (p<0.001), and mTFA (p = 0.019) compared to the medial displacement group (N = 36). The TT showed a significant correlation with lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (r = -0.520, p<0.001), naviculo-cuboid overlap (r = -0.501, p<0.001), and mTFA (r = -0.243, p = 0.014). Lateral talo-first metatarsal angle was found to be the significant factor (p = 0.018) discriminating varus angulation and medial translation types in the binary logistic analysis.Varus angulation of the ankle was correlated with knee alignment and foot deformity. Radiographic indices were different between the varus angulation and medial translation groups. The role of concomitant deformities needs to be further investigated in terms of a causal relationship. Surgeons need to pay attention to concomitant deformities in the treatment of medial ankle osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3135373463,"Over 50% of women with detrusor overactivity (DO), who do not respond to therapy have been shown to have bacteriuria, which may stimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines than can enhance nerve signalling, leading to symptoms of urgency. This study made use of a consecutive series of urine samples collected from women with refractory DO, who participated in a clinical trial of rotating antibiotic therapy. The aim was to determine the effect of bacteriuria and antibiotic treatment on the levels of urinary cytokines, and to correlate the cytokine concentration with patient outcome measures relating to urgency or urge incontinence. The urinary cytokines chosen were IL-1α, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CXCL10 (IP-10), MCP-1 and TNF-α. The presence of bacteriuria stimulated a significant increase in the concentrations of IL-1α (P 0.0216), IL-1 receptor antagonist (P 0.0264), IL-6 (P 0.0003), IL-8 (P 0.0043) and CXCL-10 (P 0.009). Antibiotic treatment significantly attenuated the release of IL-1α (P 0.005), IL-6 (P 0.0027), IL-8 (P 0.0001), IL-10 (P 0.049), and CXCL-10 (P 0.042), i.e. the response to the presence of bacteria was less in the antibiotic treated patients. Across the 26 weeks of the trial, antibiotic treatment reduced the concentration of five of the nine cytokines measured (IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and CXCL-10); this did not reach significance at every time point. In antibiotic treated patients, the urinary concentration of CXCL-10 correlated positively with four of the six measures of urgency. This study has shown that cytokines associated with activation of the innate immune system (e.g. cytokines chemotactic for or activators of macrophages and neutrophils) are reduced by antibiotic therapy in women with refractory DO. Antibiotic therapy is also associated with symptom improvement in these women, therefore the inflammatory response may have a role in the aetiology of refractory DO."
https://openalex.org/W3135208456,"The ‘long tail’ nature of rural special education (RSE) suggests that it simultaneously possesses the private nature of discreteness and the public nature of externalities, which can easily cause provision insufficiency. However, this mismatch may have a dynamic intertemporal correction mechanism impacted by different expenditures of supply sectors (governments and other social sectors). This paper uses different models and data from 30 provinces in China from 2003–2014 to analyze this dynamic correction mechanism. This research finds that different kinds of expenditures from different suppliers have divergent effects on this correction. Capital expenses (especially infrastructure construction) have significantly positive effects on the correction, but administrative expenses have significant dual effects on the correction. These effects may be caused by the various governance efficiencies and motivations of all stakeholders in RSE. This paper concludes that we should pay more attention to the accurate recognition and effective satisfaction of RSE affected by the governance efficiency and motivation of different suppliers to achieve this dynamic correction."

SMH-TB contains structured data directly from the EHR, and variables generated using natural language processing (NLP) by extracting relevant information from free-text within clinic, radiology, and other notes. NLP performance was assessed using recall, precision and F1 score averaged across variable labels. We present characteristics of the cohort population using binomial proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with and without adjusting for NLP misclassification errors.SMH-TB currently contains retrospective patient data spanning 2011 to 2018, for a total of 3298 patients (N = 3237 with at least 1 associated dictation). Performance of TB diagnosis and medication NLP rulesets surpasses 93% in recall, precision and F1 metrics, indicating good generalizability. We estimated 20% (95% CI: 18.4-21.2%) were diagnosed with active TB and 46% (95% CI: 43.8-47.2%) were diagnosed with latent TB. After adjusting for potential misclassification, the proportion of patients diagnosed with active and latent TB was 18% (95% CI: 16.8-19.7%) and 40% (95% CI: 37.8-41.6%) respectively.SMH-TB is a unique database that includes a breadth of structured data derived from structured and unstructured EHR data by using NLP rulesets. The data are available for a variety of research applications, such as clinical epidemiology, quality improvement and mathematical modeling studies."
