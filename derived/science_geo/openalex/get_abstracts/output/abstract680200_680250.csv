https://openalex.org/W3197986920,"Inflammasomes are important sentinels of innate immune defence, sensing pathogens and inducing cell death in infected cells1. There are several inflammasome sensors that each detect and respond to a specific pathogen- or damage-associated molecular pattern (PAMP or DAMP, respectively)1. During infection, live pathogens can induce the release of multiple PAMPs and DAMPs, which can simultaneously engage multiple inflammasome sensors2–5. Here we found that AIM2 regulates the innate immune sensors pyrin and ZBP1 to drive inflammatory signalling and a form of inflammatory cell death known as PANoptosis, and provide host protection during infections with herpes simplex virus 1 and Francisella novicida. We also observed that AIM2, pyrin and ZBP1 were members of a large multi-protein complex along with ASC, caspase-1, caspase-8, RIPK3, RIPK1 and FADD, that drove inflammatory cell death (PANoptosis). Collectively, our findings define a previously unknown regulatory and molecular interaction between AIM2, pyrin and ZBP1 that drives assembly of an AIM2-mediated multi-protein complex that we term the AIM2 PANoptosome and comprising multiple inflammasome sensors and cell death regulators. These results advance the understanding of the functions of these molecules in innate immunity and inflammatory cell death, suggesting new therapeutic targets for AIM2-, ZBP1- and pyrin-mediated diseases. AIM2 responds to infection with herpes simplex virus 1 or Francisella novicida by driving assembly of a large multi-protein complex containing multiple inflammasome sensors and cell death regulators."

https://openalex.org/W3198788043,"Extracellular electron transfer by Geobacter species through surface appendages known as microbial nanowires1 is important in a range of globally important environmental phenomena2, as well as for applications in bio-remediation, bioenergy, biofuels and bioelectronics. Since 2005, these nanowires have been thought to be type 4 pili composed solely of the PilA-N protein1. However, previous structural analyses have demonstrated that, during extracellular electron transfer, cells do not produce pili but rather nanowires made up of the cytochromes OmcS2,3 and OmcZ4. Here we show that Geobacter sulfurreducens binds PilA-N to PilA-C to assemble heterodimeric pili, which remain periplasmic under nanowire-producing conditions that require extracellular electron transfer5. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that C-terminal residues of PilA-N stabilize its copolymerization with PilA-C (to form PilA-N-C) through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that position PilA-C along the outer surface of the filament. PilA-N-C filaments lack π-stacking of aromatic side chains and show a conductivity that is 20,000-fold lower than that of OmcZ nanowires. In contrast with surface-displayed type 4 pili, PilA-N-C filaments show structure, function and localization akin to those of type 2 secretion pseudopili6. The secretion of OmcS and OmcZ nanowires is lost when pilA-N is deleted and restored when PilA-N-C filaments are reconstituted. The substitution of pilA-N with the type 4 pili of other microorganisms also causes a loss of secretion of OmcZ nanowires. As all major phyla of prokaryotes use systems similar to type 4 pili, this nanowire translocation machinery may have a widespread effect in identifying the evolution and prevalence of diverse electron-transferring microorganisms and in determining nanowire assembly architecture for designing synthetic protein nanowires."

https://openalex.org/W3198736369,"Abstract Homologous recombination is essential for the accurate repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) 1 . Initially, the RecBCD complex 2 resects the ends of the DSB into 3′ single-stranded DNA on which a RecA filament assembles 3 . Next, the filament locates the homologous repair template on the sister chromosome 4 . Here we directly visualize the repair of DSBs in single cells, using high-throughput microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy. We find that, in Escherichia coli , repair of DSBs between segregated sister loci is completed in 15 ± 5 min (mean ± s.d.) with minimal fitness loss. We further show that the search takes less than 9 ± 3 min (mean ± s.d) and is mediated by a thin, highly dynamic RecA filament that stretches throughout the cell. We propose that the architecture of the RecA filament effectively reduces search dimensionality. This model predicts a search time that is consistent with our measurement and is corroborated by the observation that the search time does not depend on the length of the cell or the amount of DNA. Given the abundance of RecA homologues 5 , we believe this model to be widely conserved across living organisms."
https://openalex.org/W3197037744,"PIWI proteins use PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to identify and silence transposable elements and thereby maintain genome integrity between metazoan generations1. The targeting of transposable elements by PIWI has been compared to mRNA target recognition by Argonaute proteins2,3, which use microRNA (miRNA) guides, but the extent to which piRNAs resemble miRNAs is not known. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of a PIWI–piRNA complex from the sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis with and without target RNAs, and a biochemical analysis of target recognition. Mirroring Argonaute, PIWI identifies targets using the piRNA seed region. However, PIWI creates a much weaker seed so that stable target association requires further piRNA–target pairing, making piRNAs less promiscuous than miRNAs. Beyond the seed, the structure of PIWI facilitates piRNA–target pairing in a manner that is tolerant of mismatches, leading to long-lived PIWI–piRNA–target interactions that may accumulate on transposable-element transcripts. PIWI ensures targeting fidelity by physically blocking the propagation of piRNA–target interactions in the absence of faithful seed pairing, and by requiring an extended piRNA–target duplex to reach an endonucleolytically active conformation. PIWI proteins thereby minimize off-targeting cellular mRNAs while defending against evolving genomic threats. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of a PIWI–piRNA complex provide insight into how piRNAs recognise target RNAs and reveal differences from the target mechanisms of microRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W3196989945,"Background Efforts to minimize COVID-19 exposure during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have led to limitations in access to medical care and testing. The Tasso-SST kit includes all of the components necessary for remote, capillary blood self-collection. In this study, we sought to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the Tasso-SST device as a self-collection device for measurement of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Methods Capillary blood was obtained via unsupervised and supervised application of the Tasso-SST device, and venous blood was collected by standard venipuncture. Unsupervised self-collected blood samples underwent either extreme summer or winter-simulated shipping conditions prior to testing. Sera obtained by all three methods were tested concurrently using the EuroImmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay in a CLIA-certified clinical laboratory. Results Successful Tasso-SST capillary blood collection by unsupervised and supervised administration was completed by 93.4% and 94.5% of participants, respectively. Sera from 56 participants, 55 with documented (PCR+) COVID-19, and 33 healthy controls were then tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Compared to venous blood results, Tasso-SST-collected (unstressed) and the summer- and winter-stressed blood samples demonstrated Deming regression slopes of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99–1.02), 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98–1.01), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97–1.01), respectively, with an overall accuracy of 98.9%. Conclusions Capillary blood self-collection using the Tasso-SST device had a high success rate. Moreover, excellent concordance was found for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG results between Tasso-SST capillary and standard venous blood-derived sera. The Tasso-SST device should enable widespread collection of capillary blood for testing without medical supervision, facilitating epidemiologic studies."
https://openalex.org/W3137863440,"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic mobile health applications indicating risks emerging from close contacts to infected persons have a large potential to interrupt transmission chains by automating contact tracing. Since its dispatch in Germany in June 2020 the Corona Warn App has been downloaded on 25.7 Mio smartphones by February 2021. To understand barriers to download and user fidelity in different sociodemographic groups we analysed data from five consecutive cross-sectional waves of the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring survey from June to August 2020. Questions on the Corona Warn App included information on download, use, functionality, usability, and consequences of the app. Of the 4,960 participants (mean age 45.9 years, standard deviation 16.0, 50.4% female), 36.5% had downloaded the Corona Warn App. Adjusted analysis found that those who had downloaded the app were less likely to be female (Adjusted Odds Ratio for men 1.16 95% Confidence Interval [1.02;1.33]), less likely to be younger (Adjusted Odds Ratio for age 18 to 39 0.47 [0.32;0.59] Adjusted Odds Ratio for age 40 to 64 0.57 [0.46;0.69]), less likely to have a lower household income (AOR 0.55 [0.43;0.69]), and more likely to live in one of the Western federal states including Berlin (AOR 2.31 [1.90;2.82]). Willingness to disclose a positive test result and trust in data protection compliance of the Corona Warn App was significantly higher in older adults. Willingness to disclose also increased with higher educational degrees and income. This study supports the hypothesis of a digital divide that separates users and non-users of the Corona Warn App along a well-known health gap of education, income, and region."
https://openalex.org/W3198422208,"Oxygen is critical for a multitude of metabolic processes that are essential for human life. Biological processes can be identified by treating cells with 18O2 or other isotopically labelled gases and systematically identifying biomolecules incorporating labeled atoms. Here we labelled cell lines of distinct tissue origins with 18O2 to identify the polar oxy-metabolome, defined as polar metabolites labelled with 18O under different physiological O2 tensions. The most highly 18O-labelled feature was 4-hydroxymandelate (4-HMA). We demonstrate that 4-HMA is produced by hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like (HPDL), a protein of previously unknown function in human cells. We identify 4-HMA as an intermediate involved in the biosynthesis of the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) headgroup in human cells. The connection of HPDL to CoQ10 biosynthesis provides crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying recently described neurological diseases related to HPDL deficiencies1-4 and cancers with HPDL overexpression5."
https://openalex.org/W3198003368,"Background Many clinical studies reported deficits in basic and complex cognitive functions in adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, the extent in which deficits in basic functions (i.e., processing speed and distractibility) contribute to complex cognitive impairments (i.e., working memory, planning, cognitive flexibility, memory functions) in adults with ADHD is not well-studied. So far, literature show only one study, revealing that basic functions explain 27–74% of executive dysfunctions. Yet, the authors reported that findings could be affected by the selection of neuropsychological tests. The goal of the present research is to replicate such a finding using a different sample and a different set of neuropsychological tests. Methods Forty-eight adult patients with ADHD were compared with 48 healthy controls in basic cognitive functions, namely processing speed and distractibility and more complex cognitive functions, namely selective attention, cognitive flexibility, planning, working memory, verbal fluency, and verbal memory. Basic and complex cognitive functions were assessed using the Vigilance and Sustained Attention, Selective Attention, N-Back, Tower of London, Trail Making Test, Word Fluency, and Verbal Learning and Memory. Results and conclusion Logistic regression analyses showed that impairments in complex cognitive functions explained 25% of the variance in ADHD diagnosis. The explained variance dropped from 25% to 9% after considering basic functions of processing speed and distractibility. This 64% reduction highlights the importance of basic functions for impairments in complex functions in patients with ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W3198072855,"Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains a significant public health problem globally. In Ethiopia, the number of infected peoples and deaths due to COVID-19 has increased dramatically in the past. Currently, students are resuming to face to face education with strict prevention measures. University students are more dynamic and more susceptible to acquiring and spreading the virus. Objective To assess the attitude, preparedness, and self-efficacy to prevent and control COVID-19 and associated factors among university students during school reopening, Northeast Ethiopia. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted among Debre Berhan University (DBU) students from December 1 to 15/2020, when students return to campus. A multistage sampling technique was applied to recruit 682 participants. The ReadyScore criteria were used to classify the level of preparedness. Epi-Data version 4.6 was used for data entry, while SPSS version 25 for analysis. Descriptive and Binary logistic regression analysis was computed, and a p- value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result The overall level of favourable attitude, good preparedness, and high self-efficacy among students were 67.2%, 17.9%, and 50.4%, respectively. Only mothers’ education was associated with attitude. Female gender, open relationships, health science faculty, heart disease, and favourable attitude were significant preparedness factors. Whereas being undergraduate, parents’ education, residing in dorm being four and above, having kidney disease, having friend/family history of COVID-19 infection and death, favourable attitude, and good preparedness were predictors of self-efficacy. Conclusion The level of attitude, preparedness, and self-efficacy towards COVID-19 among students during campus re-entry were low. Managing chronic illnesses and raising the attitude and preparedness of students is essential to reduce the burden of COVID-19 pandemics. Besides, emphasis should be placed on male, unmarried, postgraduate, and non-health science students to increase the level of preparedness and self-efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3196402546,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the development of bilateral renal cysts which enlarge continuously, leading to compression of adjacent intact nephrons. The growing cysts lead to a progressive decline in renal function. Cyst growth is driven by enhanced cell proliferation and chloride secretion into the cyst lumen. Chloride secretion is believed to occur mainly by the cAMP-activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), with some contribution by the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A. However, our previous work suggested TMEM16A as a major factor for renal cyst formation. The contribution of CFTR to cyst formation has never been demonstrated in an adult ADPKD mouse model. We used mice with an inducible tubule-specific Pkd1 knockout, which consistently develop polycystic kidneys upon deletion of Pkd1. Cellular properties, ion currents, and cyst development in these mice were compared with that of mice carrying a co-deletion of Pkd1 and Cftr. Knockout of Cftr did not reveal any significant impact on cyst formation in the ADPKD mouse model. Furthermore, knockout of Cftr did not attenuate the largely augmented cell proliferation observed in Pkd1 knockout kidneys. Patch clamp analysis on primary renal epithelial cells lacking expression of Pkd1 indicated an only marginal contribution of CFTR to whole cell Cl− currents, which were clearly dominated by calcium-activated TMEM16A currents. In conclusion, CFTR does not essentially contribute to renal cyst formation in mice caused by deletion of Pkd1. Enhanced cell proliferation and chloride secretion is caused primarily by upregulation of the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A."
https://openalex.org/W3197288252,"RNA silencing is mediated through RNA interference (RNAi) pathway gene families, i.e., Dicer-Like (DCL), Argonaute (AGO), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) and their cis -acting regulatory elements. The RNAi pathway is also directly connected with the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanism, and the pathway controls eukaryotic gene regulation during growth, development, and stress response. Nevertheless, genome-wide identification of RNAi pathway gene families such as DCL, AGO, and RDR and their regulatory network analyses related to transcription factors have not been studied in many fruit crop species, including banana ( Musa acuminata ). In this study, we studied in silico genome-wide identification and characterization of DCL, AGO, and RDR genes in bananas thoroughly via integrated bioinformatics approaches. A genome-wide analysis identified 3 MaDCL, 13 MaAGO, and 5 MaRDR candidate genes based on multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree related to the RNAi pathway in banana genomes. These genes correspond to the Arabidopsis thaliana RNAi silencing genes. The analysis of the conserved domain, motif, and gene structure (exon-intron numbers) for MaDCL, MaAGO, and MaRDR genes showed higher homogeneity within the same gene family. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis exhibited that the identified RNAi genes could be involved in RNA silencing and associated metabolic pathways. A number of important transcription factors (TFs), e.g., ERF, Dof, C2H2, TCP, GATA and MIKC_MADS families, were identified by network and sub-network analyses between TFs and candidate RNAi gene families. Furthermore, the cis -acting regulatory elements related to light-responsive (LR), stress-responsive (SR), hormone-responsive (HR), and other activities (OT) functions were identified in candidate MaDCL, MaAGO, and MaRDR genes. These genome-wide analyses of these RNAi gene families provide valuable information related to RNA silencing, which would shed light on further characterization of RNAi genes, their regulatory elements, and functional roles, which might be helpful for banana improvement in the breeding program."
https://openalex.org/W3198873514,"When fish are processed, fish bone becomes a key component of the waste, but to date very few researchers have sought to use fish bone to prepare protein hydrolysates as a means of adding value to the final product. This study, therefore, examines the potential of salmon bone, through an analysis of the benefits of its constituent components, namely fat, moisture, protein, and ash. In particular, the study seeks to optimize the process of enzymatic hydrolysis of salmon bone with trypsin in order to produce angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides making use of response surface methodology in combination with central composite design (CCD). Optimum hydrolysis conditions concerning DH (degree of hydrolysis) and ACE-inhibitory activity were initially determined using the response surface model. Having thus determined which of the salmon bone protein hydrolysates (SBPH) offered the greatest level of ACE-inhibitory activity, these SBPH were duly selected to undergo ultrafiltration for further fractionation. It was found that the greatest ACE-inhibitory activity was achieved by the SBPH fraction which had a molecular weight lower than 0.65 kDa. This fraction underwent further purification using RP-HPLC, revealing that the F7 fraction offered the best ACE-inhibitory activity. For ACE inhibition, the ideal peptide in the context of the F7 fraction comprised eight amino acids: Phe-Cys-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Leu-Ala-Arg (FCLYELAR), while analysis of the Lineweaver-Burk plot revealed that the FCLYELAR peptide can serve as an uncompetitive ACE inhibitor. An examination of the molecular docking process showed that the FCLYELAR peptide was primarily able to provide ACE-inhibitory qualities as a consequence of the hydrogen bond interactions taking place between ACE and the peptide. Furthermore, upon isolation form the SBPH, the ACE-inhibitory peptide demonstrated ACE-inhibitory capabilities in vitro, underlining its potential for applications in the food and pharmaceutical sectors."

For the present COVID–19 pandemic, we discuss the performance of some linear and nonlinear time series forecasting techniques widely used for modeling the actual pandemic and provide estimates for this metric from January 2020 to April 2021. We apply the results obtained to evaluate the evolution of the present pandemic in Brazil and Spain, which allows in particular to compare how well (or bad) these countries have managed the pandemic. For Brazil, our calculations refute the claim made by some officials that the present pandemic is “a little flu”. Some studies suggest that the virus could be lying dormant across the world before been detected for the first time. In that regard, our results show that there is no evidence of deaths by the virus in 2019."
https://openalex.org/W3197397807,"This paper proposes a framework for a layout evaluation of urban public sports facilities. First, the buffer analysis method is used to measure the service level of public sports facilities. The study findings indicate that the overall service level of public sports facilities presents the spatial characteristics of a central agglomeration, and the value of the service level diffuses outward from high to low. There is evident spatial heterogeneity in the layout of public sports facilities in Hangzhou. Second, the Gini coefficient, Lorenz curve, and location entropy are employed to measure the equity of the distribution among spatial units and the intradistrict disparity. The results show a mismatch between the spatial distribution of the facilities and the distribution of the permanent population. The patterns of distribution of the location entropy classes of Hangzhou can be divided into three types: balanced, alternating, and divergent districts. The method in this paper is effective in measuring spatial equity and visualizing it. it has a certain degree of systemicity, universality and operability. At the same time, this method can compare the diachronic characteristics of the same city and the synchronic characteristics of different cities, which has universal application value."
https://openalex.org/W3196383064,"Pork processing plants were apparent hotspots for SARS-CoV2 in the spring of 2020. As a result, the swine industry was confronted with a major occupational health, financial, and animal welfare crisis. The objective of this work was to describe the epidemiological situation within processing plants, develop mathematical models to simulate transmission in these plants, and test the effectiveness of routine PCR screening at minimizing SARS-CoV2 circulation. Cumulative incidence of clinical (PCR-confirmed) disease plateaued at ~2.5% to 25% across the three plants studied here. For larger outbreaks, antibody prevalence was approximately 30% to 40%. Secondly, we developed a mathematical model that accounts for asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and background “community” transmission. By calibrating this model to observed epidemiological data, we estimated the initial reproduction number ( R ) of the virus. Across plants, R generally ranged between 2 and 4 during the initial phase, but subsequently declined to ~1 after two to three weeks, most likely as a result of implementation/compliance with biosecurity measures in combination with population immunity. Using the calibrated model to simulate a range of possible scenarios, we show that the effectiveness of routine PCR-screening at minimizing disease spread was far more influenced by testing frequency than by delays in results, R , or background community transmission rates. Testing every three days generally averted about 25% to 40% of clinical cases across a range of assumptions, while testing every 14 days typically averted 7 to 13% of clinical cases. However, the absolute number of additional clinical cases expected and averted was influenced by whether there was residual immunity from a previous peak (i.e., routine testing is implemented after the workforce had experienced an initial outbreak). In contrast, when using PCR-screening to prevent outbreaks or in the early stages of an outbreak, even frequent testing may not prevent a large outbreak within the workforce. This research helps to identify protocols that minimize risk to occupational safety and health and support continuity of business for U.S. processing plants. While the model was calibrated to meat processing plants, the structure of the model and insights about testing are generalizable to other settings where large number of people work in close proximity."
https://openalex.org/W3196945955,"To assess whether the prognostic impact of conventional risk factors and ancillary biomarkers differs across the 2 largest ProMisE molecular subgroups of endometrial carcinoma (EC).Direct sequencing of POLE exonuclease domain hot spots and immunohistochemistry for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 and p53 were performed on 745 unselected endometrioid ECs to identify mismatch repair deficient (MMR-D, n = 264) and no specific molecular profile (NSMP, n = 206) ECs. Molecular group-specific survival analyses and interaction analyses were performed to determine the prognostic relevance of clinicopathological factors and various biomarkers (L1 cell adhesion molecule, estrogen and progesterone receptor, beta-catenin, p16, E-cadherin, KRAS) within the subgroups.Molecular subgroup did not have an independent effect on disease-specific survival after adjustment for conventional risk factors (P = 0.101). High grade (G3) and p16 hyperexpression remained significant predictors of survival in NSMP. Stage II-IV, ≥50% myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion and loss of E-cadherin were independent predictors in the MMR-D group. In the interaction analysis, molecular subclass significantly modified the prognostic effect of high grade and p16 hyperexpression, which showed a stronger negative effect on survival in NSMP as compared to MMR-D (P for interaction = 0.016 for grade and 0.033 for p16).Grade of differentiation and p16 hyperexpression appear to have a stronger prognostic impact in NSMP as compared to MMR-D EC. While these results need to be confirmed in a larger study population, they indicate that differential impact of risk factors needs to be taken into account when developing new molecular class-integrated risk stratification algorithms for EC."
https://openalex.org/W3198727498,"To analyse the mortality rate trend due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in the adult population in Brazil.From 2000 to 2018, a time trend study with joinpoint regression was conducted among Brazilian men and women aged 35 years and over. Age-adjusted and age, sex specific CHD and stroke trend rate mortality were measured.Crude mortality rates from CHD decreased in both sexes and in all age groups, except for males over 85 years old with an increase of 1.78%. The most accentuated declining occurred for age range 35 to 44 years for both men (52.1%) and women (53.2%) due to stroke and in men (33%) due to CHD, and among women (32%) aged 65 to 74 years due to CHD. Age-adjusted mortality rates for CHD and stroke decreased in both sexes, in the period from 2000 to 2018. The average annual rate for CHD went from 97.09 during 2000-2008 to 78.75 during 2016-2018, whereas the highest percentage of change was observed during 2008 to 2013 (APC -2.5%; 95% CI). The average annual rate for stroke decreased from 104.96 to 69.93, between 2000-2008 and 2016-2018, and the highest percentage of change occurred during the periods from 2008 to 2013 and 2016 to 2018 (APC 4.7%; 95% CI).The downward trend CHD and stroke mortality rates is continuing. Policy intervention directed to strengthen care provision and improve population diets and lifestyles might explain the continued progress, but there is no room for complacency."
https://openalex.org/W3197493561,"The cardiac circadian clock is responsible for the modulation of different myocardial processes, and its dysregulation has been linked to disease development. How this clock machinery is regulated in the heart remains an open question. Because noradrenaline (NE) can act as a zeitgeber in cardiomyocytes, we tested the hypothesis that adrenergic signaling resets cardiac clock gene expression in vivo. In its anti-phase with Clock and Bmal1, cardiac Per1 abundance increased during the dark phase, concurrent with the rise in heart rate and preceded by an increase in NE levels. Sympathetic denervation altered Bmal1 and Clock amplitude, while Per1 was affected in both amplitude and oscillatory pattern. We next treated mice with a β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blocker. Strikingly, the β-AR blockade during the day suppressed the nocturnal increase in Per1 mRNA, without altering Clock or Bmal1. In contrast, activating β-AR with isoproterenol (ISO) promoted an increase in Per1 expression, demonstrating its responsiveness to adrenergic input. Inhibitors of ERK1/2 and CREB attenuated ISO-induced Per1 expression. Upstream of ERK1/2, PI3Kγ mediated ISO induction of Per1 transcription, while activation of β2-AR, but not β1-AR induced increases in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Per1 expression. Consistent with the β2-induction of Per1 mRNA, ISO failed to activate ERK1/2 and elevate Per1 in the heart of β2-AR−/− mice, whereas a β2-AR antagonist attenuated the nocturnal rise in Per1 expression. Our study established a link between NE/β2-AR signaling and Per1 oscillation via the PI3Ky-ERK1/2-CREB pathway, providing a new framework for understanding the physiological mechanism involved in resetting cardiac clock genes."
https://openalex.org/W3198381533,"The developmental competence of male and female gametes is frequently reduced under in vitro conditions, mainly due to oxidative stress during handling. The amino-acid derived hormone melatonin has emerged as a potent non-enzymatic antioxidant in many biological systems. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of melatonin on post-thaw sperm quality, fertilizing ability, and embryo development and competence in vitro after in vitro fertilization. Frozen-thawed bovine spermatozoa were incubated either in the presence of 10-11 M melatonin (MT), or its solvent (ethanol; Sham-Control), or plain Tyrode's Albumin Lactate Pyruvate medium (TALP, Control). Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) and flow cytometry data after 30 min, 120 min, and 180 min incubation did not reveal any significant effects of melatonin on average motility parameters, sperm subpopulation structure as determined by hierarchical cluster, or on the percentage of viable, acrosome intact sperm, or viable sperm with active mitochondria. Nevertheless, in vitro matured cumulus-oocyte-complexes fertilized with spermatozoa which had been preincubated with 10-11 M melatonin (MT-Sperm) showed higher (P < 0.01) rates of monospermic fertilization, reduced (P < 0.05) polyspermy and enhanced (P < 0.05) embryo development compared to the Control group. Moreover, the relative abundance of MAPK13 in the in vitro-derived blastocysts was greater (P < 0.05) than observed in the Control group. In conclusion, adding melatonin to the sperm-preparation protocol for bovine IVF improved proper fertilization and enhanced embryonic development and competence in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3198652658,"Knowledge of the ovulatory cycle (KOC) aids women to refrain and engage in sexual intercourse to avoid and to get pregnancy, respectively. The effect of community-level factors on KOC was not yet known in Ethiopia. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the community- and individual-level determinants of KOC among women of childbearing age.We used the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey, and total weighted samples of 15,683 women were included. Intra-class correlation, median odds ratio, and deviance were executed for model comparison in which a model with the lowest deviance was the best model i.e. model III in this case. A multivariable multilevel logistic regression model was employed to identify community- and individual-level factors of correct KOC. In the ultimate model, an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval was reported and variables with a p<0.05 were considered as statistically significant.In this study, 3,698 [23.58% (95% CI; 22.92-24.25)] participants had correct KOC. Women's age in years, i.e. 20-24 (AOR = 1.46;1.28-1.68) 25-29 (AOR = 1.72; 1.49-1.99), 30-34 (AOR = 2.21; 1.89-2.58), 35-39 (AOR = 1.78; 1.51-2.09), 40-44 (AOR = 1.97; 1.65-2.37), and 45-49 (AOR = 1.78; 1.44-2.19), knowledge of contraceptive methods (AOR = 3.08; 2.07-4.58), increased women's educational level, i.e. higher (AOR = 4.24; 3.54-5.07), secondary (AOR = 2.89; 2.48-3.36), and primary (AOR = 1.57; 1.39-1.78), higher household's wealth index, i.e. richest (AOR = 1.71; 1.35-2.16), richer (AOR = 1.42; 1.16-1.72), middle (AOR = 1.29; 1.07-1.56), and poorer (AOR = 1.24; 1.03-1.48), current contraceptive use (AOR = 1.26; 1.13-1.39), menstruating in the last six weeks (AOR = 1.13; 1.03-1.24), women's media exposure (AOR = 1.20; 1.07-1.35), and being in the community with a high level of media exposure (AOR = 1.53; 1.24-1.88) were statistically significant with KOC.Knowledge of the ovulatory cycle was low in this study, which demands health education for women of childbearing age. Special attention should be given to teenagers, those with lower educational, and lower economic status. Besides, the strengthening of media campaigns could increase women's KOC, which is crucial for preventing unintended pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3196644554,"Newer approaches in health communication research indicate that understanding the flow of emotional experiences during exposure to fear appeals can clarify their persuasive effects. In a laboratory experiment, the impact of valence shifts during exposure to fear appeals on determinants of health-relevant behaviors were examined. Continuous response measurement allowed gathering real-time data about participants' experiences of valence shifts during exposure. Among the results, a shift from negative to positive valence promoted efficacy perceptions but only for people being personally affected by the health issue. Perceived efficacy, in turn, increased intentions to put recommended behaviors into practice. This suggests that inducing positive valence shifts in health messages improves their effectiveness, especially for relevant target groups."
https://openalex.org/W3197366291,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are capable of transporting molecules to which they are tethered across cellular membranes. Unsurprisingly, CPPs have attracted attention for their potential drug delivery applications, but several technical hurdles remain to be overcome. Chief among them is the so-called 'endosomal escape problem,' i.e. the propensity of CPP-cargo molecules to be endocytosed but remain entrapped in endosomes rather than reaching the cytosol. Previously, a CPP fused to calmodulin that bound calmodulin binding site-containing cargos was shown to efficiently deliver cargos to the cytoplasm, effectively overcoming the endosomal escape problem. The CPP-adaptor, ""TAT-CaM,"" evinces delivery at nM concentrations and more rapidly than we had previously been able to measure. To better understand the kinetics and mechanism of CPP-adaptor-mediated cargo delivery, a real-time cell penetrating assay was developed in which a flow chamber containing cultured cells was installed on the stage of a confocal microscope to allow for observation ab initio. Also examined in this study was an improved CPP-adaptor that utilizes naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) calmodulin in place of human and results in superior internalization, likely due to its lesser net negative charge. Adaptor-cargo complexes were delivered into the flow chamber and fluorescence intensity in the midpoint of baby hamster kidney cells was measured as a function of time. Delivery of 400 nM cargo was observed within seven minutes and fluorescence continued to increase linearly as a function of time. Cargo-only control experiments showed that the minimal uptake which occurred independently of the CPP-adaptor resulted in punctate localization consistent with endosomal entrapment. A distance analysis was performed for cell-penetration experiments in which CPP-adaptor-delivered cargo showing wider dispersions throughout cells as compared to an analogous covalently-bound CPP-cargo. Small molecule endocytosis inhibitors did not have significant effects upon delivery. The real-time assay is an improvement upon static endpoint assays and should be informative in a broad array of applications."
https://openalex.org/W3197768883,"In 2014, the Navajo Nation Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA) was passed, combining a 2% tax on foods of 'minimal-to-no-nutritional value' and waiver of 5% sales tax on healthy foods, the first-ever such tax in the U.S. and globally among a sovereign tribal nation. The aim of this study was to measure changes in pricing and food availability in stores on the Navajo Nation following the implementation of the HDNA.Store observations were conducted in 2013 and 2019 using the Nutrition Environment Measurement Survey-Stores (NEMS-S) adapted for the Navajo Nation. Observations included store location, type, whether healthy foods or HDNA were promoted, and availability and pricing of fresh fruits and vegetables, canned items, beverages, water, snacks and traditional foods. Differences between 2013 and 2019 and by store type and location were tested.The matched sample included 71 stores (51 in the Navajo Nation and 20 in border towns). In 2019, fresh produce was available in the majority of Navajo stores, with 71% selling at least 3 types of fruit and 65% selling at least 3 types of vegetables. Compared with border town convenience stores, Navajo convenience stores had greater availability of fresh vegetables and comparable availability of fresh fruit in 2019. The average cost per item of fresh fruit decreased by 13% in Navajo stores (from $0.88 to $0.76) and increased in border stores (from $0.63 to $0.73), resulting in comparable prices in Navajo and border stores in 2019. While more Navajo stores offered mutton, blue corn and wild plants in 2019 compared to 2013, these changes were not statistically significant.The findings suggest modest improvements in the Navajo store environment and high availability of fruits and vegetables. Navajo stores play an important role in the local food system and provide access to local, healthy foods for individuals living in this rural, tribal community."
https://openalex.org/W3197934207,"Fishways have been widely used for upstream passage around human-built structures, but 'success' has varied dramatically. Evaluation of fishway success has typically been conducted at local scales using metrics such as fish passage efficiency and passage time, but evaluations are increasingly used in broader assessments of whether passage facilities meet population-specific conservation and management objectives. Over 15 years, we monitored passage effectiveness at eight dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers for 26,886 radio-tagged spring-summer and fall Chinook Salmon O. tshwaytscha, Sockeye Salmon O. nerka, and summer steelhead O. mykiss during their migrations to spawning sites. Almost all fish that entered dam tailraces eventually approached and entered fishways. Tailrace-to-forebay passage efficiency estimates at individual dams were consistently high, averaging 0.966 (SD = 0.035) across 245 run×year×dam combinations. These estimates are among the highest recorded for any migratory species, which we attribute to the scale of evaluation, salmonid life history traits (e.g., philopatry), and a sustained adaptive management approach to fishway design, maintenance, and improvement. Full-dam fish passage times were considerably more variable, with run×year×dam medians ranging from 5-65 h. Evaluation at larger scales provided evidence that fishways were biologically effective, e.g., we observed rapid migration rates (medians = 28-40 km/d) through river reaches with multiple dams and estimated fisheries-adjusted upstream migration survival of 67-69%. However, there were substantive uncertainties regarding effectiveness. Uncertainty about natal origins confounded estimation of population-specific survival and interpretation of apparent dam passage 'failure', while lack of post-migration reproductive data precluded analyses of delayed or cumulative effects of passing the impounded system on fish fitness. Although the technical fishways are effective for salmonids in the Columbia-Snake River system, other co-migrating species have lower passage rates, highlighting the need for species-specific design and evaluation wherever passage facilities impact fish management and conservation goals."
https://openalex.org/W3197942517,"Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) and measure values of in vivo placental perfusion in women. Methods This study was part of the Placentimage trial (NCT01092949). Gadolinium-chelate (Gd) enhanced dynamic MRI was performed two days before termination of pregnancies at 16 to 34 weeks gestational age (GA). Quantitative analysis was performed using one-compartment intravascular modeling. DCE perfusion parameters were analyzed across GA and were compared in IUGR and AGA fetuses. Results 134 patients were enrolled. After quality control check, 62 DCE MRI were analyzed including 48 and 14 pregnancies with normal and abnormal karyotypes, respectively. Mean placental blood flow was 129±61 mL/min/100ml in cases with normal karyotypes. Fetuses affected by IUGR (n = 13) showed significantly lower total placental blood flow values than AGA fetuses (n = 35) (F total = 122±88 mL/min versus 259±34 mL/min, p = 0.002). DCE perfusion parameters showed a linear correlation with GA. Conclusions Measuring placental perfusion in vivo is possible using DCE MRI. Although this study has many limitations it gives us the first DCE MRI values that provide a potential standard for future research into placental perfusion methods and suggests that placental functional parameters are altered in IUGR pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W3198249108,"The arterial wall consists of three concentric layers: intima, media, and adventitia. Beyond their resident cells, these layers are characterized by an extracellular matrix (ECM), which provides both biochemical and mechanical support. Elastin, the major component of arterial ECM, is present in the medial layer and organized in concentric elastic lamellae that confer resilience to the wall. We explored the arterial wall structures from C57Bl6 (control), db/db (diabetic), and ApoE-/- (atherogenic) mice aged 3 months using synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography on fixed and unstained tissues with a large image field (8 mm3 ). This approach combined a good resolution (0.83 µm/voxel), large 3D imaging field. and an excellent signal to noise ratio conferred by phase-contrast imaging. We determined from 2D virtual slices that the thickness of intramural ECM structures was comparable between strains but automated image analysis of the 3D arterial volumes revealed a lattice-like network within concentric elastic lamellae. We hypothesize that this network could play a role in arterial mechanics. This work demonstrates that phase-contrast synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography is a powerful technique which to characterize unstained soft tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3198262078,"Traffic congestion has become common in urban areas worldwide. To solve this problem, the method of searching a solution using artificial intelligence has recently attracted widespread attention because it can solve complex problems such as traffic signal control. This study developed two traffic signal control models using reinforcement learning and a microscopic simulation-based evaluation for an isolated intersection and two coordinated intersections. To develop these models, a deep Q-network (DQN) was used, which is a promising reinforcement learning algorithm. The performance was evaluated by comparing the developed traffic signal control models in this research with the fixed-time signal optimized by Synchro model, which is a traffic signal optimization model. The evaluation showed that the developed traffic signal control model of the isolated intersection was validated, and the coordination of intersections was superior to that of the fixed-time signal control method."
https://openalex.org/W3198306537,"The Massif Central in France could potentially harbor numerous ancient endemic lineages owing to its long history of continuous geological stability. Several endemic earthworm species inhabit the area, with Allolobophora (Gatesona) chaetophora, Helodrilus (Acystodrilus) and Avelona ligra showing hints of a common evolutionary origin. However, the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status of the species remain to be studied through integrative molecular and morphological methods. To this end, eight species including most of the known species and subspecies of All. (Gatesona), Helodrilus (Acystodrilus) musicus, and Avelona ligra were sequenced for a set of five molecular markers. The species were grouped on the basis of the molecular findings in a phylogenetic framework. All. (Gatesona) was included within the same clade as Helodrilus (Acystodrilus) and Avelona, separated from Allolobophora sensu stricto, supporting its status as a good genus. Branch lengths and average pairwise genetic distances suggested the subspecies of All. (Gatesona) chaetophora examined should be considered species-level taxa. Thus, a generic diagnosis for Gatesona stat. nov. is provided, along with redescriptions of Gatesona chaetophora comb. nov., Gatesona rutena comb. nov. stat. nov., Gatesona lablacherensis comb. nov. stat. nov. and Gatesona serninensis comb. nov. stat. nov. The study findings highlight the need for further sampling of earthworm diversity in the Massif Central (and Southern France), in addition to an increased focus on the Eastern European species of Helodrilus."
https://openalex.org/W3198541556,"This paper examines the scope and characteristics of male-to-female intimate partner violence in southern rural Chiapas, Mexico, and its association with depression and anxiety symptoms, highlighting the role of partner controlling behaviors. Participants were selected by random sampling. One-hundred and forty-one women &gt;15 years participated in the study. Data was obtained through an adapted version of the National Survey of the Dynamics of Household Relationships (ENDIREH) intimate partner violence scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression symptoms and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety symptoms. Quantitative results indicated a 66.4% lifetime prevalence of physical and/or sexual IPV among ever-partnered women 15 years or older (95% CI: 57.5–74.5%). Forty percent (95% CI: 32.0–49.7%) of them reported having experienced physical and/or sexual violence with high partner control (HC-IPV), and 25.8% (95% CI: 18.5–34.3%) reported having experienced physical and/or sexual violence with low or moderate partner control (MC-IPV). Lifetime experience of HC-IPV was significantly associated with moderate-severe depression symptoms (RR = 5.8) and suicidality (RR = 2.08). While partner alcohol abuse was associated with a 3.06 times higher risk of lifetime physical and/or sexual IPV, 30.9% of women mentioned that their partners were never drunk when violence occurred. Interestingly, high partner alcohol abuse was more frequent among women who reported HC-IPV compared to MC-IPV. Implications for global mental health practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3198573461,"Anxiety and depression are common mental health disorders and have a higher prevalence in females. They are modestly heritable, share genetic liability with other psychiatric disorders, and are highly heterogeneous. There is evidence that genetic liability to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with anxiety and depression, particularly in females. We investigated sex differences in family history for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders and neurodevelopmental genetic risk burden (indexed by ADHD polygenic risk scores (PRS) and rare copy number variants; CNVs) in individuals with anxiety and depression, also taking into account age at onset. We used two complementary datasets: 1) participants with a self-reported diagnosis of anxiety or depression (N = 4,178, 65.5% female; mean age = 41.5 years; N = 1,315 with genetic data) from the National Centre for Mental Health (NCMH) cohort and 2) a clinical sample of 13,273 (67.6% female; mean age = 45.2 years) patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). We tested for sex differences in family history of psychiatric problems and presence of rare CNVs (neurodevelopmental and >500kb loci) in NCMH only and for sex differences in ADHD PRS in both datasets. In the NCMH cohort, females were more likely to report family history of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, but there were no robust sex differences in ADHD PRS or presence of rare CNVs. There was weak evidence of higher ADHD PRS in females compared to males in the PGC MDD sample, particularly in those with an early onset of MDD. These results do not provide strong evidence of sex differences in neurodevelopmental genetic risk burden in adults with anxiety and depression. This indicates that sex may not be a major index of neurodevelopmental genetic heterogeneity, that is captured by ADHD PRS and rare CNV burden, in adults with anxiety and depression."
https://openalex.org/W3196908262,"Antibiotic-susceptible bacteria may survive bactericidal antibiotics if other co-inhabiting bacteria detoxify the medium through antibiotic degradation or modification, a phenomenon denominated as indirect resistance. However, it is unclear how susceptible cells survive while the medium is still toxic. One explanation relies on the speed of detoxification, and another, non-exclusive explanation, relies on persistence, a state of bacterial dormancy where cells with low metabolic activity and growth rates are phenotypically tolerant to antibiotics and other cytotoxic substances. Here we simulated the fate of susceptible cells in laboratory experiments in the context of indirect resistance to understand whether persistence is necessary to explain the survival of susceptible cells. Depending on the strain and experimental conditions, the decay of persister populations may follow an exponential or a power-law distribution. Therefore, we studied the impact of both distributions in the simulations. Moreover, we studied the impact of considering that persister cells have a mechanism to sense the presence of a toxic substance-a mechanism that would enable cells to leave the dormant state when the medium becomes nontoxic. The simulations show that surviving susceptible cells under indirect resistance may originate both from persister and non-persister populations if the density of detoxifying cells is high. However, persistence was necessary when the initial density of detoxifying cells was low, although persister cells remained in that dormancy state for just a few hours. Finally, the results of our simulations are consistent both with exponential and power-law decay of the persistence population. Whether indirect resistance involves persistence should impact antibiotic treatments."

Accordingly, the Polite research project aims at: (1) investigating the current state of level 2 palliative care and (2) developing recommendations for its optimisation.The multi-perspective, observational study will follow a mixed-methods approach across two study phases. In phase 1a, quantitative routinely collected data from a statutory general local health insurance provider will be used to identify patients who received level 2 or other outpatient palliative care in the years 2017-2019. In phase 1b, a questionnaire will be sent to all registered general practitioners (GPs) in Lower Saxony to collect information on the number and characteristics of physicians offering level 2 palliative care. In phase 1c, a quantitative, standardised online questionnaire for teams providing specialised outpatient palliative care will be administered to assess the interfaces of level 2 palliative care. In phase 2a, the results from phases 1a-c will be discussed in an expert workshop with the aim of developing ideas to adapt and optimise level 2 outpatient palliative care. Finally, in phase 2b, the empirically derived recommendations from phases 1 and 2a will be agreed upon via a multi-round Delphi survey involving experts with sufficient influence to promote the project results and recommendations nationally.The results of the project will facilitate the optimisation of outpatient palliative care, as well as its administration, nationwide.The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien) (Registration N° DRKS00024785); date of registration: 06th May 2021) and is searchable under the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal of the World Health Organization, under the German Clinical Trials Register number."
https://openalex.org/W3197947524,"The purposes are to find the techniques suitable for the safety relay protection of intelligent substations and discuss the applicability of edge computing in relay protection. Regarding relay protection in intelligent substations, edge computing and optimized simulated annealing algorithm (OSAA) are combined innovatively to form an edge computing strategy. On this basis, an edge computing model is proposed based on relay fault traveling waves. Under different computing shunt tasks, OSAA can converge after about 1,100 iterations, and its computing time is relatively short. As the global optimal time delay reaches 0.5295, the corresponding computing time is 456.27s, apparently better than the linear search method. The proposed model can reduce the computing time significantly, playing an active role in the safe shunting of power relays. The simulation also finds that the voltage and current waveforms corresponding to the fault state of Phase A are consistent with the actual situations. To sum up, this model provides a reference for improving and optimizing intelligent substation relay protection."
https://openalex.org/W3197999134,"Muscle derived stem cells (MDSCs) and myoblast play an important role in myotube regeneration when muscle tissue is injured. However, these cells can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes once exposed to PPARγ activator like EPA and DHA that are highly suggested during pregnancy. The objective of this study aims at determining the identity of trans-differentiated cells by exploring the effect of EPA and DHA on C2C12 undergoing differentiation into brown and white adipocytes. DHA but not EPA committed C2C12 cells reprograming into white like adipocyte phenotype. Also, DHA promoted the expression of lipolysis regulating genes but had no effect on genes regulating β-oxidation referring to its implication in lipid re-esterification. Furthermore, DHA impaired C2C12 cells differentiation into brown adipocytes through reducing the thermogenic capacity and mitochondrial biogenesis of derived cells independent of UCP1. Accordingly, DHA treated groups showed an increased accumulation of lipid droplets and suppressed mitochondrial maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity. EPA, on the other hand, reduced myogenesis regulating genes, but no significant differences were observed in the expression of adipogenesis key genes. Likewise, EPA suppressed the expression of WAT signature genes indicating that EPA and DHA have an independent role on white adipogensis. Unlike DHA treatment, EPA supplementation had no effect on the differential of C2C12 cells into brown adipocytes. In conclusion, DHA is a potent adipogenic and lipogenic factor that can change the metabolic profile of muscle cells by increasing myocellular fat."
https://openalex.org/W3198341177,"During late embryonic development of the cerebral cortex, the major class of cortical output neurons termed subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN; including the predominant population of corticospinal neurons, CSN) and the class of interhemispheric callosal projection neurons (CPN) initially express overlapping molecular controls that later undergo subtype-specific refinements. Such molecular refinements are largely absent in heterogeneous, maturation-stalled, neocortical-like neurons (termed ""cortical"" here) spontaneously generated by established embryonic stem cell (ES) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation. Building on recently identified central molecular controls over SCPN development, we used a combination of synthetic modified mRNA (modRNA) for Fezf2, the central transcription factor controlling SCPN specification, and small molecule screening to investigate whether distinct chromatin modifiers might complement Fezf2 functions to promote SCPN-specific differentiation by mouse ES (mES)-derived cortical-like neurons. We find that the inhibition of a specific histone deacetylase, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), enhances refinement of SCPN subtype molecular identity by both mES-derived cortical-like neurons and primary dissociated E12.5 mouse cortical neurons. In vivo, we identify that SIRT1 is specifically expressed by CPN, but not SCPN, during late embryonic and postnatal differentiation. Together, these data indicate that SIRT1 has neuronal subtype-specific expression in the mouse cortex in vivo, and that its inhibition enhances subtype-specific differentiation of highly clinically relevant SCPN / CSN cortical neurons in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3198857211,"Macrophages are a critical driver of neovessel formation in tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs), but also contribute to graft stenosis, a leading clinical trial complication. Macrophage depletion via liposomal delivery of clodronate, a first-generation bisphosphonate, mitigates stenosis, but simultaneously leads to a complete lack of tissue development in TEVGs. This result and the associated difficulty of utilizing liposomal delivery means that clodronate may not be an ideal means of preventing graft stenosis. Newer generation bisphosphonates, such as zoledronate, may have differential effects on graft development with more facile drug delivery. We sought to examine the effect of zoledronate on TEVG neotissue formation and its potential application for mitigating TEVG stenosis. Thus, mice implanted with TEVGs received zoledronate or no treatment and were monitored by serial ultrasound for graft dilation and stenosis. After two weeks, TEVGs were explanted for histological examination. The overall graft area and remaining graft material (polyglycolic-acid) were higher in the zoledronate treatment group. These effects were associated with a corresponding decrease in macrophage infiltration. In addition, zoledronate affected the deposition of collagen in TEVGs, specifically, total and mature collagen. These differences may be, in part, explained by a depletion of leukocytes within the bone marrow that subsequently led to a decrease in the number of tissue-infiltrating macrophages. TEVGs from zoledronate-treated mice demonstrated a significantly greater degree of smooth muscle cell presence. There was no statistical difference in graft patency between treatment and control groups. While zoledronate led to a decrease in the number of macrophages in the TEVGs, the severity of stenosis appears to have increased significantly. Zoledronate treatment demonstrates that the process of smooth muscle cell-mediated neointimal hyperplasia may occur separately from a macrophage-mediated mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3197963208,"Traditional dose-finding designs are substantially inefficient for targeted agents and cancer immunotherapies by failing to incorporate efficacy signals, mild and moderate adverse events, and late, cumulative toxicities. However, the lack of user-friendly software is a barrier to the practical use of the novel phase I designs, despite their demonstrated superiority of traditional 3+3 designs. To overcome these barriers, we present an R package, phase1RMD, which provides a comprehensive implementation of novel designs with repeated toxicity measures and early efficacy. A novel phase I repeated measures design that used a continuous toxicity score from multiple treatment cycles was implemented. Furthermore, in studies where preliminary efficacy is evaluated, an adaptive, multi-stage design to identify the most efficacious dose with acceptable toxicity was demonstrated. Functions are provided to recommend the next dose based on the data collected in a phase I trial, as well as to assess trial characteristics given design parameters via simulations. The repeated measure designs accurately estimated both the magnitude and direction of toxicity trends in late treatment cycles, and allocated more patients at therapeutic doses. The R package for implementing these designs is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. To our best knowledge, this is the first software that implement novel phase I dose-finding designs that simultaneously accounts for the multiple-grade toxicity events over multiple treatment cycles and a continuous early efficacy outcome. With the software published on CRAN, we will pursue the implementation of these designs in phase I trials in real-life settings."
https://openalex.org/W3198249659,"Hill-type muscle models are widely employed in simulations of human movement. Yet, the parameters underlying these models are difficult or impossible to measure in vivo. Prior studies demonstrate that Hill-type muscle parameters are encoded within dynamometric data. But, a generalizable approach for estimating these parameters from dynamometric data has not been realized. We aimed to leverage musculoskeletal models and artificial neural networks to classify one Hill-type muscle parameter (maximum isometric force) from easily measurable dynamometric data (simulated lateral pinch force). We tested two neural networks (feedforward and long short-term memory) to identify if accounting for dynamic behavior improved accuracy.We generated four datasets via forward dynamics, each with increasing complexity from adjustments to more muscles. Simulations were grouped and evaluated to show how varying the maximum isometric force of thumb muscles affects lateral pinch force. Both neural networks classified these groups from lateral pinch force alone.Both neural networks achieved accuracies above 80% for datasets which varied only the flexor pollicis longus and/or the abductor pollicis longus. The inclusion of muscles with redundant functions dropped model accuracies to below 30%. While both neural networks were consistently more accurate than random guess, the long short-term memory model was not consistently more accurate than the feedforward model.Our investigations demonstrate that artificial neural networks provide an inexpensive, data-driven approach for approximating Hill-type muscle-tendon parameters from easily measurable data. However, muscles of redundant function or of little impact to force production make parameter classification more challenging."

A positive result of antibody tests suggests that the individual has potentially been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, thus allowing to identify asymptomatic infections and determine the seroprevalence in a given population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly developed high throughput immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detection on the Luminex MAGPIX platform. Clinical agreement studies were performed in 42 COVID-19 patient serum samples and 162 negative donor serum/plasma samples. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 42.86% (95% CI: 9.90% to 81.59%), 71.43% (95% CI: 29.04% to 96.33%), and 28.57% (95% CI: 13.22% to 48.67%) for samples collected on 0–7 days, 8–14 days, and 2–8 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 97.53% (95% CI: 93.80% to 99.32%). There was no cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Hemoglobin (200 mg/dL), bilirubin (2 mg/dL), triglyceride (250 mg/dL) and EDTA (10 mM) showed no significant interfering effect on this assay. In conclusion, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody assay with high sensitivity and specificity has been developed. With the high throughput, this assay will speed up the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM testing."
https://openalex.org/W3184279352,"Pretimed signalized intersection is known as a common source of congestion, especially in urban heterogeneous traffic. Furthermore, the accuracy of saturation flow rate is found to cause efficient and vital capacity estimation, in order to ensure optimal design and operation of the signal timings. Presently, the traffic also consists of diverse vehicle presence, each with its own static and dynamic characteristics. The passenger car equivalent (PCE) in an essential unit is also used to measure heterogenous traffic into the PCU (Passenger Car Unit). Based on the collection of observed data at three targets in Banda Aceh City, this study aims to redetermine the PCEs by using Bayesian linear regression, through the Random-walk Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling. The result showed that the obtained PCE values were 0.24, 1.0, and 0.80 for motorcycle (MC), passenger car (PC), and motorized rickshaw (MR), respectively. It also showed that a significant deviation was found between new and IHCM PCEs, as the source of error was partially due to the vehicle compositions. The present traffic characteristics were also substantially different from the prevailing conditions of IHCM 1997. Therefore, the proposed PCEs enhanced the accuracy of base saturation flow prediction, provided support for traffic operation design, alleviated congestion, and reduced delay within the city, which in turn improved the estimation of signalized intersection capacity."

Materials and methods: sequential mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) research, carried out between August 2014 and August 2015 with people who use crack. In the quantitative approach, a cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,062 participants. Factors associated with “alcohol use with the effect of increasing the effect of crack/crack craving” were estimated by multiple regression. In the qualitative approach, 39 interviews were conducted using Bardin’s content analysis technique. Results 871 (82.0%) participants reported consuming alcohol, among them, 668 (76.7%) used alcohol combined with crack: 219 (32.8%) reported feeling an effect of reduction in paranoia and/or crack craving and 384 (57.5%) reported feeling an increase in the effect of crack and in the craving to consume the drug. This relationship was also observed in the narratives of the people who use crack, with the possibility of a cyclic effect of consumption of the two substances. Those who related alcohol use to the effect of increasing crack craving (384) were more likely to use alcohol before crack (OR: 1.81; 95%CI: 1.13–2.89); to consume more than 20 stones daily (OR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.01–2.16); to remain in abstinence from crack for less than one month (OR: 3.20; 95%CI: 1.91–5.35); to use dependence treatment services (OR: 1.85; 95%CI: 1.26–2.71); and to commit physical violence (OR:1.67; 95%CI:1.08–2.56). Conclusion The findings of this study indicate that the modulation of the effect of alcohol use on crack cocaine depends on the moment when the drugs are consumed, and the use of alcohol before crack consumption is associated with characteristics that suggest a greater vulnerability to patterns of harmful crack use. Even though combined use is referred to as a way of reducing the negative effects of crack, the damage of this association may be greater than its possible benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3197141002,"Saururus chinensis is a core member of Saururaceae, an ancient, perianthless (lacking petals or sepals) family of the magnoliids in the Mesangiospermae, which is important for understanding the origin and evolution of early flowers due to its unusual floral composition and petaloid bracts. To compare their transcriptomes, RNA-seq abundance analysis identified 43,463 genes that were found to be differentially expressed in S. chinensis bracts. Of these, 5,797 showed significant differential expression, of which 1,770 were up-regulated and 4,027 down-regulated in green compared to white bracts. The expression profiles were also compared using cDNA microarrays, which identified 166 additional differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, qRT-PCR was used to verify and extend the cDNA microarray results, showing that the A and B class MADS-box genes were up-regulated in the white bracts. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on putative S. chinensis A and B-class of MADS-box genes to infer evolutionary relationships within the A and B-class of MADS-box gene family. In addition, nature selection and protein interactions of B class MADS-box proteins were inferred that B-class genes free from evolutionary pressures. The results indicate that petaloid bracts display anatomical and gene expression features normally associated with petals, as found in petaloid bracts of other species, and support an evolutionarily conserved developmental program for petaloid bracts."
https://openalex.org/W3197405253,"In monocular see-through augmented reality systems, each eye is stimulated differently by a monocular image that is superimposed on the binocular background. This can impair binocular fusion, due to interocular conflict. As a function of visual characteristics, the latter can have a greater or lesser impact on user comfort and performance. This study tested several visual characteristics of a binocular background and a monocular element during an exposure that reproduced the interocular conflict induced by a monocular see-through near-eye display. The aim was to identify which factors impact the user's performance. Performance was measured as target tracking and event detection, identification, fixation time, and latency. Our results demonstrate that performance is a function of the binocular background. Furthermore, exogenous attentional stimulation, in the form of a pulse with different levels of contrast applied to the monocular display, appears to preserve performance in most background conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3197993328,"Polymeric arrays of microrelief structures have a range of potential applications. For example, to influence wettability, to act as biologically inspired adhesives, to resist biofouling, and to play a role in the ""feel"" of an object during tactile interaction. Here, we investigate the damage to micropillar arrays comprising pillars of different modulus, spacing, diameter, and aspect ratio due to the sliding of a silicone cast of a human finger. The goal is to determine the effect of these parameters on the types of damage observed, including adhesive failure and ploughing of material from the finger onto the array. Our experiments point to four principal conclusions [1]. Aspect ratio is the dominant parameter in determining survivability through its effect on the bending stiffness of micropillars [2]. All else equal, micropillars with larger diameter are less susceptible to breakage and collapse [3]. The spacing of pillars in the array largely determines which type of adhesive failure occurs in non-surviving arrays [4]. Elastic modulus plays an important role in survivability. Clear evidence of elastic recovery was seen in the more flexible polymer and this recovery led to more instances of pristine survivability where the stiffer polymer tended to ablate PDMS. We developed a simple model to describe the observed bending of micropillars, based on the quasi-static mechanics of beam-columns, that indicated they experience forces ranging from 10-4-10-7 N to deflect into adhesive contact. Taken together, results obtained using our framework should inform design considerations for microstructures intended to be handled by human users."
https://openalex.org/W3198357244,"Apricot bud gall mite, Acalitus phloeocoptes (Nalepa), is a destructive arthropod pest that causes significant economic losses to apricot trees worldwide. The current study explores the ways to understand the mode of dispersal of A. phloeocoptes, the development and ultrastructure of apricot bud gall, and the role of phytohormones in the formation of the apricot bud galls. The results demonstrated that the starch granules in the bud axon were extended at the onset of the attack. During the later stages of the attack, the cytoplasm was found to deteriorate in infected tissues. Furthermore, we have observed that the accumulation of large amounts of cytokinin (zeatin, ZT) and auxin (indoleacetic acid, IAA) led to rapid bud proliferation during rapid growth period, while abscisic acid (ABA) controls the development of gall buds and plays a vital role in gall bud maturity. The reduction of gibberellic acid (GA3) content led to rapid lignification at the later phase of bud development. Overall, our results have revealed that the mechanism underlying the interaction of apricot bud gall with its parasite and have provided reliable information for designing valuable Apricot breeding programs. This study will be quite useful for pest management and will provide a comprehensive evaluation of ecology-based cost-effective control, life history and demographic parameters of A. phloeocoptes."
https://openalex.org/W3198448050,"The interaction of extracellular matrix (ECM) components with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is thought to perpetuate fibrosis by stimulating signaling pathways that drive HSC activation, survival and proliferation. Consequently, disrupting the interaction between ECM and HSCs is considered a therapeutical avenue although respective targets and underlying mechanisms remain to be established. Here we have interrogated the interaction between type VI collagen (CVI) and HSCs based on the observation that CVI is 10-fold upregulated during fibrosis, closely associates with HSCs in vivo and promotes cell proliferation and cell survival in cancer cell lines. We exposed primary rat HSCs and a rat hepatic stellate cell line (CFSC) to soluble CVI and determined the rate of proliferation, apoptosis and fibrogenesis in the absence of any additional growth factors. We find that CVI in nanomolar concentrations prevents serum starvation-induced apoptosis. This potent anti-apoptotic effect is accompanied by induction of proliferation and acquisition of a pronounced pro-fibrogenic phenotype characterized by increased α-smooth muscle actin, TGF-β, collagen type I and TIMP-1 expression and diminished proteolytic MMP-13 expression. The CVI-HSC interaction can be disrupted with the monomeric α2(VI) and α3(VI) chains and abrogates the activating CVI effects. Further, functional relevant α3(VI)—derived 30 amino acid peptides lead to near-complete inhibition of the CVI effect. In conclusion, CVI serves as a potent mitogen and activating factor for HSCs. The antagonistic effects of the CVI monomeric chains and peptides point to linear peptide sequences that prevent activation of CVI receptors which may allow a targeted antifibrotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3198710005,"Background The Västerbotten intervention program (VIP), is a public health promotion program in northern Sweden with the aim of preventing cardiovascular disease. Positive effects have been reported although the evidence is not unequivocal. Since only historical controls have been used, effects from other sources than the program have largely been uncontrolled for and health related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been evaluated. Purpose By using the neighbouring county of Norrbotten (NB) as the reference population, we compare HRQoL in Västerbotten (VB) and in NB. Methods In 2014 the Northern Sweden survey, Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA), examined a random sample from the two counties. HRQoL was measured with the EQ-5D-3L. In total, 1112 subjects aged 40–74 years participated, 516 in VB and 594 in NB. Differences in mean QoL between VB and NB were analysed via Student’s t-test and the Pearson chi-square test. Results Average HRQoL measured by the EQ-5D-index was 0.798 in VB and 0.811 in NB, a difference of 0.013 (p = 0.2, CI -0.009 to 0.036). For subjects aged 45–54 years, the HRQoL was lower in VB than in NB, a difference of 0.048 ( p = 0.041; CI 0.002 to 0.0094). Men had higher HRQoL than women, and university educated had higher HRQoL than those without university education. EQ-VAS showed similar results. Subjects from NB and from VB did not differ regarding age, gender and level of education. In NB, HRQoL decrease with age, a pattern not seen in VB. Conclusions We found similar levels of HRQoL in VB and in NB."
