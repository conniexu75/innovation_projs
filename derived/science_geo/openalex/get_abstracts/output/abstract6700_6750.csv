https://openalex.org/W2017082399,"Movement time varies as a function of amplitude and requirements for precision, according to Fitts' law, but when subjects perform two-handed movements to targets of widely disparate difficulty they do so simultaneously. The hand moving to an ""easy"" target moves more slowly to accommodate its ""difficult"" counterpart, yet both hands reach peak velocity and acceleration synchronously. This result suggests that the brain produces simultaneity of action not by controlling each limb independently, but by organizing functional groupings of muscles that are constrained to act as a single unit."
https://openalex.org/W1968606150,Event-related potentials associated with detected targets in a vigilance task were analyzed in two ways: (i) by sorting the potentials in terms of sequential reaction time bins of 50 milliseconds and (ii) by examining the single trial waveforms. A negative component (N2) covaried in latency with reaction time. These results support the hypothesis that N2 reflects a decision process which controls behavioral responses in sensory discrimination tasks.
https://openalex.org/W1522366213,"Bilirubin is generally considered a lipophilic substance, and its neurotoxicity is ascribed to an affinity for lipids in the central nervous system. In the present paper, it is shown that the solubility of bilirubin in apolar solvents and in triglycerides is low and increases with solvent polarity. Consequently, bilirubin should not be characterized as lipophilic. The solubility in aqueous buffers was studied under exclusion of light and was found lower than previously reported, about 7 nM at pH 7.4, temperature 37 degrees C, increasing with higher pH, approximately in inverse proportion with the squared hydrogen ion concentration. Binding of bilirubin to human serum albumin was studied by the rate of oxidation with peroxidase of the free ligand at equilibrium. The stoichiometry of proton involvement in the binding process was investigated by acidimetric titration. It is concluded that precipitation of bilirubin in vivo is thermodynamically possible. It was further demonstrated by light absorption spectroscopy that bilirubin forms a complex with phosphatidylcholine in diethyl ether and that an aqueous suspension of phosphatidylcholine enhanced aggregation of bilirubin. Transfer of bilirubin dianion from its complex with plasma albumin and precipitation of bilirubin acid with phosphatidylcholine in membranes of nerve cells is therefore possible and may account for the neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2094298397,"Thin-walled channels resembling lymphatic capillaries and containing lymphocytes were observed in perivascular spaces throughout the central nervous system of patients with various neurological disorders. This suggests that immunological surveillance in the central nervous system may normally involve lymphocyte circulation through the perivascular compartment. In some old multiple sclerosis plaques, perivascular lymphoid tissue was found which was organized in a manner similar to the antibody-producing medullary region of lymph nodes. This may indicate continuous processing of the putative multiple sclerosis antigen in such lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2081776574,"Forty subjects rated the magnitude of painful electrical stimulation of tooth pulp before and after the intravenous administration of either fentanyl, a short-acting narcotic, or a saline placebo. The responses were choices of verbal descriptors from randomized lists of either sensory intensity (that is, weak, mild, intense) or unpleasantness (annoying, unpleasant, distressing) descriptors. The fentanyl significantly reduced the sensory intensity without reducing the unpleasantness of the tooth pulp stimuli, indicating that the mechanisms of narcotic analgesia may include a significant attenuation in pain sensation in addition to effects on pain reaction. These results stress the importance of using multiple measures of pain."
https://openalex.org/W1561326814,"Insulin stimulation of hydrogen peroxide production by rat epididymal fat cells was investigated by studying the oxidation of formate to CO2 by endogenous catalase. Under optimal concentrations of formate (0.1 to 1 mM) and glucose (0.275 mM), insulin stimulated formate oxidation 1.5- to 2.0-fold. Inhibitors of catalase activity, including nitrite and azide, inhibited both basal and insulin-stimulated formate oxidation at concentrations that did not interfere with insulin effects on glucose C-1 oxidation or glucose H-3 incorporation into lipids. The addition of exogenous catalase increased formate oxidation only slightly, while exogenous H2O2 (0.5 mM) stimulated formate oxidation by endogenous catalase strongly. These data indicate that the insulin-stimulated H2O2 production was intracellular. Insulin dose-response curves for formate oxidation were identical with those for glucose H-3 incorporation into lipids. The dependence of relative insulin effects on the logarithm of the glucose concentration was bell-shaped for formate oxidation and correlated highly with the coresponding dependences of glucose C-1 oxidation and glucose H-3 incorporation into lipids. This suggests that insulin stimulation of intracellular H2O2 production is linked to glucose metabolism. Since it is known that extracellular H2O2 can mimic insulin in several respects, these observations suggest that H2O2 may act as a second messenger for the observed effects of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2076718572,"Spleen cells from mice immunized with a cultured human neuroblastoma were hybridized with the mouse plasmacytoma P3X63Ag8. Hybrid myelomas were screened for production of antibodies that reacted with human neuroblastomas but not with cells from other tissues. One of these hybridoma antibodies reacted with an antigen present on the six human neuroblastomas tested, one of two retinoblastomas, a glioblastoma, and fetal brain, but did not react with other tumors or tissues including adult human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2087686093,"When chicken pineal glands were organ-cultured in darkness, serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity was low during daytime, increased at midnight, and decreased on the next morning. The autonomous increase of N-acetyltransferase activity was suppressed by illumination of the glands. When pineal glands were cultured under a light-dark cycle (LD 12:12), the change of N-acetyltransferase activity continued to oscillate in phase with the light-dark cycle for 3 days."
https://openalex.org/W1965584350,"Subcutaneous injections of naloxone, an opiate antagonist, lead to an increase in serum luteinizing hormone concentrations in female but not in male rats before they reach puberty. In addition, estradiol benzoate specifically blocks the luteinizing hormone response to naloxone in prepubertal female rats, suggesting that the opioid peptides have a physiological role in the endocrine events leading to sexual maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2003971709,"Abnormal mitochondrial structure and function have been documented in patients with Zellweger's syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome). In vitro studies have suggested that the formation of C24 bile acids (chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid) from C27 cholesterol requires mitochondrial oxidative clevage of the terminal three carbons of the side chain. Therefore, three patients with Zellweger's syndrome were examined for the presence of mitochondrial defects in bile acid synthesis. All three excreted excessive amounts of 3 alpha, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-26-oicacid, 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-26-oic acid, and 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24 xi-tetrahydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-26-oic acid (varanic acid), precursors of chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid that have undergone only partial side chain oxidation. These findings give added support to the role of mitochondrial oxidative side chain cleavage in the overall scheme of bile acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056733416,"The restriction enzymes Hpa II and Msp I both recognize the sequence 5'-CCGG (C, cytosine; G, guanine). However, Hpa II cuts mouse liver DNA to fragments four times larger than does Msp I. The size of DNA cut by Msp I is close to that predicted from base composition and nearest neighbor analysis. The most probable explanation of these results is that in mouse the site 5'-CCGG is highly methylated."
https://openalex.org/W1981758509,"Morphological, karyological, and allozyme analyses indicate that the parthenogenetic lizards Cnemidophorus neomexicanus and diploid C. tesselatus are hybrids formed, respectively, by crosses involving the bisexual species C. tigris and C. inornatus, and C. tigris and C. septemvittatus. Mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited maternally, was obtained from each of these species. Analyses of the mitochondrial DNA's and their restriction endonuclease digestion products by electron microscopy and agarose gel electrophoresis support the hybridization hypothesis by indicating that C. tigris (specifically the subspecies marmoratus) was the maternal parent species for both C. neomexicanus and C. tesselatus. Furthermore, these data imply that these two parthenogenetic species are younger than some races of C. tigris."

https://openalex.org/W2065840417,"L-Leucine, L-aspartate, and D-glucose bind in a stereospecific manner to a colloidal clay, bentonite. This binding has high-affinity, saturable characteristics. The biologically uncommon enantiomers, D-leucine, D-asparatate, and L-glucose, do not exhibit any selective absorption on bentonite. It is suggested that this difference between stereoisomers could account for the evolution of life forms possessing a great preponderance of L amino acids and D-glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1496821751,"The zero-trans uptake of purines and pyrimidines was measured in suspensions of Novikoff rat hepatoma, mouse L, P388 mouse leukemia, and Chinese hamster ovary cells by a rapid kinetic technique which allows the determination of uptake time points in intervals as short as 1.5 s. Kinetic parameters for purine/pyrimidine transport were determined by measuring substrate influx into cells in which substrate conversion to nucleotides was negligible either due to lack of the appropriate enzymes or to depletion of the cells of ATP (5'-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate), and by computer fitting exact, integrated rate equations derived for various carrier-mediated transport models directly to zero-trans influx data. The results indicate that different carriers function in the transport of hypoxanthine/guanine, adenine, and uracil with substrate:carrier association constants (K) at 24 degrees C of 300 to 400 muM, 2 to 3 mM, and about 14 mM, respectively, for Novikoff cells. K and Vmax for hypoxanthine transport by L and P388 cells are similar to those for Novikoff cells, but the transport capacity of Chinese hamster ovary cells is much lower and K = 1500 muM. All transport systems are completely symmetrical. Hypoxanthine transport is so rapid that an intracellular concentration of free hypoxanthine (90%) close to that in the medium is attained within 20 to 50 s of incubation at 24 degrees C, at least at extracellular concentrations below K. In cells in which conversion to nucleotides is not blocked free hypoxanthine accumulates intracellularly to steady state levels with equal rapidity and thereafter the rate of hypoxanthine uptake into total cell material is strictly a function of the rate of phosphoribosylation. The low Km systems for hypoxanthine (1 to 9 muM) and adenine (0.2 to 40 muM) uptake detected previously in many types of cells reflect the substrate saturation of the respective phosphoribosyltransferases rather than of the transport system."
https://openalex.org/W2067213425,A new method generates specific predictions concerning the expected frequencies of aphasia after unilateral injury to the brain in the left- and right-handed. These predictions are then compared with the observed data for all known studies between 1935 and 1973 to derive the best-fitting model of hemispheric speech lateralization in the left- and right-handed.
https://openalex.org/W2088630178,"At given doses and clonal ages, ultraviolet irradiation-induced DNA damage reduced clonal life-span, but when followed by photoreactivation, extension of clonal life-span was observed. If photoreactivation preceded the ultraviolet treatment, no significant beneficial effect was detected. Because studies of others have shown that photoreactivation repair monomerizes the ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane dimers in DNA, but does not affect the other photoproducts, these results indicate that DNA damage can influence the duration of clonal life-span unless that damage is repaired. Repeated treatment with ultraviolet and photoreactivation resulted in significant mean and maximal clonal life-span extension when compared with untreated controls, and it is assumed that the rejuvenation effect was due to the correction or prevention of some age damage."
https://openalex.org/W2054622680,"The sodium-selective ligand 1,1,1-tris[1(1)-(2(1)-oxa-4(1)-oxo-5(1)-aza-5(1)-methyl)dodecanyl]propane dissolved in 3-nitro-o-xylene containing a small amount of the lipophilic anion tetrachlorophenyl borate was used as a liquid ion-exchanger in sodium-selective microelectrodes. The microelectrodes gave rapid, stable responses that were linear functions of the logarithm of sodium activity. They were tested under conditions approximating those to be expected in the cell interior, and the results indicated that they can be used to measure intracellular sodium activity without significant interference from intracellular potassium."

The behavioral effects of a drug can be modified by brief exposure to a low-level microwave field even when the radiation level alone has no apparent effects on the behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2095029917,Tritiated thymidine was found to affect the cell cycle progression of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes. By means of flow cytometry a statistically significant increase in the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle was observed in cultures with low concentrations of tritiated thymidine added 18 hours before the cultures were harvested.
https://openalex.org/W2131162547,"Human erythrocytes have been freeze-fractured, and the polypeptides associated with the separate halves of the membrane bilayer have been analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The transmembrane proteins were differentially separated by the fracture process. Although sialoglycoproteins associated with the outer half of the membrane, the anion transport protein (band 3) mainly remained with the inner half of the membrane. Well-defined fragments of the sialoglycoproteins were produced by the freeze-fracture procedure, indicating that selected covalent bonds of these transmembrane proteins were broken."
https://openalex.org/W2061187412,"In cats reared in the dark from birth until 4 months of age, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus contained few normal Y cells in either the binocular or monocular segments. Although most of the neurons appeared to be normal X cells unaffected by light deprivation, many cells with abnormal receptive field and response charcteristics were encountered. These effects were permanent, since 1 to 2 years of normal visual experience following initial light deprivation did not lead to any functional recovery. The sizes of cell bodies in cats reared in the dark were similar to those of normal animals, an indication that changes in geniculate cell physiology need not be related to changes in cell size."
https://openalex.org/W1527548375,"Immune complexes bind to several eukaryotic cell types including human blood platelets through the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin (Ig) G. Utilizing immobilized Fc fragment of IgG enabled us to isolate from human blood platelets a glycoprotein of an apparent Mr = 255,000 which, upon reduction, dissociated into sub-units of an apparent Mr = 50,000. This Fc fragment-binding glycoprotein has an isoelectric point between pH 6.3 and 6.9 and is composed of 34% hydrophobic, 25% acidic, and 14% basic amino acids. The Fc fragment-binding glycoprotein was also isolated from human platelet membrane preparations and was unaffected by prior treatment of platelets with thrombin. Isolated Fc fragment-binding glycoprotein formed an in vitro complex with aggregated immunoglobulin G. These results suggest that the isolated Fc fragment-binding component may prove useful in studies concerning the functional role of glycoproteins as cellular receptors for the Fc fragment of IgG."

https://openalex.org/W1482380427,"Paramyosin isolated from the adductor muscle of Mercenaria mercenaria was shown to contain three to five phosphate groups/molecule; the actual number varied depending on the method used to extract the protein. Dephosphorylation resulted in an increase in the solubility of paramyosin near pH 7 and near physiological ionic strength. This behavior suggests that the number of phosphates/molecule may be a determining factor in the aggregation behavior of paramyosin-containing myofilaments. Thus, phosphorylation may be involved in catch contractions since correlations have been demonstrated earlier between catch contraction of molluscan muscles and aggregation properties of paramyosin (Ruegg, J. C. (1971) Physiol. Rev. 51, 201-249)."

https://openalex.org/W2003027637,"Cultured skin fibroblasts from subjects with cystic fibrosis exhibited normal population doubling times in early passages. After about 13 cumulative population doublings, cystic fibrosis lines doubled more slowly than controls and ceased doubling after about 19 weekly passages. Control lines continued doubling for 27 passages. The premature senescence noted in cells from subjects with cystic fibrosis reconciles controversial observations of cell doubling reported in the literature. Data presented here demonstrate that experiments with cystic fibrosis cells in late passage may generate misleading results since differences from control lines may be ascribed to generalized senile changes rather than to specific results of the cystic fibrosis genotype."
https://openalex.org/W1525418428,"The NH2-terminals and amino acid compositions of three carboxymethylcysteine-containing peptides produced from carboxymethylated calf brain tubulin by digestion with elastase have been determined. The 3H/14C ratio obtained when these peptides were generated from mixtures of [14C]carboxymethylated calf brain tubulin and the [3H]carboxymethylated proteins of mouse brain or 3T3 cells and subsequently purified indicated that both mouse brain and 3T3 cells contained protein giving rise to peptides homologous to these peptides. This indicates that the tubulins of calf brain, mouse brain, and 3T3 cells are homologous in the regions of amino acid sequence accounting for the peptides examined. From the 3H/14C ratio of the isolated peptides, 13.5% of the protein of mouse brain and 3.5% of the protein of 3T3 cells were estimated to be tubulin."

https://openalex.org/W2083589499,"Curare is known to be less effective as an acetycholine antagonist when the divalent cation concentration of the extracellular solution is increased. This observation can be accounted for by the negative surface potential on the end plate; an increase in divalent cation concentration decreases the negativity of the surface potential and thereby lowers the concentrations of cations at the membrane-solution interface. The concentration of divalent cations, such as curare, will be reduced more than the concentration of univalent cations, such as acetylcholine. The observations can be accounted for by a surface potential of about -50 millivolts. The same principle can explain the reported actions of divalent cations on the affinity of receptors for acetylcholine. The effects of surface potential on concentrations at active sites may play an important role in drug interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1495319386,"The first 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of a cerebroside is reported. All signals of D-glucosylceramide (I), the cerebroside from human Gaucher's diseased liver, have been assigned by comparison of their chemical shifts with those of model compounds. This data has been used to demonstrate for the first time directly: (a) that the glucosyl moiety must exist in the pyranoside ring form and have a beta anomeric linkage, and (b) that the fatty acyl composition of the aglycon is: alpha-hydroxy, 0%; saturated, 86 +/- 2%; unsaturated long chain, 14 +/- 2%; and unsaturated short chain, less than or equal to 2%. The use of 13C signal shifts in the delta 80 to 120 region (anomeric window) for the assignment of glycon anomeric and ring forms demonstrated herein should be applicable to other glycoconjugates."
https://openalex.org/W2104916493,"It has recently been shown that perceived motion, in the absence of any appropriate retinal motion, is a sufficient stimulus to generate smooth pursuit eye motions. This raises the question of whether perceived motion is necessary for pursuit. In three experiments we obtained a negative answer to this question: retinal motion always governed pursuit."
https://openalex.org/W1506321313,"Abstract The effects of the antithyroid goitrogens, methylthiouracil and methylmercaptoimidazole, on the oxidation of N-acetyltyrosylamide at pH 8.8 by lactoperoxidase have been evaluated in the presence and the absence of iodide for the purpose of elucidating the effects of iodide. At pH 8.8, iodine is not oxidized. In the absence of iodide, the two antithyroid drugs inactivate lactoperoxidase by a second order process. When iodide is added before methylthiouracil or methylmercaptoimidazole, enzyme inactivation does not occur as rapidly and both goitrogens are readily oxidized. The kinetics of the oxidation reactions have been analyzed in order to obtain the equilibrium constant of the iodide . lactoperoxidase complex. Essentially the same iodide dissociation constant, i.e. 2 x 10(-5) M, was found by studying its effects on the kinetics of oxidation of the two antithyroid drugs. A large difference absorption spectrum is observed in the Soret region between native lactoperoxidase and lactoperoxidase inactivated by methylthiouracil."
https://openalex.org/W1512835562,"A photolabile nitrene precursor, 3-azido-(2,7)-naphthalene disulfonate (ANDS), has been synthesized and used as a membrane-impermeable probe. The aryl azide was nonfluorescent. When activated by light, a highly reactive nitrene was generated which was capable of nonspecific covalent modifications of hydrophilic regions of cell surfaces. The products of the photolysis were highly fluorescent and modified proteins could be identified by their characteristic fluorescence after electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. When intact human erythrocytes were labeled with ANDS, Protein 3, the major membrane protein, and the sialoglycoproteins were modified. No proteins of apparent molecular weight greater than Protein 3 were labeled by ANDS, suggesting that none of these membrane components was exposed to the hydrophilic external surface of the red blood cell. When open erythrocyte stroma were labeled with ANDS, virtually all protein bands detectable by Coomassie blue staining could be shown to contain some fluorescence label. The significance of these findings are discussed with relation to the use of various aryl azides as surface labels of membranes."
